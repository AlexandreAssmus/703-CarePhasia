and she did all the work around the house,0.365108669

and they plan out how theyre what theyre gonna wear and,0.287276328
Cinderella wants to go but they make fun of her you see,0.265394807
they say,0.634096324

the dog chased the cat up the tree,0.313502759
the bird was caught by the worm,0.299321711
would you like to star in a movie,0.278155863
books like to read children,0.395715892
icecream tastes good in the summer,0.302864581
beautiful flowers smell the lovely woman,0.404414326

how many are in a dozen,0.296016812
the tiger was clawed by the lion,0.347063869
bad weather was caused by long airplane delays,0.273301542
sounds like a ten minute interview,0.27206108
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk,0.243649825
it was important to me to get into law school,0.2724033
that was something that happened that was very important,0.493871182
I have no idea why I was accepted because I dont think I met any,0.329177082
thirty two,0.79858613
I was thirty two when I started,0.331090778
so I guess I was thirty one when I applied,0.35358876
and in my year the median age was twenty two,0.273145616
so I was one of the oldest in the class had nothing in common,0.282727689
Imean they still remembered highschool,0.455276847
who thought about highschool,0.448958725
and they all knew eachother from highschool,0.376528442
and they were there because they didnt get into medical school or,0.307781518
and I was just flummoxed,0.346880913
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came,0.290543735
they were just there because,0.580820262
well I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the,0.330279946
and I was there because I just really cared,0.431499988
and so I really didnt fit in really,0.320915371
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real,0.252866536
up until then I was friendly with people but I didnt understand,0.275294065
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study,0.265544355
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what,0.344918877
ke they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious,0.297948956
why would anybody say the obvious,0.406257987
so people said the obvious,0.38611874
and they were rewarded,0.449195325
so those were the people sought after to be in the study groups,0.334060997
not me,0.624586225
so I did almost everything alone for the entire year,0.32020995
and when I asked to borrow one of my friends notes she said she,0.240553051
so I said,0.480681747
thanks but no thanks,0.524217308
dont bother,0.548084855
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didnt,0.289809465
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it,0.310613573
so that was me,0.420665801
so I was part of that group for some classes,0.303362846
at the end of the year in the subway station I met someone who,0.22846128
but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy,0.280747741
and she was in the other group,0.394171268
so I never saw her,0.402804643
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I,0.292864382
and that was good,0.418417931
ke once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one,0.256393641
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the,0.43227756
and he said,0.372952074
please when you write your exams dont think that your mark is,0.30821377
and I thought,0.462097377
wow it is so amazing to hear something like that,0.351298839
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged,0.289095879
it was in law school that I learned that competentq was a,0.314507484
oh hes a competent lawyer,0.231347799
and that the positive term was brightq,0.445492327
if you werent bright you were nobody,0.326522171
so because he wasnt bright the students didnt respect him,0.262905449
and I made the mistake of saying to someone,0.307072192
youknow yeah okay but hes decent,0.328602612
ke hes a decent person,0.265712321
he has a heart,0.387082338
and she said,0.380783647
a heart,0.585828066
I didnt come to Oz where this one doesnt have a brain and this,0.251390159
I came to law school,0.302660495
didnt talk to her again,0.321348071
UofT,1
UofT was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada,0.249151841
I dont know why,0.510981023
and I also didnt understand that law schools had their own kind of,0.27490136
but I didnt I didnt know that,0.436302096
I didnt even get it until after I left,0.313762635
so really it wasnt the right school for me,0.287656903
I really should have gone to York,0.347861469
but when I came to Toronto people were saying,0.311818302
oh UofT,0.443278164
its the best school,0.422498345
and why would you wanna be way out at York,0.241068497
youre in Toronto,0.285547912
you wanna be downtown,0.349927783
so I thought,0.627347827
okay I wanna be downtown,0.337345958
so I was downtown,0.354079902
boy kicks the ball,0.338545382
flies into a glass window breaks the window and falls into the,0.358231604
it knocks over the lamp,0.315597624
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see,0.314203441
it looks like hes got his gun in the ck pocket,0.190666959
okay the mother tells the child to take an umbrella,0.255087823
and the child doesnt want one,0.284646571
oh the but in this in the second one the,0.38048619
well oh oh oh oh oh I see,0.525387526
so the mother offers the child the umbrella,0.344409138
the child refuses,0.489458501
the child says,0.397241682
goodbye,0.999999881
goes outside,0.574881673
its raining,0.675891876
its really raining,0.518869281
and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother whos not,0.217677131
well whats happening is that firefighters are rushing,0.343428373
but it looks like what happened is that the little girls cat was,0.335157186
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat,0.258294821
and then he got stuck,0.338713616
and then the firemen are coming to save the man,0.337955236
maybe the cat was chasing the bird,0.302043766
no I think the dog was chasing the cat,0.266104728
am I allowed to make it a xxx,0.259695619
the bane of feminists everywhere Cinderellas story about a,0.285827011
and I dont think we find out how she got to that situation but,0.314897776
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a,0.416665077
she always she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking,0.376560718
and she didnt get to go shopping for new clothes,0.234285027
and she wasnt given the best food to eat,0.214001462
and anyway she was just treated horribly,0.349668771
one day the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an,0.318072081
Cinderella thinking shes a member of the family thinks she can,0.227989256
but she cant,0.378255695
so she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get,0.286430031
and then they go,0.455607891
after they leave shes very disappointed because she really wanted,0.378600121
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her,0.347139418
so she gives her a beautiful dress to wear lovely new shoes and,0.275224745
and the only rule is be back by twelve,0.294027209
so Cinderella went to the ball,0.258767247
she had a wonderful time,0.374810636
nobody knew who she was,0.420877218
everybody was saying,0.485376239
oh whos that woman,0.284943253
whos that woman,0.384003997
the prince danced with her the whole evening,0.393404275
she had a lovely time,0.3668966
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta,0.327901781
so she ran out,0.331719935
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper,0.220902398
following that the prince found the missing slipper,0.418976098
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper,0.273820281
so he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on womens,0.262386739
it didnt fit anybody,0.406810611
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly,0.284721226
and he tried it on their feet,0.278068513
it didnt fit any of them,0.29009071
and he saw Cinderella and said,0.258879125
why dont you try it,0.481469512
or possibly she said,0.343866169
why dont I try it,0.463827014
and he tried it on,0.325914204
and it fit,0.414818168
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after,0.315888345
and she of ofcourse being swept off her feet agreed,0.223109111
that shed just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and,0.322101742
but the book doesnt take you that far,0.305910289
it only takes you to the part where they meet and they fall in,0.333091825

and thats where I invested my time,0.306593657
and I spent many years in education while while working,0.339210093
I just did it because I felt I could do it,0.514353991
and it was immensely challenging,0.412673116
but I struggled through it,0.436548412
and I was very successful,0.353516161
a typical day a workday,0.424981534

and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative,0.343285143

oh okay,0.663836598
I guess the one of the earliest memories that I have is,0.30835852
it was a wonderful experience because I was living in a small,0.310443461
and there wasnt the opportunity to partake in any sort of,0.287012845
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports,0.3258093
they had rowing,0.493715912
and they also had arts and handicrafts music theater which I,0.339761406
and so that gave us the opportunity to have a really full,0.336570472
and also what I really enjoyed was the fact that they,0.386834383
we could eat if we wanted,0.495606095
if we didnt feel like eating we didnt hafta eat,0.29014644
there was never anybody saying that youknow you werent allowed,0.307325602
so that was I was in my glory because I would have,0.32007888
and that was enough for me,0.344967097
also we resided in these cabins in the woods,0.309112877
and every morning the counselors would take us swimming before,0.330038637
and it was always really really chilly in the morning,0.359005094
and so this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks,0.25840044
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water,0.365173578
I dont know,0.538106382
I cant remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to,0.236990213
but it was always freezing cold,0.439782113
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake,0.330076903
used to attach themselves to your leg,0.38445586
ofcourse suck on your blood,0.32401374
and that the only way that you could get them off is was if,0.345807493
and then you could pull them off your your leg,0.384094417
and then wed all go back get dressed and then go and have,0.320374638
and in the evenings ofcourse youknow we useta sit around the,0.285077125
everybody used to sing songs and tell stories ghost stories and,0.30218631
and then youknow that would be the end of the day,0.311964691
and it was just it was glorious,0.386888891
I just I loved camp,0.498842418
and arts and crafts was really good,0.369851798
we they always had lotsof materials and somebody who had,0.378154814
and theres painting and things that we useta create with wood,0.375542134
and then Imean I think I was only there for a week,0.297551244
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity,0.334970385
because the days were just so so so full,0.404210508
and then at the end of the week youknow theyd bring in the school,0.256452352
I was living in Montreal at the time,0.279632628
go back to Montreal,0.354435027
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it,0.300080061
and I made such good good friends and people that I really,0.374039978
and once home I kept in contact with alotof the people that,0.269872308
alotof the the girls that I met at the camp,0.252537608
so that was kindof nice,0.403152078
and then I went to youknow every year Id go back to that same,0.251246959
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back,0.219141021
and so you would meet the same people over and over and,0.367220998

mhm,0
well today today Im here,0.374977976
no usually Ive I retired asof last year,0.244106203
so at the moment Im involved in renovating our house,0.224829048
we havent done anything to the house in the last twenty five years,0.249492019
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by,0.280778527
and being elderly she wasnt able to do any of the housework or,0.230431691
so it was pretty run down when I bought it,0.344458491
and she musta been a real cat lover because there were stray,0.299355835
inside the house the the carpets just reeked of cat urine,0.30521524
the walls were crumbling,0.464530259
the plaster was cracked,0.449973583
there was water damage everywhere,0.404943228
I guess shed left the windows open,0.307017237
and the rain had come in,0.338982284
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck,0.311615229
so anyways we did a little bit of renovations,0.285631567
but we havent done much since then,0.363002956
and that was twenty five years ago,0.335567713
so anyways we hired somebody to youknow put together some,0.340122819
and and hired a contractor,0.467739195
and at the moment whats happening is that the contractor and the,0.372586429
so theyre arguing about everything,0.41813159
the the the the guy who designed the space youknow,0.369846255
thats the way it hasta be,0.317152888
the contractor says is arguing that it cant work that way,0.297924608
if youre gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support,0.269310147
and all this kindof stuff,0.468267322
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera,0.254184365

so many issues,0.489313483
so many details,0.493286401
youknow and I cant really afford a designer,0.232264295
but I know I should because Im not very good at it,0.364088207
but anyways so just trying to figure out youknow,0.417116791
thats thats the major thing in my mind at the moment,0.29154107

and he comes home,0.35639447
hes dripping wet,0.307015121
and his mother frowns at him says,0.282288045

I think I was maybe about eight or between eight and ten,0.256898016
something like that,0.701598167
and we went down to this local creek,0.289174795
we lived in a small village,0.30990994
and it was about a mile down to the creek,0.265477449
and it was springtime,0.402802885
and we were cautioned not to go down because it was youknow,0.265908897
not a river,0.425891131
it was a creek,0.382100105
well anyhow we boys will be boys,0.287039906

and we went down,0.332703471
and we always had ke hammers and nails that we bore from our,0.243215457
so we went down,0.395271063
and we found some logs and some odd boards,0.35142231
and we put together a raft,0.30469647
and we went rafting,0.359761029
and the water was a very free flowing,0.360224187
and it was fantastic,0.353937268
but ofcourse we hit one point,0.39272067
and there was a ice floe,0.343140393
and the raft went sideways,0.37368378
and we all went into the water,0.328716815
so youknow and at that time we wore rubber boots,0.215443119
but they were no help because the water was more ke waist,0.258966833
and we got soaked from the waist down,0.24093765
water went in the boots,0.307982147
and and then we finally made it to shore thankgoodness,0.390304297
otherwise it coulda been more serious,0.482315183
and when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots,0.271887869
but we still had our socks on,0.30793339
and we were wet,0.324951828
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in,0.375986606
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road,0.279426813
and it was like sloshsloshslishslosho youknow,0.290115207

but because the temperature was dropping our sortof jeans or,0.301730335
they were starting to freeze,0.428509742
so it was like walking walking along like a robot,0.335599035
but we made it home,0.398750752
and everything was fine,0.389701724

so there variety of activities,0.403579801
if its a very hot day I would choose to maybe go downtown to,0.251636297
sometimes its kindof neat to pretend youre a tourist,0.276363254
and the tourists seem to be very polite youknow,0.299940169

I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities,0.264619172
otherwise I find youknow doing the same thing its like being a,0.294159561
and you have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day,0.312150568
so its kindof nice to try different activities,0.328302026

and stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down,0.385212451
and she doesnt look too happy,0.286339343
and he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again,0.2438173
okay theres alotof action here,0.30221951
looks like theres a girl whos reaching up into a deciduous,0.252488524

perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle,0.346454322
theres a man up in a tree,0.270603448
perhaps he was climbing up the tree,0.297964901
and now theres a dog barking up the tree at the man,0.247885346
he looks very perturbed upset because he cant get down,0.280691177

Cinderella lived with her mean say stepmother who had two,0.261297315
they were not too fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she,0.274622411
and she was made to do all the work,0.29227981
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person,0.322889626
and she lived I believe in the attic,0.264780164
and she would talk to the birds,0.317118824
okay,0.99999994
she was always working,0.416619509
but she would think of youknow how she was made fun of by the,0.207269013
she was overworked,0.493835509
shed bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the,0.365779549
there was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse,0.279315472
Cinderella was always mopping mopping cleaning youknow cooking,0.307400227
Cinderella received a delivery,0.358524144
it was sealed,0.409494579
and the delivery went to the stepmother,0.40943107
stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read,0.287258297
Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited,0.325309396
but as it turned out she was not,0.340994954
so the stepmother denied her that,0.376453012
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the,0.319129527
they were invited to a ball,0.301918656
the prince was having a ball,0.388140321
Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the,0.280999303
in fact she tried on or looked at a dress that she would,0.245872721
she mentioned the dress,0.380325615
and then she looked at pictures of the dress,0.295719534
she was friends with all the,0.356165916
they decided to,0.62809509
so they sewed,0.471535355
and they spun,0.400062829
and they weaved and youknow appliqued the bows on the dress,0.266013741

she,0.999999881
the birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special,0.29400447
she was so delighted with the dress,0.303133726
meanwhile the stepmother and the two sisters were prancing,0.426584303
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her,0.291080117
I believe that they may have been responsible,0.444767535
she cried,0.646916807
everybody was sad her friends the animals small creatures,0.303396791
the fairy godmother heard her pleas and and her sorrow,0.307263345
and she came and waved her magic wand and turned pumpkin into a,0.285092592
its a sad story,0.327413291
into a magnificent coach for Cinderella,0.254430562
then she was off in the coach with the blessing of the,0.315754533
she arrived at the ball and was greeted at the door by two of the,0.256711304
there she met the prince,0.365501404
but the fairy godmother had brstu,0.382856131
in her haste when she heard the clock dong dong dong she ran off,0.222084224
and behind she left her glass slipper,0.32005316
meanwhile she raced home before the entire dream disappeared in the,0.349605411
and and then she made it back,0.397597015
the dress disappeared,0.474237561
the angry godmother met her,0.353238791
and she was very annoyed at her that she came home so late,0.279946476
meanwhile the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom,0.312007457
they tried,0.663301885
it wouldnt fit,0.404022127

is that supposed to be taped,0.340745568
oh okay,0.663836598
basically okay so a bird came,0.307278752
and I all I remember is sortof that she basically was,0.345915258
and all the young ladies were invited to come to the ball,0.315453857
and Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated,0.393512845
she basically hadta do all the work that the other sisters didnt,0.332620174
so she was never,0.475361764
so she was always being giving job giving job,0.371731848
so she kept just getting more and more jobs to do,0.335748911
and and so so she was never able,0.371848494
the so the the day of the the day of the,0.510871589
and she never had any time to work to to,0.40125221
so the,0.503961444
yeah meanwhile the other two stepsisters were,0.348686457
and so they were all prepared to go to the ball,0.337045908
and then the on the day of I believe,0.324365914
and so the the birds and the mice and all the all,0.453127444
and they were stealing I remember they were stealing ke,0.341574132
and she was discovered that was discovered,0.44958958
and the th stepmother basically gave her more jobs to,0.271077186
and somewhere in the story theres a fairy godmother,0.312942058
yeah so this is her still doing all of these jobs,0.292544901
and yeah so shes all sad and unhappy that she is,0.25482145
and then her fairy godmother appears and waved,0.38978368
and basically the some something gets turned,0.434875637
and I think the mice turn into horse either,0.3018004
and so then then she creates a nice gown,0.301615626
and off she goes to the ball,0.290258765
but she hasta be back by midnight because the spell ends at,0.22716856
and so the sisters ofcourse they see Cinderella there in their,0.313667476
and theyre wondering how she and the ep and the,0.336702585
anyway midnight approaches,0.456613898
the bell the stroke of midnight comes,0.34964487
and she remembers that shes gotta leave by then,0.223754764
and so,0.590056539
oh yeah,0.846038759
in the meantime,0.502810717
I think thats the prince,0.344880015
and thats his father,0.385606617
and anyway he he he n he only wants to dance,0.309379756
and anyway when as as as midnight approaches,0.387726009
and so she in her running out she loses her glass slipper and,0.276436001
but shes ofcourse still missing her one slipper,0.335182697
so the next day the the prince wants to find out,0.305877388
and he knows that he the the lost slipper,0.329856038
so he announces to all of his subjects that hes,0.267041802

he n eventually comes to to their u their,0.306573212
and its ofcourse its not gonna fit on the evil sisters,0.215155497
and he finds that it does fit Cinderella,0.284112841

the mother was just lecturing her son about the need to,0.299385637
the son reassured her that he didnt need one,0.25794059
then it started to rain,0.408258289
it started to rain even harder,0.405490994
so he came home all wet,0.295520425

becauseof two emergencies the the fire department was,0.431186289
this the girls cat ended up climbing a tree and was,0.243770599
and in the same tree there was this man who climbed up it,0.254922539
and someone probably the girl brought a ladder,0.328632295

so the fire department hadta come with a larger one,0.330503345
okay,0.99999994
Cinderella was an orphan girl who lived with her,0.264112771

because that was the company I worked for at the time,0.325534672
that I wouldnt have been there had it not been for that work,0.380459547

and prepare a meal for the evening,0.376372814
maybe some housework that needs to be done,0.365138352
and then in the evening I have a lecture to go to,0.304663539

I remember it quite clearly being driven,0.428172261
it was a CYO thing,0.306247622
so I remember being driven in in the car by the priest and the my my other friends around me and going to the hospital and and having my arm taken care of and having surgery,0.262408495
so,0.99999994
I was in a cast,0.272205532
you hafta remember it was a long time ago,0.260168254
so I was in a cast,0.255972862
and I was in a cast for a long time,0.266848445
I do remember my father making me slings that were the holidays,0.285747737
so because it went through many holidays,0.372282267
and and then once it was youknow once it,0.37694782
I went back to being a cheerleader again,0.308138371
its alittle misshapen,0.509177864
but its fine,0.460332751
so I no longer do back flips to say the least,0.281800151
well my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight,0.273178101
well the problems were that he could not communicate,0.409891009
right after his stroke he really had no language at all,0.270318717
so the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and and has continued at this clinic,0.288274616
and this is almost four years later since his stroke,0.295198858
so Ive seen the development of the speech patterns emerging,0.281588167
and what I have seen is him is him recapture language,0.262774676
I I think very similar to what I see in a child,0.307864785
so in moving in in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see,0.297831833
okay,0.99999994
well I guess the thing that always stays with me right now is my husbands stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident,0.248054013
and and I remember asking the question,0.401658654
is he alive,0.396736681
and it was such a strange question,0.351123333
but I needed an answer to it,0.374123663
and they said on the other on the the other side of the phone they didnt know,0.301674068
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and and getting out there,0.365697831
and I remember hearing the sirens as I was as I was approaching,0.282882154
and when I got there youknow he had already been in a he had already been out,0.315384656
he didnt know who I was,0.318751127
and he didnt know who anyone was,0.274213046
but luckily and but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him,0.313065588
so they knew that he wasnt drunk,0.342632473
they knew that he wasnt impaired in any other way,0.273374081
and he knew enough to know that he was he had a stroke,0.325136542
and I remember he was the one who said to me,0.275203109
get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible,0.323259383
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to,0.345861018
and I remember this police officer,0.345099032
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him when Anthony was on the force,0.244910091
so he came in as a as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant,0.244751886
and so youknow I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing youknow in that it was very much like a like a movie or youknow,0.265666187
but and I remember getting down into the into the brain attack center,0.331630856
and everybody was doing what they needed to do,0.373851687
and it was all this kindof prescribed dance that went on,0.305990726
and youknow getting him there and and getting him that shot and and that starting,0.402105093
and and youknow and then from there it was just the recovery,0.350855201
it was the day in day out routine,0.317139387
but I do remember that,0.526986539
that stays with me,0.34875986
yeah it does absolutely,0.497241139
okay,0.99999994
well a boy is outside,0.322925299
and hes playing looks like soccer,0.267288566
so hes kicking the ball,0.282410294
and loandbehold it goes into the neighbors or his own window and crashes through that window,0.300787091
and theres the the man whos sitting and either watching tv or talking or having a conversation,0.298196137
and the soccer ball comes through the window hits the lamp,0.30367133
and the gentleman inside is really quite surprised,0.375234514
he then has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man,0.269473672
and the mother is saying to him,0.355905563
take this umbrella because I think its going to rain,0.325237304
and hes saying,0.298381478
no no no I dont need that umbrella,0.353785098
Im leaving,0.333081126
so shes got the umbrella in hand,0.219900697
and hes out the door,0.278509885
and then sp loandbehold the rain starts,0.333931834
and he is caught in the rain,0.268793017
and he is really wet,0.298468262
and he makes his way home,0.330400169
and his mother is looking at him saying,0.286237031
I told you so,0.502021849
and lets get the umbrella,0.307882458
and then you can go back out,0.389901847
well its a series of circumstances,0.37980926
and the little girls cat is in the tree,0.287457168
she was looks like she was riding her bike,0.321193248
and she was she saw her cat up in the tree,0.25551793
she could have called her dad,0.329848051
and her dad said,0.312752426
okay Im going to help you and go get the cat,0.257145464
and took the ladder,0.398153901
and it doesnt seem like the ladder is quite as as high as what he needed to,0.249877602
so anyway the,0.473696917
no Im sorry,0.338559628
then it looks like he used the ladder,0.32498911
and the ladder has fallen,0.35935837
and he is stuck in the tree,0.254295826
and the dog is barking because they are all up in the tree,0.303052694
and the firemen hafta come and rescue,0.335124105
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house,0.308917165
and there was a stepmother,0.40499106
and the stepmother had two daughters,0.428689361
the father dies,0.503095031
and the daughters the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they so to speak,0.261071205
so Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and and all of that,0.331741542
and then the the the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes,0.391911924
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella,0.337629706
and then comes the the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the for there to be a dance,0.367711544
and everybody is all is all youknow looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the the perfect outfit,0.329252839
and and Cinderella is not going to go to the ball,0.274243116
and she is at home,0.279526979
and and and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot,0.463021249
so they find I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the in a in a hope chest or I guess what I would call now a hope chest,0.23294732
and so that becomes,0.487668216
I dont wait a minute,0.305004835
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing,0.302616268
so the sisters go to the ball,0.299719334
and and poor Cinderella is home with her mice,0.283965796
and and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe,0.300160557
so the fairy godmother creates the the carriage to take her in,0.31935513
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect,0.391397655
and and her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball,0.319833696
so when when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there,0.27491951
and everyone is just,0.422706783
takes her breath away and she takes their breath away,0.353097618
and she meets the prince,0.369686812
and they dance,0.537355363
and they have a wonderful time,0.403207868
but what happens is the clock strikes twelve,0.301893294
and she needs to be home,0.353385627
and she is running out the door,0.29556933
and her slipper is her shoe is left behind,0.264082342
so she goes home,0.383118749
the sisters and whatnot they all go home,0.372115225
and and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper,0.281192571
and he combs through the village,0.372494012
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers,0.280875146
and it doesnt work,0.336594999
and then loandbehold he finds Cinderella,0.333119214
and the shoe fits,0.3711496
they get married,0.427368581
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
the end the end,0.639703751
and way too many girls are looking for Princecharming,0.360435069
but thats a whole other issue yes,0.338781983
I would get the bread,0.349500269

my peanut butter stays in a cabinet,0.244021416
my jelly is in the refrigerator,0.24412775
so the bread comes out first,0.326855987
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out,0.333200485
once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first,0.250279337
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter,0.276178956
put the other slice of bread on,0.312011927

and I came down on my arm,0.257513016
and I remember hearing it crack,0.366668075
it was CYO so it was it was not ke in a public school,0.250365645
and I remember the some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest,0.261994004
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital,0.286069572
and I remember that I was in the hospital for almost a week,0.272889078
Id never really been sick and have since really been sick,0.338481843
but so I I remember being in a cast for quite a long time,0.298440725
and and and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long,0.293018639
I had a Christmas sling and a and whatnot,0.305044353
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling,0.205784127

I tried to do twirling,0.381482393

so,0.99999994
besides my husband,0.479130745
well after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him and realizing that he needed time for processing and and sortof understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them,0.345536083
so that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability,0.380765855
so he he was able to do that,0.350113392
so after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sortof a little bit of self teaching and and and giving him time to find his words and and thinking of the process as as as a child learns speech again,0.280165493
so I tried to educate myself on on how children learn language,0.29776454
and then from that he sortof followed that same process but only speeding it up,0.369109154
so he had the foundation there so,0.360889584
but mostly just giving him time,0.464644432

I guess the mother heard the weather report because she had an umbrella in hand as the as the little boy is walking out the door,0.239158317
but he I guess took a look outside and said,0.262369514
no youknow I dont see any I dont see any rain so I dont wanna take a an umbrella,0.276911914

well the story opens with Cinderellas dad coming home with his new wife and their two children and and her two daughters,0.281359017
and what we find out later on is that the father has died,0.232175887
and this woman now becomes her stepmother,0.38410303

and she is then able to to go to the ball,0.326655239
and the ball is set for a reason,0.313971996
and the reason is is that the prince is to find a wife,0.318006396
and shes given instructions that she needs to be home by twelve midnight,0.242686167
and and the the fairy godmother provides her with this beautiful dress and these wonderful glass slippers and and a whole coach of of pumpkins that turn to to a coach and and with horsemen etcetera,0.269003481
and so she goes there,0.357963026
and she is the belle of the ball,0.287750721
and everyone is oohing and aahing because they dont know who she is,0.306368917

she she she passed away from it,0.408760101
so that was youknow so that was I only had three days of dealing with her her speaking,0.266606063
but and it was it was repetitive,0.42477417
ke she was ke stuttering speaking at that point,0.233041689
everything was,0.532829285
I I need need need need,0.659657359
youknow it was ke that kind of talk,0.225032836
it was hard for her,0.330738604
but but then I really didnt I didnt have that long a long a time to really develop any kind of a language with her,0.29448244
about something that happened,0.620491147

and that was I guess one thing that I do remember,0.383267403
that was fun a really fun time that we had on the train,0.292310417

and it startles him gets him scared,0.354319274
and he gets up,0.328092694

and I need the umbrella,0.317965329
and he gets the umbrella and goes off to school,0.257206887
thats moms always know,0.396556824
well it looks like I think there was a cat that was being chased by a dog up the tree,0.241603285
and the little girl it was her cat,0.312607616
and shes she wants her cat to get down from the tree,0.231582731
and so I imagine its her father that decides to climb up the tree,0.274266392
but he gets stuck up the tree,0.282086402
he cant get down,0.296094537
and finally somebody called the fire department to come rescue all of them,0.329209149
they the father and the cat were stuck up the tree,0.295380205
so they the fire department came through again,0.361875951
so its a story about a daughter and her father,0.317851841
and her mother dies,0.493311942
and her father remarries,0.499420345
and the woman he r marries has two daughters,0.254912615
who the the stepmother thinks her daughters are beautiful magnificent and es doesnt want Cinderella to get any anything once the father passes away,0.223590165
ke makes Cinderella do all the work,0.232006967
and her she wants Cinderella to be her servant and and clean the house,0.310610712
and theres this handsome prince that lives in town,0.31582278
and the princes father the king decides its time for his daughter,0.390987515
and he sends a notice out to everyone in town all the women that are eligible to come and to a ball to dress up and come to this ball,0.267961621
and Cinderella wants to go,0.288674086
and the she gets her dress,0.353157848
I think it was her mothers dress if I remember correctly,0.360410631
and shes gonna wear that,0.213407755
and the sisters find her trying it on,0.307604969
and they they rip it on her and make a mess of the dress,0.25488025
and so she cant go to the ball in that dress,0.217741683
and off the s the the stepsisters go to the ball,0.322898299
and the fairy godmother comes and helps Cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up,0.25568974
and she looked just gorgeous,0.375279069
and sends her off to the ball with a coach and a coachman,0.26884371
and goes to the ball with glass slippers,0.285577536
and dances with the prince,0.475573182
and the prince falls in love,0.351816505
and the only one thing was that she hadta be leave the ball by twelve oclock on the strike of twelve,0.266505748
she hadta get outof there or she was gonna turn back into her rag clothes again,0.223436147
so she was having a wonderful time,0.364783883
and she hasta leave the ball when the when the clock starts striking twelve,0.304686576
and she loses one of her glass slippers,0.244150177
and the prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this glass slipper,0.232001916
and finally they they they werent gonna try Cinderella because she they nobody thought she was at the ball,0.270263046
but they finally try her foot in the slipper,0.30000782
and it fits perfectly,0.418142915
and she turns back into this gorgeous gown and clothing again,0.295916408
and and the prince marries her,0.435089588
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
okay,0.99999994
to make a sandwich if Im gonna make a whole sandwich I would use two pieces of bread,0.215526775
and smear the peanut butter on one half and the jelly on the other half of bread,0.290012479
and then put them together,0.488820225
and cut it in half or fours whatever way you like it,0.296719819
and eat it,0.376779318
you mean in terms of how I felt or what happened,0.278245121
I was I was thrown off of a horse once which was was quite traumatic,0.266166121
and the horse reared up and seemingly simultaneously kicked back,0.343119889
and I was thrown in the air and tumbled pretty much head over heels in front of the horse,0.247832328
and I was out with a group of horses riding along a beach,0.269831777
and the the rest of them were behind me and just went galloping over me,0.325394839
and it it was that was really scary,0.402919054
I I love horses,0.523066819
I love all animals,0.466004819
but I never went horseback riding again,0.391847491
it was serious and I ended up with a serious back injury,0.278915048
it didnt manifest right away which I found out in my travels through the osteopathic world that they oftentimes dont,0.246020332
sometimes years can go by before you realize that theres been a disc injury or anything like that which is why most people dont connect it with an accident,0.236238852
sometimes youknow great a great deal of time could go by years,0.233421743
and suddenly they arent saying,0.330621958
oh I remember I fell off that horse five years ago,0.223833799
youknow theyre thinking what happened to me yesterday or last week so,0.272627741
but that was traumatic,0.496184498
noone trampled me but it it,0.392286122
yeah and the the terror of watching them youknow running over me,0.276507646
it was pretty bad,0.41599825
yeah yeah no it was very scary,0.355235189
my back,0.62146461
oh yeah,0.846038759
when it first went out so to speak I ended up seeing an orthopedic surgeon,0.232865632
didnt want surgery,0.407138526
totally against it,0.50386548
was lucky enough to find an osteopath who,0.239056215
hes not a chiropractor but they do manipulations,0.297790289
and Ive met people who have had surgery,0.279656976
and Im doing way better than them,0.320008218
Ive had about three rounds of physical therapy,0.255225003
and I also began doing weight work to strengthen my upper body,0.291684985
there was a time where I could youknow be taking a gallon of milk or a half gallon of milk outof the dairy case,0.203916013
and it would go right to my fifth lumbar,0.273145407
so now my my biceps and shoulders have been strengthened with regular weight work,0.323496252
so there are things you can do youknow,0.41079098
and Im doing better than many people,0.307294548
the disc was cracked,0.386290729
so but surgery never seems to be a solution,0.367967099
no,0.99999994
no,0.99999994
I understand how to lift and bend,0.318108588
and I just strengthened myself,0.438587636
mhm,0
not really,0.792273641
Imean from time to time in our day to day youll encounter people but never youknow a for a sustained period of time or did I ever work with any person like that,0.266009271
oh yes,0.78150177
no it usually goes pretty well,0.374537438
ERROR,1

and they tend to know a little bit of English,0.2916888
I remember I was I was in Frankfurt once by myself and I ended up going to a pub,0.223107755
I dont think they called them that in Germany,0.288080037
but anyway I had a wonderful time talking to people,0.351790428
I dont speak German,0.321006775
and alotof Germans do have some youknow language recognition in terms of English,0.244117871
but I tend to get along okay,0.338000387
there are way other ways than words to communicate,0.401961625

I ate everything I wanted,0.480363339
I felt terrific,0.537211716
I was working full time,0.341778606
my freezer looked like an Oreida convention,0.279994071
I could eat my youknow my crinkle cuts my shoe strings with pasta,0.25628379
I could do anything,0.582177997
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say,0.186621889
my my my obstetrician youknow during the the buildup to this would say youll be sorry,0.240515769
and I said youknow I cannot imagine regretting this,0.327041209
youknow Im eating Im making ice cream sandwiches with the the the the,0.230943605
its two pieces of pound cake youknow with the HagenDazs in in the middle,0.261532754
so then I get to the hospital,0.35687837
and it was really nasty,0.352774858
it was really it was probably the worst experience I ever had,0.37254405
I was told that if I had automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward,0.244083762
thats what I was told,0.287783921
and I did it did spark revenge in me that I actually carried out,0.293497741
youknow my my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook,0.201445341
he said,0.528301835
well were just going to break your water,0.358172238
itll move things along,0.34792459
I said,0.525946558
no,0.99999994
dont,0.649354219
step back,0.637965381
step back,0.637965381
just leave me alone,0.551282167
I can do this myself youknow,0.441200793
and then he kept saying,0.379365385
relax,1
I dont understand while youre not relaxed,0.329859138
and this is psychological Im sure,0.255627036
every time he said relax I became even more infuriated,0.289592445
youknow this is the effect it had on me,0.260903478
and he wasnt listening when I said stop saying that,0.285385489
when you tell some one to stop doing X you expect them to stop doing that,0.366787493
so anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful,0.227395147
she was born smiling right away recognized my voice,0.23622939
it was just the the most special experience of my whole life,0.329091638
and so now I went for my first postpartum checkup,0.252111226
and Im sitting on the table,0.287833959
and he youknow does the finger pricks and to get some blood out,0.253844589
and he turns around,0.377351284
and he puts the little tube in the machine,0.286552936
and then he turns it on,0.358896166
and the machine is whirring,0.404510379
and I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock,0.282692999
it happened really fast,0.532086372
and I threw him on to the table,0.283726782
and then I jumped on top of him put my knee in his groin,0.207376301
and I was,0.364481449
his glasses were askew,0.319428355
and he his tie was crooked,0.308561593
and I said,0.329179674
relax,1
relax,1
I dont understand why youre not relaxed,0.372083068
whats the matter youknow,0.31838876
it was such a calamity,0.352837801
and although youknow it was all in good fun because later on youknow he,0.229690179
and his wife useta work in his office,0.376161665
and they had a nurse too,0.329138875
and they said,0.43198812
selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives,0.301375031
its really selfish on I on our part,0.294834614
so that was it,0.503803194
thats it Keli,0.378365517
that was a big big experience youknow PeeWees big adventure,0.307149529
well it seems theres a boy out playing,0.280321509
kicks the soccer ball,0.409683436
unfortunately it goes right into the window breaks it,0.38740018
Im gonna guess thats his father sitting there,0.220667496
now he gets the ball,0.324041516
and hes looking at the surveying the damage and his son I guess,0.214837715
and it doesnt doesnt look like its going to end too too well,0.2819435
might be a problem,0.449987173
okay well heres this little child I guess leaving for school,0.292212665
mother saying,0.667589843
take your umbrella,0.459018826
child says,0.563934207
no no I dont need an umbrella,0.274556041
very optimistic,0.715294242
I do the same thing,0.377582163
now its raining,0.475217283
and now its pouring,0.449003816
and then the child comes home youknow obviously soaking wet,0.291746378
the mother is kindof in her Itoldyousoqadj mode,0.303632617
and the little the little boy I guess it is he learned a lesson,0.292562962
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella,0.293044984
life is learning from ones mistakes,0.372994602
listen to your mother,0.436311007
well the cats up in the tree,0.315775663
they get stuck in trees I guess,0.321944833
Ive Ive heard stories like that,0.370226562
I guess its the the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like shes ready to catch the cat,0.238249451
the little dog ofcourse wants the cat down for different reasons,0.301480383
and then the fire department shows up,0.380682915
which theyre good like that,0.425558984
they got the ladder,0.362937272
and all is well,0.448711038
so Cinderella is sent to live with this with a family,0.255969942
and she is basically a a maid,0.337546289
and they there are the two epsis the two,0.458418369
I think its the wicked stepsisters if I recall,0.27912885
and they were they were rather homely,0.492075682
and Cinderella ofcourse was very pretty,0.338439107
and shes very youknow sweet and helpful,0.263708264
and these two are kindof spoiled and youknow not very pleasant,0.301467896
and theres going to be a ball,0.274614781
and I I believe invitations go out,0.305247664
and the two sisters are going to theyre going to go to the ball,0.308961838
and Cinderella is not invited,0.265470535
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in,0.329300195
and Cinderella ends up with,0.324320287
well its all magical youknow right,0.341872573
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach,0.242065519
and by dint of youknow luck and good favor from the fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball,0.195546225
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight,0.299473673
so shes dancing with the prince having a wonderful time,0.304617822
the other two sisters I I forgot where,0.315966725
they just kindof melted into the background,0.397229254
they werent very popular,0.318424135
I could have told you that from the beginning youknow,0.29976666
but anyhow Cinderella finds out what time it is,0.265957117
and she needs to leave youknow to get into the the the carriage to go back before midnight,0.299058676
and she her slipper fill,0.31386435
and the prince finds it,0.381452799
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that youknow he wants to find this this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper,0.231203169
I remember the details now from my own picture book,0.294656932
put it on,0.390014291
when when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet,0.24111405
and the slipper was ke even half not even half the size of her foot,0.250599712
so anyway they locked Cinderella up,0.351742119
I think nobody wanted them to find her,0.407279074
and the mice helped,0.422451854
they brought the key,0.444598913
and the mice she youknow the animals loved her,0.292706043
they were her friends,0.474684328
and ofcourse it all ends happily ever after,0.343106806
she does it does it is discovered that the slipper fits her,0.310223877
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince,0.338123292
just the way we all live,0.430487603
its exactly what my experience has been,0.319762319
its the same thing,0.483602881
its like they its like they met me,0.313442737
and they ali youknow they they it was the youknow really it was like they knew me,0.321685016
its so uncanny,0.413222671
alright well first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture,0.266118348
now when I make a sandwich,0.339607686
and its not just with peanut butter and jelly,0.325296342
I I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up youknow,0.265009761
its got to be just right,0.334170371
so anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter,0.337943137
again two slices of bread is nice but for this well put the peanut butter on first with a knife,0.233572394
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around,0.271301001
and it it just works better than with the knife,0.343985111
and thats it,0.421838701
youknow in this case you could cut it in half fold it in half get another piece,0.258267581
youknow if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle youknow like that,0.224193439
and thats it,0.421838701
I like a good smdu,0.454868406
oh gee,0.657452464
actually I fainted once,0.48398298
and thats a terrible feeling,0.387402713
and I guess youknow I guess we could compare that to a a stroke in the sense that its a sudden onset,0.264795482
and you do have a a short window if its the same as a stroke,0.270407706
there in my case theres a short window of realizing something is really wrong,0.286508769
and you do have time to to be cognizant of being in big trouble,0.278530717
infact I remember one time I I I fainted,0.472030252
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house,0.240469903
and that was I was really afraid of of the fact that I was in a hard tile room,0.266231537
and my daughter was downstairs,0.306061149
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight,0.240629375
and I just in a panic I said,0.266811252
Dolly call nineoneone,0.442173839
so I knew I was in trouble,0.344493777
and I I then I I was able to just slowly go down myself,0.362672448
and then I went outof the picture,0.271924436
and the paramedics did take me to the hospital,0.324232131
and I had food poisoning,0.344971001
and when I got,0.364699483
now that was really frightening as youknow they theyre racing me through the the er,0.269753993
theyre asking me youknow all sorts of information,0.269536704
and and the pocketbook disappears,0.48835513
and then youknow testing and monitors and all that,0.439055324
and they said,0.43198812
youknow your potassium level is in the basement,0.266550809
so it was really a,0.458031237
and youknow you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either youknow in the hospital or even dying,0.25668624
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to those sortof sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly,0.275152683
so it was truly an emergency situation,0.34358114
so and my daughter as young as she was youknow I credit Natalie with youknow the fact that it wasnt worse,0.195903897
that she she just listened to me and didnt question it and dialed nineoneone,0.305131644
yeah so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice I think,0.325589538
right,0.999999821
and thats probably as scary just like that,0.387394518
yeah yeah,1
I was in the hospital for the night,0.319903821
and they gave me a liquid potassium,0.265770733
and then in ivs,0.564572692
and then I left the hospital with,0.355608016
well before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions youknow to to call,0.225107878
but it was liquid potassium and ivs for many hours,0.297519594
and they were monitoring me and youknow taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that,0.35688296
so but youknow I was out youknow by the next morning,0.237550378
but still,0.812089384
I felt really weak and tired,0.401637644
Imean you needed to recover,0.466439933
the the the rest of that day was really kindof not on the map youknow,0.311685175
but Imean I I just felt really really tired,0.555136979
and wiped out maybe is better,0.265284419
tired tired doesnt capture it,0.325247169
youknow it was scary,0.369289815
youknow when you see these stories right,0.361962348
you you hear them,0.652118444
somebody died,0.465923548
ke how do they die,0.340187192
right right,1.000000119
it can be serious,0.44392243
and I had been doing a good deed that day,0.286337763
I was at the YogiBerra stadium,0.29482469
at the time and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation,0.288858801
and I was at the YogiBerra stadium working an event,0.259479553
it was family day,0.380517006
and they had I had some chicken,0.375833482
and thats thats what did me in,0.296307743
trying to do a good thing right,0.41318801
they almost killed me,0.408028483
yes,0.999999881
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it,0.395050138
a very dear friend of mine was was had cancer and was dying,0.28566891
youknow she was at that youknow close point,0.254937798
and she I guess it was the liver starting to shut down,0.261091292
youknow the again the organs the the kidney and liver especially the liver,0.434369147
and she was incoherent,0.39758262
and she was speaking to me,0.3223809
this was a very strange experience,0.440897405
she was speaking to me,0.343848526
but I couldnt understand a single word that she said,0.296552926
and it was just gibberish,0.397624612
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way,0.321788013
and she would it would be frustrating for her that I wasnt understanding what she said,0.299390882
and it sounded like words too,0.382321447
but it wasnt,0.402158439
and I spoke with the the nurse who was caring for her,0.292496532
she was at home,0.358765841
and I was told that when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen,0.254526436
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of youknow the medical sequence of events,0.299399912
but but that thats very frustrating to be,0.471331
and I could see the frustration on her face,0.295901269
and then I feel badly,0.37291795
and I feel frustrated too because I I really wanna understand and and cant,0.331398308
well you could only have simple communications at that point sortof like point to things,0.377601326
and then I would I would I would tell her at different ver intervals,0.283031642
I cannot understand what youre saying,0.421768725
and she would feel even worse,0.397510856
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was saying words,0.396157086
I I realized that pretty pretty quickly,0.498691976
she she thought she was youknow saying things,0.425323755
so I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or just pretend sometimes I even understood,0.325614989
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever,0.385566294
youknow then she would it would be pretty clear Im not coming with the water,0.268335998
but that that thats very frightening,0.571878374
and and its frustrating for everyone,0.501040936
youre imprisoned in your own body in a way arent you,0.232530579
yeah that hasta be a hell,0.275827557
something important,0.730375767
I guess alotof important things sortof happened youknow,0.385362864
be hard to,0.452485621
I think I think in a sense I made my own important things,0.334105849
for instance I grew up in a family,0.235518038
I was one of five children,0.289132148
and now I dont want this to sound youknow politically incorrect but my father was Italian of Italian descent,0.204326704
and he had this mind set that girls just dont go to college,0.256032676
and unfortunately four of us were girls,0.307920098
so he didnt that wasnt a,0.297511101
he wasnt pleased with that either I dont think,0.274129897
and I was the third one,0.333033025
can you imagine,0.585175395
in a row,0.395816952
no boys yet,0.412495255
so anyhow it was made very clear that college was not on the map,0.256265938
and his his his idea was that,0.450551867
Ive been supporting you all these years,0.323196769
and now you owe me,0.304845333
youknow you hafta go to work and contribute to the household,0.257030785
so this was a builtin thing,0.358410209
at the time I wasnt realizing how grave it was,0.25239867
infact there was something that felt almost exciting about it,0.442423731
that Ill be going to work soon youknow,0.274090946
and the good news was that I was also an honor student,0.271295547
and I got to highschool at twelve,0.235943273
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete,0.228816956
and now I was going to work,0.333611667
so my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasnt going to college because I was an honor student,0.239783391
she actually wanted to call him,0.424235314
and I was very calm about the whole thing,0.318424225
I said,0.525946558
theres really no point,0.427225411
youknow its youre not going to get anywhere,0.299858391
this is the state of things,0.418086171
its the state of the art at the Lastname household,0.433201641
and thats that,0.513823211
so anyway she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on WallStreet and who worked at a personnel department at what was then the IrvingTrustCompany which no longer exists,0.235630304
and they took great pride in that that company,0.353430092
they they were at one WallStreet,0.445881814
and they considered themselves at the top of WallStreet,0.371096194
and this was verbalized,0.450736284
so anyway she called her friend,0.370941013
and Ill never forget her,0.291711092
her name was FirstnameLastname who I went to see,0.244714975
so I I put a suit on went shopping and bought myself youknow a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview,0.215171218
and I think I was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her,0.292246103
and so she hired me,0.305982828
and I ended up in a subbasement,0.274712741
not just a basement,0.448082864
it was a subbasement,0.416401535
I think I was lower than the vaults,0.263814092
in a secretarial pool where else,0.276472896
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool,0.267223597
I did,0.688738763
and good good on me,0.367434084
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to,0.296997994
eventhough I had an academic course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study,0.281365782
and I and I I took typing and stenography,0.300824404
I thought this might help me,0.470127732
and maybe my job wont be so random,0.254019082
I have atleast a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up youknow,0.255124986
so I end up in a secretarial pool,0.217022806
and they banks are notoriously very frugal,0.400941819
and back then the things were even worse,0.411320835
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization,0.356295943
and I I I preface that because they didnt tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because theres a fee involved,0.293302059
so if somebody youknow in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches youknow where I was,0.236544892
so I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in,0.185532704
it was sortof like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at being at any orphanage where a call comes in,0.201223701
and they pick you,0.43921876
so they a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust department on the twelfth floor,0.275880843
he was a a a senior vice president of the bank,0.317646891
his secretary was unexpectedly out,0.377849579
and they needed a fillin,0.460316241
so they selected me,0.373093963
and up I went,0.302062184
and I walked in,0.282044291
and you could hear a pin drop in this place,0.26002717
I could tell it was going to be,0.349143565
I didnt know how I was going to generate any level of youknow lightheartedness,0.240383029
you youknow it it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water,0.261976808
and you should genuflect youknow before you to sit down at your desk,0.26851204
so there I am,0.476088166
and it turned out that his secretary,0.336045593
Ill fast forward alittle,0.381928027
so here I was,0.434167266
youknow my skills were good,0.286713153
Im answering the phone,0.275955647
Im taking shorthand letters,0.309250593
things are getting things are humming along,0.443809122
everything is great,0.502066851
and it turns out that she the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back,0.265091091
she was pregnant and was having some difficulties some complications so the the absence was going to be long term,0.328969151
and they hired me,0.342371762
so now and I had a raise right away,0.291812092
I thought this work life is a cinch,0.349785
Im here for a week and I got a raise,0.213948965
I got outof the subbasement youknow,0.263756692
Im in the light of day,0.23336333
things were youknow ke things were moving along so quickly that I I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on WallStreet youknow,0.252057135
it was the trajectory I was on,0.320404917
so one day I was there I was there for about three months I guess,0.302561432
and I was out to lunch still trying to youknow explore the area,0.251609385
its a very exciting place youknow,0.318524033
WallStreet,0
and I found the NewYork StockExchange,0.309309602
and I youknow I was m sortof like a pseudo tourist,0.224750444
so I was walking up Broadway one day,0.253204346
and I encounter the MarineMidlandBank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories,0.26508081
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving,0.314043224
it just youknow it was a great place light and airy modern,0.28466633
I went in,0.350302637
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was,0.351441473
so I was directed there,0.305904031
I sat down filled out an application,0.218142584
and I was drunk with power by then youknow because I had gotten the raise,0.234566733
things were moving so quickly,0.453892291
so I filled out the application,0.306039363
the interview with the personnel manager went very well,0.354385316
she told me about three different types of positions I could have,0.257089883
and visited all three of them,0.40478313
and I could pick whichever one I wanted,0.35955599
so I picked the one in the international department,0.308978111
that sounded really interesting to me,0.444920868
and was working for an executive there,0.349973381
and it was just a wonderful environment,0.356651783
and I was in the LatinAmerican division,0.355038226
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and Chile,0.425593197
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when there was the coupdetat in Chile when SalvadorAllende was,0.359128267
and we had lots of money,0.296110064
we we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the LatinAmerican area,0.274879783
so those were those were some pretty exciting times,0.447493702
and I then I was there for a few years,0.278612316
and my direct boss who was the he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office,0.257626057
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor,0.284945667
so ofcourse youknow how romance always wins out,0.294795871
I had a boyfriend,0.386947304
I didnt wanna move to Paris,0.286173403
and many people probably would have said Paris youknow,0.290787876
and ke it would have been,0.319374025
I look back,0.510267973
I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didnt work out either,0.303532571
but thats okay,0.40419668
so I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was alittle more fast moving and exciting,0.279051721
I I figured this is a good youknow juncture to get outof banking,0.2404982
it seemed very staid no matter where you were,0.333574355
so I I I got a an agent,0.343321264
I had youknow kindof felt my way around youknow how things work down on the street by then,0.236570194
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms,0.311882377
so to fast forward,0.462955177
hope that wasnt too long a story,0.268191248
then I I I I had my daughter,0.49747014
I was a stayathome mom,0.361203611
and the college thing was always on my mind,0.297811687
so I applied to MontclairState,0.401456058
and and I was accepted,0.361673892
I came in at the time was a second career program,0.273169696
and the important thing was that I did it,0.365414172
I got my degree,0.385619342
and I graduated summacumlaude,0.336472481
and I had marvelous experiences,0.330649346
and plus I was a day student,0.235110685
and that was another thing for me,0.364985645
I realized that I could still kindof live the life I might have,0.414971083
when I mention a day student its because I was a young always among young mainstream students,0.280135006
and I thought,0.462097377
gee maybe Ill be sortof ostracized from main society here,0.190261498
but I wasnt,0.385934711
and they liked me,0.38446942
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience,0.324382424
so I got the degree anyway,0.325492531
and here I am,0.346665502
yeah,1
youre welcome,0.436786056
yeah this is that same disaster that we had last week,0.3202613
disastro,0
the boy is outside having fun youknow kicking around the soccer ball,0.244089499
and crash,0.478586882
it goes right through the window,0.395737618
looks like his father,0.419219494
knocks the lamp over too I see,0.257646322
the father was happen happened to be sitting in the chair,0.302227169
and he gets up,0.328092694
and hes got the ball in his hand,0.250429749
he looks out the window,0.341369241
and seems like the boy is going to have a bad evening,0.268870443
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that,0.337351054
funny he was just sitting there,0.373314112
you dont even see a newspaper or something youknow,0.292197824
he was just sitting there ke waiting for disaster to strike,0.294004947
well we have what looks to be a mother and her child,0.309272349
its funny,0.395219117
my first impression is a girl a little girl,0.339795381
but in other pictures I dont know,0.305240989
I think its a little boy,0.326820374
maybe its sposta be r generic,0.297075093
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella,0.350171596
child says no,0.425190926
youknow that that whole idea is rejected,0.364838928
mother offers the umbrella again,0.324385464
no bye,0.4895235
uhoh outside started to rain,0.259835064
now its pouring,0.454243332
child comes in soaked,0.304470778
the mother is standing there with that youknow Itoldyousoqadj attitude and and kindof annoyed I guess,0.301382989
but thats what mothers do youknow,0.348913103
you wanna protect your child,0.426928639
and the child they dont like the idea,0.303821325
they think youre mean and difficult,0.411346823
you just dont want your child to fall down and skin their knee,0.288098693
you dont want them to get wet,0.399047434
you dont want anything to happen to this child,0.420429379
I know thats how I was,0.347482949
and so now its another rainy day,0.302834958
or later maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella,0.2390939
learned a lesson,0.502741337
listen to the mother,0.399781555
and youknow so maybe a lesson learned for the future,0.279191583
that maybe mommy youknow isnt that bad after all,0.244524121
trying to protect me,0.441561043
well we have a cat emergency here,0.322950393
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like,0.2617926
and I guess the father or maybe some well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder,0.277398586
got up in the tree,0.291234344
hes stuck up there too now,0.293612599
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to get the cat,0.278784543
and now I see the fire department is on the scene,0.2623972
and theyre going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after,0.309480339
well for reasons that werent entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a being a maid working for this family,0.230312854
and it was a mother and her two daughters,0.346054822
they were just very shrill and very unattractive young women,0.37790513
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and just just very nice,0.331031531
these two were were very spoiled and and didnt have any appreciation for anything,0.29840219
Imean Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard youknow animals loved her,0.232562676
the horse the whoever was out there,0.370584697
mice even youknow,0.404121965
she was a delight,0.408844948
anyway theres a a an an announcement comes to the unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their their their mcmansion I guess where they live,0.259231776
they werent in a castle,0.261624604
they got an invitation to to a ball,0.302935302
the prince was going to give a ball,0.289208353
and Cinderella useta she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance,0.271278173
and so when news came of this ball she was also silently very excited about it,0.267390966
but the two girls youknow ofcourse they were going,0.319235563
they had an invitation,0.383102953
and somehow I forget some of the details in between,0.303366631
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up youknow helping working some magic,0.251675069
and Cinderella does go to the ball,0.249496251
ke a pumpkin that that that what was that gets turned into a a a carriage and with horses,0.296761751
and shes got a beautiful gown on,0.205507725
and she just looks really just beautiful,0.481308788
and she the prince ofcourse youknow sees her right away,0.278173059
and youknow one of those across the crowded room,0.291534275
and they danced all night,0.434266359
and it was very romantic,0.367673278
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the that or whoever or that they were,0.312752545
was that the stepsisters or was that another story,0.389783889
the wicked stepsisters I dont know,0.280141592
anyhow those horrible faces like,0.402150124
so anyway the the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight,0.264143556
and you see the the the clock is is striking twelve,0.316403717
and shes saying goodbye to the prince,0.269973397
and ofcourse he doesnt wanna let her to leave,0.259934396
and shes late,0.304918289
shes running down this youknow a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe,0.208891973
one of her glass slippers,0.288920105
and the butler or whoever majordomo from the the palace was sent around youknow to the town to find who fits into the shoe,0.230891392
and Cinderella gets locked up,0.2668432
youknow the mother the that horrible mother thought that youknow theyd cram the shoe on one of her daughters feet,0.240443155
and I remember their feet were ugly too,0.258623958
and the mice end up getting,0.336838365
oh she was locked in this room youknow,0.220902741
they didnt want her on the scene,0.271464318
and the mice brought her the key,0.376427233
she got out and tried on the shoe,0.260908186
ofcourse it fit perfectly,0.51309824
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after,0.320832789
one hopes,0.585350037
and I hope they werent the bridesmaids at the wedding those those horrible people,0.285574198
okay,0.99999994
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here,0.307335407
otherwise its an open face,0.351696044
they dont call it a sandwich right,0.305666506
so be nice,0.493854314
well were pretend we have two pieces of bread,0.284735441
and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread,0.327583075
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread,0.244988397
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both,0.241790235
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly,0.267500162
and just gently spread that on,0.426545799
close it up maybe cut it in half,0.313667595
because I love smdzu,0.563942254
but I dont like a bite of the crust first,0.229699984
on a peanut butter its,0.322605014
so thats why I,0.426726997
yeah and I like to cut it ke on the diagonal,0.220030352
hasta be a particular way youknow,0.255649924
yes I had in in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor,0.214670911
and he told me that if as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen,0.264236897
and two days later it ruptured,0.302381456
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm,0.238536641
and fortunately it was he needed do surgery,0.324241757
but after that I was fine,0.374529719
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain Ive ever experienced,0.300306052
so thats the first thing that came to mind,0.339744836
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically,0.413235456
and it could not be,0.44644469
so it was full blown surgery,0.294092506
and I remember being I was obviously much younger,0.370962441
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience,0.281553149
and I hadta go very slowly,0.310786277
and I was outof work for a long time which is what I remember the most,0.245279908
and then little by little I just got my strength back until,0.319682717
I had the the privilege of working with a hippotherapy organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who worked with children with multiple sclerosis and and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally,0.331564963
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying,0.33735162
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would would elicit your sympathy,0.3300111
and you just sortof hadta tell them to youknow to to buck up and do it,0.325104594
but it was very it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that,0.345071614
and now ofcourse here Im doing that in in in a much broader spectrum,0.280112565
there are several,0.561127186
let me think what would be a good story,0.338071644
well very recently two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country,0.202361122
and since we didnt have complete leisure time we v divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every major league un major league stadium in the country,0.205034479
and in two thousand twelve we completed that,0.354402483
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in in thirty cities,0.310981393
yeah and it was absolutely wonderful,0.322198093
and then ofcourse they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami,0.257406205
so on Memorialday weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there,0.206719458
and in August well be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there,0.243655384
so when we hear if you build it they will come we think its meant for us and that were going to go see baseball games,0.300083011
and eventhough I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had,0.292836428
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that wed never seen or never would have seen,0.255821466
and it was just the the the best six years the best time I can I can recall,0.273539722
and we love to talk about it,0.349922985
yep,1
okay theres a young boy kicking a soccer ball,0.25044015
he doesnt know his own strength so he kicks it r very far and very hard,0.249007225
and it breaks the window,0.406748325
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball,0.311881781
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked,0.248259753
oh thats the ball,0.253210247
Im sorry,0.42297408
hes holding the ball,0.299185038
and hes looking out the window to see who kicked the ball,0.237253636
okay a little boy is leaving for school,0.263468027
and his mother obviously thinks its going to rain or knows its going to rain offers him the umbrella,0.250106126
and he says,0.357835323
no mom I dont need it,0.366071582
see ya,0.50396049
Im leaving without the umbrella,0.25678575
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder,0.322822183
and he gets really really wet,0.368825138
so he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry,0.284896791
and hes hes happier at the end,0.2220954
okay the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree,0.269917697
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree,0.295252979
a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat,0.233041838
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure,0.27710703
and now the man is stuck in the tree aswell,0.262989432
and the fi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat outof the tree,0.259203523
okay Cinderella is a story about a little girl who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled,0.227515116
and she is not treated as an equal,0.296850741
she is treated as a real stepchild,0.312894613
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders outof the fire,0.229498759
and she grows up in that role where her her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not,0.287130654
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry,0.274476111
and the invitation comes,0.515885353
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball,0.270400792
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball,0.274707168
and Cinderella thinks she wont go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball,0.196576104
noone knows who she is,0.270020336
and part of that is the glass slippers,0.322713315
she has her glass slippers,0.334944338
and she gets into the pumpkin thats turned into the carriage,0.281631678
she rides to the ball,0.314181745
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight,0.281576365
so she goes to the ball,0.293767571
and she has a wonderful time,0.337326467
and the clock strikes twelve,0.39246276
and shes running outof the ballroom,0.226261124
and she loses a glass slipper,0.270115167
and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry hes going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his his true love,0.244101569
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live,0.385228813
and the two epsis two stepsisters try on the slipper,0.310575187
and ofcourse it does not fit,0.380286723
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him,0.241970599
but the slipper does not break,0.391712785
she tries on the slipper,0.301359862
it fits,0.55581367
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
and thats about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella,0.268049836
I would take a knife,0.332893133
I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly,0.239368945
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first,0.275622815
and then I would spread the jelly,0.329822391
and then I would fold the bread in half,0.303925067
in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst,0.262446105
and my doctor had told me that I could just do normal activities and nothing would happen,0.31458807
and unfortunately it did rupture,0.412798375
and it burst,0.382657468
and it was February,0.324637592
and it was an ice storm,0.287143052
and it was the middle of the night,0.374174356
and it was very treacherous getting there,0.422242016
but I we did,0.557352126
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic operation,0.354016483
and they couldnt do it that way so it was a fullon operation,0.333653361
and I remember it was I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time,0.288985729
and eventually I just got back to my own my old self,0.30594328
I dont remember too much about what I did to get better,0.375002831
I do remember though that I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk,0.331391484
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown,0.255022764
and it required crossing a very busy street,0.314664304
and there was no traffic light,0.35425362
and I remember them being able to cross very easily,0.362388641
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in in either direction to inch my way through,0.229609132
but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to to move,0.307451904
and now I dont even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but,0.281995893
yes,0.999999881
okay thankyou,0.616147399
yes my first experience was back in the late nineteen nineties,0.260940731
I worked with a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges,0.313652575
and the the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they had been,0.347696066
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse,0.33745718
so that was my first experience was was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually substituted for words that could that could not be understood,0.329816222
and and the the kids were great,0.439977169
and they were youknow they would manipulate because if they didnt know what to do they would just start to cry,0.371007681
and youd hafta youd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just ke I dont wanna do this,0.192434713
and now ofcourse fast forward to here this has been an amazing experience working with both children and and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate,0.303117961
and what theyre doing youknow to to make themselves better,0.353576899
and Im Ive taken cues from the people with whom Im working what not to do and and what to do,0.218141243
and and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps,0.395215958
so,0.99999994
yes Id like its something I love talking about,0.330373079
my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park,0.19469291
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year,0.285158485
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in in the south and then the midwest and,0.27228418
and eventhough we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had,0.350209057
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something,0.366466403
and we were also very sad that it was finished,0.291768312
but every time they build a new ball park well be going,0.305026412
so and and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our Christmas cards our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling,0.284337074
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with with the the trip itself,0.366058022
and the first one it said,0.356191248
from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home,0.248549402
which which was mine,0.488913059
but it was nice,0.426136971
and it in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen,0.313211262
we saw cities we never would have seen,0.380518258
and we interfaced with people that we never would have youknow communicated with because theyre very different when you leave the NewYork area,0.31605199
so,0.99999994
okay this story begins with a boy playing soccer,0.246857867
and hes kicking the ball in the air,0.297758758
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction,0.271299303
and the ball goes crashing through the window of a home,0.33674705
and theres a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window,0.266684055
and at the end he picks up the soccer ball and looks outside to see who kicked it from whence it came,0.222943589
okay,0.99999994
a little boy is leaving the house,0.33559534
he does not want the umbrella,0.324341953
he says bye mom and leaves without the umbrella,0.199309215
and as he starts walking it starts to rain,0.291968167
and then it starts to rain even harder,0.39952606
so he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake,0.255068928
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet,0.297564
and then he takes the umbrella and starts out again,0.338683218
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree,0.260492682
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down,0.267272323
so her dad takes a ladder climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat,0.22680831
unfortunately the ladder falls,0.435203671
he cant get down,0.296094537
theres a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really cant get down,0.201412395
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree,0.262708336
Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters,0.288590968
and eventhough they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family,0.314161688
infact her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders,0.271830529
and she is kept down at heel eventhough they are wealthy and snobby,0.23417826
and an invitation comes to a ball,0.310300976
and the the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going,0.28277567
but its quite clear that she will not be going to the ball,0.343395472
the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife,0.310611904
and Cinderellas friends from the field make her a dress,0.282279253
and shes all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say,0.243535295
youre not going,0.481596708
and they destroy the dress,0.401091486
and shes devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball,0.223920286
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears,0.389694333
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress,0.345490158
she turns a pumpkin into a carriage,0.325382382
she turns four white mice into four horses,0.282920778
I could sing it but I wont,0.37933889
I really could,0.624605298
and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken,0.279340774
and everything will turn back to the way it is,0.371641427
she goes to the ball,0.308626205
she meets the prince,0.3857328
she dances with the prince,0.399876833
theyre falling in love,0.30860883
and the clock strikes twelve,0.39246276
so she hurries out,0.438226551
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her,0.243008614
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman hes fallen in love with,0.266919613
so they set out to try the the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in the town the village,0.248978168
and eventhough the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it they eventually find that it fits Cinderella,0.324530184
and they live happily every after,0.377736717
okay,0.99999994
I would take I would open both jars,0.322924912
I would find a knife,0.326299936
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread,0.273839861
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread,0.280537397
and since there is only one piece of bread I would just I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich,0.269121319
okay I had fallen at one point,0.267097503
and I fractured my right wrist,0.338022947
and I remember that,0.448325574
well it was how many years ago,0.274983346
it was probably in nineteen ninety two or three,0.320799559
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream,0.214491308
and I was looking at the sign,0.264882624
and then I tripped and fell,0.35363248
and I was holding my keys in my right hand,0.262410998
and so Ive but I got a little fracture,0.317704171
and I hadta go to the emergency room,0.291375041
well I was casted for quite a while,0.301689446
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge I think was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own recovery,0.238721848
but it wasnt really a bad thing all in all,0.312618643
I had the cast on for awhile,0.270308584
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist,0.21910657
yes I do,0.616899133
I have a very dear friend cousin who is has aphasia,0.264550835
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and shes now seventy one,0.27867505
and I visit her regularly,0.336935699
and we communicate in a very interesting way,0.366786063
well I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to,0.280158669
and I dont give her many choices,0.265625179
and we do alotof hand motions,0.300080061
and she has a way of communicating,0.328371406
shes pretty amazing,0.386431903
she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats alot,0.336112559
she she likes to say she wants to go home indicating her frustration with her situation,0.292800963
but I can see when I speak with her that shes very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts,0.262741804
she has the thoughts she if she could only put the words together,0.320153236
and it is very very frustrating for her,0.3838346
but I think that shes kindof come to terms with where shes at,0.281810492
its hard,0.537883997
wow well the first thing that came into my mind because Ill Ill take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place,0.246578649
and the most so its a trauma event where my grandfather passed away,0.269379884
and he was not sick,0.33223325
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work,0.296436191
so he went off on a normal day,0.261055976
and I remember playing youknow with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital,0.259684861
and a friend of mine and I made put some cookies together and for when he was going to come home because we didnt entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with the death,0.260594785
so its kindof a sad story,0.308407605
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the o cycle of birth and death and whatnot,0.264683902
so it turned out he passed away that night,0.352629602
and I never did see him again,0.374387532
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship,0.322937757
and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life,0.321474046
and then looking back on it as an adult now realizing that this man was really an angel of mine,0.26302883
I didnt realize it then but I came to believe,0.378860027
and I dont know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there,0.280666053
came to learn about that,0.394571006
and it just served as a a real learning in my life in many different ways,0.282039881
okay well this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went outof the way and broke the window,0.231863782
not his intention but it was an accident,0.362163663
and loandbehold his dad was sitting in the living room,0.299029142
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad,0.32869029
and the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didnt see the boy because the boy ran away in fear,0.217508003
this is the story about a a little boy who was on his way to school,0.2627002
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella,0.250848889
but he didnt wanna take the umbrella because he didnt wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain,0.229815096
so he went on his way,0.304244757
he got caught in the rain,0.273749322
it started to rain very hard,0.362779647
he got very wet,0.334471047
and he came home,0.362693429
and he got the umbrella,0.293110698
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom,0.289255887
ERROR,1
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson,0.223849237
okay well little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park with her dad,0.233237535
and as they were going along they noticed that a cat was running along the field,0.307846993
and a dog was chasing it,0.303303719
and dont you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree,0.235144719
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so,0.317886055
she encouraged her dad to get the ladder because they lived right across the street,0.277083725
and the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree,0.251495838
but then he got stuck in the tree,0.290149987
and looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down,0.284175545
so Im sure someone had a cell phone in this picture eventhough its not shown,0.2444527
so the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat,0.291487813
and they all lived happily ever after,0.364279985
okay once upon a time there was a young girl,0.286037147
and she hadta go live with her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldnt take care of her anymore,0.2520473
so he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived,0.334745228
and they took the the girl in,0.354223132
and turned out they really didnt treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted,0.291456461
and she was sortof like their maid,0.282130957
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent alotof time among the cinders by the fireplace,0.242556199
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball,0.279163837
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball,0.329334259
so when they got the announcement Cinderella knew about it,0.289508015
but ofcourse the wicked stepmother wasnt going to let Cinderella go to the ball,0.237632111
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball,0.300041437
so the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things,0.352674603
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house,0.306978822
and then they saw how sad she was,0.284057319
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such,0.31420207
but Cinderella I guess she knew in her heart that she couldnt really go to the ball,0.263117671
so as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go,0.264670461
and they had beautiful dresses,0.40053004
and she hadta help mend them,0.36215806
and lets see what happened,0.333353341
she I think she went out in the garden,0.282063633
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad,0.318571925
and she was crying,0.402705461
and she really wanted to go to the ball,0.333122969
and her fairy godmother had said youknow,0.267766654
you may go to the ball just change,0.343676329
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress,0.309527934
and she said,0.380783647
fetch me a pumpkin,0.346434414
and then turned it in to a coach,0.296179384
and shen,0.507526219
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin,0.319417268
and so she was able to go off to this ball,0.275471717
and when she got there the ball was in full swing,0.278902352
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the the prince,0.393025696
and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious they really werent gracious people,0.338423491
and one had a tic and a creaky knee,0.268501014
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just,0.339641064
things that they just didnt know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the prince in a proper way,0.306053698
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her,0.315858334
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince,0.335306615
and there was this magical thing that happened that wed like to think is love,0.335602164
and they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting,0.472673029
and suddenly the struck,0.459415644
and she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight,0.306377381
and with that she ran away,0.308564216
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind,0.259783387
she made her way home,0.371579289
she was alittle sad because I guess she thought shed never see this prince again,0.364916623
and then the prince found the slipper,0.408833027
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper,0.258599728
so he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on,0.237760231
and then they did come to the home of the where Cinderella lived,0.316619128
then they the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot,0.304598927
wasnt going to fit,0.268803954
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe,0.28064701
and it fits,0.372495621
and they get married and live happily ever after,0.314800531
that was not the best version of the story that Ive ever heard,0.289833516
well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would open up the freezer and get some glutenfree bread outof there,0.227994233
and I would put a paper towel on the counter,0.271891743
and Id put the slices of bread on the paper towel,0.2353082
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly,0.276324034
put them on the counter,0.402795225
and I would retrieve from the drawer a implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly,0.258019656
and I would then open up the peanut butter,0.302392781
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread,0.265015423
and then I would close the jar,0.325611264
and then I would open the jelly jar,0.289131552
and I would take a nice heaping,0.323949665
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around,0.31656304
and then I would put the top on the bread,0.302211195
Id close up the jelly and put the knife and the spoon in the sink,0.235612333
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater,0.319510877
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate,0.28287679
and I probably wouldnt cut it,0.330081969
and I would go sit down,0.297755957
and I would enjoy a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich,0.282800287
oh thats right,0.353263378
I injury I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant,0.212045148
I was going to a store to get some an ice cream,0.249150589
I was really hungry,0.425783873
I had just worked really hard that morning,0.399443299
and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying,0.232686549
if they sell cheeseburgers Im getting one,0.296720147
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist,0.265460581
and immediately a big ball popped outof my wrist,0.230444193
and I couldnt move my fingers,0.296816915
so I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast,0.208592862
and it was it was it was interesting mainly in my my in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything,0.226427823
but ofcourse I couldnt work either,0.406438798
but it presented a challenge,0.43349731
I learned how to do things lefthanded,0.369966388
I hadta write lefthanded,0.432900697
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars,0.219775632
and that was in I think it was in May,0.266873509
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in ColumbiaPresbyterian with him with the cast on,0.222676963
we have these pictures,0.527487874
and I remember he had ke a little kindof like a scrape on the back of his head or just not not a ke a bloody thing but a a kindof like a wornout spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast,0.240748063
I dont actually remember doing physical therapy,0.383125275
once I had the cast off I think I was fine,0.293432474
and I regained all the strength in my wrist,0.270282835
I think six weeks,0.362549663
yes it was my dominant hand,0.289813906
yes I do,0.616899133
youknow my cousin Ann shes seventy one now,0.199285641
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six,0.315135181
and so shes lefthanded,0.287925959
and so she lost the use of her right side,0.286111057
her hand is all mangled and her foot also,0.299152881
and her communication skills are very limited,0.391757101
she its aphasia is what I think she has,0.290539265
and shes gotten progressively better over the years,0.301191956
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again,0.356475621
she useta always say,0.527553856
zoom zoom zoom zoom,1.000000238
and I always thought because she was in a car she was sitting in a her parked car when she had the stroke,0.284913331
and she doesnt say that anymore,0.316537321
but alot of the people where she lives thats her nickname Zoomzoom because she useta say that alot,0.264487177
but shes very challenging to communicate with,0.356037527
and Ill go see her and spend and hour or so,0.229486272
and we have lunch,0.386177272
and things and we try to communicate as well as best as we can with asking her simple questions,0.316551417
and she communicates in sortof a roundabout way,0.300634503
she has three children,0.383559942
and when she wants to talk about them she cant always get their names but shell say one two or three,0.243039817
and thats how we know because sometimes she brings alotof numbers in,0.280098706
so when she tries to tell you shes in pain shell take her good hand,0.250514448
and shell say,0.360808372
one two three four five pain,0.610544384
I dont know,0.538106382
I dont know,0.538106382
like that,0.719409466
she somehow its amazing how she communicates,0.36402908
I give her alotof credit,0.282566071
yeah,1
okay I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather,0.307742208
because he was the one of the most important people in my life when I was a child,0.294000268
and I was it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten,0.291439176
it was in July,0.327941775
and it was just a normal day,0.336608976
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street,0.250566274
and it was back in the day when there was alotof freedom,0.280432373
you you went out the door and came in for lunch,0.253707469
and then you went out the door,0.349359035
and there really werent very many parameters,0.371523827
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had,0.275428534
and came home to find out that he had had a,0.292697459
he they didnt use the word stroke but thats what he had,0.276253283
that he hadta go to the hospital from work,0.329499841
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home hell have these cookies,0.265549034
and then the next morning I remember waking up,0.34307313
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like,0.281429917
I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that you know he wasnt coming home and just as a child an innocent child kindof coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing,0.260505855
having that be my first experience with death,0.339603454
and youknow I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who is in the nursing home,0.215450093
she was around because she she kindof lived with us for awhile,0.307119995
and it was just she actually I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard,0.364621609
everyone went to the all the adults went to the funeral at night,0.312781662
I just remembered that,0.555420399
and I was hysterical crying,0.342366189
I was so so sad,0.444189519
and she didnt know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me,0.307732999
and it worked,0.409485877
she wasnt being mean,0.336669147
but I was beyond being consoled at that point,0.321288913
and I I felt very alone in my grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man whos my grandfather,0.254433841
but anyway that that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future,0.315481782
and I remember a time when I was in sixth grade,0.253135294
and we were having a sleepover in my friends back yard,0.26394099
happened to be with a a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to u leukemia a the other girl who lost her grandmother,0.228400901
and I had lost my grandfather,0.320896447
and we it was like they they could make a movie about the bond,0.307485551
we were all in the tent,0.338926822
and and we were just talking,0.411866695
I can see us all sitting there,0.379812479
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life,0.27041778
and we put it out there,0.36073035
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go,0.334878474
and we all just just let it out,0.453621089
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this,0.350057065
and its a good thing,0.388005018
so thats why I think this story is is so important to me was because its something that affected my life youknow as I grew up,0.258976847
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didnt know about angels then,0.274679929
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe,0.326340914
and he can sortof watch over me if you will,0.305049807
yeah one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball kicking the ball,0.245837718
and inadvertently it went through the window of his his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper,0.297262818
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp,0.305823773
and he stood up and looked out the window,0.299412668
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window,0.287754416
he kindof shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing,0.286388636
and he was going to go speak to his son about that,0.276266903
okay well Johnny was on his way to school,0.203014731
and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said,0.252301246
Johnny take your umbrella,0.291693717
and he said,0.372952074
nope mom,0.529892921
I dont think its going to rain today so I I dont wanna take it,0.327299625
so off he went without his umbrella,0.280727148
and sure enough it started to rain,0.350520939
and it it started to rain harder,0.376563251
and he got wet,0.27916342
so he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said,0.27714783
you were right mom,0.370240837
I needed my umbrella,0.380608439
then he took his umbrella and went off,0.301147342
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of taking her advice next time,0.25300011
its always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though,0.343007803
okay Sally and her dad were walking around the park one day,0.251451224
Sally was riding her tricycle,0.37658307
and as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree,0.252762854
and her dad she urged her dad to help the cat,0.263905227
and so he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree,0.262509286
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over,0.313902199
and some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the fire department,0.297048628
and sure enough the fire department came to help retrieve the dad from the tree and the cat,0.280876428
and at the end of the day every one was fine,0.308245093
once upon a time in a land far away there was a little girl named Cinderella,0.247202933
and she was brought to the home of a a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her,0.281830281
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters,0.377233952
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the the mom her stepmom,0.254963845
and they actually put her to work,0.41033569
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose,0.283659101
but Cinderella was happy nonetheless,0.384938776
and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends the mice and the birds and such,0.332624257
and she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella,0.334107965
and she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride,0.248647436
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom,0.358005494
and in her heart she thought,0.388134778
oh I would just love to go to that ball,0.320960909
and she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that ofcourse she wasnt going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella,0.252653867
and but the stepsisters were going to go,0.340430796
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball,0.315440297
and Cinderella was sad,0.266527593
she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said,0.278174132
well help you Cinderella,0.396716833
and they brought out some ribbon and some some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her,0.336566806
and she had the dress,0.367731005
but she had no way of getting to the ball,0.287984341
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared,0.30612734
and it was her fairy godmother,0.345524192
and her ir my,0.362520546
dont cry my child,0.349991381
I know you wanna go to the ball,0.321543932
and and I can help you,0.414138407
just fetch me a pumpkin,0.35850057
and Ill turn it into a coach,0.226022407
and your mice friends will be the coachmen,0.268343747
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the the coachmen,0.295748115
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world,0.266969442
and when she got there she approached the ball and looked down the stairs,0.314377069
and there everyone was dancing,0.397331685
and they saw her come in,0.314347386
they turned and looked at her,0.341588616
and the prince looked,0.444277704
and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen,0.312472612
he invited her to dance,0.365279317
and they just had a nice connection,0.351392627
and she engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing,0.365681142
and suddenly the time had gone by,0.313507736
and it was midnight,0.359069943
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight,0.247319996
so quick she ran from the castle,0.235593811
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper,0.216265082
and she found her way home,0.358997703
and,1
so he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them,0.277936816
and everyone tried on the slipper,0.330838978
and when he came to the house of the where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper,0.254199594
and it didnt quite work,0.329457134
but the Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs,0.272147
and the mice gave her the key,0.32173273
and she got out,0.346216977
she came down,0.413582981
and she said shed like to try on the slipper,0.240833953
and with that she tried on the slipper,0.323209018
and her fairy god,0.353794932
but as it was they she tried on the slipper,0.295839816
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted,0.420830607
and they got married,0.337132514
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
Id like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness,0.269704282
yes well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of glutenfree bread from the freezer,0.207598597
put them on a paper towel on the counter,0.311245561
Id get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon,0.239317179
and Id open up the peanut butter,0.23824513
and Id scoop out some peanut butter spread it on the bread,0.252593756
close the jar,0.384241998
Id use the spoon to get the jelly outof the jar,0.213029414
Id put it on the other slice of bread,0.220273286
put the jar the lid back on the jar,0.322097629
Id put the peanut butter and jelly back,0.241733417
Id put the lid,0.239036828
and I probably would not cut it in half,0.311762571
and I would take it to a table,0.338278204
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.304255307
I can remember when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing,0.239117682
I was swinging with a friend,0.311354429
and we were standing facing each other,0.420241773
and I hit my head,0.272536695
and I did have a concussion,0.319880247
and I remember feeling quite ill,0.369050026
and my mother was taking some nursing courses,0.341820866
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight,0.305931002
but I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache,0.312168092
and then I was fine,0.344589919
after a day or so,0.32289654
no I think just rest rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes,0.282359362
yes,0.999999881
all different people whove had,0.361251742
I think youknow Ive encountered people who stutter,0.331421584
and I will usually just try to let them finish,0.378690034
Im pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them,0.27851668
and Ive encountered people with aphasia,0.300622284
and Ill often do the same,0.303051978
unless they really look as though theyre struggling,0.428115427
and then occasionally Ill try to give them a cue,0.303792626
yeah so I would say thats the most that I can think of,0.299387038
and children with speech and language difficulties,0.486279249
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words,0.260474622
mhm I can remember when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas,0.235504821
it was a couple weeks,0.335691005
she had been in the hospital,0.382865846
and she had not been ill,0.359457314
but she was diabetic,0.427994847
and youknow periodically she would be in the hospital,0.2889615
and it was Christmas eve,0.261111379
and we got a call that she had passed away,0.265310168
and it was terrible,0.392322272
my dad was at work,0.252535224
and my mother hadta contact my dad,0.341186881
and it was a really very difficult time,0.415329158
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry,0.300314486
so it was really something that I think I really remember,0.539191782
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father,0.256031901
and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve,0.283634305
we put everything up then,0.436959684
and then we would get up,0.377606928
so my mother did have all of us do that,0.320591778
but I remember thinking how sad my mom was,0.34148252
and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers,0.294443905
and my dad didnt come home until very late,0.225800633
and then he was there ofcourse on Christmas morning when we got up,0.28077957
but it was a difficult Christmas,0.368435293
and I do remember that very vividly,0.336789846
yeah mhm,1
one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball,0.253198326
and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbors window,0.29613924
his neighbor was sitting watching television,0.35779646
and the ball came through knocked over his lamp and caused quite a and caused quite a loud noise,0.272407651
his neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off,0.258145332
one cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school,0.232369378
he said,0.528301835
I will not need the umbrella,0.349322826
however when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard,0.316973925
it rained and rained,0.515059948
he hadta run through the puddles,0.325267762
and he got wet,0.27916342
he tried to cover his head with his hands,0.34153381
when he got home his mother said,0.335085183
look at you,0.40619275
youre soaking wet,0.426527292
and he thought about having an umbrella,0.313569784
h and the next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson,0.261083156
one day a girl was riding her bicycle,0.305190861
and she saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard,0.218911394
she looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat,0.24023211
she went and got her dad who brought a ladder,0.255065888
he started to climb the tree,0.304712713
and the ladder fell,0.391115069
so now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree,0.226189971
someone called the fire department,0.39534241
and they were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad,0.310065567
Cinderellas mother passed away when she was a little girl,0.316609979
and her father was raising her,0.456657141
and he met a woman that he thought would be a good wife,0.29941377
and she had three daughters of her own,0.34204483
and they got married,0.337132514
and they lived together,0.481834143
but Cinderella was not treated fairly there,0.369844168
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores,0.284343183
and the stepsisters would say,0.36535272
Cinderella get my lunch,0.356431514
Cinderalla clean the laundry,0.494508892
Cinderella youknow do everything,0.34117645
so and the stepmother was not kind to Cinderella,0.304651797
and one day an invitation came that all of the unmarried women in young girls in the village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince,0.256719857
they needed to find a suitable wife for the prince,0.31763795
so Cinderella heard about it,0.363828301
and she dreamt of going,0.286455542
and she was a friend to the animals,0.340090513
she was a kind girl,0.40151751
and the mice and the animals helped her,0.421748996
and they made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night,0.30401656
but when it was time to come they said that she could not go,0.368970513
and the wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly,0.285545766
they were very very mean to her,0.380820304
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go,0.301388353
and they locked her away,0.396486044
but the mice came and they helped her,0.33560577
they got the keys,0.353046954
and they opened the door,0.381417692
and allofasudden the fairy godmother was there,0.368308991
and she helped Cinderella,0.350207388
and there was a beautiful dress for her,0.309761286
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen,0.251916409
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight,0.214971155
so Cinderella went,0.364514232
and she danced,0.467100143
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her,0.318411022
but then the clock struck twelve,0.378818184
and out Cinderella ran outof the ball,0.222617954
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes,0.249611169
and then she turned she turned back into Cinderella,0.36844334
and she made it back to the to the the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters,0.34126389
and a few days later some of the princes men came,0.295337588
and they had Cinderellas shoe,0.289873928
and they said we can try this on,0.324004382
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince,0.27117902
and all of the stepsisters tried it on,0.313287854
and Cinderella I I believe she was she was locked away then too because they had noticed they knew the stepmothers m,0.283791661
they realized,0.742986917
so I think they had locked her away at that point aswell,0.305303305
and they helped her get out,0.351842999
and she tried on the shoe,0.287743539
and sure enough it fit,0.436737835
and she was able to see the prince,0.301300049
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
aw,0.99999994
youre welcome,0.436786056
well first you would get out your bread and you and a knife,0.305673271
and you would open your peanut butter and spread some peanut butter on the bread,0.324621469
and then you would get I would get a clean knife,0.338809758
I dont mix my peanut butter and jelly,0.278861493
and I would open the jelly and spread the jelly on top of that,0.270129323
put another piece of bread on top,0.284200847
cut it in half,0.335750401
my mother said if you cut it in half its a little extra love in that sandwich,0.226906687
so we would always cut that in half aswell,0.316388458
I remember,0.696829081
I was playing on the swings with a friend,0.276407838
and we were swinging,0.379122674
and I fell,0.314124942
and I did come down right on the back of my head,0.277546376
and I got a concussion,0.294901103
and my parents took me to the hospital,0.290395975
and they were very concerned,0.484335363
and I was very sick to my stomach,0.270089149
and they were going to keep me overnight at the hospital,0.308168262
but my mother hadta get home,0.392651975
she had three other children at home,0.324477375
my dad worked in the evenings then,0.263134181
and she had promised that she would wake me up every hour,0.286147118
so I do remember that,0.520371675
and the next day remember resting on the couch in our living room and getting all kinds of visitors,0.306337297
and yes the neighborhood children were all coming in,0.320033371
and yeah it was a day or two until I felt better,0.214271754
no,0.99999994
yeah I just remember my mother having to wake me up every hour or so even through the night and being extremely tired and wanting to sleep but her continuously waking me up,0.285690218
Im sure she didnt yep,0.260972142
I have,0.647408724
some that I think of are talking with people who had difficulty with maybe disfluent speech,0.321059436
they were stutterers,0.633824289
and really trying hard not to finish their words for them or their statements,0.367991358
and th also patients with aphasia,0.355485886
just really sitting and giving them additional response time,0.445832253
and also working with children with difficulty with language and with articulation,0.536822021
and mostly with them just modeling correct production for them,0.423880607
mhm,0
I guess that was an important day in my life,0.249056756
and I remember I was student teaching as a speech language pathologist,0.29063338
I was working hard,0.360435754
back then we didnt have SuperDuper speech company so we hadta make everything,0.331867814
and I had contact paper that I was laminating pictures with,0.295770049
and my husband,0.415728122
now hes my husband but then he was my boyfriend,0.325242937
had called and said,0.428063005
oh lets go over to the park,0.206436202
lets do this,0.483345628
and he was acting kindof funny,0.320616364
and I thought,0.462097377
I dont really have time for this,0.371074796
and even when he came to the house he was acting kindof funny,0.303065926
and I said,0.329179674

and he wasnt being very careful,0.305026442
and he went to kick the ball to his friend,0.287978977
but he kicked it through a window his neighbors window,0.303842008
his neighbor had been sitting there watching television and was very alarmed and upset that the ball came through the window,0.298271447
when the neighbor looked to see who had kicked the ball the boy had run off,0.255814224
youre welcome,0.436786056

one cloudy day a mom was encouraging her son to take his umbrella to school with him,0.224819198
she warned him a second time before he left,0.342042863
but he said,0.471670747
no I dont need it,0.410349101
I guess hoping that it wouldnt rain,0.389064789
but sure enough it did rain that day,0.422984898
it rained on the way to school and on the way home from school,0.310668737
when the boy got home he was soaking wet,0.261666954
and his mother looked at him and said,0.319030404
I had told you that you should bring your umbrella today,0.344958335
and then from then on he carried his umbrella and learned a lesson,0.299620181
okay one beautiful day a cat ran outside,0.2478569
and a dog chased it up the tree,0.266042531
a little girl was riding her tricycle and saw that it was her cat stuck on a branch in the tree,0.23292464
she ran and got her father who got a ladder and tried to help her retrieve the cat,0.234989852
but the ladder slipped off of the tree,0.327720821
now both the dad and the cat were stuck in the tree,0.261576772
the mom called the fire department,0.343945146
and they came,0.464633346
they were going to help both the dad and the cat get down from the tree,0.26961875
and everyone would be happy,0.406999499
sure,0.999999881
Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away,0.287853748
and her father married a wicked woman,0.368376523
she had two daughters of her own,0.332971036
and they maltreated Cinderella,0.40155986
she hadta clean the floor,0.389121175
she hadta bring them breakfast,0.415856391
she hadta make their dresses,0.414201379
and one day where they lived an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land,0.293822616
and all of the unmarried women in the in the area were invited to the ball,0.335322857
and the two stepsisters were going to go,0.31773448
and Cinderella helped them get ready,0.318086684
and she on her own made her own dress with the help actually with the help of the animals,0.322770447
she was very kind to animals,0.364642769
and then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her,0.360020429
and they were evil,0.438291907
and they ripped her dress and tore her dress,0.327414513
and they told her she couldnt go,0.272080183
and she cried and cried,0.427733064
and they left,0.478788704
and she cried,0.426966757
and then allofasudden a fairy godmother appeared,0.348589361
and she told Cinderella,0.294098854
I can help you get to the ball,0.34486261
and she used her magic wand and made a beautiful dress,0.298991799
and she turned the pumpkins into a coach,0.251657009
and she had coachmen come,0.312386096
and Cinderella got to go to the ball,0.254194736
and sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did fall in love with her,0.271199048
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that Cinderella hadta be home at midnight,0.22716336
that if she was not home when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form,0.310227096
so Cinderella was at the ball having such a wonderful time,0.245298684
and it was getting closer and closer,0.392261028
and she didnt realize,0.308401614
and allofasudden the clock struck,0.431802988
and she ran outof the ball,0.22511363
and as she ran down the steps she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers,0.208812684
and the prince found it,0.402581334
and that was all that was left of Cinderella,0.315387219
so the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him,0.273017883
and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella,0.262182444
so the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away,0.325057179
and they tried on the the glass slipper,0.334676236
but it didnt fit either of them,0.320674896
and the mice snuck the key under the door to Cinderella,0.276044756
and she was able to get out just in time sothat she could try on the glass slipper,0.250405848
and sure enough it fit,0.436737835
and the princes servants brought her back to the castle,0.402318776
and she and the prince lived happily ever after,0.349179417
youre welcome,0.436786056
okay so first I would have two slices of bread,0.256874204
and then I would have a knife,0.340387613
and I would spread the an I would open the jar of peanut butter and get some peanut butter on my knife and spread it on the one slice of the bread,0.237837493
then I would use another knife,0.380403697
then I would,0.57782948
and then I would put the second slice of bread on top,0.253848821
and then I would cut the sandwich in two,0.278991312
okay,0.99999994
I remember hurting my back about five or six years ago,0.243105009
and I really didnt do anything to hurt my back,0.329300106
I just kindof moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back,0.270122886
and it was weeks of going to the doctor going finally just having physical therapy to to fix it,0.313017964
but it all worked out,0.392946839
yeah,1
it was alotof exercises,0.322707117
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield,0.265573949
and they had me lift weights and do different exercises stretching mostly stretching my back,0.31449455
and they used some kind of electronic ke stimulation therapy,0.327704012
and that really helped,0.540695667
it was the big part,0.356165349
yeah,1
not really,0.792273641
Imean a little bit here and there,0.419058353
youknow Ive know people who have had strokes and,0.285112977
I think alotof it was sortof just waiting them out,0.368815154
sometimes they just couldnt get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign sortof a sign language where they kindof point to what theyre looking for or what they need,0.328043073
that was mostly,0.529558182
kinda what did it,0.515868068
I guess Ill tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace,0.253102183
it was a long haul,0.318140894
it was alot youknow alotof discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it,0.199950323
and we probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents,0.309259713
and at one point I would be kindof more wanting to do it,0.307749987
and Eileen would be busy,0.223754317
her parents were ill,0.431467116
and we were trying to take care of them,0.320199132
and then it would swap,0.390516311
I was busy at work,0.285422713
and she was more interested in talking about it,0.31852293
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kindof we were on the same page at the same time,0.256464362
and we made this decision n to to that we should look possibly look at foster care,0.303298116
and we looked into it closely,0.340595186
and it just wasnt going to work right for us,0.304799736
and then we decided to to adopt,0.453673571
and we identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family,0.262846828
and we looked into all of her medical records and things,0.315503955
and then we traveled to China,0.370730698
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that,0.340932637
and then we v then we went to China,0.301100731
and actually the adoption occurred there in China,0.439207613

and he he took the umbrella,0.324663877
and off he went again to school,0.321041971

and the cat ran up the tree,0.275431991

and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air,0.259157181
and the while once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too,0.284186929
so they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree,0.301967531
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall outof the tree,0.242834389
okay there was a little girl named Cinderella,0.262017965
and her mother died,0.461211145
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own,0.285014451
and the new mother the stepmother didnt really care for Cinderella that much,0.287665933
she was more concerned about her two daughters,0.325228125
and then as they grew up the the she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her,0.275391668
and one day there was a an invitation to a a big ball to meet the prince because the prince was looking for a wife,0.273895472
and his father was having a big party a big ball to so he could meet all the eligible women in the in the kingdom,0.259209365

but she was too busy,0.379638314
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for everybody else because they all hadta have their clothes made cleaned and ready to go,0.313046068
so she in she started to get everybodys everybody elses clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball,0.298223883

and they tore up her dress,0.286491781
and she was she thought shed never get to the ball,0.304040462
and then she met her her fairy godmother,0.385793269
she went out in the yard and was crying,0.262838989
and the fairy godmother came,0.379058033
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the the mice into horseses,0.286649048
but told her that she needed to be home by d leave by twelve oclock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point,0.208681986
so she went off to the ball,0.287642121
and she met the prince,0.353252947
and they fell in love,0.312526941
and allofasudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight,0.312902451
so she hadta run out,0.39613235
and she ran down the steps of the the castle,0.328103065
and left the prince,0.460460722
and she lost her shoe on the way,0.268743157
so the prince thought he would never see his this girl again,0.364193559
and so the next day the father and the and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on,0.290219665
and that was Cinderella,0.372282445
so then she married the prince and lived happily ever after,0.321099013
I would take the bread,0.354710162
and I would spread the peanut butter open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread,0.304501474
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter,0.283849299
and then put another piece of bread on top of it,0.275559366
alright back when I was in high school I broke my collar bone in physical education class,0.219775274
I was a senior in high school,0.258511961
and I was playing third base in gym class,0.237317875
we we were playing softball,0.36913231
and I was playing third base,0.279869437
and it was a ground ball,0.364498883
I kindof moved over toward the short stop,0.274706781
and the short stop charged in to get it and ran into me and kindof hit my shoulder and snapped my collar bone,0.211850107
and it was in the springtime,0.398424268
so it was I youknow they hadta Id never broken a bone,0.300463468
they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me,0.324756801
and take then I we the field was about half a mile from the school,0.257312715
so I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm,0.284347385
and and they said my arm was broken,0.262779146
and they put this harness on me that kindof pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight,0.326593995
and so I got to wear that for my prom and for graduation,0.264828712
and there was a miserable injury,0.353113055
Ill say that,0.343165964
no really you just its a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and youknow meet up when while they heal,0.296377331
and otherwise its just limited activity for awhile,0.417755067
right around the funnest time of the year,0.381825417
yeah it did,0.5155074
yeah I go I distribute communion in the nursing home once a month,0.212274358
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making alotof sense and some are not so communicative,0.353464782
and youknow you end up youknow using my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to youknow coax them into talking to you communicating with you,0.273247719
and youknow you do alotof different things ke make youknow with trying to make facial expressions and trying to youknow to just kindof jar them back to the present so they can determine whether theyre even ready to take communion,0.283042222
but youknow thats kindof its alotof its alot more alot less verbal and alot more youknow trying to make a personal connection with them,0.243991747
when,0.999999881
Ill talk about my other daughter,0.261591136
when Erin was born and we it was a little postdated the energy s,0.192938507
and she was a little bit late so they decided she would they would induce her,0.332072437
and she we went to the hospital,0.319472015
it was all planned,0.379147887
it was only going to be a couple of hours,0.265199274
and it ended up being ofcourse like thirteen hours,0.272834688
but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileens parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby,0.268964946
and it was the first my parents first grandchild so a really exciting time,0.315990478
and I have three brothers,0.359545052
so it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl,0.296837032
so youknow it was the whole thing was just that being that we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done,0.314389527
and a little but it made it so exciting because we knew our an that the grandparents could be there,0.342771709
and we could be youknow it could be exciting for everybody,0.325808704
yes it was,0.434191704
so the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air,0.260092258
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard,0.354539365
and it goes through the window of the house,0.359716296
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over,0.306717038
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily,0.25943467
and Im sure hes on the other end running from his father,0.216721386
the little boy is getting ready to go to school,0.282837749
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and because its sposta rain,0.301749587
and he tells her he doesnt need it,0.26929003
and he walks out the door,0.317209035
and youknow he just barely gets away from the house,0.278389513
and it starts really raining hard,0.435231358
so he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her,0.257124513
you know what you were right,0.504714429
I needed the umbrella after all,0.313305706
the little girls cat climbed up the tree,0.28013742
it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog,0.264464915
and she so the cat got stuck in the tree,0.234773859
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out,0.270265609
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell,0.246421397
so then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father and get the barking dog away from the tree,0.307924211
so once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone,0.310997754
and the father met a a woman and decided to get married,0.284586579
and this woman had two daughters,0.337632716
and the so the they became a family,0.383413345
and quickly the new mother who became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters,0.282844454
so she they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the stepmother and the two the stepmothers two daughters,0.295658916
and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody,0.261841118
and then one day there was going to be a ball,0.30005759
the king was going to have a a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife,0.26742661
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party,0.299394965
and Cinderella wanted to go,0.303567857
but her ep her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody elses needs were taken care of first eryb her the two sisters dresses were ready and everything else,0.229276419
so Cinderella got it all ready,0.351697534
and in the meantime her the mice sewed a a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear,0.244372189
so after she got all of everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself,0.264017999
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs,0.301457465
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her,0.273717195
so she thought she wouldnt be able to go to the ball,0.287678689
and then she met her she ran out into the back garden of the castle,0.273954988
and she met her fairy godmother,0.361698061
and the fairy godmother told her that youre going to go to the ball,0.265529841
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach,0.257300198
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown,0.256989956
and she put the she turned the mice into the horses,0.31474486
and she went off to the ball,0.300344765
and the but there was one stipulation is that she hadta be home she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was,0.281260669
so she went to the ball,0.295837134
and she met the prince,0.353252947
and they fell in love,0.312526941
and then the allofasudden she heard the clock strike twelve,0.330070108
and she immediately tried ran outof the ball hadta get outof there before she turned back into Cinderella,0.227760106
and she lost her shoe on the step of the of the palace,0.29129678
but there was nothing she could do,0.415016025
she just kept running,0.435841501
and the next day the kings minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe,0.258643448
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldnt fit into it,0.239376858
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe,0.269133389
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after,0.329330564
I would put the bread down,0.320598006
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread,0.281622708
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter,0.260731548
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it,0.257348806
the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast my right breast,0.252329826
and our son Joseph had just been born a year ago a year before the the diagnosis or the concern anyway,0.201419041
and so I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him,0.28707096
but there was surgery required,0.403550744
and there was a waiting period,0.385662168
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on not on me sothat I could get back to taking care of him,0.279485703
as it turned out everything was fine,0.311705112
the lump was removed,0.377150893
it was benign,0.444548726
and everything was alright,0.444336027
so but it was a scare for awhile,0.33646524
and important that I kept the priorities that I thought was were important,0.367220044
there was very little recovery,0.458133936
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasnt too sure whether they had removed the breast or not when I first woke up from the anesthesia,0.240585178
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright,0.320404738
and I was so busy,0.301412314
I dont recall anything special otherthan a dressing and keeping up with whatever medications whatever they told me to do,0.277886868
but I nothing was was bothering me after it was over,0.350217491
yeah,1
mhm,0
I useta teach English as a second language,0.285883486
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation exercises that we did,0.264903188
I always tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew,0.313881308
but yeah theres difficulty when someone is not fluent in in your language,0.287569135
sometimes with elderly,0.53505373
I took care of my mom and my dad as they were really in advanced years,0.197528735
nineties,0.999999881
and sometimes my father would go back to Italian,0.299824148
it was a place of comfort I think especially as he was maybe dying,0.273661196
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow,0.362242937
all I al but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking,0.28427729
but it was memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another,0.311751068
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too,0.332787067
but I was very interested in where he was going with with the Italian at the end,0.283711046
with my mom she was more more grounded,0.270520031
sometime it was hearing it was her hearing problem,0.404840499
was alotof shouting going on,0.266845047
so its sometimes for me its that,0.370154023
its like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive,0.322776198
yeah,1
youre welcome,0.436786056
oh Ive had so many happy things,0.323225886
oh whats happy,0.37286526
Im sure the happiest day was the day Joseph was born,0.175345242
we were in EastOrangeGeneral hospital,0.366005361
I had a wonderful doctor,0.347911835
my husband Joe who had alittle too much background in language problems that can occur with babies and children made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food,0.244329751
whatever the heck his he worried about my doctor removed from the diet,0.245128721
so when it was time for Joseph to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural,0.256120145
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes,0.304608852
so when the day come came I for Josephs birth I was one lesson short of the full of the full course I guess of childbirth preparation,0.222059444
so I was going fine without any medication,0.322276503
it was just taking awhile,0.419356734
and then I said to them,0.381646037
this is all I know,0.418020487
I dont know any more,0.404663771
so they were laughing,0.497768849
and they said,0.43198812
well take over,0.467914373
and they just pushed my head from the pillow and said,0.294118702
lets line up the mirror correctly,0.338408351
everything was going fine,0.415650308
still no medications,0.502066493
everything was going fine,0.415650308
DoctorSobol my doctor said,0.40158391
Firstname this is going on,0.329907924
I wanna get home for supper,0.307445824
I said,0.525946558
Ill get you home in time,0.286682397
so it was a little bit longer but at five twenty on December ninth ninety sixty nine Joseph was born,0.193084031
no medications,0.556884825
no nothing,0.755602241
I was on a high,0.274132967
I can Ive never been on such a high,0.244153887
but it was it was such a happy day,0.31809175
and everything was fine,0.389701724
it was the way Joe had hoped without any interference,0.279066563
he got a really nice Apgar score,0.265205681
yes he was a ten right off the bat,0.236169294
so I said,0.480681747
well did my job,0.364301085
now comes the scary part,0.354781568
raise the kid,0.325081736
so happiest day,0.535635412
for sure,0.576099992
mhm,0
once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball,0.225136504
and not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair,0.256892741
and shocked outof his ennui he looks out the window and with ball in hand has judged correctly that hes going to hafta go outside and speak to little Ned,0.191291451
well I think this is my daughter inlaw Tanya,0.246867999
and this is Nick,0.27279979
and Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him to school that day,0.217873931
and as hes waving goodbye he is reassuring my daughter inlaw that he surely doesnt need an umbrella independent little soul that he is,0.199517876
within the first block on the way to school he it begins to rain,0.287892491
as hes sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he understands what his mom was trying to say after all,0.222431943
a bit reluctantly he has returned home and just hasta stand there sopping wet while my daughter inlaw tries very hard not to say,0.206981346
I told you so,0.502021849
but he he happily accepts an umbrella and returns to school in the opposite direction it looks like,0.252793878
returns to school,0.466894954
umbrella,1.000000119
and dry,0.54901427
and happy,0.508799553
enough,0.99999994
well this is little Mary little MaryBoyle who has noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree,0.232752189
and and has called the only person she knows who can rescue Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household,0.255278677
and that is her dad,0.309647948
he has gone to help her climbs the tree,0.24214302
but the ladder has gotten away from him,0.279180706
is falling,0.548015356
as if things arent noisy enough the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark,0.228779122
and so now the neighbors I guess have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue in this order dad Fluffernutter,0.27074331
and theyre not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because hes the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with,0.272518486
there you go,0.571465254
youre welcome,0.436786056
there was a a widower with a daughter whose name was Cinderella who had remarried a a mean woman,0.283842802
he didnt know that at the time but thats what marriage reveals over time,0.272100568
she had two two daughters,0.437847137
and so his stepdaughters were part of the household that Cinderella and her father had enjoyed,0.30396992
but things changed once they all arrived together,0.4195292
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude,0.292048454
the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way,0.333239079
she performed servile tasks,0.366202116
at one point an invitation comes to a ball,0.259504646
and theyre considering happily going,0.385680854
Cinderellas face is lighting up,0.273262709
but she doesnt realize whats going on,0.290848255
the ball was held because the the King decided that his son it was time for the son to marry,0.27449882
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town,0.248796061
well Cinderella would love to go,0.292116076
and it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and the stepmother and the and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves,0.34193024
so they prepared had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy,0.247225747
but she was there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family,0.260585546
well theres a book in the picture and the picture book I dont remember at all,0.22419174
she discovers a book,0.389888912
I dont know if thats where she comes across an incantation,0.224906847
but a fairy godmother appears,0.408320934
and because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her,0.265259027
fairy godmother helps her,0.397959352
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too,0.28570506
and as as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball Im going to just remember that she dances with the handsome prince,0.232523814
and at as she runs back tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair,0.236635819
I didnt see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though,0.255878121
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight,0.323521972
but she hadta get outof there by midnight,0.247545347
and she does,0.385054022
but then theres the there is the return of the slipper the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night,0.309077144
but as I said the book seems a little bit different,0.2781398
theres a key,0.382818818
and I guess when she lets everyone in finally,0.299802393
where is he,0.392332703
why is the key there,0.372001529
I dont remember that part,0.359144092
but as I just remember the story ends happily,0.325880021
that he does find her and the slipper,0.303105652
and theyre reunited,0.37146616
and so happily ever after,0.383072764
uhhuh,0
well I would keep all my ingredients at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly,0.277665764
lay the bread down,0.375984877
get a nice butter knife,0.362285048
and I begin with spreading a a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the the well around all four sides sothat when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesnt actually go over the side,0.243909091
it just stays within the the borders,0.416502476
I useta like mine folded over,0.334389448
I think I I like it just the one slice,0.435601801
so it just looks really kindof beautiful with a little wall a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle,0.313086867
okay,0.99999994
youre welcome,0.436786056
the the most the most memorable event was,0.488057524
it but I think I did tell you about it,0.495319396
the the yeah,0.475758076
it was about the the possible scare,0.367705405
it was just a lump in in my breast,0.268152416
and that Im Im pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of of our son to think about,0.240567029
and I didnt think because of my age or the the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything more than precaution to do the the procedure,0.285855442
but as close as I came was youknow the the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and and caring,0.295300812
and I I felt supported the whole the whole time,0.348212361
just that I I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasnt sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so the dressings and bandage were so tight,0.266444504
but I just remember thinking the the theyll be Ill do whatever I hafta do on it,0.276715398
and whatevers next Ill find out about and take care of,0.259948224
so its a moving progression,0.406516582
I dont usually write the end of a story if its something like that,0.261473447
if you tell me Ill say,0.406354547
oh well go through it step by step,0.240007833
and well get there,0.464769363
it was like that,0.454540551
so Im fortunate that it hasnt been anything worse than that,0.315041572
just I can only remember being busy because with with a toddler,0.310818076
he was a year old then,0.334436327
and and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another,0.367195636
it was nothing short of show up for a doctors appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done,0.262374103
so I didnt think about,0.431951165
I knew I had it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright,0.268870324
so it wasnt much to do except youknow just take care of of the healing part and cooperate,0.236331254
but I was sure everything was going to be alright,0.361261398
something important,0.730375767
well I think I think oddly enough of of meeting and and continuing a a life with Joe,0.242140576
it was Im sure the most important thing that ever happened,0.319556981
the most memorable day was the day our son was born,0.249231026
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how how interesting that all was,0.311676323
we were students at MontclairState,0.353397727
and in those days freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus,0.250343859
we hadta sing the the almamater,0.490679413
but the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at at LifeHall,0.268813521
and he noticed the sign and said something about,0.31978333
I think I had part of it was covered,0.277879536
and he said,0.372952074
are you a a speech major,0.316146016
I said,0.525946558
no English,0.481226474
and I I unveiled the the words English,0.264283091
but he was a senior,0.375440747
and I was a freshman,0.295858234
and so I got to meet one of the youknow the upperclassmen got his signature,0.23183994
and then later we just had it was an easy conversation,0.304140061
we just we talked alittle,0.558690786
he he continued when I whenever I saw him to say hi,0.303634763
and I people would tell me,0.357101798
hes a BMOC,0.357710034
youknow hes a he was a a vice president of student government,0.245238125
and I said,0.329179674
ohmygoodness,0
but the more we hadta talk about,0.390224993
I was a student leader in my high school,0.238442242
and I thought when he when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee,0.291707695
but it turned out that he we he was interested,0.368336827
so our first date I think was the,0.283928752
it was something like the KingstonTrio or something like that,0.430841178
some folk group,0.4985964
it was really nice,0.44395721
they were on campus,0.390626431
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come,0.287873477
that was one of his duties,0.354716063
but when I just think of how all that unfolded just,0.438954622
I knew I I was gonna finish school,0.321007103
and so we we paced ourselves I guess youknow to to be logical about things,0.315182775
get to know each other no surprises along the way,0.320609599
because you have time with a person and you you see them in all the seasons and all,0.355005383
but I think when it finally came to to getting married I dont think there was a formal,0.298714429
we we people ask us but this was not even a formal proposal,0.342208177
I think everyone around us assumed we would marry,0.368212372
so we did,0.567811728
and so I I wasnt engaged,0.295691282
youknow I we I was pinned,0.380504698
and someone said to me the next day,0.279066265
youknow youre youre engaged to be engaged,0.299886972
I said,0.525946558
no Im not,0.328473717
and they said,0.43198812
well thats what that means,0.474365383
and I said,0.329179674
oh I thought it meant sortof going steady college style,0.333951712
they said,0.538892329
no youre engaged to be engaged,0.305492431
I said,0.525946558
well we have some time to go before,0.379706591
I said,0.525946558
it means what it means to the individual couple too,0.402525187
so I tried to assert myself,0.415842414
but I guess they might have been right,0.473137736
but I dont I dont care,0.436275393
it didnt mean anything,0.479065746
but that it when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross Imean thats thats probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married,0.292806834
and all that happened at once,0.37841481
it all converged,0.508480489
its alright that weve done this before,0.36009568
okay same story,0.38918221
now was it little Ned,0.305064648
no this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself,0.216083869
and the trajectory is off,0.377619237
it goes right through a window,0.373274475
and we hear the crash,0.290274739
and the lamp has gone over,0.301789254
and and Im assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody whos startled that this intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture,0.22766763
and he says,0.357835323
I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard,0.22169669
okay,0.99999994
its still raining,0.537264705
okay in the first picture its about to rain,0.252039403
mom is telling little sweetie,0.380023271
take your umbrella with you because I think its going to rain today,0.311291069
and the little little Sammy this time says,0.322981894
no no no no no I dont need it Im a big kid,0.30738309
and as he says goodbye his mom is just offering it one more time,0.231034026
he says,0.504161835
solong,0
see you later,0.38965556
but as he steps out the door wouldnt you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall,0.224341944
and as hes getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says,0.237648457
oh drat,0.719177246
and when he back gets back home and looks at mom I think shes restraining the,0.246844783
I told you,0.531163752
and hes looking a bit sheepish little Sammy,0.231771871
but hes out in in the last frame,0.267529726
but hes still going in the opposite direction here,0.32857129
okay,0.99999994
were in a time warp youknow,0.217554927
you guys have not moved forward from last last week,0.27403605
okay,0.99999994
groundhog day,0.595809221
no this is cat up in a tree day,0.224098161
ohmygoodness mygoodness,0
this is little sweet Sue,0.305989981
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree,0.247015953
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb,0.239971921
the ladder that he must have taken to to get to to the cat has fallen,0.299315751
so hes stranded,0.294934839
and little Fido is barking and saying,0.341979206
what the heck are you doing up there,0.340646148
but thankfully the the firemen are on their way,0.374227196
kindly neighbors must have called and said,0.333074659
help help help,1.000000238
and so theyre rushing along with the ladder,0.325988144
they will rescue him shortly,0.386925042
and I think theyll get dad down before they get the cat down,0.277552634
I think thats the priority,0.359312892
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world,0.299333662
its all going to work out just fine,0.366405249
alright I think last time it was a combination aswell,0.306894273
what once upon a time there was a a family where the there was a widow,0.328040481
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to a woman he had met,0.296826929
but the woman had two daughters of her own,0.314982861
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after the woman and her daughter the became the stepmother and the stepsisters and joined the the household of Cinderella and her dad,0.331675172
Im assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again,0.20987986
and she must deal with the family her new family,0.341203809
and theyre not very kind,0.403298199
theres theyre mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother,0.266747445
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of Cinderella at every option,0.251235336
and so she did the rv chores and she was treated badly,0.251284957
simultaneously there is another father and a and a b and a offspring a prince this time,0.384516418
and the father is a king,0.415756077
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son,0.3262254
and I assume that its time for him to be married,0.280906171
and so the prince a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful maidens who are available,0.251297235
an invitation goes out to Cinderellas stepmother to the household,0.267684489
and everyone is smiling,0.414303958
and Cinderella I guess assumes that she might be able to go,0.276833087
but this is not going to happen,0.453355908
this the the book,0.565089226
and I dont know whats going on with that little book yet,0.261401892
but she I maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house,0.289229453
the little animals or begin to help out,0.35084188
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready,0.265760213
and Cinderella now knows that with the help of her godmother she will get to go,0.254959762
there is a little admonition from after shes dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably,0.241486013
be sure youre home by midnight,0.273893118
and then it switches to the to the ball,0.433490604
and I and the prince sees and falls in love with at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty,0.25191772
when he could see all that,0.431320131
so they dance and dance,0.478793979
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase,0.251533359
I guess the the the right hand man the the first secretary first VP of the king is running after her to say,0.279536754
wait a second,0.420145392
wait a second,0.420145392
but she runs back to the to to home,0.375318527
and then comes the search for who matches the slipper,0.317861855
and its he in your little booklet the first vice president then who comes to the door,0.254549503
and theres a funny little picture of somebody tripping and a cushion,0.289443076
but I dont remember any of that from my stories or my film memory,0.233266056
but apparently there the key there was a key there that still doesnt mean anything much to me,0.339240998
they must have let him in,0.354746133
the the match is made when she tries on the slipper,0.280995667
and so I I suppose the the fella,0.341090024
xxx weve got our girl,0.306529284
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot,0.276422411
and I dont know why I thought it was direct,0.307766616
but he could afford to hire help to do that so so the help took care of it,0.300902396
anyway its a happy ending,0.33022058
they they get back together again,0.539558172
and Im sure its the prince and his sweet Cinderella and p life is happy from then on happily ever after,0.20321691
ERROR,1

the knife butter knife,0.492231488
we open up the peanut butter first,0.290178955
and we spread a a thinnish layer in the middle because were gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges,0.275097042
all four edges will have a slightly raised perimeter,0.303259671
were going to put red raspberry jelly,0.272560626
open that cap up,0.383766413
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesnt cross over the walls so it doesnt hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your your hand as youre enjoying,0.235462338
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich,0.323168844
if you like you can fold it over which was the way alotof people in my neighborhood did it,0.25567317
but I think thats it,0.469734192
thats how well do it,0.387460351
mhm,0
well I recently had Hodgkins disease,0.29107976
was diagnosed I guess about three months after I retired,0.271473676
I spent several months in chemotherapy,0.277247787
but i prior to that before the chemotherapy started I had an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks,0.247950241
that was was a StevensJohnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no no burning to my skin,0.269907385
it was all a result of the allergic reaction,0.324612945
and that stopped the chemo,0.455511004
I had one round of chemo,0.286893308
and then the allergic reaction took place to the dica not the chemo medication but to a medication thats designed to protect kidney function,0.342087567
so I was in the hospital for three weeks,0.253480196
that resolved,0.745923877
I started chemo again,0.445359439
and I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since,0.285909295
so my hair came back,0.360847175
my weight came back,0.377906442
and I hafta watch it now because its its back more than it has been,0.264333844
but it was its been quite a year and a half or so,0.289191574
well I had married my wife about forty eight years ago,0.253679335
and it was,0.414238811
sorry guys,0.676196158
pretty much her her doing plus my oncologist ofcourse,0.293941885
so it was youknow it I had chemo every two weeks,0.284385234
and the oncologist was just great,0.356364876
and and Firstname was quite a support,0.352004111
sorry,0.99999994
and I I didnt do much else because it was youknow the chemo and and eating as best as I could and resting as as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasnt too hard,0.252561301
so that was it youknow following doctors orders as they say and my wifes orders,0.246400565
so,0.99999994
a story,0.598745942
well this being SaintJosephs day in the RomanCatholic calendar and since my sons name is Joseph aswellas my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday,0.177628741
that I do know the day of the week in December December ninth,0.208363205
and it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that that we found out that we were pregnant that my wife was pregnant,0.300847828
hes our only child,0.312194258
so his his the announcement of the fact that he was that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess are happy memories prompted by as I said today because of of the of SaintJosephs day,0.226032972
about the about SaintJosephs day,0.492625535
its a its a feast day in in the in the RomanCatholic calendar that comes just after SaintPatricks day which I think overshadows overshadows it,0.282087475
and its as the Irish celebrate SaintPatricks I think SaintJosephs day is mostly celebrated by the ItalianAmericans and by Italians,0.259222806
and theres a special pastry that is consumed,0.342537552
and its called a Zeppole or the the donut of SaintJoseph,0.366117746
its quite rich creamy fattening cholesterol laden but quite delicious,0.359447718
if you if you meant my sons birthdate we prepared for childbirth,0.325535655
I was to be a coach,0.277593344
it was very early in the time when the socalled painless childbirth developed or Lamaze,0.25983122
but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didnt allow fathers in the waiting,0.223854885
so eventhough we prepared we prepared for the day of birth going to childbirth classes Lamaze classes,0.295154601
when it when,0.7662251
pun intended,0.493085653
when push came to shove I couldnt go into the waiting,0.246637791
so I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days,0.277587771
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery,0.277885526
and and I we did use some of the coaching,0.312560648
so it and and she did employ some of the techniques that were taught to her,0.319282144
so yeah so that was that was the day of his birth,0.274723172

Cinderella is a young girl who whose mother died,0.30282715
and shes brought by her father to live with I I think a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderellas age,0.210065961
father meant well,0.500932455
but the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully,0.314200014
she became their maid essentially and hadta clean the house take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella do the cooking do the washing while they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to to please themselves,0.270681083
one day the prince,0.455198467
they they lived in a in a principality,0.375628591
the prince whose father wanted him to marry was asked to or was told that there would be a ball held at which many of the or all of the single women in the principality would would be invited,0.247050285
and the idea would be that he would the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife,0.320210278
the three Cinderellas three stepsisters prepare for the ball,0.319508553
the mother their mothers very excited,0.423212379
and ofcourse Cinderella is excluded,0.321041822
she cannot go to the ball,0.286369205
and so shes left at home alone while the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball,0.256595224
shes visited by her fairy godmother who grants her her wish of attending the ball,0.23354432
because Cinderella says,0.403844118
how am I gonna get there,0.322369367
what am I gonna wear,0.32194677
so the h fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her outof magic takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach,0.194605902
mice become the horses,0.38889873
I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too,0.219368041
I forget which animal becomes the coachman,0.245245442
they take her to the ball,0.361266404
shes not really recognized by her stepsisters and and the stepmother,0.32474941
but they the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight,0.290729225
otherwise or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was,0.315163612
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera,0.25161764
so she promises to return at midnight,0.320267767
but shes having so much fun that shes still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight,0.24429588
so she panics,0.505024374
rightly so,0.680858016
runs gets back in the coach and is taken home,0.240476549
but one of her slippers glass slippers that was part of what the fairy godmother made for her is left behind,0.227688015
and the prince at at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and wanted to to know who she was,0.240608931
because she was going to be the one,0.357194901
and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind,0.286203355
so he has all of the young ladies in the nici in the principality try the slipper on,0.265125513
it their its brought to each of their houses,0.381158233
and the ofcourse the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for the one who was at the ball,0.313067645
and sure enough it is Cinderellas foot that fits the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and but to her great delight,0.272904038
and the prince marries her,0.41128993
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
well I would take two pieces of bread,0.267890275
on one of them I would take a knife and spread the peanut butter,0.246411502
and on the other piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together,0.265411019
and Id have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.264676452
yeah well the big one is my cancer Hodgkins disease,0.202926159
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven,0.302060604
I had symptoms before then but didnt connect the dots,0.265985727
I had night sweats,0.390076935
I was tired and h just didnt think much of it,0.248625115
but then I noticed that I was losing weight,0.370992362
and thats what caused me to seek a doctor,0.279336572
so I went to,0.394104749
I hadnt been to a doctor in years,0.229582652
so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses,0.225346878
shes now both our physician for both of us,0.257200867
she did an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something the lymph nodes turned out,0.237473637
so I went for a sonogram,0.291986674
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan,0.224600136
that led to the need for a biopsy,0.301887125
so at that by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong,0.336506397
the decision was gonna be is it,0.258258045
it it was lymphoma,0.481112003
but is it gonna be Hodgkins lymphoma or NonHodgkins lymphoma,0.22297743
so I went to Mountainside hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasnt enough not enough tissue was obtained,0.213930964
so I hadta go into the city into NewYork to Sloan for a more complete biopsy,0.19882521
and that clinched it,0.32942155
it was Hodgkins lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two,0.281725496
Hodgkinss is much more treatable at a higher success rate,0.316102594
so I started chemo,0.415697038
and after the first session I developed a rash,0.293493539
and we werent quite sure what was going on,0.245164812
one of the nurses,0.437556326
the the oncologist wasnt sure,0.282813966
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment h for the for the Hodgkins,0.233387247
but one of his nurses said,0.294333577
this is an allergic reaction,0.383216053
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol,0.286307395
I think I mentioned this last time,0.434536636
which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney,0.322101295
its actually a drug for gout,0.368028611
but it has a protective effect for kidney function,0.352242917
that landed me in the hospital with with whats called StevensJohnson syndrome which is treated like a burn,0.232814372
it s people with StevensJohnson are often sent to burn units,0.24847503
my mouth was inflamed,0.357991636
I I it was just awful,0.487477571
I couldnt drink water,0.358820617
it it burned,0.596095502
that ofcourse suspended chemo,0.492387474
I we worked through the StevensJohnson,0.347591907
I was looking forward to chemo,0.315281272
it was it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation,0.31831339
so and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather,0.264400482
but still I I couldnt take solid food for for two weeks or so nor water,0.247876093
it was it was the only thing that really worked was was iced tea,0.34717983
so I got through the StevensJohnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months,0.275456667
it ended last May,0.345527232
had my Pet scan at that time which was clear,0.21290493
oncologist waited another six months,0.342865974
had another Pet scan,0.264085054
that was clear,0.505505741
and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed,0.252480775
I dont know if you know about ports,0.407889277
so that sorta that sorta clinched the the idea that Im youknow home free,0.241310418
youknow I hafta be monitored every six months,0.201474562
and chemo wasnt it wasnt all that bad,0.257465541
Imean Firstname got me through it if as I said last week,0.223977402
I broke down,0.404771805
she was just super in getting me through all of this,0.288299441
and the chemo wasnt bad,0.247318029
I I really wasnt nauseous,0.383302718
my appetite started to come back,0.352452695
infact we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo,0.270922959
wed send out for lunch,0.255195051
so the it was it was tired,0.377748132
Id I would get tired,0.379766762
but I had chemo every two weeks,0.334143877
and my hair came back,0.323302865
and thats where I am now,0.288867414
not all that much,0.589408398
Im a Im a very bad eater when it comes to nutrition,0.227679491
fish,0.99999994
but it it it wasnt all that much to do,0.404678136
the the chemo was the the primary source of of treatment ofcourse,0.457310468
the oncologist was very responsive,0.416556627
and he youknow he he gave me antinausea medication,0.304352999
but I didnt I took it once during the whole treatment time,0.286578923
and and even then it wasnt because I was starting to to vomit,0.299739748
I just felt a bit queasy,0.401663154
alotof rest,0.553374648
I slept alot and had tender loving care from Firstname,0.201606274
so it I didnt do alot different youknow,0.323277026
so I I really cant go beyond that,0.378582954
it was the chemotherapy and the rest,0.408810794
youknow that was pretty much it,0.373560697
well I guess one of the most important things,0.351084143
I think I think last week I mentioned my sons birth so I I wont go through that again,0.290539354
another milestone was was getting a job at MontclairState,0.31653744
I I had I was a speech clinician doing work as a as a a speech language pathologist,0.281224072
but I missed interacting with students,0.346452564
I had and and and I I had some experience in doing that because I my undergraduate degree was in history,0.292984843
and I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that,0.261817962
but then things things sortof changed obviously,0.547477126
but I I I missed that kind of interaction,0.371646047
I worked mostly with children when I was a speech clinician,0.265927821
and r Firstname was teaching English at the highschool level,0.270817131
and she would come back home with stories about youknow working with students and discussions they had in class,0.299512357
and I was sorta jealous of that,0.282704324
and so when I was invited to to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance,0.241305187
that that changed everything,0.685341835
and I was warned that from from friends colleagues that I was taking a big risk in in doing this because I wasnt going to get tenure,0.23636508
that they were h I was gonna be taken advantage of,0.213698581
I dont know where they got the idea,0.32635808
but that I would youknow I I would work for xl number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldnt get tenure,0.237181604
but I wanted to be in the classroom so much,0.322428137
and it was more that than doing research actually,0.40507248
it was actually teaching that drew me to it,0.349186033
that I said,0.462552398
the heck with it,0.323476583
youknow Im gonna do it,0.321992368
and so I I did,0.436355501
and it it changed everything,0.506121993
and that was a very very positive event youknow,0.336131662
and I spent forty five years after that being here,0.304450959
yeah,1
so yeah,0.688268423
yeah,1
well no lucky for you,0.344598323
okay a young boy is kicking a soccer ball,0.26292789
hes out I guess in the backyard,0.234613106
but as hes when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbors house or maybe his own house and lands on the lap of a of a man sitting in a chair who then gets up holds the ball in his hand and looks out the the hole in the window,0.227774411
and thats where it ends,0.355232418
so we dont know if hes gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what,0.198236749
but hes just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened,0.349739909
this is a story about not listening to your mom especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella,0.273910701
mother is suggesting that he he do that,0.398052216
that hes theres its going to rain,0.279470176
and hes hes rejecting the whole thing,0.299726099
says goodbye,0.558927417
and mothers a bit dismayed because hes not taking the umbrella,0.264258742
and sure enough once hes outside it starts to rain hard enough that he hasta run back to the house,0.27554813
hes not very happy,0.346833795
hes soaking wet,0.327314138
mother is looking at him almost saying,0.293718725
see I told you show,0.429246098
and next we see hes out back in the rain but with the umbrella,0.248642921
well it seems as though this young girls father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat whos up on a limb,0.201570064
he himself though ends up being stuck,0.333906144
his facial expression indicates that he hes having difficulty moving one way or the other,0.331168592
and being of no help the dog is barking making a racket,0.280814737
and someone evidently called the fire department,0.414129227
and there are two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder,0.276294589
and theyre going to try to get him down,0.360502481
his ladder fathers ladder is on the ground I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him,0.234995291
so the fire fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope,0.248710796
story of a young girl whose,0.352995753
I guess shes a teenager,0.317265868
whose mother dies and father remarries,0.465767443
and shes introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters,0.298285693
and they immediately take advantage of Cinderella,0.326500982
she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and hasta attend to their needs and the needs of the household,0.303111523
and evidently father was of no help in mediating any of this,0.317802101
so the girl ends up being in a household but but being rather a member of the household being a a servant as I said,0.274005532
one day a ball is announced,0.275916964
she she lives in I guess a principality headed by youknow royalty,0.198832065
and one day a ball is announced,0.257597476
if I recall correctly its because the prince is in need of finding a wife,0.243898898
his father tells him that its time for him to marry,0.324456275
so a ball is organized,0.307106853
and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend,0.313991457
and the three stepsisters and and their h their mother go plan to go,0.326460361
and they get their gowns ready,0.330275685
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too,0.296252549
but it turns out that shes not gonna be allowed to go,0.26044634
she ofcourse is very sad about that,0.351440519
enter her fairy godmother,0.39440155
they they go off to the ball the the the the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball,0.341970176
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella,0.248142973
youre gonna go too,0.331752419
and were gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen,0.186880261
and I guess the mice too become horses,0.279340148
Im not sure which animals become the horses maybe the mice,0.257421106
shes outfitted Cinderellas outfitted with a gown and a pair of l glass slippers,0.204967007
why glass,0.518905342
I dont know,0.538106382
but shes told she hasta get home by by midnight,0.17916818
because at the stroke of twelve everythings gonna turn back to what it was,0.232947648
the coach will become the pumpkin,0.295635998
the coachmen will become the mice,0.319289804
shell lose her beautiful clothing,0.364881098
so she goes to the ball promises to to leave by twelve,0.255475819
but shes having a great time,0.353472769
and the prince is very much drawn to her,0.308261782
and shes still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time and gets gets back home in time,0.265560716
but as shes running out one of her slipper slippers comes off,0.215294659
and the prince picks it up,0.297309846
and it turns out that shes the one that he wants,0.324152589
and he figures hell be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into the into the glass slipper,0.208429471
so a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper,0.210822567
and the the the stepsisters ofcourse try,0.457807183
and they dont fit,0.33525601
and they try to push their feet into that slipper,0.324793369
and it doesnt work,0.336594999
and theyre very upset,0.321734846
and loandbehold Cinderellas foot fits perfectly,0.311965019
it was her slipper,0.37899363
and theyre very very surprised shocked and upset,0.359283686
but shes the one,0.357588649
the prince is delighted,0.398403615
and they end up being married and live happily ever after,0.295287043
well as I said before Im not very good at nutrition,0.221109927
so I would not use what looks like whole wheat bread,0.371634722
I would use American white bread two slices,0.264985561
on one slice I would spread the peanut butter,0.281119138
and the other slice I would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich,0.303486824
I think I do fine,0.550152659

it took well we took him to the hospital,0.279077411
and he wanted to wait,0.346281916
and they said they need immediate surgery,0.392240882
so they did immediately operate on him,0.358167231

she was a poor stepsister,0.378700495
and she had other stepsisters,0.444760978
she hadta clean the house while her other sisters didnt,0.281626642
and she went to the ball,0.319874614
and she met a prince,0.322738498
and she went in the coach which was a pumpkin,0.242779389
and anyways at midnight stroke of midnight she lost contact with the prince,0.247430027
and he went ahead and looked through the whole town for some little glass slipper that she had worn that night,0.275242209
and then they met and lived happily ever after,0.341381729

and so shes this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party,0.279822171
and ofcourse the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the stepsisters,0.366440624
he dances with her,0.425567031

the ball landed I guess,0.293196231
the man that caught the ball,0.397171348
and he saw he looked out the window at the broken glass,0.270314634
okay,0.99999994
so in the first picture okay so the mom is gonna hand a little boy an umbrella,0.19727771
it looks like hes gonna go somewhere with a backpack on,0.220806777
then he goes outside,0.425919116
and it starts raining,0.436297894
oh he steps in a puddle,0.199216589
and his hairs wet,0.343484461
oh he came home,0.277145267
his hair his mom is angry at him,0.242828161
I think his mom is angry at him,0.257742584
maybe shes angry at him because his hair is wet,0.213182837
then he went maybe he forgot to use the umbrella,0.273312926
Im not sure,0.363532603
then he went back outside,0.474144131
and he used the umbrella,0.351122946
was that right,0.517891347
okay,0.99999994
ohgosh theres alot going on here,0.341122806
I see a and theres theres a cat in a tree,0.251740187
and lets see,0.377603769
the girl is trying to get her cat down,0.255194217
so maybe the dad climbed up the ladder to help get her cat down,0.233619764
oh then the ladder fell,0.280746758
maybe he used the ladder to get the cat down,0.250117153
then the ladder fell down,0.404006183
shes trying to catch this cat maybe,0.29603973
I dont know why these people are here,0.392242581
maybe theyre coming to help get the cat down,0.289919168
and I dont know why hes upset,0.275575429
I dont know what the dog is doing,0.298533052
is that it,0.567281842
how I would make one,0.417527467
I would use two pieces of bread,0.271289051
and I would put them down on the table,0.32079348
and then I would take the peanut butter outof the cabinet,0.259388804
and I would take the jelly outof the refrigerator where I keep it,0.249701709
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread,0.231346413
and then I would use a knife for that,0.323699117
and I would probably use the same knife and put it in the l or I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread,0.261043847
and I put the two pieces of bread together,0.29343155
and then I would cut them either in half or on a diagonal,0.289862812
and then that would be it,0.481224656
and then I would wrap it in cellophane,0.295341939
for one of the boys to take to school,0.318154216
and then Id put it in the freezer,0.252954841
because I make five at a time,0.289506644
okay,0.99999994
the boys kicking what looks like a soccer ball,0.30297339
only it goes through the window,0.371389985
breaks the window,0.514734507
and it alarms this man who notices whats happening,0.305861473
he looks out the window to see whos done it and whats happened,0.238829166
okay,0.99999994
well the boy I believe its a boy is leaving home,0.23981601
and his mother probably his mother is suggesting that he take an umbrella,0.312626779
she I think shes suggesting pretty strongly,0.353667736
he says no he doesnt need an umbrella,0.210742742
probably says its not gonna rain,0.243492201
walks out and it is raining,0.297939658
walks along further and its raining even harder,0.38588661
even perhaps windy because the rain is slanted,0.360632032
hes walking through puddles,0.286738992
he gets home pretty wet dripping,0.329442859
and his mother or the woman is pretty mad,0.245980576
got hands on her hips,0.353424728
she gives him the umbrella again I assume,0.281656742
and now hes walking out alittle happier with the umbrella over his head,0.260959864
this is a switch kindof,0.440141231
okay then the little the little girl here whos riding a tricycle apparently,0.305490911
and her the cat went up she either notices the cat up the tree or saw him go up,0.232762918
I think her father or somebody was trying to get up there to get the cat,0.274273664
but he got stuck,0.425792217
and he looks kindof dismayed,0.357011229
the dog here is barking up at the man in the tree stuck in the tree,0.264755309
and for all of this they the fire department has come out to rescue everyone with a ladder,0.289236933
and rescue the man and the cat,0.361824185

but the fairy godmother comes by and gives her xxx using magic ofcourse,0.242595151

and it fell inside the mans house,0.329963475
and it hit the lamp and broke it,0.280431509
and the man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid,0.242607892
trying to and the kid probably ran away,0.27640751
hes gonna go knock on his daddys door and say,0.159683362
pay me for my broken window,0.275856316
mama said to the little boy,0.254746169
its supposed to rain today,0.367588639
take your umbrella with you to school,0.328928083
and the little boy says,0.313526839
ah no,0.521325588
I dont need an umbrella,0.276721835
its not gonna rain on me,0.222692698
and then he walks to school,0.360979766
and it starts to rain,0.356020004
and it rains really hard,0.441260993
so he hasta run back home,0.318109453
and hes all soaking wet,0.287143379
and hes not happy,0.28600347
and his mothers not happy either,0.403822958
and he hasta change clothes probably,0.304453582
its hard to tell,0.328850329
and then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry,0.270407289
well the little girl has a cat that the dog chased up the tree,0.267389357
and then a nice man maybe her daddy came along,0.257424861
and he had a ladder,0.327300787
and he climbed up in the tree to get the cat,0.236796796
and then the ladder fell down,0.382182002
and then hes stuck in the tree,0.259022534
so somebody else watched this whole deal while the dogs still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody,0.271520376
and they came with their truck and ladder,0.362664044
not quite there yet but theyre getting there,0.481334507
and theres a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them,0.260270596
the cats on the other side of the tree,0.385343045
says,1
Im gonna catch the bird and eat her,0.175149158
and the firemen rescued them all,0.444764972
yes,0.999999881
thats interesting,0.544379771
I dont think I remember the beginning,0.364462078
I obviously dont remember alotof this,0.382828772
I dont remember any of these things from when I was a kid,0.230683729
I used to read science fiction,0.317984104
I still do,0.567693591
well lets see,0.42255798
if I remember Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl,0.305029273
the nice man took her home to his family or somebody,0.270013571
and the stepmother had already had daughters,0.462793648
and they took her in,0.357762426
but they treated her like a servant,0.356310636
and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff,0.388343126
and she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out to wear,0.268731117
and she was usually in the kitchen cleaning,0.346957415
and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball I think in honor of PrinceCharming or somebody,0.22442238
and the evil stepmother wanted her daughters to get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and be rich,0.267306358
and so they all got fancied up to go to the ball,0.279703408
and Cinderella wasnt asked if she wanted to go,0.214876398
and she wanted to go,0.348211974
and she was crying about it,0.355124533
and a good fairy godmother came along,0.306003273
Im not quite sure how she got there,0.311915278
and she was able to turn ordinary things and creatures around her into fabulous ones,0.299132496
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses,0.217130527
and she turned the mice into something,0.334284842
anyway and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers,0.257291108
and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left,0.291888654
and when she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her,0.313202828
and they danced the night away,0.384580016
and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry,0.355161309
then the fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning,0.291964203
and so she hadta be sure to leave by midnight,0.274129182
and she was a little late,0.355085909
and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach,0.266366363
and she lost a glass slipper,0.26761502
and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her I think,0.270567656
and she jumped in the coach,0.27296558
and it ran away they ran away from the ball,0.276672393
and it turned back into a pumpkin,0.31446752
and her clothes turned back into rags,0.33816272
and she had one glass slipper on her foot,0.265944093
and then the prince was very sad,0.322959363
and he wanted to find her,0.35384202
and he they took the glass slipper she had that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs,0.276363492
and they went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit,0.316911578
and the evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper,0.245052591
and it wouldnt fit cause they had big feet,0.264573187
and finally Cinderella got to try on the slipper,0.254628092
and it fit,0.414818168
and the prince and the was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry,0.346443892
he was in love with her,0.315810174
so he found out,0.366709948
they told him I guess,0.450565428
and all the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of Cinderella then,0.268003494
and she married the prince,0.39261055
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
the end,0.63970381
so were gonna do something alittle different,0.322512984
well oddly enough I never had peanut butter and jelly growing up,0.258447051
I still havent had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.261631012
it was not part of my growing up,0.246178553
but Id take two pieces of white bread,0.230298221
and Id put peanut butter probably if it were me Id put it on both pieces of bread,0.214555815
and then Id put jelly in the middle,0.233667284
and I happen to like well grape jelly I think would go good with peanut butter probably,0.300507635
strawberry is nice too,0.387051553
and then Id smush it together,0.304011822
and then Id cut it in half diagonally,0.263095945
I believe,0.638807654
we didnt eat peanut butter growing up,0.268082112
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all,0.259767592
occasionally I eat peanut butter outof a jar because its a protein,0.252409458
and I my stomach is growling at me youknow,0.212523639
adequate,1
a few words of French occasionally,0.320700288
I listen to people speaking Spanish,0.366994649
and youknow I picked up a word or two,0.203736857
and I usually can figure out what theyre saying when theyre trying to speak English,0.304461896
and people who speak,0.451355189
I dont know what language is kis that Pakistan,0.260472596
and that theres multiple languages,0.430707335
and I hear Arabic I people wherever I go,0.335740358
so I hear English thats accented that way,0.33013922
most of the time I can figure them out too,0.29326579
no,0.99999994
illness,0.99999994
well my daddy died of a heart attack,0.198860943
and my mother probably died of a stroke although they said heart attack,0.266983181
strokes ran in her family and heart attacks in his,0.291341275
and my mother had emphysema,0.346327215
I guess these days they call it COPD,0.343053341
she well her family were coal miners,0.354756564
and you talk about secondhand cigarette smoke,0.304513216
well my familys got secondhand coal dust,0.235155612
because they carried it in,0.41828528
and by the time she was in her early twenties she already had stuff that showed up on the tv xrays that they do because she worked in a school cafeteria,0.227504537
back in the days where they actually cook real food,0.321161509
thats mostly Imean Ive got glaucoma and youknow those kind of things but,0.277752817
thats well I have diabetes,0.348736167
that seems to run in the part of my daddys family,0.23502177
well I always wanted to do horseback riding,0.354822367
and a friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at RockcreekParkStables in the district,0.20834744
and she wanted to go but she didnt wanna go by herself so she asked me to go with her,0.255557865
and since Id always sorta wanted to do that I went with her,0.266169339
and they taught Englishstyle riding,0.458272099
and we took this introductory group of lessons,0.309031427
and she quit and I kept on,0.265302032
and in fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp,0.218611091
yeah,1
but it was lotsof fun,0.410357177
I learned alot,0.442122489
and I enjoyed that for a couple years until I had sortof a accident,0.26649943
they tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy,0.291660905
youknow wed be,0.343265355
and hed go like that at sound,0.233937368
and I usually went right off youknow,0.285940558
and so a couple of times and I dont land on my feet,0.191564009
so I sorta landed on my lower back and so thats caused me problems,0.248605937
and I didnt go back after that,0.268785268
but it was really nice while I did it,0.408560097
little bit of almost jumping,0.383370578
the best part was riding the jump trail in RockcreekPark which is a a horse trail that theyve let the little little usually trees fall across,0.265730679
and its rough,0.580128193
and if you take and my horse because he didnt like his neighbor horses,0.265242159
we were always at the end of the line,0.311040044
thats not a good place to be when other horses are moving along,0.298430234
because horses being herd creatures they wanna catch up,0.32514137
and stay with their good buddies,0.3633973
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles,0.384529799
and Im in the back of the line,0.296661884
and hes running to catch up,0.253342301
and its alittle more exciting being at the end of the line,0.354171753
but it was really it was really good,0.497736156
but now I do helicopters and its better,0.307251871
I presume you needed a special one for that is that right,0.3831608
extremely well,0.687301219
a little bit of French and a little bit of Spanish and some Yiddish,0.317849457
just the neuromyasthenia,0.586804569
it it meant I had a six month old daughter,0.254121542
and I was paralyzed,0.367880106
so I did hafta hire someone to help me,0.302256495
but I knew that very often people do die from that,0.350444615
but I live by,0.306636363
anything is possible,0.54515022
and and it works for me,0.363071561
it did take several years,0.291780651
and I did hafta have rehab which was not very effective so many years ago,0.218998611
and I I guess I must have had a residual from that because I was doing reasonably well,0.322729975
as a matter of fact I I was leading groups as we traveled and organizing trips and so on for MontgomeryCounty,0.241784975
but the I I did find I then needed two hip replacements,0.292630315
and recently I about two years ago I was in an auto accident,0.208083481
so I do use a cane now,0.302156448
but Im fine,0.361692846
and and and the daughter is fine,0.400258124
this is a tough one but Ill say it anyway,0.327664286
it was a sad one but it had a great impact on my entire life,0.278651297
I was eight years old,0.319278032
and we were extremely poor,0.38378036
and we were dispossessed from our apartment,0.334815055
and it was ice on the ground,0.334762871
and at that time when that happened I made up my mind that I will never be poor again,0.310903609
and that I will not rely on a man,0.285058796
that I can make it on my own,0.34123975
and I certainly have,0.471018255
okay heres a little boy whos having a good time,0.265969545
and he kicks the ball and unfortunately it breaks a window,0.307651222
and the the ball rolls into the a mans home,0.343275309
and hes very very disturbed over this,0.336381793
he looks at the window holds the ball and looks to see who kicked the ball,0.239890784
I want you to know Im enjoying this,0.3791188
this is my thing,0.45097506
mama is telling this little boy,0.340600878
its raining out,0.471859455
you hafta take the umbrella,0.257205844
and hes saying,0.298381478
aw shucks I dont need an umbrella,0.232993126
so he goes outside,0.367185891
and ofcourse it is raining,0.403437436
and hes annoyed with himself,0.278147876
and hes trying to hold his head to get outof the rain,0.222663432
he comes in,0.349407554
and he finally admits to his mother,0.414423406
yup I guess I need the umbrella,0.30428037
and he walks away with the umbrella,0.306142569
okay,0.99999994
a little girl was riding her bike,0.330952823
and the the cat was following her,0.368903399
and the cat ran up the tree,0.275431991
she comes back crying to the father and the mother,0.381040752
and the father says,0.42590946
dont worry about it,0.424233466
Ill get the cat outof the tree,0.219109923
and he takes the ladder,0.333031088
and he climbs the tree,0.352875441
and the ladder falls down,0.400067598
in the meantime a dog comes along and is barking at him,0.255568624
and the cat is also alittle afraid of that dog,0.289229035
so it doesnt come down,0.362861931
and the kids still crying,0.410195172
I want my cat,0.465072781
I want my cat,0.465072781
anyway either the man uses his cell phone or she cries to her mother,0.272376627
and they get the the fire people to use the ladder to get the cat down,0.316940188
yes,0.999999881
a little bit,0.594921589
okay,0.99999994
Cinderella lives in a home with a wicked mother and two ugly mean sisters,0.239881247
and shes really abused in every way,0.287122637
they take tremendous advantage of her,0.339988798
shes the cleanup person she wears rags and all that sort of thing,0.263406754
anyway they hear that theres a great ball coming up,0.299810529
and the two daughters and the mother are going to the ball,0.364857733
and ofcourse theyre gonna leave Cinderella home,0.220085472
they want Cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on,0.290082186
and so she does,0.368685722
and she thinks about the ball,0.318363041
and shes really very very sad,0.361893505
and she makes a wish,0.303730488
and the wish is that she can go to the ball,0.27631399
when a fairy godmother appears and tells her,0.333686709
yes you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight,0.261236489
and she says,0.378272772
okay I will,0.485110134
and the fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well,0.367906481
and she gets into this big pumpkin,0.27122575
what can I call it,0.430538625
anyway its its something that carries her to the ball,0.347574264
and when she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her,0.314362168
and she hears the midnight stroke,0.345367491
and she gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise,0.262044996
so she goes running down the steps,0.31397301
and she loses her shoe,0.314875335
and she gets home okay,0.302154392
the prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit,0.255519927
and it doesnt seem to fit anyone,0.321886837
and the the ugly the mean mother has him try on the the shoes on the two ugly daughters,0.258950651
and finally Cinderella comes down,0.342442095
and although the mother doesnt want him to he tries on the shoe,0.258238196
and it fits her,0.331145763
and I believe he he then wants to marry her,0.350733221
I would try and get good bread like whole wheat bread or something like that,0.36275357
and Id first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick,0.223971114
and then get raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on,0.301443309
and put the second slice on top of it,0.263748705
and then cut it in quarters for a young child,0.283433825
did you want something to raise it up,0.397616774
oh I think Im a very good English speaker,0.236835763
everybody tells me Im very articulate,0.308431327
just like a smattering of Spanish just really a few words,0.3551009
no,0.99999994
well I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from NewMexico to the east coast,0.270888954
it was such an immense change culturally,0.338722855
and we also we lived in a very rural area in NewMexico up in the mountains,0.295191169
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all,0.231558338
so when we came here it was absolutely shocking,0.386258245
Imean just the fact that they had sidewalks alone,0.411182135
they just amazed us,0.510813832
and the street lamps and everything,0.461440295
I think one thing thats different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money,0.287009686
its so much richer,0.411917508
and they can afford to do all of that youknow,0.314823985
we had alotof unpaved roads out there,0.286330134
ofcourse theres the theres alot sparser population,0.311681509
so alotof times theyre not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place,0.233600125
but here it was just amazing to us all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city,0.305451661
it was just indescribable the impact that it had on us,0.349264652
I think it took us years to really kindof overcome the culture shock,0.306663483
so I Imean I remember that period of my life all the time,0.327752709
what just the immense change that we underwent,0.424426794
in fact we had Spanish accents,0.290233433
very heavy,0.627003372
my parents always did their whole lives,0.385898352
but we had such a terrible time at school people teasing us and everything,0.290045589
and we really tried hard to emulate English speakers especially,0.356698811
I used to listen to DavidNiven for some reason,0.363178521
I was really crazy about him,0.393537343
and I wanted to sound like him,0.370760679
so youknow and it really was a it really it had a huge impact on us each in their own way,0.273442298
okay,0.99999994
alright,0.999999881
this little boy Tommy found this ball,0.300810754
oh yeah,0.846038759
found a soccer ball and decided to try his luck at kicking it around,0.232257396
so he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick,0.268605769
and sure enough it went through the his neighbors window,0.310241014
his neighbor was watching television,0.356550664
and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window knocks over his lamp,0.264100045
he looks out the window but theres nobody there,0.320722759
okay,0.99999994
theres Tommy again,0.253944218
his mother that morning knew that it was gonna rain,0.268821537
shed been listening to the weather channel,0.360669672
she told him to take his umbrella,0.284825116
no hes positive that theres not gonna be any problem,0.266910344
also he doesnt wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella,0.203535929
and he says goodbye to his mother,0.30886209
and hell be fine,0.31421423
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain,0.25926584
so he runs back,0.359126568
his mothers quite annoyed with him because shed argued with him,0.314696014
and he said it was not gonna rain,0.215045169
he feels bad,0.459879041
finally takes the umbrella and goes to school,0.312027425
okay,0.99999994
Susan was out playing with her dog,0.237109944
and the dog chased a a cat up into the tree,0.284125984
and oh I guess it was actually her cat,0.28394407
so she became quite upset about it,0.357389867
and her neighbor came out and said,0.325010598
well thats okay,0.354997218
dont worry about it,0.424233466
I have a ladder,0.354724735
and Ill get up there and get your cat,0.278517306
so he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb,0.243259951
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground,0.363640726
and then he couldnt get down,0.314689785
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree,0.311637193
so somebody hadta call the fire department,0.339212447
and they came out and rescued the both of them,0.370598406
oh yeah,0.846038759
yeah,1
I dont remember these animals,0.385201335
I forgot what an involved story it is,0.291563928
okay,0.99999994
okay,0.99999994
Cinderella lived with her father and her mother in this little village,0.326907784
when she was very young her mother passed away,0.364727199
it was just her and her father,0.408948541
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry,0.277683496
he met somebody there in their village,0.2810646
and he remarried,0.406693459
and then sadly he passed away very shortly after that,0.343056828
so she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters,0.352221876
and it they turned out that the stepmother was not very nicely she was not very nice to Cinderella,0.29768464
so she made Cinderella into kindof a little maid who hadta sweep out the,0.240973711
sorry,0.99999994
yeah,1
its another one of these turtlenecks,0.381757438
these are my favorite things,0.404653907
so they turned her into a little maid,0.312497973
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her sisters her stepsisters and her stepmother,0.321121097
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant,0.32155627
she was very unhappy,0.421013772
but she didnt really know what else to do,0.398692638
there was nothing else she could do,0.37959069
then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son the prince who was,0.241480023
they were trying to find a suitable bride for him,0.309879452
so they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoipolloi of the area,0.33273676
so the sisters decided theyd go,0.285752624
and at first Cinderella thought that she might go,0.271833926
and they laughed at her,0.311037362
told her she didnt have anything to wear,0.287234932
she was not pretty,0.430991679
so they went to the ball,0.340613365
she was very sad sitting among the cinders,0.281576067
and her fairy godmother shows up appears and tells her shell get it all set for the ball,0.243578613
so she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses,0.249504939
and I forget what she made her dress outof,0.251644462
so she goes to the ball,0.293767571
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers,0.247704968
so she goes to the ball,0.293767571
and she meets the prince,0.369686812
the prince falls madly in love with her because shes the most beautiful girl there,0.278510273
but the fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was,0.280709177
so she saw midnight approaching,0.347756356
so she hadta leave suddenly the prince,0.387019694
youknow she hadta run away from him and hide run away jump in her carriage,0.240738571
and just as she got back she jumped outof the carriage,0.2547369
and everything turned back to what it was before,0.363881707
so she al thought,0.387217134
well thats gonna be my one night of happiness,0.215230644
but Ill always remember it,0.420861661
but the i she had left behind the way she was running outof the castle she had left behind her glass slipper,0.256977648
the prince had run been running around trying to find her,0.295938224
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper,0.328936368
so he told his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper,0.248559549
so they went around to all the villages,0.353456378
and they they had them try had the women who might possibly be that Cinderella try on the glass slipper,0.28711769
so they got to the house of Cinderella,0.258231461
and they asked her,0.410247266
how many girls do you have,0.420778006
no I only have two,0.390181959
because they had found out what was going on,0.335504353
they were having them try on this glass slipper,0.321374476
so she hid Cinderella forced Cinderella to stay inside her room,0.245750144
and she they tried the slipper on to the the stepdaughters,0.333627939
and the first one was was the heel was too big,0.313007176
so the mother said,0.350524873
no no that itll fit,0.384264857
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel,0.238604888
but it still didnt fit,0.403696001
and they tried on the for the second woman,0.335899413
and but her toe is too big,0.270424396
and the mother says,0.425748408
no no it fits,0.486781061
and she cut off her toe in secret,0.24283351
but it still didnt fit,0.403696001
so they said,0.49252069
no this isnt her these arent their shoes,0.249205172
so then they were leaving,0.497937173
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there,0.475582063
I dont remember exactly who what clued them into that,0.335578412
so they insisted on looking around,0.379098654
and they found Cinderella,0.362855077
and sure enough they tried her the shoe on her,0.311271667
and it fit,0.414818168
so they took her back to the castle,0.330658853
she married the prince,0.42098096
and she was very forgiving,0.407179922
she brought her sisters to live with them,0.361660302
well when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I toast the bread,0.291974097
and then I let it cool off,0.345806837
and then on one side I smear the peanut peanut butter,0.269557565
then on the other side I smear the jelly,0.297138959
and then I put them together,0.419116169
how do I what,0.582254171
very well,0.659657896
excellent,1
well I have noone to talk Yiddish to so I dont know whether I should include that,0.28063792
well I I can speak some Yiddish,0.33361125
but theres nobody to converse with so I dont know whether that would qualify,0.317755997
no,0.99999994
would you consider Alzheimers,0.443916231
yes my husband,0.469840735
what,1.000000119
well it started about six years before he passed away,0.293933928
I noticed that he was very forgetful,0.362833053
he couldnt remember what building we lived in and other things,0.279722542
and even driving his driving was erratic,0.431011945
and I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and and canasta that he no longer wanted to play,0.28308776
he didnt want to we used to square dance quite a bit,0.23755756
and then he decided,0.468061835
he never gave me a reason,0.339253098
and at first I didnt quite understand,0.24647975
and he dropped out of alotof the things,0.257769048
he was a volunteer at the KennedyCenter,0.33258307
and he loved it there and they loved him,0.37957263
and the next thing I know he wasnt going anymore,0.267280072
and I tried to figure out why,0.324198723
and he said,0.372952074
well they want me to use a different technique when I write up a sale,0.268080473
write it sothat he would write it write the sales for by hand,0.279548019
and then they put it in the computer,0.364806086
so the final straw came when I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him,0.274399728
and that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts,0.289739996
and he got very confused with the different women,0.328891844
they all happened to be black,0.380369157
and so he mixed them up,0.336412013
and when one wanted to feed him hed push her hand away,0.274695456
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldnt handle it and I couldnt handle it,0.335058004
and thats when he went into a nursing home,0.276269168
and he remained there,0.438588202
and he deteriorated quite a bit,0.363432705
he forgot how to walk,0.325899512
he forgot how to teach to feed himself,0.329552412
he didnt remember whether where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands,0.231138304
and so they took good care of him,0.277083278
he was always neatly dressed and clean outof bed until he reached the point where he stopped eating,0.235697761
and he eventually passed away peacefully,0.417098641
Ive had so many happy memories I dont even know where to start first,0.289575636
just one,0.723146677
I cant think of anything outstanding,0.273241192
I guess the day I got married,0.316342086
when my children were born,0.274152428
Im trying to think of,0.258533835
one one really stands out,0.503185451
we were fortunate enough to have my parents babysit for the children so we could get away,0.304449022
and we went to Jamaica for a week,0.235622168
and that was one of the most wonderful enjoyable vacations we ever had,0.327944368
the weather was fine,0.383208752
the food was great,0.381396413

mother is happy,0.410536587
he is not getting wet,0.328767389

these firemen really have a big job on their hands,0.32316196
Im just wondering who comes first,0.271843791

according to this book,0.396732777
flipping pages,0.565870047
I dont remember who this man is,0.293765843
the father is the,0.500685096
okay,0.99999994
the best I can,0.359241545
Cinderella had a stepmother,0.381153643
two stepsisters,0.627931714
Cinderella was beautiful,0.433665037
the two stepsisters were mean ugly vicious just like the mother,0.31602481
and she did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just indulged themselves,0.313356578
and then they announced that the the king would have a ball in the palace,0.362751663
and everybody was invited,0.343651861
ofcourse Cinderella was not,0.353558064
and she would have liked to have gone to the ball,0.310146421
and along came the fairy godmother,0.368459344
and he s,0.328487277
well get you dressed up and get you to the ball,0.307328284
and she got into a beautiful gown and a a coach,0.254278511
but that she would hafta be back by midnight,0.275126278
Im improvising,0.314087361
and off she went to the ball,0.300344735
and the PrinceCharming asked her to dance,0.374137253
and she danced with him,0.391316921
and I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother,0.342074454
and at the stroke of midnight Cinderella knew she hadta return home,0.234586477
so she quickly ran down the steps to get into the coach and in the process lost one of her slippers,0.223049551
and she got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters,0.375412494
well PrinceCharming was enamored with her but he didnt know who she was or where he could find her,0.263765842
so he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball,0.232684448
and when they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into them into the shoe,0.315474749
and it wouldnt work,0.363761067
and Cinderella they would not let Cinderella do it,0.31814608
however the prince or the attendants said,0.365064025
why dont we have this this young lady try on the shoe,0.256364554
and they finally did,0.492421478
and the shoe fit,0.385195196
and thats when the PrinceCharming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball,0.324755818
and she was she went back to the palace,0.332588017
and the the king granted a marriage for his son PrinceCharming and Cinderella,0.330932081
and they were married,0.43122673
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
well I guess you would take two slices of white bread,0.264299631
smear some peanut butter on one side some jelly on the other,0.307277083
put them together,0.529813349
see that they the top one matches the bottom one,0.400541186
cut them up across in a diagonal,0.306514293
put them in some Glad bag,0.242038667
and then give it to your son,0.333913147
what are choices,0.553743482
well,1.000000119

thats about it,0.447779983
but but but really describing everything and that kinda thing Im never good at,0.375378013
okay,0.99999994
theres this child playing with this kickball or something,0.334890932
breaks out the window,0.433602691
person sitting in his house probably doesnt have tv or something,0.250437111
and the ball comes in,0.382783026
and then looks like he just looks out the window to see who there,0.321880698
okay,0.99999994
it looks like maybe she tried to give him an umbrella,0.281114548
yeah I think he because hes out there he decided he didnt want to take it,0.298044533
he goes out and gets wet,0.274802536
walks a little bit,0.457026005

and it looks like thats what happened what should have happened first,0.370448589
I dont know why shes standing there with her hands up,0.250648171
alright anyway then I guess he goes up to get the cat down,0.297953904

hes just sitting there,0.386637539

and Im not even sure how she got to to the ball to go to the ball but she did,0.269193232
and and I think she was supposed to be back by midnight or then she turned into a pumpkin,0.240814254
so that thats not it,0.525179863
I dont remember that,0.43988502

ugh,1.000000119
okay,0.99999994
Id have two pieces of bread,0.241756886
I would put the peanut butter on one slice,0.270133913
and let me see,0.340478182
I havent made one lately,0.327737898
but I think I would probably put a jelly on the other slice,0.294361532
and then just put it together,0.44297424
I think I do fairly well,0.465582848
I think very well,0.487861872
not fluently,0.68564868
Ive not had a stroke,0.298832893
and I guess no Ive not had a serious illness,0.282430321
my sister had a mild stroke years ago,0.252419055
and this is the same one who just had cardiac surgery about a month ago,0.254835844
mhm,0
well shes still in the process,0.312979162
shes still shes in a nursing home now,0.272889435

she had the surgery,0.397852063
she had mitral valve whatever or a leaky valve or something,0.293373615
and so shes in a nursing home now,0.262586862
and shes feisty as ever,0.253109902
so yeah shes recovering and probably driving everybody crazy,0.308858365
thats off the record,0.332168281
a happy memory,0.440921545
and Ive done this in training so I I didnt pull this one out from outof the air,0.21389477
I was the president of the black alumni association at Collegename in,0.280701637
no I was the vice president many years ago,0.209330499
and we had the first black president of Collegename while youknow I was in the post of this office,0.252494544
and so we invited him for the community to meet the community,0.328309029
and I literally organized everything,0.434066057
and my father had a liquor store then,0.300476193
and I had the people in the liquor store the liquor business contribute,0.310856372
and I think people smoked then,0.376636088
PhillipMorris contributed cigarettes,0.525169015
and I had the chemical bank contribute money and had all kinds of youknow cheese,0.253273427
it was one of the best events they have ever had at the school,0.303767949
and they have said that,0.466541976
it was well attended by the whole community of Collegename,0.297041774
we did an instulement,0.400372356
we did everything for this guy,0.370385021
its still one of the things I like best,0.334094554
it really was,0.536793053
exactly,0.999999821
and even the president said,0.419814378
you should really have been the president,0.409603894
and I could have been,0.416016549
I just didnt want the job,0.344662458
I didnt realize I was gonna do his work anyway,0.297786593
right,0.999999821
so the little boy went out to play kickball that day,0.269049704
I forget what its a soccer ball I guess,0.282282948
and he never expected to when he kicked the ball that it went through the window somebodys window and broke it,0.305035949
went in,0.566411495
the gentleman who was in the house was shocked by the noise he heard,0.281164974
and he sees a ball coming,0.271548539
and he went to the window to find out who did this because he was gonna go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games,0.23950541
oh okay just the beginning middle and an end,0.261667311
okay so then I hafta look at it so you dont hafta hear all my thoughts,0.26525715
theres a mother getting ready to send her child off to school,0.270702213
she tried to urge him to take an umbrella,0.290163219
obviously shes heard the weather report,0.295089722
he went and he didnt listen to his mother,0.27629742
so he went out and got wet,0.269097358
when he came back he looked very sad,0.354308188
and his mother looked very annoyed,0.365061581
and the next time he took an umbrella,0.261445701
theres a whole lot going on here,0.351636827
well okay,0.538446307
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside,0.255005449
and he and he hes up on a tree for some reason,0.255187988
oh theres a ladder so he was obviously trying to do,0.237869635
oh he was trying to get her cat and from the ladder,0.20085679
and he the ladder fell,0.326352417
hes stuck up in the tree,0.215438142
the daughter is still upset because the cats still up the tree,0.295660943
the dog is barking because everythings outof sorts for him,0.278836131
and so the fire engine comes with a ladder ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them,0.278950721
dont do that again,0.42983377
yeah,1
not one of my favorite,0.326474041
I forgot all about this the wicked witch and her stepdaughters,0.28962934
okay you hid the text,0.270005465
you dont want me to know the text,0.340843052
I gotta I gotta make up my own,0.330719501
and cinderq means shes sweeping up the cinders from the chimney,0.302854478
and the ugly stepsisters,0.358307421
I dont remember this,0.453340232
they are talking about how theres some young lady theyve never seen before,0.310499609
I dont really remember,0.495378524
oh the invitation whatever,0.331366718
I dont really remember it too well,0.421509266
not one of my favorite stories but anyway,0.316435337
so she the wicked witch talks about the party,0.285907
the sisters dont want her to go,0.269932956
isnt that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly,0.272403717
and then the xxx fairy godmother helps her go,0.255183369
she captures the eye of the prince charming,0.362515658
she hasta leave before midnight,0.35128364
he doesnt know where she is,0.28678003
shes in her tatters,0.309769958
and her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin,0.234517276
the wicked godmother locks her in,0.339435995
but then they bring the key,0.435415119
and they take the key to the cellar,0.382131457
they try every maiden in the town whatever they call those old things parish to see who the shoe belongs to,0.240585461
and it belongs to Cinderella,0.284242958
and she marries the prince and gets prince and gets,0.334354818
lives happily ever after,0.419070125
Cinderella is this shes living with her wicked the wicked stepmother,0.27041322
I guess its her stepmother,0.350471139
I dont know where her father is,0.277059078
and the stepmother has these two not attractive daughters,0.365660787
and Cinderella shes very pretty but shes left in tatters and rags,0.237055674
her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the youknow the cinders from the whatevern,0.261178106
and the fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor,0.360568076
and so one day there was going to be a ball,0.282016158
the king,0.694988251
and he makes this announcement,0.331044912
and she wants to go aswellas his daughters her daughters,0.302404612
but theyre figuring whom you youknow,0.326062649
but her fairy godmother comes along to the rescue and tells her she will make youknow turn,0.251186758
get me a pumpkin and some rats whatever,0.297198713
and the pumpkin will be your coach,0.254080355
other rats will be your coachmen I think,0.272602081
she gets her a great dress or something to wear,0.291930854
her hair they dont even talk about all that,0.345646888
and so she goes,0.34825632
and the prince is dancing with all the young ladies but she captures his eye,0.298628867
and he dances with her,0.41944018
and ofcourse its love at first sight,0.303613007
and she realizes at the stroke of midnight she hasta be home,0.22532779
so she runs out there before he can find out who she is,0.264822096
and in running she drops one of her slippers,0.251341194
she runs into the coach which turns into a pumpkin before she can get home I think,0.209541842
the rats turn the coachmen turn into rats and whatever,0.302161336
so the the king the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to,0.289224267
hes gonna go to every house and see if the shoe fits,0.185664773
and the fairy godmother is like shes trying to get her daughters now I remember this their big feet into the shoes,0.227934435
no it doesnt work,0.360188127
and they say,0.439308643

and he whisks her off,0.317017853
and they get married,0.360645145
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
thats a long story,0.358423322
okay,0.99999994
how I would make it,0.465685278
from the word goq,0.450025409
go to the cabinet and take down a jar of peanut butter,0.225295708
Id probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something,0.272573024
so Id go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out,0.230570316
and go to the refrigerator where I also keep my bread,0.270057261
take out two slices of bread,0.30524838
Id put them open them there,0.353140295
I would take the peanut butter first,0.299738348
and smear it on the on one side of the bread,0.312776923
pretty thick though,0.562810183
I like alotof food,0.381387383
then Id take the jelly and put that on over top of the peanut butter still on the same side,0.24700129
and I would take the other side and put it down,0.321015924
and then I would take it and cut it in half,0.299633682
and then I would start eating it,0.39459765
I speak pretty well I think,0.461285114

my current favorite story is a day last year,0.234573454
it might have been the year before last,0.357106268
it was Christmas time getting towards Christmas time,0.374640882
and I was to meet some friends for lunch at Zaytinia downtown,0.255397975
and I realized when I got down there that I was an hour early,0.277907431
it was kinda cold,0.398290515
DC sets up a a kind of a Christmas bazaar down on GStreet,0.233732283
I guess its GStreet,0.38883844
and they had closed the street to traffic,0.374625772
and there were wonderful little kiosks along the street with really nice stuff,0.32425341
and I was kinda cold so I bought a wool beret,0.23008208
and then I felt fine,0.355839163
I walked around,0.427940696
and I walked I was walking up SeventhStreet,0.296265393
and up ahead of me on the right in descending letters it said RegalCinema,0.244858742
just across the street was another sign also descending that said LegalSeafood,0.34770745
and on the window of the bank facing me right below that sign was coming soon EagleBank,0.253044426
I love I love Washington,0.446779013
okay,0.99999994
I make up a story,0.304132819
okay,0.99999994
okay weve got a a a perfectly okay little boy playing with a soccer ball,0.253777474
and he kicks it,0.334304392
and it goes through the window of the house probably his own house,0.335691988
and it breaks the window knocks over a lamp and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father,0.263661772
who then picks up the ball stares out the window and probably swears at the at the little boy,0.24728182
this is another little boy,0.421181411
theyre alotof trouble,0.356689215
this little boy does not want to take an umbrella to school,0.285439849
you can tell hes going to school because hes got his backpack on,0.224193811
and his mothers trying to give him the umbrella,0.323926866
and hes saying,0.298381478
nope,1.000000119
and he walks out the door and waves goodbye,0.271126866
and it starts raining on him,0.339706063
and he runs home,0.339561373
and hes soaking wet,0.287484318
and his mother is frowning at him,0.306574136
and the next thing you see is him with walking with an umbrella,0.26344043
okay,0.99999994
the cat went up the tree,0.293781489
the little girl wants her kittycat down,0.364909321
and the father clearly tried to go up the tree and get it,0.295357108
and he got up there,0.317297965
and the ladder fell,0.391115069
okay,0.99999994
Cinderellas father married for the second time when Cinderellas mother had died,0.287012637
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters,0.294117123
and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her clean the fireplaces hence the name Cinderella,0.279375225
and do other menial work,0.393615276
at some point the prince of the whatever principality it was was in need of a wife,0.264218926
said his father and the I dont know minister of whatever marriages,0.228662342
so they cooked up a scheme to have a ball,0.301608056
and they sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality,0.337482303
Cinderella got one but she ofcourse could not did not think she could go because she didnt have the clothes or even transportation,0.306206912
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with white horses and a footman and soforth,0.264167845
so she was able to go to the ball,0.283982277
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight,0.298499823
she went to the ball,0.318856329
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated,0.344878882
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love,0.33277747
midnight came,0.652356923
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be outof there,0.285711616
so she hurried away,0.408102274
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her,0.253153741
she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth,0.251294106
but she managed to get home anyway,0.357117951
and later the the prince was very depressed,0.417082787
he had fallen in love with this woman,0.289646327
and she had disappeared,0.456158459
all he had left was a glass slipper,0.272747099
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else,0.316658735
so the his father who I guess was the king and the minister of marriages went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on,0.243299797
and ofcourse it would not fit anyone at all including the two unpleasant stepsisters,0.270928591
eventhough I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit try to fit in,0.223617032
but it still didnt work,0.415561229
and it got blood all over the place,0.337005675
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper,0.307596743
it was Cinderella,0.410175055
and ofcourse she was just a sladeyn,0.362970352
but he insisted that she try it on,0.374531806
and sure enough it fit,0.436737835
so he had found his bride,0.324407935
and there was great celebration throughout the land,0.426598132
and they got married and lived happily ever after,0.303366333
how I would make a peanut butter and,0.295583725
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it,0.343179166
but I you would I would take two pieces of bread,0.31867224
and Id put peanut butter on one using a knife,0.209626511
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread,0.249684006
and then Id put the two together,0.290401042
and I would probably slice it,0.389510602
because it would be for a kid Id probably slice it in quarters,0.263155073
well not bad,0.525102317
Ive given several speeches,0.29668957
haltingly,1.000000119
Ive had prestroke incidents,0.382866442
TIAs,1
serious illness yes,0.486414224
I was flat on my back for a year at age ten with rheumatic fever,0.18904914
the days before there were antibiotics,0.406064898
so there was no way to cure it,0.352021664
and I was one of the few who survived at that time,0.276720464
that was one of the close calls,0.365761667
well I I was when when they told me I could get up I was very happy,0.330540389
and I was gonna go out and play baseball,0.199976012
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed,0.268930614
I hadta learn to walk again,0.391553491
so I got into all sorts of athletic activities,0.272790134
my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again,0.210231066
and he also bought a one arm printing press because he wanted me to exercise on this printing press,0.289302826
so I went into business printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve,0.221417338
but I I maintained some form of athleticism all the way up until up up up until the time that I enlisted in the in the navy,0.263428956
I was a long distance runner in school,0.264735758
I played basketball with half hour quarters,0.270091265
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time laughs,0.291902572
and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and got into as much of that as I could,0.245513856
and I think it had a salutary effect,0.26719448
thats the naval air core flight test which is the toughest physical,0.303832769
its four days of physical examinations aswellas academic,0.280341387
you hadta be at the top top ten percent of your class to get started,0.209628001
then came the physical,0.468911231
that was a challenge,0.467631042
and so thats why I got into the navy,0.245934561
yeah theres no theres no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever,0.284387201
the few other people who survived the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort,0.226081163
and the first time I went through the navy exam they said,0.277247667
well youve had rheumatic fever,0.335458606
you have a heart condition,0.39576602
get out,0.628203452
so when I went back again I I checked to make sure I didnt,0.357489139
and then I went back again,0.427173793
and I didnt fill out the paper first,0.222467393
I went through the exam and got through got to the end and they said,0.268983722
well have you had any conditions,0.417466283
yes rheumatic fever,0.476567864
well you you cant be here then,0.367685616
and I said,0.329179674
well I just passed your exam,0.339400917
well alright if you wanna go go,0.428752601
oh theres so many,0.334968418
what kind of a story do you wanna hear,0.298568636
well there there was there was one interesting time when I was when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasnt working,0.254213631
we we had a we had a good program by all appearances,0.257871479
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms,0.29243353
and they looked like an army,0.318442076
and theyd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight,0.233746544
and still malaria,0.496289313
why,0.99999994
so I went out looking for answers,0.318519741
and on this one occasion I drove for across this desert area for about oh musta been six hours,0.2062435
Id been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark,0.210006058
and Im getting alittle concerned,0.323485553
I was also warned about the Danakil people also called Afars,0.25066635
very no I dont think youd call it hostile,0.306867421
but they didnt have many friends because their their the way they qualify for marriage,0.358071893
they had these mass weddings that were made,0.387443423
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body,0.329288632
so after about six hours we happened upon this little group of tuplesn round mud houses,0.231389731
and we stopped the Landrover,0.335798264
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys,0.264961779
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars,0.272746265
I thought,0.680924118
boy I shouldnt be here,0.33300513
and it turned out that about a third of the community maybe more were down with malaria,0.273248225
and they assumed that I was a physician because theyd the only white people they had seen before were physicians,0.318886817
just by sheer accident I had a car full of medication,0.218159974
so for about the next two hours I was a physician laughs,0.211830437
peering under eyelids and and baby bottoms and and administering this medicine,0.349808633
and at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy,0.294521004
and suddenly the chief appeared,0.368301302
seven feet high long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice,0.241295457
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests,0.225026354
I said,0.525946558
whats that,0.52037257
they said,0.538892329
smoked camels milk,0.510657549
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days,0.231555194
I said,0.525946558
apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but,0.322525173
and the driver kicked me and he said,0.267809123
youve been doing fine up until now FirstnameJ,0.290612161
dont ruin it,0.437342763
so we had smoked camels milk,0.336244375
its better than PeptoBismol,0.481338233
it really works,0.605122149
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds,0.282528341
and the chief got a big smile on his face,0.225423694
it all ended well,0.393905342
I dont know whether this is in your interview or not,0.273919612
but at my age I very often forget the word that I want to say,0.271533519
and its getting alittle worse laughs,0.339400321
names especially,0.64969337
well the dad sends the son out to get alittle exercise,0.239800677
and he finds the soccer ball ending in his lap,0.253703415
and he looks out there and he says,0.309735388
good shot son,0.38009119
end of story,0.401563108
oh this reminds me of my childhood,0.282932431
mom wants son to take an umbrella with him,0.222084656
and he says,0.357835323
I dont need that,0.442907065
its just something to get in the way,0.347790152
and is surprised on his trip by running into a rain storm,0.220933646
he comes home drenching wet,0.328546971
mother says,0.589775503
I told you so,0.502021849
and son has learned a lesson,0.295623034
just like my childhood,0.494125336
this this is an instant right outof my life,0.304419279
girls girls cat has crawled up into the tree,0.235337719
and the dad says,0.2825315
well Ill go fetch it,0.291450948
why is the dog barking,0.322865725
I dont know,0.538106382
possibly because theres a man in the tree,0.322874665
and in the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder,0.271789014
somebody called for help,0.389391363
here comes the firemen to get him outof the tree,0.280118763
this happened to the fellow next door to me,0.316817969
when I had a house nearby he got up on the roof to repair it and accidentally kicked down the ladder,0.248165205
and he called me over and said,0.285155743
can you pick the ladder up,0.317595094
and I said,0.329179674
well not for a while,0.425719172
I wanna call the neighbors here,0.344585299
maybe I can charge admission to see this,0.340397924
mhm,0
vaguely,1.000000119
this goes way back,0.482768655
wow I dont remember this version,0.291706204
yeah,1
these these two first two pages I dont remember at all,0.272021413
xxx,1
good lord,0.5502882
this is gonna be tough to remember,0.274508566
flipping though book,0.490763724
something missing here,0.668443561
oh there it is,0.370589972
whats with the key,0.342765689
I dont remember that part,0.359144092
humming,0.999999821
and I dont remember those first two pages,0.249671981
but I gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who lives on an estate,0.267786264
and is is to have a ball maybe coming out party,0.255167484
I dont know,0.538106382
is that the way the story goes,0.393901914
mhm,0
well as I recall Cinderella and and her sisters were all workers in this estate,0.255535215
and she being the youngest one was the most discriminated against,0.382845044
the others treated her badly,0.407876581
she always got the worst tasks to perform and longed for a different life,0.281833112
I dont remember the bit about the key her,0.251585245
her sister locks her in the room,0.345420301
I dont know,0.538106382
well that comes alittle later,0.413450003
a fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because shes been such a good person,0.257299393
and the arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight,0.24028255
and at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her,0.245398402
but then hasta flee on schedule to avoid the being converted back into a chambermaid,0.269523025
and in the process loses her shoe,0.286817551
the handsome gentleman upon upon discovering the shoe determines hes gonna look for a person that that that fits,0.256288886
and the evil sisters are determined its gonna be one of them,0.244893476
so that must be where the key comes in,0.329948157
they lock her room,0.413787931
I dont know I dont recall how she gets out,0.346474767
but at any rate its eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits,0.315544158
and everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters,0.290921599
almond butter,0.851922035

and he is kicking a soccer ball,0.275571644
and the boy is kicking the ball into the air,0.320606619
and it seems like the ball is in the second picture going through a window the window of a house,0.298304051
not sure if its his house or a neighbors house,0.296764225
but its breaking the window and going inside,0.412992448

but it breaks through the window,0.419846147
and the ball comes right at him,0.32556951
and the man in the picture seems to be alot older,0.259479553
probably very scared and startled,0.493485332
and he going into the fourth frame picks the ball up and looks out the broken window to to see if he could see who kicked the ball through the window,0.252287924
I see a a lady and a smaller child,0.296045184
I do not know if its a mother daughter,0.291440994
the lady is holding an umbrella,0.28878662
they seem to be talking,0.432587594
and in the second it seems to be a little girl but not sure,0.299057633
the second frame they seem to be continuing the discussion,0.372223079
and the older lady seems to be holding the umbrella and listening to the child,0.311428368
and it seems like the child is discussing the fact that he or she does not need the umbrella,0.308876723
and the child goes out into the outside in frame three,0.331626385
and they notice he or she notices its starting to rain,0.305193275
and he or she puts her hand out and feels the raindrops,0.255511612
and this childs going somewhere because theres a backpack on his or her shoulder,0.295438111

Im presuming its the mom,0.224833176
and hes soaking wet,0.287484318
and the mother presumably gives the child an umbrella,0.368647814
and the child goes back outside in the rain with the umbrella open and goes off to wherever theyre going,0.289062053
okay here,0.713770688

and theres a little girl underneath the branch where the cat is sitting,0.306895077
and her tricycle is there along with a ladder,0.292948365
and to the right of the tree the fire department two fire men are bringing a ladder presumably to rescue the cat from the tree which the older gentleman seems to be trying to rescue,0.275523692
but from the look on his face has not succeeded,0.280420601
and the little girl is very upset because she thinks the cat is endangered,0.290162772
okay Cinderella was a young lady who lived with her two stepsisters and stepmother,0.261048168
and they treated her very badly and made her do alotof work,0.278127462
and one day a gentleman came to their house and announced that there would be a ball that the king was having for the prince to find a wife a princess for the prince,0.292770386
and they were all very excited,0.420233101
and Cinderella thought she was going,0.325396597
but her mother stepmother said,0.496754944
no shes not going,0.344115913
just the two other sisters were going,0.388348818
and she was very sad,0.314486057
and they got ready to go to the ball and left,0.311160326
and as Cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses,0.260747015
and they went to the ball,0.364615798
but the fairy godmother said,0.335898995
you hafta be home by twelve oclock or everything will disappear at twelve oclock,0.183187947
so she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time,0.268600464
and the prince fell in love with her at the ball,0.280812532
and it was just about twelve oclock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes crystal shoes at the ball,0.217587829
and she barely made it home,0.336716563
and poof the carriage and horses turned back into the pumpkin and mice,0.29943496
the prince wanted to find her,0.367666274
took the shoe and made a decree that theyd check every girl in the village until Cinderella was found,0.210399777
and they came to the house,0.411865026
and her two stepsisters they tried the shoe on but it wouldnt fit,0.246845007
and they finally found Cinderella,0.383978426
and they put the shoe on Cinderella,0.258025587
and it fit,0.414818168
and Cinderella was reunited with the prince,0.348809063
they got married and lived happily ever after,0.302667856

okay a young boy is out in the yard playing soccer,0.191632196
hes in his front yard playing soccer,0.224866182
and he kicks the ball,0.333056271
and it goes through his neighbors window into the neighbors family room where the neighbor is sitting there watching television,0.303008378
and it goes right in to where the neighbor is sitting,0.316967875
and the neighbor is jumping up,0.307059616
he jumps up to find out where that soccer ball came from,0.242909491
he looks out into the yard to see who kicked the soccer ball,0.226428419
okay,0.99999994
okay little Johnny is getting ready to go off to school,0.233975127
and his mother as as hes getting ready to walk out the door his mother says,0.239495084

Ill be fine,0.337402701
he gets outside,0.42280212
hes walking,0.339315981
and it starts to rain,0.356020004
and it rains harder and harder and harder,0.479082942
so he turns around,0.378836453
and he runs home and goes inside,0.318016142
and hes drenched,0.237902358
and his mother asks him,0.423951685
whats wrong,0.493209422
and he says,0.357835323
I need my umbrella,0.387143314
so then she gives him the umbrella,0.315438658
and he takes it and goes out back outside in the rain where he isnt going to get wet anymore,0.23244974
but I believe he has changed his clothes first before he goes back outside because he goes outside dry,0.28690809
and he stays dry with the umbrella,0.282901555
okay,0.99999994
everything I see,0.557238638
okay,0.99999994
okay,0.99999994
Fluffy the cat has been chased up the tree by the family dog,0.219923973
and little Lucy whose cat it is sees her cat up in the tree and tells her dad who comes out and climbs up into the tree with a ladder,0.195859984
but the ladder falls down,0.38731277
so hes stuck up in the tree,0.212578014
the cat is still up in the tree,0.282352448
the firemen come to help get the cat outof the tree and her dad outof the tree,0.228839099
so the firemen have arrived,0.382144243
and theres help thats come to help get the cat outof the tree,0.252858132
yes,0.999999881
yes,0.999999881
so I can use details eventhough there were no pictures about them,0.344727457
oh okay,0.663836598
so Cinderella,0.50247395
her father remarried a woman after her mother died,0.43550086
and this woman had two daughters,0.337632716
and so Cinderella came to live with her father and her stepmother and two stepsisters,0.331378728
and then her father passed away,0.411227345
and she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters,0.388432652
so they were very mean to Cinderella,0.339799911
and she became like a housekeeper for them,0.266098142
she did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked,0.31613788
and and they treated mistreated her,0.513263762
so one day there was a ball given by the king and queen to find a suitable wife for their son the prince,0.244294822
so the invitation came,0.377943158
and the stepsisters were all excited,0.399748206
but poor Cinderella she couldnt go,0.275482029
she didnt have the clothes,0.287303329
her stepmother and stepsisters said she wasnt invited to the kings ball,0.244443998
so she she wished she could go to the ball,0.324675709
but she had no way to do that,0.367252231
and she was very sad,0.314486057
and so the night of the ball the stepsisters get to go to the ball,0.303979188
theyre all dressed up,0.351646394
theyre very fancy and and ready to go to the ball,0.289626956
and out the door they go,0.335055768
Cinderella is down in the basement,0.306709617
and shes crying,0.343393147
and allofasudden her fairy godmother appears and asks why shes crying,0.277105808
and she says she wished she could go to the ball,0.281289548
and so the fairy godmother said that she could,0.331665039
and she fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into carriage drivers,0.292418122
and they had she had horses for the carriage,0.372264683
and she casts the spell,0.325222939
and Cinderella has a beautiful dress,0.31810981
and she her hair is beautiful,0.338601887
she has a beautiful dress,0.361799419
and she says,0.378272772
you will go to the ball,0.349359185
go to the ball,0.34578684
but one one rule is that at twelve oclock midnight you must be home by twelve oclock because all of this magic is going to go away,0.22427398
Cinderella goes off to the ball,0.272026002
she gets there,0.463335097
the prince becomes smitten with her when he sees her,0.312929213
hes dancing with her,0.311960727
her stepsisters are just seething because who is this who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with,0.306884706
they wanted to be chosen by the prince,0.321623176
and the night is going wonderfully,0.357142568
and then she hears the clock strike twelve,0.321364909
and she remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken,0.262174517
and she runs out and down the stairs leaving the prince behind,0.324675351
and as shes running down the stairs one of her glass slippers comes off,0.223020568
because when the fairy godmother cast the spell she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing,0.277969867
one of them gets left behind on the steps,0.292291611
and she runs home,0.350958258
and she she gets home before youknow as the spell is being broken,0.231670558
well the prince is very smitten with her,0.312536746
and he wonders who this beautiful woman was,0.33317861
and he wants to find throughout the kingdom where this m who this woman is,0.26525721
so he sets out he finds the glass slipper on the steps,0.23537612
knows it belongs to her,0.33462429
and he sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper,0.243965819
who does that shoe belong to,0.338971883
so they go throughout the kingdom trying the glass slipper on all of these women,0.273023337
and noone can wear the glass slipper,0.253054142
it fits noone,0.339620382
so they finally get to the house where Cinderella is living,0.308074325
but shes downstairs,0.364020407
and theyre keeping her in the basement because they know that the prince is coming,0.333362788
and they dont want her out youknow out and about where she could talk with him,0.273169875
and he tries the glass slipper on her two sisters,0.260063559
and it does not fit,0.389264226
and hes wondering,0.332848251
is there anyone else that this could be youknow this shoe could fit,0.348685056
and so Cinderella they realize that Cinderella is there,0.341505885
and he asks the the the the kings the princes assistant asks for her to try on the shoe,0.301447719
she tries the shoe on,0.283943981
and its a perfect match,0.384478003
and he takes that news back to the prince,0.328849137
the prince summons Cinderella,0.43421948
he realizes she is the the young lady that he was smitten with,0.30166927
and they are married,0.402466238
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
and she never hasta be the housekeeper for her stepsisters again,0.273505449
and so they live happily ever after,0.374748856
I would get a loaf of bread,0.269922972
and get the peanut butter outof the cabinet and the jelly outof the refrigerator,0.26792416
and I would remove two slices of bread from the loaf of bread,0.278546989
I would open the peanut butter jar and take peanut butter on a knife and spread it across the bread,0.25281322
then I would spread open the jelly and spread jelly on top of the peanut butter,0.252930939
and then take the second slice of bread and put it on top of the first slice that has the peanut butter and jelly on it,0.258723021
okay,0.99999994
I do very well speaking English,0.337928772
Im a native English speaker,0.242034495
Ive been speaking since I guess the normal age,0.269635856
when do kids start to speak,0.369468689
a couple of,0.385432094
young very young,0.703061998
and Ive been reading pretty young,0.291568398
Ive learned sortof selftaught myself to read when I was about four,0.286920339
so I was reading pretty well by kindergarten,0.276618242
my speech is I think fluent and generally understandable,0.332418829
I talk alittle fast sometimes,0.44074744
thats about it,0.447779983
no not really no,0.614239275
not that I know of,0.408869773
yes my mother had a stroke,0.2961092
and my grandfather had two small strokes,0.293268412
my grandfathers strokes or my mothers,0.343889594
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four,0.300505579
so she was very young,0.420174599
they think it was because she had blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx in her in her atria,0.244605705
and then she youknow unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid,0.204902664
and it basically took out essentially a fistsized portion of her left hemisphere,0.325736851
so its left her pretty severely impaired,0.318455905
my grandfathers strokes were smaller,0.303402185
I believe they were right hemisphere,0.441345423
he had some serious apraxia,0.401667893
but he had no evidence of aphasia,0.318639904
he was still able to read and write and did not make alotof effort to speak,0.269583523
I was fairly young,0.376421392
and he was hemiparesis and used a wheelchair,0.321631789
but again he also just was very stubborn,0.387056231
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all,0.262696743
he just sortof refused to do it,0.397917986
so he kindof just lived in his own head for the last maybe ten years of his life,0.238091975
shes been pretty good,0.319331467
its been ten and a half years now almost eleven years,0.324971288
yeah its been a long time,0.301787764
shes been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then,0.283782035
initially she did about a month,0.320327729
initially she was after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute,0.327350438
so she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname,0.215496048
she was there for about a month,0.302525938
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks,0.272913724
and actually no sorry she went home,0.289376259
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting,0.287372142
and then after that went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks,0.345723838
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT and got to about the,0.248473406
she was not as cooperative with that,0.37304166
she found it very uncomfortable,0.45860672
and right and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress,0.311782539
especially given that she was not willing to to work at home besides doing range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own,0.261505842
shes very good about that,0.38166675
so we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay outof physical therapy,0.237165451
and she shes doing that,0.367357403
and then but we we continue to do speech therapy,0.365445435
weve done it here for at this point I guess almost ten years,0.278009266
and shes done a mix of group and individual,0.267092407
and she goes to an adult daycare program where shes very social,0.25839442
we dont spend alotof time with friends outside of that,0.244344071
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then,0.27884081
but we hafta make an effort unless shes sick or has something else going on to get outof the house at least once a day even if its just for a small short activity,0.206898227
it can its its hard,0.42935428
it takes alotof time and effort,0.334599614
and for her not every activity is easy,0.324109226
so,0.99999994
see now you make me wanna think of a really good story,0.317665935
well Ive told you about my mom,0.306338787
thats probably the like the singular event thats most significant,0.392760277
okay Ill tell you a story,0.289636672
this is a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird,0.301542103
but its so clear in my mind and it still doesnt make any sense,0.297908664
so my first semester of my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname,0.222453877
but my family was from DC,0.246777475
and I had a car,0.294360757
so I would drive back and forth over break time with my car,0.295100749
its about a thousand miles,0.338996589
so it generally takes about two days,0.312889159
so the first semester back its winter and Im driving across IEighty which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with alotof corn,0.206065863
so it is an extremely boring repetitive drive,0.379595846
there is alotof youknow driver tunnel vision that happens,0.266786605
and its cold and gray so its not even pretty green fields,0.323937714
its just empty empty empty fields,0.43760556
but Im Im kindof proud of myself because its my first semester went well,0.206175059
I was youknow independent excited,0.287048966
so Im on IEighty in sortof the middle of Illinois,0.18906112
and there is a slowdown,0.368226737
and its very flat so I can see ahead,0.2696428
I dont see that there is construction,0.295451999
I dont really see an accident,0.305514425
but I youknow figure somethings happened probably a minor accident,0.358209699
it looks like its a rubbernecking delay,0.348547131
its kindof pissing me off,0.338416755
IEighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction,0.291205168
and theres ke no exits nothing built along it,0.233225301
and we get closer and closer and closer,0.446109772
and I still cannot see whats going on,0.301447809
Im just like,0.409400791
what could this be,0.51511097
and we get alittle closer,0.402636528
and I see okay it looks like Im in the left lane,0.200313434
and then theres a median between the youknow east bound and west bound routes,0.310437024
and Im going east,0.244880557
and I can see that theres something over in the median to my left,0.261614919
and it looks as I get closer like an animal,0.269883037
and I get closer,0.348084867
and it looks like a fairly large animal,0.370214939
and Im thinking,0.300175965
is it a cow,0.386664212
is it a moose,0.383428961
Imean there wouldnt be a moose in Illinois,0.215339333
but it looks it looks fairly large and theres something unusual about it,0.391940147
so Im alittle more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay,0.288763434
but Im still kindof internally rolling my eyes going,0.322844476
why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal,0.272272944
wasting my time,0.477615774
I just wanna get home,0.45724982
and I get closer and I can see that theres these kindof large hind legs,0.273781896
so its oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car,0.315157473
and theres kindof a long tail,0.324413627
and its brown,0.492360443
and its this big hump,0.279599726
and Im getting closer and closer and closer,0.369070143
and I youknow my mind is doing that thing where its just trying to do the pattern matching going,0.299968719
what is this thing,0.54831326
I dont,0.563904762
its not a cow,0.344224989
its not a deer,0.353379607
its too big to be a dog,0.268238962
and Im literally as Im passing it ke my head is,0.183060646
youknow were just creeping along,0.349707514
my head is sortof like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view,0.32208997
and its only until its ke at my shoulder and I passed it that it my mind kindof pattern matches and goes,0.231080011
its a kangaroo,0.416423678
and then youknow again I hafta turn around and look at the road,0.236272752
and everythings cleared up behind me,0.344648629
and I spent like the next five miles going,0.244945288
thats no way it was a kangaroo,0.28253746
but it wasnt anything else,0.388358504
it was a kangaroo,0.383054793
it was clearly a kangaroo,0.376494825
I saw the ears,0.311955929
I saw the big massive tail,0.312828094
I saw the big hind legs,0.293147504
I saw the little tiny front legs,0.325306654
it was a kangaroo,0.383054793
and so to this day its this thing where I just dont know,0.32979241
I just dont know,0.530531764
I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo,0.327309072
Ive even start Imean this was,0.343313992
okay so this was the winter of two thousand two thousand one,0.290802836
so the internet was a thing but its not like,0.356766671
Google was around but there werent really if you didnt know how to search,0.283639014
and I think Ive subsequently every now and then done like kangarooq roadkillq kindof to see if theres any any information about this but no,0.30580762
Im pretty sure it was a kangaroo,0.260785937
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that,0.356398642
so its not a significant story,0.354708314
but it is kindof a funny story,0.391911209
I just dont know how,0.491455615
I just I am so certain and so uncertain,0.413635522
and I mostly just kindof like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going,0.345568836
what,1.000000119
it doesnt have a neat little conclusion,0.299926341
I dont know,0.538106382
I dont know,0.538106382
if it wasnt a kangaroo thered be no story of it,0.21656926
it couldnt be anything,0.447972029
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo,0.357984662
Imean it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind Imean massive hind feet,0.289251685
I dont know what else it possibly could have been,0.395295978
anything else that it might have been a wallaby or something like that,0.407614708
wallabys are pretty small,0.493268639
it still wouldnt have been in Illinois,0.273986995
Imean basically if its not a dog or a cow or a deer its something that shouldnt be there,0.291739434
okay what am I looking at,0.308394074
okay,0.99999994
okay,0.99999994
a beginning and middle and end,0.455232561
alright so theres a little boy named Ralph,0.220021337
Ralph is a science geek kid,0.212608397
his dad is a former athlete,0.268252581
his dad is always on Ralphs back about youknow,0.189788133

and youknow its fine if you like science and you wanna become an astronaut,0.236602351
but youknow you still gotta learn some skills,0.325461596
so here I bought you this this soccer ball sothat you can youknow,0.346645474
its easy to play soccer,0.307723284
all you hafta do is run around,0.237872109

and his dad says,0.303622425
listen if you if you dont do this then Im gonna hafta severely restrict your internet time to get you to be a wellrounded kid,0.262931794
so finally Ralph goes outside,0.264428377
and hes practicing with the soccer ball,0.281376928
and ofcourse hes pretty terrible,0.311992437
and he he cant quite get it,0.288356543
he keeps doing the CharlieBrown thing running up to it missing almost falling down,0.322825283
and finally finally finally he kicks it,0.486131877
it arcs high,0.418874145
he sees it,0.438891888
it goes toward the house toward the house toward the house into the living room,0.383270264
Ralphs dad well call him Jake looks up,0.20605889
and the soccer ball comes in and it knocks over this lamp,0.252941281
but thats okay,0.40419668
its an ugly lamp,0.27643621
he hates the lamp,0.316823751
his wife might be mad but youknow for now,0.235952944
and hes just hes getting really angry,0.312760949
and he gets up and he sees he he walks over to the the window,0.278464586
and he looks out,0.346581817
and hes like,0.297184765
Ralph,1
and Ralphs like,0.347293377
I was just practicing,0.423733413

the dad Jake sighs and is like,0.192601889
yeah you can use the internet,0.355145305
he gives up at that point on ever making his son wellrounded and decides his son will just be the best damn astronaut that ever there was,0.227320701
the end,0.63970381
okay,0.99999994
well this ones pretty simple,0.493310928
theres a mom,0.3069745
well call her Sally,0.376657307
and theres a kid,0.27994895
well call him Andre,0.290734261
Sally has bought Andre a really really ugly umbrella,0.241219878
Andre refuses to use it,0.289358586
he gives it back,0.369263738
he says to his mom,0.308749557
listen mom,0.596212506
Im gonna go out,0.287984878
its going to be fine,0.321998417
I dont think theres gonna be rain,0.257667303
Im a meteorology nerd,0.236076817
I saw on our local news my favorite meteorologist said theres no way theres gonna be rain,0.16260165
so you keep your ugly umbrella,0.374963075
and if it does rain Ill come back and you get to say that you were right,0.289384037
so ofcourse little Andre did I say goes out into the weather,0.233533069
and it immediately starts raining,0.438088
he thinks,0.59624052
ah gosh darn it,0.450784177
that meteorologist Im gonna hafta start watching channel nine instead of channel seven,0.166651577
he runs back inside,0.397475928
hes very upset,0.308472633
he looks at his mom and he goes,0.256483287
you were right,0.478274345
the the channel seven guy was wrong,0.28449443
and mom says,0.314412147
well I told you so,0.412717551
and you told me I could tell you so,0.392499149
heres your umbrella,0.436436415
and little Andre goes out,0.265596777
and hes got his umbrella,0.225529298
and hes in the rain,0.280063868
and he just thinks,0.416734189
well I guess Im a channel nine viewer now,0.227501675
the end,0.63970381
alright,0.999999881
theres a little girl Jenny,0.286490649
she has a cat named Moggy,0.282561064
Moggy shes trying to play dressup with Moggy,0.277637333
Moggy gets very upset,0.441541791
he manages to dash outof the door where he encounters the dog named Goldie,0.190964043
Goldie starts barking at Moggy,0.32849583
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard,0.289099276
meanwhile little girl Jenny runs after them,0.288083166
she starts yelling and yelling and yelling,0.507404387
the cat wont come down,0.235491142
hes terrified little Moggy,0.355233967
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder and tries to to carry it,0.246616393
its very awkward,0.43064636
into the yard,0.412777036
shes dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up,0.22981374
he sees her out the window and starts yelling,0.30287984
no Jenny no thats too dangerous,0.307884902
so the dad comes grabs the ladder sits it against the tree climbs up it to try to get Moggy,0.227409512
as hes climbing up the tree Goldie the dog knocks the ladder over,0.205487072
poor dad is stuck in the tree,0.219915152
the ladder is too unwieldy for little Jenny,0.227858603
she runs back to the house,0.330961376
she calls the nineoneone,0.428283066
the fire department comes running out,0.379339188
on her way back she grabs her tricycle and tricyclesv out to the tree just to youknow save time,0.252471536
and all this time the the fire department comes out,0.38455829
they rescue dad,0.419632077
they rescue Moggy after alotof difficulty,0.324284822
and this whole time this little bird is just singing enjoying the show,0.369889945
the end,0.63970381
sure,0.999999881
okay,0.99999994
well I remember Cinderella but I will give it a first shot,0.268725723
ohboy,0
its very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella,0.25456664
okay,0.99999994
onceuponatime there was a little girl named Ella,0.258063972
she was the daughter of two loving parents,0.306962729
only one day when shes a little girl her mother dies suddenly,0.320996523
its very tragic,0.407539368
everybody cries,0.625430763
everybody loved her mother,0.548468947
her father in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own,0.229359925
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures,0.377895176
he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps,0.244723454
until the father partly outof heartbreak and partly outof just a really bad diet also dies,0.241531715
at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy,0.264912933
they make her run around working all the time then begin mocking her for being dirty,0.316129684
and they call her Cinderella,0.311320901
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are,0.343458652
so one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other brides all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people,0.287891388
or perhaps hes commanded to hold a ball,0.229753628
and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match,0.260841042
so the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this,0.352477074
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns,0.306007296
Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to youknow get outof the house and to have a bit of glamour,0.202600315
but ofcourse they wont let her,0.330440432
because they they tell her that she would be an embarrassment,0.406682998
but mostly they dont want the competition,0.336232781
so they go off to the ball,0.328293979
and Cinderella is left alone sortof brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house,0.255909383
and she begins crying,0.38728112
and shes crying and crying by the fireplace when allofasudden a woman materializes from the flames and says,0.273911953
Cinderella why are you crying,0.334281385
Cinderella says,0.483765066
I just I just wanted to go to the ball,0.385860324
I just wanted one night of happiness and joy,0.321480215
and the woman says,0.360824466
well I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this,0.245580643
so can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs,0.283000052
and youre already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do,0.265753567
and she waves her wand,0.393208683
and the pumpkin turns into a carriage,0.334310293
and her ball her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown and her slippers into slippers of cut glass,0.235729232
and youknow none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling,0.265793532
and she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen,0.285184443
and Cinderella is just overcome with joy,0.276591629
and she gets into the carriage,0.3547059
and shes about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says,0.243671626
unfortunately my magical power is limited,0.336526781
and at midnight when the the chimes go everything will turn back,0.314758629
so make sure that you are well away from the ball and and out of youknow an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens,0.280185103
so Cinderella says,0.360751361
I will I will,0.542298555
and she waves goodbye,0.344051838
she goes off to the ball,0.296550632
and she arrives,0.419076771
and its even more dazzling than she thought,0.381620795
and she comes in,0.354023337
and everybody is just enchanted with her because shes beautiful and charming,0.332574069
and in the midst of of her being greeting by by throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up,0.265208095
and he sees her,0.374631166
and he asks her to dance,0.338915408
and they begin to dance,0.435197651
and ofcourse theyre both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that theyd have really cute kids together,0.3115246
and the prince is is about to propose to her there and then on the spot,0.31000185
and the clock begins to strike twelve,0.329294831
and she says,0.378272772
ohno oh yeah I need to go,0.346944481
she she runs off,0.41998291
and the prince is kindof stumped for a minute,0.258265465
hes thinking,0.370665044
wait a minute,0.40345037
theres a lady running away from me,0.239477098
what is this about,0.486213684
so she gets a good head start,0.31613785
eventhough shes wearing heels of glass she runs outof the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach the prince chasing after her all the while,0.224348113
on the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes,0.256429315
she doesnt have time to stop and pick it up,0.253068417
she leaps into the coach,0.2710118
it starts racing outof the palace grounds and and down the road as the clock youknow slowly strikes midnight,0.256261349
and on the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and and her clothes back into rags,0.302543283
and she hasta run the rest of the way home,0.282092571
the prince has been unable to catch up with her in time,0.272153914
he did not have a coach at the ready youknow being in his own palace and all,0.217893943
but he has the shoe,0.33896023
and he looks at the shoe,0.264409959
and its its very delicate and tiny,0.434694797
and he thinks,0.406649709
I have a clue,0.361366868
and I shall not rest until I find this woman because truly shes the hottest lady Ive ever seen,0.247898296
its gotta be her,0.223973468
nobody else,0.74397856
so he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest but still a kingdom,0.266042471
and goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person every woman of eligible age,0.267732918
and it doesnt fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason,0.289306998
and finally he gets to to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother,0.321060359
and he tries the shoe on the first stepsister,0.30206877
and it doesnt fit,0.307662129
and he tries it on the second stepsister,0.30150345
and it doesnt fit,0.307662129
and hes about to leave when he he sees in the corner of the courtyard this this little servant girl,0.247620672
and shes shes sweeping away all of the dust,0.249358684
and he just has a sense,0.353623748
he has a sense,0.401751518
he says,0.504161835
I dont know,0.538106382
shes kindof dirty but she looks kindof hot,0.344082981
I dont remember if shes as hot as the lady I saw last night but lets give it a go,0.191155791
so he he calls her over,0.384164691
and the stepmother the whole time is like,0.383982956
no no it couldnt be her,0.338782728
shes just a gutter wench,0.277549952
you dont want anything to do with her,0.373708516
shes dumb,0.338757098
shes ugly,0.36201641
shes infertile,0.363699377
why not consider one of my daughters,0.300821006
youknow theyre they might not be your first choice but theyre a pretty good second bet,0.297738194
the prince continues to wave her away,0.342637092
and he approaches Cinderella,0.36303696
and he asks her to try on the shoe,0.244438693
and she does,0.385054022
and ofcourse it fits,0.368467093
and he thinks,0.406649709
good enough for me,0.433532476
and he whisks her away,0.334083825
and they marry,0.451715887
and depending on your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters,0.275691211
possibly they just feel really bad,0.565013587
supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after,0.381220341
the end,0.63970381
well,1.000000119
lets assume that,0.433239818
Im not gonna make the bread from scratch or grow the peanuts,0.187854454
you would go to the grocery store purchase bread whatever kind of bread that you like,0.33136934
if its not already been sliced you would need to slice it at home or have it sliced at the grocery store or bakery wherever you prefer,0.256315976
take two slices of bread,0.342440486
take a jar of peanut butter,0.292109877
again if you wanna buy youknow your organic custom ground at WholeFoods you can do that,0.261511803
or you could just get youknow your jar of generic Jif from Giant,0.18658343
also jelly or jam or preserves,0.310416818
theres very little difference between the two,0.362621099
Im sure somebody could tell you,0.390899926
grape is traditional,0.468840927
also purchase that at a grocery store,0.333079368
open both up both of those jars,0.332864553
might need one of those assistant little clamper things if its really on tight,0.310840547
you need a plate,0.444213659
put one piece of bread on the plate,0.302417189
take a knife,0.402715951
spread first the peanut butter on the bread,0.353440553
then inorderto avoid cross contamination clean the knife,0.371893287
put it in the jelly,0.275401026
spread the jelly on the other slice of bread,0.325891674
put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing eachother,0.326839685
not outward,0.627373338
its not a sticky sandwich,0.322512388
and then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across,0.307187647
and then stick it in your mouth then chew,0.336183995
well this looks like theres going to be a little bit of a disaster,0.304169446
looks like Dads up in a tree and cant get down,0.190060988
it looks like he was chasing the cat up there trying to get the cat down,0.263232052
dogs barking at the bottom of the tree because the cat aint,0.226040006
Dads just sitting there going,0.49021548
ohdear,0
and then must be his daughter whos trying to catch the cat incase he does fall down,0.222843036
and theres yeah evidently Dad lost his ladder,0.208416477
and the firemen are coming,0.458378106
and theyre coming with a ladder,0.309505224
and hopefully they get them all down and everything is okay,0.362012565
well this looks like theyre out in the country with a couple a man and a woman in a car,0.275288105
and theyre driving,0.425296187
you can see a farmhouse,0.345351607
so its close to farms and in the country,0.373559117
theres a farmer by a little tree there,0.301665455
and hes waving at them and saying hello,0.240344062
theyre waving back,0.41468209
evidently they must be lost,0.417306453
the man takes took out the a map,0.30417645
and then the farmer is giving them directions and pointing to where and how to get wherever theyre going,0.356452584
so they take off driving down the road,0.351365328
and the farmer went back to digging the hole to plant the tree,0.32973057
so hes there alone,0.357812107
allofasudden in the middle of his digging theres the car again and the couple again going the same way,0.31060642
and he looks very astounded and going,0.364642799
how did they get back here,0.44021365
this is crazy,0.456292689
hes probably thinking,0.40164572
he just looks very astounded that,0.440235734
what are you doing here,0.518406332
well its inside of a house,0.382356077
and theres a couple fighting,0.342378557
it looks like shes yelling at the man,0.259899408
theyre yelling back at eachother,0.331983626
hes dger hes reading a newspaper,0.279499948
and shes got her coat on and her suitcase heading for the door,0.236089393
evidently shes going to leave him,0.343519002
and he looks all distraught very distraught that she left,0.382384688
and hes still sitting in the chair,0.298315823
and then the door opens,0.404192686
and there she is,0.367147803
and they look at eachother,0.389953196
he gets up,0.422961265
shes crying,0.408200055
and he opens up his arms to welcome her home,0.266377985
anyway and theyre hugging at the door and everything like that,0.313185692
and it looks like she crashed the car,0.289471328
and hes looking towards the car going,0.283687741
wow what happened here,0.441982746
that must be why she is crying because she crashed the car,0.295140207
Im sure theyll be alright,0.310365856
www,1.000000119
okay this is about a birthday party,0.284672767
and it looks like a young man is having a birthday party,0.285152286
and people are coming in with their children,0.414506197
and mom is standing there with a broom shaking it at the dog whos hiding underneath the sofa,0.236852586
and then you look over at the cake,0.293512315
and guess what,0.4427706
he evidently took a big chunk outof the birthday cake,0.19605267
and thats why the boy is crying and moms gonna hit him with a broom,0.178128272
but he left his pawprints going all the way underneath the couch,0.300845414
so he wasnt hiding very well,0.297145814
okay you get the peanut butter and jelly,0.303955078
Im sorry,0.42297408
you get the peanut butter and jelly,0.329550058
you set it on the counter,0.353714287
you get your bread,0.532244742
close up the bag to the bread,0.325886667
then you put the bread on the plate,0.349727213
and then you get a knife,0.34667474
and then say you start with the peanut butter,0.311577737
so you open up the jar of peanut butter,0.257932454
and then you spread,0.456850678
close up the peanut butter jar,0.325436711
and then you open up the jelly jar,0.301741779
and you spread on one side the jelly,0.302269697

not for my my side my grandparents three sons inlaw all died in nineteen sixty eight,0.228812739
it was a bad year,0.301689208
my aunt who was her husband was one of them came and lived with us for about nine nth ten months until she could get herself together,0.211566165
I was sick,0.443732619
I had a cold,0.3455019
I couldnt lift my head up,0.293652952

the greatest example or the most recent example I can think of is a cousin of my husbands who had Parkinsons,0.21868369
he lived with it for some twenty plus years,0.26124835
one of the problems with Parkinsons is as it progresses you lose the use of your vocal cords and your voice gets softer and softer and softer,0.259372234
I have a hearing problem,0.396747619
I understood how frustrated he was,0.385374576
he was in a wheelchair by that time,0.294993162
and basically I tried to get him to raise his voice a little,0.299340159
and blame me,0.355773568
and since my husband has Parkinsons I am using all those lessons,0.222008973

the same aunt from a previous story,0.307551771

and the next thing I know my uncle has grabbed me and pulled me outof the water,0.203517273
huh that was nice,0.297672123
I like playing games in the water with him,0.266507149

losing a section of my skin on my back that was about the size of a small saucer,0.226130739
the skin grafts were taken from my left hip,0.250668764
I dont know which was worse pain the wound in back or the skin grafts on my hip,0.194439277
but you cant hardly get comfortable in bed,0.29006359
you just sleep under lights that dry up the skin wounds,0.302195638
and then that was I was outof the hospital,0.298809797
I was back at work within six weeks with still the sortof a semi open wound over my spine in the back which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years,0.23310025
in order to close the wound on the back they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar take the flaps of skin close them back over the original scar wound,0.289886087
and so I had for about six weeks a lump on my back where they were infloating,0.234040707
that was done and I had ten years with an oncologist,0.246335149

he knew who I was but he did not connect with what I was saying,0.314440578
and when people came to visit him in the hospital we had the same problems,0.300616086
now he could communicate reasonably well but he did not comprehend so his communication was it was just difficult,0.343236953
oh he was in therapy for,0.226078108
and I useta watch,0.37333104
he was given many many tests,0.341230094
he was to write elephant,0.306813598
a great deal of therapy,0.366411507
and was really doing fairly well,0.417218149
six weeks after the stroke,0.406162143
so I had him back home by that time,0.323990136
and he was doing reasonably well,0.365247905
mhm,0
did you do some when you were communicating with him,0.35233894
no I did not hafta do anything,0.35940522
they just gave me instructions on always,0.325024247
and he had hearing aids,0.343264461
ERROR,1
and that sort of thing just to help him,0.381512076
no because by the time he was home and an outpatient he was doing he,0.28015238
and it was it had affected his swallowing and that,0.360126495
so so there was some speech difficult only because of the swallowing,0.369325489
that was about my only experience with,0.355262995
Im sure there were many instances when I was frightened,0.294598609
but not certainly I was afraid but not a terrified type of fright,0.378260195
maybe like boo scared but not hysteria hysteria scared,0.395282984
its thats a hard thats a real hard question,0.349820107
I have been afraid when Id been dreaming because I was lost,0.328876823
but that was a dream not and I always seem to get outof it,0.306861579
lets see what ever where would I have been lost,0.309955865
I have been lost but not afraid,0.41650641
it hasta be hasta have the fear,0.308803707
I certainly worked in a very large industrial plant where there were certainly dangerous situations all around with mechanics and equipment and furnaces,0.340544671
but,1.000000119
its not anything that was its not scary because you are trained to cope with that but you are working constantly around large equipment,0.329569668
and I think probably many times since I was a supervisor I was probably more concerned about a young man working on one of the drill presses or on a lathe that would lose a finger or was injured by a grinder or something happening to one of the men that worked for me,0.231265947
and then the furnaces in a large plant its always a concern,0.355031818
an industrial plant is is something to be very cautious,0.336512327
not to be fearful of but to be cautious about your people who are working for you and also that your own behavior you dont do stupid things,0.305448085
and I worked midnights which was,0.289882213
I was the only female in the plant,0.318657011
and that still was not a fearful situation,0.410354257
but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was and the machinery was working,0.334443033
and we never had an accident we never had a fire we never had,0.340074927
we had a blizzard,0.352858901
but they would have never left me alone with,0.410896242
Imean they they picked me up at the plant took me back home,0.253758371
but not that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in,0.369406641
but it wasnt it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job,0.310699165
you were just more aware of what was going on around you because there was just alotof mechanical equipment and dangerous electrical and that sort of thing,0.306447059
but that was about the only situation that I was ever in that was ever might might have been life threatening but certainly never was,0.406896085
but it was an interesting experience,0.395363629
no it was when I worked in the automotive industry back East,0.240754813
yeah no there we dont have any really heavy equipment,0.320538193
matter of fact Boeing is here but,0.368246347

then after we,0.540287793
or the beneath the pansy her roots and her root ball Ill call it,0.239562556
now pat,0.494358361
pat it down sothat the pansy stands up,0.290570438
Im talking like that book laughs,0.298543125
stands up big and tall,0.340584636
and,1
and after thats done we water gently,0.29686138
and then theyre planted,0.438277394
and happy,0.508799553
well first you need bread,0.392077476
and you need peanut butter,0.402129591
and you need jelly,0.388835937
and you need a knife,0.346024752
so I would take two slices of bread,0.273252785
and Id put them on the bread board,0.242805853
and on one side I would spread peanut butter,0.2754848
and on the side I would spread jelly,0.278788388
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place,0.298500985
so then,0.702018976
and I serve her,0.339971185
Im going back to my kids,0.311839074
my daughters fifty three,0.387269676
and her sister her younger sisters already retired,0.434152514
well I am seventy four almost seventy five,0.357521415
what we gonna do now,0.425809264
yeah I can I can tell you what I did,0.459210694
I went into the hospital the day after Christmas to have major surgery laughs,0.235655859
but getting ready for that is is much more of a story,0.324270725
because my daughter and her husband came from Florida two days before Christmas,0.252404153
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife,0.246954069
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan,0.317436546
and there were seven of us for Christmas,0.298967659
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldnt let me drink wine because but I snuck some in,0.276118279
then five oclock the day after Christmas we went to the hospital,0.286514968
and the rest wasnt that much fun,0.279730022
the rest of it,0.44168371
the the reason my daughter was there was to take me look t look after me because shes a registered nurse,0.222648457
and so she was there for about a total of seven days,0.255766332
and then the cousins stayed on,0.348873675
but thats what I did over the Christmas holiday,0.285318285
and I dont plan to do that ever again,0.325497359
no,0.99999994
it was a new experience however,0.386976093
last weekend,0.67931813
oh last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida,0.211021036
and theyre arriving tomorrow evening,0.358513713
so I moved the car outof the garage,0.235792339
and I got my,0.363106102
and I,0.451039851
and I took my chamois and some pail of water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing,0.273418814
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday,0.171651557
Sunday I vacuumed the living room,0.260234445
moved all the furniture,0.42247504
put,1.000000238
Ive found if you,0.390069425
so I did that to,0.478583157
then having s having vacuumed forwards,0.410411328
because youknow if I dont have everything looking just right theyll think,0.395852268
things are getting ahead of her,0.315673023
time to put her in the home,0.321507245
youknow,1
so then I discovered the spots in the rug,0.280926615
so now I go out and I do the spot rug thing,0.277842283
upstairs made sure everything was ready in the in the guest room,0.260644376
generally I didnt have a whole lot of fun,0.24994126
youknow,1
oh and I I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason theyre coming,0.239680529
so all in all I worked the entire weekend,0.306242198
and Im tired,0.271206826
ohmygosh what when did I have my last vacation,0.328708798
it was probably in,0.411000997
well youknow when youre retired its hard to tell when youre on a vacation laughs,0.208996415
but I did go to Florida,0.321605861
I think it was in June,0.253650993
it was a sad time because,0.362466633
yeah,1
and youknow its a sad time but I did have fun,0.233909994
the reason its sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years,0.207028985
they were litter mates,0.494751364
and one became very ill and hadta be put down,0.266094834
and I think it was well February or March,0.205970004
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down,0.256869644
so those were those were not fun,0.442321062
those were not fun,0.408757925
but had I did have fun in in Florida,0.263188034
because we always do,0.57823807
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx,0.21514602
and we go out to dinner,0.317586482
and we have wonderful gourmet meals,0.356048524
we just kindof play family,0.428572685
because we dont see each other that often,0.373969138
but we do things,0.562884688
we we go to the Everglades,0.344807982
we take an airboat ride,0.315171629
and and that kind of stuff,0.425872445
and they have they once had two dogs and three cats,0.374749064
theyre down to two dogs and one cat now,0.274991721
so that that keeps me happy,0.45255217
but pretty much thats it,0.466860026
www,1.000000119
okay,0.99999994
well well set the scene first,0.40786162
were in a lovely little rural location here,0.316690743
the banks of a very tranquil lake,0.333771557
and we have a sailboat in the lake,0.286891252
and we have actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite,0.329083502
a boy little boy playing with a kite,0.343112826
so its its windy,0.410717845
its windy enough to keep the flag fluffering,0.292201161
now we have a cozy little house on the shore,0.280671507
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade,0.271883219
and the car is parked in front of the garage,0.319965452
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach,0.290977478
now the beach is very very narrow,0.377072781
but its wide enough that the little girl out there can play and shes making a sandcastle,0.277625293
and it also has a pier,0.332479805
thats where the sailboat comes when its tired,0.287564039
and looks like dads on the edge of the pier,0.267227471
or maybe its Grandpa,0.258308232
we cant tell from here,0.296673328
but hes fishing and hes caught a fish,0.261276603
now the boy whos flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog,0.211930022
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass,0.240517929
shoes beside them radio playing dad reading a book,0.232141465
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine,0.268737078
and then they have a picnic basket between them,0.313693732
so all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home,0.273592591
www,1.000000119
now here we have a rural scene,0.348915964
we have just a two lane highway,0.307645857
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees,0.290379077
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front,0.284604132
and the man has a map in his hand,0.296740085
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree,0.256643832
well its clear,0.517106771
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is,0.270490795
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story,0.245762333
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the cars headed,0.361788154
off they go,0.453950763
we see them receding into the distance,0.364970148
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole,0.279937685
and suddenly theres the car back in front of the farmer,0.292890072
it looks like they just went around in a circle,0.324379265
who knew,0.585344434
www,1.000000119
www,1.000000119
www,1.000000119
we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boys birthday party,0.277711093
and the little boy looks to be about six,0.258475214
and what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table,0.229385868
we have the front door open,0.36783579
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in,0.33256343
obviously theyre guests,0.430330575
and theyre carrying presents,0.392846495
each one accompanied by the mother,0.395248473
and they all stop and they look at the cake,0.318259597
well theres a big chunk taken outof the cake,0.215002
and one of the candles,0.430476546
looks like the little boys fifth birthday according to the candle count,0.233435288
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints,0.344950765
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug,0.280951887
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa,0.26946184
and theres a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa,0.233097866
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom,0.239587575
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this,0.382393897
the little boy is crying,0.343804657
doesnt look like we had much fun at this birthday party because it leaves it right there,0.281430364
but there she is,0.443598598
everybodys unhappy,0.670276821
but Im gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down,0.188547865
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out that was that the dog chewed on,0.242213979
and the little boy stopped crying,0.362284899
and everybody came in and they had a wonderful party,0.312260032
dont you wish real life was like that,0.324283302
www,1.000000119
I counted the candles,0.343474388
I cheated,0.550058544
well I have dogs and kids,0.368708342
www,1.000000119
we have a little household setting here,0.414162576
were in the living room,0.391419768
and husband and wife,0.533208072
husbands sitting in the chair trying to read his newspaper clearly angry mouth wide open,0.229938969
and what we assume is his wife is standing in front of him pointing at him in a very menacing way,0.230567113
in the next picture we see husband with paper up,0.246532351
and the wife heading for the door with her coat on and a suitcase,0.283939928
she has had it,0.48225078
looks as though as soon as she goes out the door the door closes husband was sad,0.226896182
possibly remorseful,0.757016718
thinking of the things he should have said,0.345202923
thinking of the things he should not have said,0.351706237
and all that kind of stuff,0.413901061
whats he going to do,0.330360621
he doesnt know,0.371007234
it shouldnt have gone this far,0.378463328
door opens,0.638717055
he looks over his shoulder,0.369876832
its his wife,0.447381765
shes back,0.363871366
he cant believe it,0.376770407
she forgave him for whatever it was he did which he doesnt really know it was,0.315429002
so they embrace,0.600111842
and theyre both very happy,0.386186242
and in the middle of the embrace the husband looks out the open door,0.327306151
and he sees the family car,0.287748992
www,1.000000119
www,1.000000119
okay,0.99999994
set the scene here,0.445468992
here we have what what appears to be an emergency,0.34036231
and how do we know this,0.424257606
because we have a fire truck on the street and that goes by this large tree,0.268603206
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder,0.31763804
so we look at the tree,0.290993869
and we have a dog barking up the tree,0.286807388
barko barko barko whats he what is he barking at,0.260724247
well theres a little bird up there but I dont hes not barking at the bird,0.228546038
we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree,0.253680229
well what,0.652861714
wait a second,0.420145392
what is he doing up there,0.326504856
so we look alittle further and we see a kittycat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man,0.272202373
and beneath the kittycat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying,0.280926526
go kitty jump,0.50139761
come kitty come down,0.441058755
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder,0.266070575
now this this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree,0.264418602
cant get down,0.364559174
dad went up after the kittycat,0.302271485
got stuck up there,0.445770234
the dog is yelping,0.342318624
hes barking,0.33870247
and someone called the firemen,0.423673093
and then theyre coming to rescue first the father and then the kittycat,0.395728827
and its a happy ending because the little girl gets her kitty cat back,0.270955056
www,1.000000119
I better pay attention,0.400103092
that is an easy one because its fairly recent,0.334804267
the the the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes,0.3564367
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition,0.325708896
and I remember hearing a womans voice saying,0.336773843
oo shes a bleeder,0.215850398
and then I went,0.388092995
and thats the only thing I remember from the recovery room,0.325236917
I me,0.79297924
is this what you want,0.497149438
memories,0.999999881
okay and then I remember being,0.36321938
and I remember having a,0.37494719
I cant remember what it was exactly because I never knew,0.391468704
but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it,0.27201885
and they said,0.43198812
you could push this button whenever you have alotof pain,0.379879296
you cant push it any less than six minutes apart,0.242532581
if you try it wont do anything,0.472762346
so youre alright,0.478244752
dont worry about it,0.424233466
so whenever I l felt that I couldnt stand it I would push that button,0.364055216
then I remember seeing my daughters face,0.380025119
I remember seeing her and her husband,0.408821881
and I,0.451039851
I remember bits and pieces of nurses coming and catheters being inserted and,0.2959916
but again,0.731100261
I never saw,0.482671618
just bits of it,0.392772257
and I remember getting outof bed the first day and being,0.264459968
and I remember the second day,0.328452319
Id had a hip replacement,0.239068642
around the the,0.719995439
and,1
and each day I remember seeing my daughter and her husband at some time,0.286804706
but not communicating with them or anything,0.470147431
and when I left my daughter asked me several questions,0.262161583
being a nurse,0.462284416
and I said,0.329179674
do you know I remember one day you came twice,0.389577001
she said,0.530327618
we came twice every day,0.37560451
see,0.99999994
so thats that shows how much I was out,0.311789632
I remember another thing,0.529347897
sitting sitting up straight in the hospital watching,0.396381915
and,1
and the nurse came in later and she,0.354975939
I could hear her,0.412890881
she was saying,0.487144142
boy she fell asleep sitting up,0.319668561
and I thought,0.462097377
Im not asleep,0.326255918
Im just,0.439855367
youknow,1
and that thats pretty much it,0.42799744
and I I remember the the therapy afterwards and and youknow pain and the and the medication of the Vicodin,0.381691098
and I remember saying things that didnt make sense,0.351105511
and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to,0.322541237
and I remember asking him,0.394616097
I had just taken Vicodin,0.37872681
and I remember asking him,0.394616097
now who are you,0.397729874
and I knew very well who he was,0.315021992
and he would answer very slowly,0.325847089
and I thought,0.462097377
oh hes hes hes hes trying to youknow,0.261705756
and Id say,0.274971426
why am I asking these stupid questions,0.372701168
and I was i and I said,0.280934542
I could hear myself saying,0.495461822
now let me write this down,0.370923996
and so in due course about three hours later these men showed up,0.25917834
and I was back,0.340646267
and I said,0.329179674
hi,0.999999821
and they they had come in,0.416178912
and we we talked a bit,0.313892782
and I had a my,0.321451455
I was walking around,0.37150681
and finally I said to him,0.358377725
did your dispatcher say anything to you about the telephone conversation he had with me before he sent you out this morning,0.28914541
youknow he said he said,0.406917661
yeah,1
I said,0.525946558
whatd he say,0.338055193
he said,0.528301835
well I dont know what youre gonna find when you get to eighteen sixty East Crystal Way,0.177758232
so I told him I said,0.426181704
when you get back please tell him I was on drugs,0.297949851
tell him I was thoroughly drugged,0.300976694
I had just taken a pain pill,0.318410456
and it was three hours ago,0.257440627
and this is the difference between me right after it kicks in,0.271886826
so thats what I remember from from that,0.348959744
is that any help,0.44471851
okay,0.99999994
the first problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese,0.268253416
so it was frustrating,0.453025758
I hadta put children in school,0.288191229
I hadta take them shopping to get their uniforms,0.358882517
I hadta take a taxi and tell him where I wanted to go and how to get home and,0.273288399
so how did I deal with it,0.374944657
I studied Japanese,0.348839909
every morning five days a week until I got so I could do it,0.282855362
happened again when I went to Korea,0.357825875
it happened again when I went to Guatemala,0.36144501
so and and and Brazil,0.549900055
where they did not speak English,0.39490068
spoke English in Jamaica and they spoke in English in Malaysia at that time,0.267913461
but the only time that Ive really had what,0.405476183
and I hafta communicate immediately and then study at the same time,0.294807285
and I find I do it by reading body language reading facial expressions,0.290109098
and alot of this moving hands and to describe what I want,0.287610024
and then as as the language picks up on,0.302395016
thats pretty much my experience with that,0.359326243
okay,0.99999994
I was on a boat a ship I should say,0.253273994
and the USS President line it was President Wilson,0.285888672
and we were sailing from I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo,0.202299193
and I had my my husband and my two youngsters were there,0.301016688
they were probably third and fourth grade,0.347871065
and we came in we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up,0.232896328
so the captain youknow notified us,0.243738279
theres a,0.440788209
well what happened was,0.404515624
and the,0.791413784
and our little ship was in the vortex,0.302543938
I was frightened,0.481976449
I was my children one of them was thrown outof her bunk and youknow,0.203191385
and and I we strapped them in something,0.354254663
I cant remember exactly because I was miserable,0.358328253
I was seasick,0.387721896
and I was on the promenade deck,0.273218572
and they had,0.523942649
so because the promenade youre sposta be able to see but they had these,0.34198457
and I was strapped in a deck chair that was,0.250807256
and I was sitting in this chair sick as I could be watching the waves come up over me gpxraises arms above head,0.219251335
and then I would hear crashing,0.358660877
and one wave would go up real high,0.268204033
the ship would creak,0.439674854
it would go,0.492061734
I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life,0.283188701
they had ropes for people youknow if you hadta go to the bathroom or something you couldnt walk so you would do this to try and find your way,0.30731988
they had bed spreads,0.360817313
so that was it,0.503803194
and youknow we survived,0.29387188
the boat didnt go down but it I dont think it ever sailed again because it was already thirty years old and it was ready to be,0.244351745
which wasnt very helpful being being on it,0.303300798
but we survived,0.478912085
but Ive never been as frightened before or after,0.313043892

this one is puzzling to me,0.375886977
its clearly a rescue operation,0.398879707
and it clearly is in water because the man who appears to be rescuing the young lady is wearing a buoyancy vest,0.25551948
what I cant make out is whether she,0.27120024
ahhah,0
it looks like she she got caught in a flood possibly,0.286219388
and she has grabbed a branch that has stuck out into the raging waters,0.270693392
thats what it is I bet you,0.369924128
and shes clinging to this branch for dear life,0.25738728

once upon a time a long time ago there was a throat beautiful little girl whose mother died,0.261091322
so her father married giving her a stepmother,0.405709565
and the new stepmother had two daughters,0.380426168
well the two daughters were not anywhere near as fair as Cinderella,0.244667694
and the stepmom did not treat Cinderella very well,0.257941574
she did not treat her like she did her own daughters,0.366473407
she made her do all the laundry,0.271294504
she made them do all the housework,0.308247119
she made she made her wait on her stepsisters with her xxx,0.296910822
and it looks to me like she slept out in the barn with the horses,0.233576521
but she liked horses and she liked the dogs and she liked all the animals,0.324604928
so they liked her so she didnt care,0.358441979
well one day she was looking out the window at the castle,0.278119206
she could see,0.429314673
and word came that the king was very angry with his son prince because he was not in any hurry to get married to take a queen,0.235779956
so the king says,0.345379472
alright enough of your fooling around,0.423775285
he sent out an,0.29148972
well it wasnt an edict it was more of a letter,0.231596649
to everyone in the kingdom saying that there would be a ball,0.331715047
and his son would meet all of the eligible young ladies in the kingdom,0.270464063
and there would be a way that one would be chosen from this ball,0.331371397
Cinderella thought,0.553874373
wouldnt that be wonderful,0.365947843
wouldnt that be wonderful,0.365947843
so she,0.650917053
and she made a beautiful well very beautiful dress,0.352559835
wasnt fancy really but she was such a such a pretty girl it looked beautiful on her,0.252644956
so she thought she could go to the ball because she was certainly one of the members of the of the kingdom,0.300385535
two stepsisters came in,0.393442512
no way are you going bitch,0.361361176
so they ripped off her gold necklace,0.313924193
go back into the scullery,0.349001706
so she went back into the scullery,0.298000306
and there sitting on a big trunk was someone who looked very much like a fairy godmother,0.271906644
she had a,0.472863615
she took the story and she says,0.302416265

and she got into the carriage,0.332416505
and she had gorgeous horses,0.317896396
and the mice were now footmen,0.321500123
and they,0.66941309
when they helped her down,0.409763455
the prince took one look at her and he thought,0.292485118
who are these dogs,0.443063468
he didnt say that,0.354907811
he he thought it,0.627126336
so hes dancing with her,0.294436961
and theyre dancing around the ballroom,0.35113287
and then comes time for her pumpkin to her pumpkin and her mice to reappear,0.280506968
its midnight,0.55929637
and she was told,0.333451509
youve got til midnight,0.332628697
she sees the clock,0.313105345
she races outof the ballroom,0.242392257
and the prince says,0.391356617
where are you going,0.458958179
he starts following her,0.399141729
and she races down the stairs and jumps in the into her coach and they race home,0.276406258
and then there she is in her regular clothes sitting on a pumpkin,0.256920576
but as she was running down the stairs she lost one of her glass slippers,0.236033425
the prince saw it,0.361097366
and he said,0.372952074
this is the slipper from the most beautiful woman in the kingdom and I am going to find her,0.240240604
and so that began the search,0.374000669
they went to every house in the kingdom,0.340670824
every young woman in the kingdom,0.362264365
and noone could fit their big fat foot into that pretty little glass slipper,0.249461547
went to Cinderellas home where Cinderella was nowhere to be seen,0.240933001
two ugly stepsisters they tried to push it and they shove it,0.282403022
they could,0.799111605
and so the question was,0.394059569
isnt there another young lady,0.283519447
no no no no no,0.999999821
well finally,0.662069976

ERROR,1
I was I was five and my folks were we were,0.292099297
I was an only child,0.330489278
so the three of us had gone to to see the Von Hindenburg,0.210327238
which had which was a big dirigible that was transporting people across the ocean,0.312799752
and it was the last one before as it turned out before it exploded and in in its return trip,0.283328831
and so my dad was real anxious to see this thing that that he had been talking about,0.307952195
so we went to see it,0.37524271
and on the way back they decided theyd stop at a little kind of amusement park but it had monkeys and other small animals down in the front area,0.257807851
and so my mother hadta go into the restroom,0.280882597
she said,0.530327618
now you watch her,0.449396908
dont let her get into trouble,0.308776885
and so I was watching the monkeys,0.298404992
and he was standing there talking to me,0.319048822
I poked my finger in the cage,0.248699307
and the monkey,0.457830966
sothat although it didnt actually break the bone it twisted my finger sothat its always been crooked,0.295140147
and ofcourse when my mother came out she said,0.296243697
it does look like for five minutes you could watch her,0.295262337
and I remember that very vividly laughing,0.36821121
because laughing because it was my fault but my dad got into trouble,0.340835512

well I spent last summer taking an ASU class in Florence Italy for a six week summer session,0.216708004

so it became imperative that I be able to atleast read enough so that I knew what was going on,0.313000649
but lots of times I misunderstood,0.33731547
and so I would hafta point to what somebody else was eating if thats what I wanted to order,0.294490576
or wed go in a f a cafeteria and so I could point to the food that I wanted,0.239406466
and I needed directions I hadta show them the map of where I wanted to go,0.282571554
and laughing and point to youknow what I wanted to do,0.309884518
and then they usually could point me in the right direction,0.400677592
so I used objects,0.4090693
I used food that other people were eating,0.383512646
and I used a map,0.283564389
and I tried one of the few of my other words but they werent very good so,0.266733438
they would always smile at me,0.375527114

and I started to turn,0.342780918
and before I got through the intersection the car hit me broadside,0.262162805
and knocked me into the telephone pole,0.267217875
and my I had on an Indian necklace that had a wire that was strung on jewelers wire,0.200942472
and they hit me so hard that it broke that necklace off my neck,0.282854825
and the pieces went all over the xxx,0.314791024

but I was really nervous because we didnt have very much money and the car was relatively new,0.287171453
and I didnt wanna hafta go home and tell my husband that that Id wreck the car,0.184632763
and so when I got home,0.355273843

and in the meantime the young prince had grown,0.370245665
and the father was disturbed because he hadnt found the princess that he wanted to marry,0.313170493
so he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday,0.264761418
and he sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball,0.28402245
so the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation,0.304504633
so they got their new dresses,0.359814078
and had Cinderella polish and shine everything sothat they would look just elegant,0.317378283
and so because the invitation went to everyone Cinderella decided she would prepare a a dress to go too,0.281490296
all the animals had helped her prepare it in the movie,0.274781793
and she sewed this lovely little,0.337798238
it was simple dress but very very pretty xxx,0.388492763
and when she what this the time came for them all to dress and go to the ball why she helped the stepsisters get dressed,0.282278091
and then she went up and put on her pretty little pink dress,0.2673904
and when she came down the stepsister says,0.299921215
oh,0.999999881
they couldnt she could not go with them,0.373097986
that was absolutely impossible because she was nothing but a chambermaid,0.417668223
and so they actually tore her dress so she couldnt wear it,0.312759906
they got in their coach and left,0.293051928
and Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball,0.283008933
and the sisters were so mean to her,0.329552054
and allofasudden her fairy godmother appeared,0.388237923
and she said,0.380783647
I will take care of this,0.302806616
I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land,0.263641
which she did,0.406620562
and it was just gorgeous,0.327754825
and Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful,0.274988472
but she said,0.471003324
how am I going to get there,0.371516794
and the fairy said,0.338184118
bring me the pumpkin and mice,0.268491626
and she made a coach outof the pumpkin and horses and mice became horses,0.221400559
so they carried her to the to the ball,0.361974359
when she entered the prince was just dazzled by her,0.285600275
and he asked her to dance,0.344031692
and they danced again,0.45159018
and they danced again,0.45159018
and finally it struck midnight,0.408287466
and she knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave as soon as before midnight,0.316452414
so she dashed outof the ball,0.247694865
and in her hurry she lost one of her slippers glass slippers,0.216753513
and got into the coach and took off,0.287039727
but unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve,0.333159417
and she had nothing but a pumpkin and mice,0.30265671
and she had lost her pretty dress,0.315824717
but she still had one single glass slipper,0.331611574
and so she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she didnt think shed ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had,0.258424997
and the the sisters came home,0.441538602
and they were talking about this strange young woman who was there,0.352299273
that she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her,0.300032973
and they wondered who she was and howcome he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once,0.301147729
and then the prince was s so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing Cinderella,0.238558456
and the the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper on all all of the eligible young women,0.273162991
and so the stepmother said,0.358943373
we have only two,0.462613106
and so he they tried to push their big feet into the i i glass slipper and it wouldnt work,0.234332651
they were too big,0.427239716
and he said,0.372952074
but isnt there another young woman here,0.332739741
and Cinderella came out,0.302904189

yes Im here,0.350598872
eventhough the stepmother said,0.44608891

oh well then you must try it on,0.316124022
and so she pulled out the slipper that was in her pocket that shed been carrying,0.281536192
and said,0.513667703
I think this matches,0.458125204

to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need some really good high quality sprouted grain bread,0.300848842

and you wanna get a nice high quality peanut butter,0.266810507
preferably just peanuts,0.537142217
maybe a little bit of salt,0.346043259
nice organic,0.543355584
and then you can spread the peanut butter,0.349446476
and then for your jelly you could actually use a preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself so its got really pure high quality ingredients,0.300691009
and you would just,0.509419918
and then you would introduce the two slices to each other,0.379418612

in elementary school I was rollerblading with my aunt,0.226083502
and she took off down a hill,0.280406237
and I went behind her,0.31890893
and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone,0.232657373
but I didnt really feel it at all,0.352511406
I didnt feel any pain or anything,0.36811012
I was just happy I had ke avoided,0.323626757
but when I looked down and saw all the blood,0.319509625
oh,0.999999881
and then I kicked into ke a pain association,0.227763847
so I hadta go get stitches,0.45160079
and a large man carried me into a wheelchair,0.278597027
and it was awkward,0.363618404
and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front,0.268514127
and she was I think she was pretty spun on something else,0.265035242
and she was just shouting having fights with everybody,0.375708491
so she came over and attacked us,0.292390287
and my friend was she was trying to attack one of my friends,0.263804048
so we were trying to get in the way and stop her from doing that,0.290426165
and during the whole commotion as we were trying to separate this really upset woman a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with ke just a,0.24891673
and and then he was actually,0.471556038
because my friend then got really pissed off because that was her boyfriend,0.359047443
and she was just kinda screaming,0.358049691
and he was about to knock her out,0.275082171

hadta break that up and call the cops and all that,0.351341546
Ive had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they cant really have a genuine conversation with you because they cant get around their own,0.295561939
just very self oriented kindof selfish in a way,0.358079374
cant really have a two person conversation because they dont move past a certain point in their mind,0.268641353
they just loop the track and go right back to another place,0.368356586
yeah I try to just be patient and continually try to open those doors of communication,0.279292583
so its its my mother,0.374223858
so its a lifetime process,0.388417274
but maybe in the next twenty years or something we can talk,0.25903818
so theres a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better,0.260316908
and he still hasnt quite learned,0.295622706
so as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house,0.276112318
and theres a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened,0.257914692
so there is a little boy getting ready for school,0.309492469
and his mom comes up and says,0.264857531
dont you wanna take your umbrella,0.371691555
and he says,0.357835323
no,0.99999994
hes asserting his independence and making decisions for himself,0.354496956
so he doesnt wanna take his mothers good advice,0.253822148
he goes out for the day and realizes that its raining raining very very hard,0.302335471
there are puddles everywhere,0.47599262
its really uncomfortable to be that wet,0.387914866
so he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels alot better because now he has some weather protection,0.23857148
so there is a little girl whose mother has died,0.272143036
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her,0.295930624
so shes introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters,0.285667777
shes excited,0.364216477
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean,0.353726178
and the stepmother is very cruel,0.354748458
so all the years as shes raised with them during the beginning few years its its okay,0.245113686
its not great,0.460457683
and then her father dies,0.451356471
and shes left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters,0.319798857
and they basically make her to be a maid,0.315238774
theyre never very kind to her,0.386211157
and she hasta do all the work on the farm,0.255806684
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food,0.374812186
so theres also in the same area a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle,0.31280306
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince,0.271184087
so he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region,0.267285913
so an invitation for a ball sothat the prince can choose a bride,0.259531826
and they get this invitation at Cinderellas house,0.264777452
the stepmother reads it,0.375716269
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited,0.278622031
they wanna go meet this handsome prince,0.331748933
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess,0.314245373
so they get ready for the ball,0.341546357
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball,0.263378084
she wants to go dance and have fun,0.276105136
so she hangs out with all her little animal friends and is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball,0.276451439
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that shes not allowed to go,0.259917349
shes not going to go,0.319098353
they rip off all of her jewelry,0.236588031
they tear apart her dress,0.369877696
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes aswell,0.301824212
so Cinderellas very sad,0.406939924
she doesnt know what to do,0.373237967
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that shes going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny,0.28267616
so she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride creates a beautiful dress for her gives her these delightful glass slippers and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball,0.220576465
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was,0.273586214
so Cinderella goes and is very excited,0.284452319
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night,0.246012345
and the stepsisters are very jealous,0.365751177
they dont know who this woman even is,0.329647899
and shes having a great time,0.334604621
but then she realizes that this the clock is about to strike,0.345902205
and so she runs in such a hurry,0.217092797
and the prince goes after her like,0.32798484
wait,0.999999821
you cant leave,0.416469067
why are you leaving,0.40902248
and she just says,0.364812225
I hafta go,0.344321698
and she leaves,0.452799678
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind,0.243592113
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe,0.258146137
so Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe,0.246306628
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive,0.366680592
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house,0.315749347
but it doesnt fit the fat foot of the sister,0.21945928
it doesnt fit the fat foot of the other sister,0.215261102
and it sure doesnt fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother,0.218736842
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella,0.253413767
so they know that shes the one that was at the party,0.311369061
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after,0.311612636
I would open the can of or jar of peanut butter,0.239600748

put the other slice on the top,0.338701636
thats it,0.506868482
it looks like the family caught,0.35059166
and the father goes up the tree to to rescue the the cat,0.316211283
and he goes up a ladder,0.267026007
and and while hes up there somehow or other the somehow or other the ladder fell off fell away from the tree,0.270407438
now hes now hes stuck,0.311661065
and the dog is barking,0.372440696

and a little girl I guess thats his daughter is trying to coax a cat to come down,0.225330725
and somebody had called the firemen to come out and rescue the father,0.33589524
and so theyre theyre on their way to to put up a ladder and and get the get the father down,0.282664627

and I backed up very very slowly,0.335603118

and but shes a real sweet lady,0.276704729
and I I I always have a hard time understanding her,0.365539402
there is one other lady that is hard to understand,0.348472148
but anyway theyre stroke victims,0.369861603
so I guess that happens,0.539263785
this little boy is playing out in the yard,0.246534944
and he and he kicks this,0.337242842
it must be a basketball,0.306384742
gives it a good kick,0.344429374
and it goes right through the window of this this house,0.367394388
and it knocks over a lamp in this living room,0.263644189
I dont know if its his house or if its a neighbors,0.234557763
but anyway the man looked like he was kindof upset,0.336975396
he picks up the ball,0.313928634
and he looks at the hole in the window,0.288676977
and and hes hes probably perturbed,0.301269412
thats about it I think,0.427700669
looks like this little boy is is getting ready to go someplace,0.32567656

and his mother is frowning at him saying,0.29903689
I told you take the umbrella,0.291528344
and so this time he does take the umbrella and walks out in the rain,0.263609141
Cinderella I believe was kindof a,0.315495282
I believe she worked for this wealthy family if Im not mistaken,0.269088656
and she was always envious of the rich the people that had alot more than she had,0.293327332
and she wanted to go to this ball,0.327414393
and I forget how the shoe is involved,0.24707526
I believe she danced with this prince,0.335508764
I believe she was told that if she could wear if this shoe would fit her she would be accepted,0.305889308
ohgosh,0

and everybody was so happy,0.357512981

so a little girl lost her cat up the tree and then couldnt get the cat outof the tree,0.222225115
so there was a,0.399431646
the neighbor said,0.427221656
oh Ill come over and get your cat outof the tree,0.193635687
and put the ladder up ke on the tree and started climbing up the tree,0.27703324

meanwhile the dog came along and knocked the ladder over and started barking at him,0.297843635
and he got scared,0.337912738

I was hospitalized once when I was in SouthAmerica,0.355522126

and it was a pretty terrible experience,0.352182239
and I recovered,0.389031291
so thats good,0.441452503
yes Ive been in a situation where I was frightened and scared,0.249386236
that was this one time when I was the same time I guess,0.37458396

okay so the same story I had before when I was in SouthAmerica and I got jumped and stabbed I was pretty frightened for my the safety of my life,0.218336791
and so that was a scary time,0.32731688
I dont Im really sorry,0.399973571
it was dark and scary,0.310055733
I believe Ive had experiences with people whove had a difficult time communicating,0.299058676
Ive spoken with people who are shy and arent very confident,0.243865386
and I would take my time and listen to them and try to help them along with their conversation and just be patient and try not to say anything negative to them,0.353351802
I wanted to help them along with their conversation,0.388536394
so there was a young boy who decided to go out and practice his soccer game,0.230077684
and while he was out practicing he kicked the soccer ball into the neighbors window,0.269875735
and the neighbor was at home while this happened,0.322633207
freaked him out because a ball came flying through his window and crashed,0.273210704
and so the neighbor decided wanted to know what happened,0.368268311
and so he grabbed the ball,0.288835466
realized some kids mustve been outside and kicked the ball through his window,0.26604116
so he decided to go reconcile the situation by bringing back the ball and getting some information from the boy,0.281181693
okay,0.99999994
so it was early in the morning,0.327455521
and the young boy young boy hadta go to school,0.307161987
and it was raining outside,0.397721291
so the mother said,0.350524873
you gotta take your umbrella,0.337708116
and the boy said,0.303757787
I dont wanna take an umbrella,0.262304008
Ill be fine,0.337402701
I like walking in the rain,0.304194093
and the mother is,0.448934048
okay well go ahead,0.382962227
so the boy starts walking out into the rain and starts getting really wet and realizes,0.304786891
oh its not that fun to go walk in the rain,0.207151666
comes running back home,0.497896492
and hes all soaking wet,0.287143379

and the mother was happy that the boy finally listened to his mother,0.352095604
the boy made it to school walking to school without getting wet because he used the umbrella like his mom told him in the first place,0.234610498
so the story of Cinderella starts off by Cinderellas father takes her to her new home with and introduces them to her new stepsisters and her new stepmother,0.267903298
and so at first things are okay,0.264562547
and Cinderella just ends up having to do chores and earn earn her keep inside the house,0.239786506
and then one day there was a grand ball going on at the great palace,0.269222498
and an invitation came that said all the ladies in the house could come to the grand ball,0.281731218
so everybody was really excited at that they were gonna go to the grand ball at the palace,0.227864638
and so everybody was getting ready,0.382215232
and Cinderella had a nice dress,0.275643378
and it seemed to be nicer than her stepsisters,0.274395138
so her stepsisters got jealous wrecked her dress made fun of her and everything,0.261872947
and Cinderella was upset,0.282789707
and then she couldnt go to the ball because her dress was ruined,0.256592602
and the stepsisters just laughed at her and made fun of her,0.258019626
so Cinderella stayed at home,0.290600806
and the stepsisters ended up going out to the ball,0.316517383
meanwhile there was a magic mouse or,0.298115194
I think it was a magic mouse that granted Cinderella a wish,0.284923375
and Cinderella wished she could go to the ball and and have a nice dress to to go to the ball in,0.259307474
and so oh it was a fairy godmother,0.263288707
the fairy godmother granted the wish to Cinderella and gave Cinderella the most beautiful dress that there ever was and turned the pumpkin into a carriage sothat she could be escorted in to the to the grand ball in a nice carriage with her nice dress,0.236566871
so when she gets to the grand ball everybodys impressed with how beautiful Cinderella is and how nice her dress is,0.236717105
and the prince asks Cinderella to dance,0.31388858
and the evil stepsisters are there and are so jealous that Cinderellas there and now with an even nicer dress than she had before,0.261834502
and now shes getting asked to dance with the prince which all the stepsisters wanted and and were so envious of Cinderella,0.284487277
so Cinderella was so enlightened and enthusiastic about being at the ball with the beautiful dress and now dancing with the prince,0.282509804
and it was like a dream come true,0.307555228
but the fairy godmother said,0.335898995
you hafta be home before midnight,0.297913909
so otherwise everything wont go back to normal,0.342935175
and so Cinderella noticed that it was almost midnight,0.311533481
so she runs out outof the ball in a right after her dance with the prince,0.243456006
but the prince wanted to know more about Cinderella,0.329811484
so the prince chased after,0.338719755
Cinderella was running down the steps lost one of her slippers,0.22680147
but she didnt care because she hadta get home before midnight,0.313270003
and so she gets in her carriage and gets escorted away back to her home,0.288662583
but she makes it home in time,0.343572736
so everything turns back to normal,0.432820559
her her nice her beautiful dress turns back to a normal just apron dress,0.322615296
and the carriage turns back into a pumpkin,0.333126992
and so the next day the prince still with the the thoughts of Cinderella on his mind wants to find out who Cinderella was,0.244521558
and all he has left is a glass slipper,0.234741375
so he sends out his servant to find who the woman was with the glass slipper and makes everybody try out the a glass slipper,0.221770465
and finally they find they finally find someone who the glass slipper fits on,0.294224203
and its Cinderella,0.445716858
and all the evil stepsisters are again so furious at Cinderella because shes the lucky one that fits the glass slipper,0.233628035
and she had the greatest experience ever,0.397559851
and so the prince oversees that Cinderellas just a lonely servant girl,0.279474407
and the prince decides to marry her,0.394830942
and they youknow get married and live happily ever after,0.266353726

and I made it back to the car,0.304772586
and he hadta lift me off,0.306574166
and put me in the seat,0.257234454
it took three hours for us to get home or to the hospital,0.250278801
and xrays and everything,0.508104265
broken back,0.669573903
and when my husband called me that night from home and I was in the hospital not having any idea when youknow what our what our future was going to be like he told me he was very sad,0.230138451
very sad and very sorry,0.395382464
oh yeah,0.846038759
yes,0.999999881
my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia,0.178733274
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia,0.318086416
so her first language is Mandarin Chinese,0.29927218
and then her second language is English,0.319960386
and I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods insteadof really understanding things,0.359051198
and its taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her eventhough she insists she understands,0.258917958
youknow and the the very next day shell not have a clue what I had told her,0.218505219
and so I have just learned to watch for cues that shes not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding,0.31277737
and Ive hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase inorderto make sure that she understands,0.311655134
I was in the military,0.351045519
Id just come to Phoenix from Korea,0.213405639
and I didnt know anybody yet,0.348015606
and so I got a parttime job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard,0.243302166
and I worked middle of the night shift all night shift,0.312502205
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed,0.260173172
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes,0.344518423
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons,0.400615841
we werent allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon,0.252227426
theres actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for selfdefense or as a weapon,0.285223514
so on this fifty acre site there was one light pole,0.246298403
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds,0.302390873
so all around you its pitch black,0.325612038
and youre just under this light pole,0.309181958
and you cant see beyond the darkness or beyond the light,0.285406351
and so I would sit there at night,0.292851448
and one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work,0.340865344
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning,0.314910829
and this time it was around three in the morning,0.344993472
and I didnt realize that they were going to be coming that early,0.333461851
and I was sitting where I shouldnt have been sitting,0.3062222
I was just outside the light sothat I could see,0.345520914
because its creepy,0.381787181
very creepy all night long,0.356188864
and so youknow by three oclock in the morning I was already on edge,0.204306737
and allofasudden,1

but allofasudden a man jumped out from behind a closeby PortaPotty,0.29996866
he yelled,0.581396222

and he was stretching the rope inbetween his hands like this,0.309155047
and he yelled,0.399656087
and I screamed,0.420151621
and he laughed,0.391833633
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up,0.25631848
and he continued to laugh,0.341392428
and I cried because it had scared me so badly,0.354774475

I went to Anaheim for a week long conference,0.235465914
and while I was there I developed meningitis,0.301773667
and I couldnt lay my head down on the pillow,0.234403029
it it it was excruciating,0.574335814
youknow the my scalp is very sensitive so I couldnt lay my head down on anything,0.227668703
I really didnt know what was wrong with me,0.327999264
I just thought I had a bad headache,0.410666883
so I went out to the kitchen and just sat there for about an hour or two,0.213323936
it was the middle of the night and didnt really know what to do because I couldnt lay my head down,0.242211178
but I was exhausted,0.463545561
and so I ended up going,0.313183844
and there was someone staying in the room with me,0.302372336
I I told them that I couldnt sleep,0.398086637
something was wrong with my head,0.303499192
and he was actually a neurologist,0.381583899
but he ended up giving me some pretty strong pills to help the pain go away,0.255727202
and it helped through the morning,0.407774448
but then the next day it continued to hurt,0.334709167
so I ended up going to the hospital that evening,0.311516136
I was actually staying with three doctors,0.343540162
so they took me to the the hospital,0.317235827
and they checked me in,0.312153459
they did a first did a ec,0.340432882
lets see what was it,0.296107173
a cat,0.529616594
think it was a cat,0.355273932
and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me,0.256684721
so that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture,0.295478433
a it was a it was a resident it was a teaching hospital it was UCIrvine,0.390415817
and he didnt do a very good job at it,0.230756298
so the the doctor was watching him took over,0.293000728
it was painful,0.469587654
but they had given me morphine by this point,0.306053787
so I felt much better,0.488042057
I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside,0.35886851
and I was still in the emergency room at that point,0.289197505

but when I was seventeen I was only eating one meal a day,0.30409795
but they said I they would let me go home if I didnt eat more,0.334436893
so I hadta eat three meals a day,0.285984874
and they wanted to monitor me,0.394477993
and but I felt great,0.402061075
and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there,0.367889583
and they kept me two more days,0.278352618
and they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go,0.307534039
and to check my white blood cell count,0.282726467
and it was pretty much the same as it was before,0.326053709

Cinderella was a little girl,0.375226587
her mother had passed away,0.424548179
and her father ended up remarrying a woman who had two daughters,0.317078322
the this woman and her two daughters,0.371360809
well eventually Cinderellas father also passed away,0.326746881
and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother,0.407902509
her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her their servant basically,0.35199374
and everyone they were very cruel to her,0.356392473
and she lived a very meager life,0.334242493
and but she was friends with all the animals,0.365261316
the animals were the people she got along with people she could talk to or the the creatures that she could talk to,0.3066836
and then one day the there was a prince in that country,0.362411916
and they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife,0.212744415
and as it was time for him to marry,0.295767456
and all and Cinderella and their her stepsisters were very excited to go,0.311489582
however Cinderella could not go unless she had finished all her chores,0.275122523
her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish,0.264309883
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first,0.239488333
so by the time it came to go Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to make a dress or prepare herself to go,0.222008035
but unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters clothes and such that they had cast away because they didnt want it,0.257802188
so Cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her,0.289269418
and while the the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go,0.261637717
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away,0.271328092
and they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters,0.293920219
and she went out to the yard and was crying,0.278542191
and then a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight,0.261793256
she made her very beautiful and all that,0.378651053
but she warned her,0.440539181
it would only last til midnight,0.342702985
and youknow she turned youknow a pumpkin into a carriage and youknow transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful,0.234365776
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince,0.239640146
and I guess it was love at first sight,0.260149181
and they were dancing together,0.490297437
and youknow he he very much enjoyed his time with her,0.29442811
and they were dancing outside,0.466090739
and she saw the clock,0.30202809
and she knows its almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs leaving one of her glass slippers behind,0.236746669
and she went racing off in the carriage,0.311494112
and she actually didnt make it quite home in the when it struck midnight,0.277613789
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin,0.307552963
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin,0.344156533
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers,0.258790016
and so this prince after this happened he was very interested in finding her,0.322165668
youknow he was he wondered why she had ran away,0.306168854
and so he set out to search for her using the glass slipper,0.244640782
youknow whoevers foot it fit would be that girl,0.292919517
he sent out his I dont know it was the duke or something to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit,0.197831869
it was very small,0.417908669
and eventually that duke got to Cinderellas house,0.284859389
and Cinderella got excited,0.295468986
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella,0.249868527
I dont remember how,0.451993346
and locked Cinderella up there,0.302530199
and while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper,0.301288754
their feet were way too large,0.316330731
they went flying youknow every time,0.33591187
and the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind,0.285604835
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper,0.247747719
the stepmother was very angry at this,0.300994128
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper,0.246977672
and the stepmother tripped him,0.411368757
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces,0.298984349
and youknow the duke thought that everything was over,0.31156078
and everything was ruined,0.395703077
and theyd never find her,0.323230863
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity,0.267908156
and she ended up marrying the prince,0.330092132
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
one day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat Patches was in the tree stuck and was crying,0.243099049
she ran home quickly to get her dad to help him to help the cat out,0.279528737
the dad brought a ladder just in case,0.263273776
and as they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree,0.295041054
the father then climbed up the tree,0.357935935
well thats kindof wrong but,0.428731591
and the dog happened to knock over the ladder after the dad the dog knocked over the ladder after the dad already climbed into the tree,0.268177181

meanwhile the neighbor called nineoneone,0.478536487
and then an a the firemen came to help him down from the tree,0.309260368
okay,0.99999994
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.321188539
first you would go to the fridge and get the bread,0.302509844
then,1
well then you would take the bread and grab two slices,0.305379301
and you would put peanut butter on both slices because I love extra peanut butter,0.29789719
then you would put jelly on both those slices,0.313584089
then if you want you could put the banana in it but its peanut butter and jelly so I wouldnt put banana,0.270137668
and I would just put the two slices together,0.322237879
put in on a plate,0.315946192
and then begin to eat it,0.366044879
milk might go better but were good,0.356898755

I probably know my brother best,0.403983831
and my brother I diagnose it as just a social problem,0.284404308
but when he was younger he he just youknow he couldnt really say what he wanted or tell you or or youknow kindof socially get along with my me and my friends or anything of the sort,0.249305591
and youknow just take for example one time he wanted to youknow play on the trampoline with us,0.246369302
and we werent sure what he was wanting and he was just jumping on the trampoline,0.256484151
jumps jumps on and jumps into the middle of our game and youknow kindof frustrates everybody,0.24261409

I I understand what hes trying to tell me,0.35529995
and I read that he just wants to hang out with us and have fun,0.270952314

and youknow we kindof end up beating the hell outof him on the trampoline,0.222592101
and he still laughs eventhough we beat him up,0.304676652
and it ends up turning into alotof fun,0.254259884
and and youknow hes happy,0.242973506

I still stood my ground next to Tal and made sure he was safe,0.207412258
and the guy eventually leaves,0.38697502
everything calms down,0.497933388
and it it ends,0.444499314

and the dog came and ate a piece of it,0.251817793
right as the guests were showing up for the party,0.324891508
the mom was very angry at herself for leaving the cake out,0.220090508
but she was gonna take it out on the dog by hitting him with the broom,0.205617562
and the boy was sad because his cake got eaten and his mom was beating the dog,0.213157713
first you get the bread outof the cupboard the peanut butter outof the cupboard the jelly outof the refrigerator,0.271743804
you open the bag get the bread out,0.315305859
two slices,0.546201229
probably because youre holding them in your hand you now have get a plate to put the bread on,0.296865433
put the bread down,0.379155874
you open the jar of peanut butter,0.287960261
get a knife outof the drawer,0.271380901
scoop the peanut butter,0.429564416
spread the peanut butter on the bread,0.379277557
open the jar of jam jelly,0.276969671

really,1.000000119
I dont get sick very often,0.339036524
never broke a bone and never been hospitalized really,0.333151251
the most recent tragic sickness I had,0.296130657
I went to the freshman camp for engineering students as a staff member,0.248356044
and the cabin that we were in had fleas or bedbugs or something,0.274209827
and I got bit all over and broke out into big rash hives,0.232923135
and it was that was quite traumatic,0.388637632
I took three days off of work to stay at home because I didnt actually know that they were bug bites,0.218865871
I thought I had chickenpox,0.455457419
so I went to a dermatologist and found out that no they were bug bites and very,0.249851897
anyway so it was still traumatic,0.42058447
when I did get back to work I found out that everybody who stayed in that cabin had similar experiences but probably not as bad as mine,0.272071868
I just got eaten up,0.433664829
and so it was awful,0.340717286
yeah,1
times when Ive hadta communicate with people from another country,0.318448991
I went to a seminar once where there was a bunch of Brazilians who didnt speak English very well,0.20223394
so like all other ignorant Americans I talked louder and slower so that would help,0.331565261
but they just didnt understand the words,0.388846755
so we usually hadta find someone to intermediate because of the language barrier,0.36340183
or I guess try different words that I guess I thought they might understand better than the ones that I was using,0.357047349
tell me the story,0.354539067
well I was out we lived,0.292987466
I was a teenager late teenager,0.380726725
probably I think actually I was about nineteen eighteen,0.389430732
had already graduated high school,0.386534005

and he is just has some problems now,0.330404997
but he didnt die,0.355630845

but Im sure at that moment that it was very unnerving,0.335054666
it was scary for what might happen,0.352965295
would he die or not,0.366713792
we lived not close to a city and so he hadta be helicopter air evacked,0.243915439

Im sure it was a tense moment anyway,0.282138437

once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella,0.267055452
and she had happy life with her mother and her father,0.416031271
and her mother died which was sad,0.287454545
she grew up,0.35713017
father decided to get remarried,0.37130627
and he married a woman that had two other daughters aswell Cinderellas stepsisters,0.285373747
and he was a busy man so he was always off politicking leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters,0.246919423
and her stepmother wasnt very nice,0.266170591
and as she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her,0.260215104
and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them,0.26364553
it wasnt a happy life,0.283714086
one day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married,0.24367477
and so the king said,0.357018203
Prince were gonna have a ball sothat you can meet some ladies to be married,0.198290139
an invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball,0.25378263
and she was happy,0.344117761
and so she was went to get ready for the ball,0.25265038
and Cinderellas mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball aswell but that Cinderella couldnt go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done,0.258931249
which was kindof disheartening because she wouldnt have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear,0.285696268
so the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people,0.315500915
and she slaved away the day,0.338780999
and so eventually it was time to go to the ball,0.329288065
and Cinderella felt like she hadnt had time to get ready,0.240115166
and the stepsisters and the mother were happy,0.436985075
but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made,0.332923055
and she was excited because then she could go to the ball,0.307865977
so she ran down the stairs to leave,0.267325103
and the sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart,0.274471551
so she wasnt able to go in shambles,0.220131904
and while the stepmother stat,0.456449777
and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince,0.269238085
and as she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out,0.278555155
so they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress,0.243953183
and she was all ready to go to the ball,0.281963944
and so she headed off,0.312955648
and the prince danced with a few people but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really,0.269781113
he was very infatuated,0.418419421
the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal,0.246146977
and so Cinder Cinderella lost track of time,0.244306058
and it was about to strike midnight,0.31297186
she realized what would happen and so she ran,0.333652109
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers,0.251823366
and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was,0.285762697
she was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear,0.293895185
so she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper,0.271402597
so he was distraught,0.454544932
the king and he hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit,0.30177027
they worked long and hard the prince long and hard to find the person,0.345267266
and when they arrived at Cinderellas house the stepmother locked Cinderella in a room sothat she couldnt try on the slipper because she suspected that Cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen,0.237618238
and the stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper,0.286362082
and it wouldnt fit,0.320010632
and the mice snuck the key past Dragon the cat to open the door to let Cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say,0.209403604
but wait I can try it on,0.365193069
and luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on,0.269401938
but Cinderella produced the other slipper and said,0.282687485
well heres the matching pair,0.404135793
I was the girl and it does fit,0.252922893

I was hospitalized when I was thirty years old for a heart issue,0.249855816
I had open heart surgery,0.335957885
I remember waking up with a breathing tube down my throat,0.296409011
and I wasnt able to see because I wear contacts,0.270107716
and I didnt have my contacts in and everything was very blurry,0.234437704
and people were moving around alot,0.371613383
and I remember being thirsty but nobody would give me anything to drink,0.336539805
I was in the icu for several hours waiting for them to take the breathing tube outof my throat,0.210964724
once they did I was moved to regular room,0.310062021
and I was in pain for a very long time,0.278985411
yes I have,0.549088657
say that again,0.516968429
Im sorry,0.42297408
my grandfather had a stroke and now he cant talk,0.197879165
I dont live here in town so I dont see him very often,0.275485694
when I come to visit its very hard for me to communicate with him because I cant understand what hes saying,0.255959749
he really tries hard to make sounds and point to things and make hand motions but its its difficult to understand,0.3545838
so I watch him very closely and I try to hand motion back trying to match what hes doing to maybe think about what he may be trying to say,0.288890272
I watch his lip movements but sometimes thats not so successful,0.304623872
oh,0.999999881
the last time I was really scared it was the middle of the night,0.312891662
and I listened to the baby on the monitor,0.293940276
and allofasudden I heard that she was having trouble breathing,0.356085986
so I jumped up outof bed and ran in there and picked her up,0.204503238
and she was crying,0.402705461
and I held her for a few minutes and tried to get her calmed down,0.219624668
and then I gave her a bottle,0.290373087
and we called the doctor immediately,0.365181267
you take two slices of white bread and put them on a plate,0.263337582
you take the peanut butter with a knife,0.291499615
spread the peanut butter on both sides of the white bread,0.333071679
after that you take the jelly and spread the jelly on both sides on top of the peanut butter,0.266657233
then you take the bread and close the sandwich and cut a slice down the middle,0.318064094
to make a peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter the jar of jelly a plate a knife bread,0.263738126
and so then you would take with your knife,0.355228335
I would put the peanut butter on the bread,0.29133898
and then I would take and the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter,0.260182142
to put the two slices of bread together,0.317191899
cut it in half on my plate,0.255163223
and go for it,0.330037147
well Im very lucky because Im basically very healthy,0.303779274
I was ill as a young girl,0.283904463
and so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health,0.220193475
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did,0.362612247
so going along pretty healthy,0.428907782
youknow I had one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery,0.261994123
no drugs no anything,0.563402236
so I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains,0.30531922
and they would be ke between my waist and my boobs,0.211084217
and they would last like four hours,0.324346453
and they were bad,0.417312592
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position youknow where I could just get some relief,0.259227931
youknow and you kindof felt sick to your stomach but it was pains were terrible,0.288431257
so this happened a few times and youknow you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out whats wrong,0.237227082
so you tell them all of this and they think,0.40498969
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but theyre not telling you a thing,0.327668935
so they send me a for a sonogram,0.305597484
well Ive never had one of those,0.32043004
and so I told them at the place I said,0.260110795
if you find a baby in there and Im like sixty years old,0.196021959
I said,0.525946558
we both can make alotof money,0.328150481
so it kindof made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me,0.286361277
well the report comes back later,0.347387403
and so I have a gall bladder problem,0.343279541
so youknow its like what do I do about it,0.369549662
and youknow nothing happens few little simple attacks,0.33007139
but my husband and I are in Tennesee,0.23579517
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks,0.280088514
scared my husband to death because he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane,0.247850552
so when we get back I go back to the doctor again,0.365336478
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder,0.27099967
and thats the way life goes,0.343709409
yes the other people would be my mother because I do feel like shes maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory,0.270820379
and I want her to be my mother and ke she always useta be,0.288043916
so its been very hard ke in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently,0.222905904
I try not to tell her,0.383580804
cant you remember,0.441103131
because Im now learning that she cant,0.272553086
so its difficult because its a learning process,0.421863526
its changes weekly maybe even daily,0.359849036
thats the main communication problem right now,0.403152645
I Ive been I was frightened or scared many times when I was young and growing up,0.258015156
we lived in a small town like six hundred people,0.267647862
but I did live in the town,0.283963501
my I guess I was scared maybe because my father would go away to work into the big city,0.267705649
and he would leave ke on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night,0.214276969
my father being that he didnt live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family,0.25320974
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town,0.27007553
then we had a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was loud and Im gonna say verbally abusive eventhough I didnt realize that at that time,0.221231252
and so he would scream and yell and maybe not m always treat our mother like we thought,0.283340603
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and and the difference,0.373760253
well here in Arizona we sometimes have flash floods,0.302358896
we had one and a young lady and her vehicle decided that she could drive off across this wash no problem,0.241341934
guess what,0.762680173
there was a problem,0.433850467
the car stalls,0.457417637
the water comes up to the sides,0.383855194
shes able to get outof the car and get on the roof,0.210457161
but then shes stranded,0.361463547
the water is just roaring like crazy,0.335618228
but people on the shore on the banks see her,0.321312994
they call rescue people in,0.345429182
they have all the equipment,0.496110797
they work their way to get out to her,0.409047157
theyre gonna rescue her with their their ropes and their belts and their ties,0.30036509
theyre making sure that they can safely get her attached to them so they can get her to shore,0.353964299
what a learning lesson for the young lady,0.304943234
we have a neighborhood boy Billy who loves to play soccer,0.21520716

and was caught up on one of the upper branches,0.300988406
Lisa was calling for the little kitty to come down,0.214538485

and decided to climb up the tree to see if he could get the cat down,0.256624103
well while he was climbing up and the dog was barking the ladder fell down,0.267399609
and so he was stuck up in the tree,0.240520835
so the mother hadta call the fire department,0.344437838
and the fire department brought their ladder on their fire truck,0.346159458
and they came to rescue father and kitty outof the tree,0.24289754

icus were not known then,0.374141574
and so I was put in a semi private room which was what they used during those days,0.22938849
and my classmates specialed,0.444498539
what do I remember about it,0.500571132
I remember being so ill before I had the surgery that I refused the baby because actually we thought I thought that I had the flu,0.342220843
and I was just feeling so badly,0.379258871
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didnt know really what was wrong,0.3075248
but they really didnt think anything was wrong,0.427805007
they just thought that I didnt wanna take care of my little girl,0.300532997
finally after three days I had that,0.375124216
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three am,0.219288871
and finally I had surgery at Monday evening,0.29708454
so I was really very very ill,0.450212568
infact I had peritonitis,0.419444978
and they really did not think that I would live,0.448203087
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they thats just the way they did things,0.301607609
and I actually chose you could choose if you wanted to have the baby to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby,0.282868534
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are healthy and not ill,0.264641166
and I chose the baby to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby,0.268656552
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kindof thought of her as their own,0.262731314
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses,0.238408417
and consequently from that I had ototoxic drugs,0.360775322
so I lost my hearing that way,0.372643143
okay since I am hearing impaired I understand that situation really well,0.339738727
so I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing and not admitting it or not having hearing aids,0.327676922
because you can you just notice that theyre not understanding or theyre not interested in what is being said or theyre just on a different page,0.311371148
and what have I done about it,0.388384372
actually what you do is you just talk to them,0.462497264
and you just go right in front of them sothat they can see your face and your lips,0.309618741
and also if youre in a really noisy environment go outside and where its quiet,0.273456037
okay,0.99999994
oh dont put that on yet I hafta think,0.229739472
ERROR,1
well the only time that I can really remember,0.423209101
is it on,0.389912754
okay the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon,0.282466918
and we were driving in Florida,0.321584105
and seatbelts were new,0.380463213
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car,0.267963916
and we were just driving down a country road,0.324114621
and allofasudden this truck just came right out barreling down the side road,0.359650195
and came right out in front of us,0.295030415
and we actually drove into the ditch,0.314356267
and if we wouldnt have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured,0.29005748
but since we had our seatbelts on we just took my husband just turned the car,0.259494931
and we continued on,0.408326447
and that guy just never that truck just never stopped and just kept going,0.40389058
Imean he was oblivious,0.42641443
okay,0.99999994
well you sure like beginning middles and ends dont you,0.308187425
okay,0.99999994
well it looks to me that it had been raining for many days or raining very hard,0.289791584
and this hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream,0.251029879
and managed to grab a hold of a branch,0.302650213
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in,0.251742899
and the man is there rescuing her,0.3011778
and pulled her to safety,0.371147871
well looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking,0.220759407
well Johnny was kicking really too hard,0.311236411
and kicked the ball right through the neighbors window,0.370811373
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair,0.320798457
and the ball came through the window,0.414822549
knocked over the lamp,0.365064144
and the neighbor went,0.422405183
oh,0.999999881
and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball,0.270084709
well it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school,0.261528462
and mother said,0.461896628
well youknow its sposta rain today,0.286025643
you should take your umbrella,0.455534101
and Johnny says,0.332694769
no Im not going to carry that umbrella,0.274331123
I dont like to carry umbrellas,0.304999143
Im going to go to school,0.303260297
and you can keep the umbrella at home,0.277598917
so he started walking to school,0.32742691
and sure enough it started raining,0.399524599
infact it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands,0.290682435
and run through the puddles,0.398543
and run home,0.460080266
and by the time he got home he was really really wet,0.266998559
and mother said,0.461896628
see I told you it was going to rain,0.30062592
why didnt you take your umbrella,0.337341845
so Johnny started off to school again in dry clothes with his umbrella,0.210034207
okay,0.99999994
oh,0.999999881
when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters,0.290063739
and so Cinderella grew up with two stepsisters,0.255666256
but then the father must have died because allofasudden its the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella,0.331665903
and Cinderella became the cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day,0.284342676
it was the everyone had grown up and gotten older,0.275149971
and they received an invitation from the prince from the castle because the prince was old enough to get married now,0.27411598
and he was looking for a bride,0.293580025
so they were having a big party at the castle,0.28438437
so the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters,0.345139802
and Cinderella overheard it,0.292753339
so she ran to her room,0.304016888
opened up her trunk,0.346244514
and got out her special gown that shed been saving for a long time,0.260404348
she tried it on,0.375440031
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was,0.258412987
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart,0.257845402
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball,0.293872535
so the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball,0.351119757
and Cinderella was left home all by herself,0.251388788
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and especially the mice were felt very sorry for her and were very upset,0.28007105
and then allofasudden a Cinderellas fairy godmother appeared,0.325659037
and said,0.513667703
Cinderella we you are going to go to the ball,0.29047823
and so she fricked,0.468329489
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown,0.269225657
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach,0.256360948
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach,0.336934507
and I think the dog became the footman,0.239518732
and everybody went off to the ball,0.320073813
and she had a wonderful time,0.344835877
oh and she had glass slippers,0.23957184
that was the special thing,0.459070057
the fairy godmother had given her glass slippers,0.268067807
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything the coach would turn back into a pumpkin,0.241898209
and she would not have her dress anymore,0.363626689
so she had a wonderful time at the party and danced with the prince all night,0.286279738
and then allofasudden the clock started striking midnight,0.427995414
so she ran down the steps,0.267389059
and ran into the coach,0.305117041
and ran all the way home,0.33099547
but she had lost her one shoe,0.337497294
so the prince had found the shoe,0.318478763
and said,0.513667703
I will only marry the girl that fits into their shoe,0.246355161
so there was a proclamation sent around that the princes footman would be going around with the shoe,0.266541988
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe,0.262185603
so the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball,0.283675909
so she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket,0.283285648
and the mice connived and got the key outof the pocket,0.272374451
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe,0.270803779
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe,0.329612732
but they didnt make it as because their feet were much larger than Cinderellas,0.269561112
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave,0.282713145
and the mice had just gotten the door open to Cinderellas room,0.250435054
and she came running down the stairs,0.336822867
and said,0.513667703
may I try on the shoe,0.258317858
and the footman said,0.342799544
yes ofcourse,0.637445331
and he went over to try the put the shoe on her,0.250706285
and the stepmother used her cane to trip him,0.300621778
so the shoe fell to the ground and broke,0.303249419
and so the stepmother said,0.358943373
well thats that,0.509213924
and Cinderella said,0.318436533
no,0.99999994
and she pulled the shoe outof her apron pocket,0.24194397
and said,0.513667703
here it is,0.495930731
and so the footman put it on her foot,0.222914189
and the prince said,0.403683305
oh Cinderella,0.491922438
and everybody was happy,0.349695504
the mice were dancing,0.397810102

and youve got a peanut butter jelly sandwich,0.292719275
okay,0.99999994
well I remember when I was young,0.372847736
I think it was probably in the the fall because we were playing football down in the next block on the corner house the Larsons,0.28646791
they had three kids,0.399508089
Christine was the oldest,0.424206793
and she was their natural daughter,0.360165536
and then Joanne a year older than us was their adopted daughter,0.222537413
and Bruce Larson was my buddy,0.234636724
and we were playing a little game of football in his front yard,0.239505246
and we had some older kids with us who joined in our games,0.2404131
my brother was three years older but he didnt play alot in the neighborhood games,0.189504117
but one of them was a jock,0.27383548
his parents were phy,0.306982547
and he tackled me right at at the at the goal line or the,0.267103046
and I got hurt,0.328039527
I had the football in my hand,0.262022376
it was a little fake football,0.305361152
and he landed here,0.364739656
I had a sweatshirt on,0.264086038
and I just got up,0.373234481
and I was kindof crying a little bit,0.34128648
I felt kindof sick to my stomach,0.369766146
and I just said,0.36044234
well I cant I gotta go home,0.281961709
I dont feel good,0.450784683
so when I went home I pulled off my or my mom helped me out of my sweatshirt because my arm was hurting alot,0.222045973
and the the wrist,0.547080576
Imean youknow you could tell it was broken youknow,0.340134382

and the next thing I remember Im on the operating table,0.260777473
and theyre telling me to to count back from a hundred,0.299713045

and he had a stroke around the end,0.327657163
okay,0.99999994
just he slurred his speech and just had a little difficulty saying his words and stuff,0.323398352
and just by being patient,0.391872555
it wasnt that bad,0.345626265
so I just listened and tried to be patient with him,0.321557909
and it it wasnt terribly difficult,0.355220705
and he recovered quite well from his stroke,0.330596983

and she wins the heart of the prince,0.321456432
but shes gotta run away from the the castle quickly at midnight because the spell will stop then,0.230825692
but one of her slippers falls behind,0.283875048
and the prince finds it and looks through the whole kingdom to find a girl that fits the slipper,0.295122147
and sure enough she he finds Cinderella despite the efforts of the evil stepmother to keep him away from Cinderella,0.245075494
and she goes to live happily ever after with the prince,0.291244835
but shes still nel benevolent and brings her stepmother and her two cousins to live in the castle albeit not quite in the high level that she gets to live for the rest of her life,0.242336139
the end,0.63970381
okay theres a home with a little boy and a very upset mother,0.272473991
it looks like the little boy was going to have a birthday party,0.273985147
and the mother had placed the birthday cake on a table,0.286376387
and the family dog had come in,0.309327036
and gotten into the cake,0.299878627
eaten part of it,0.313857645
and retreated under the couch because the mother caught him in the act and was chasing him with a broom,0.30198127
so hes under the couch,0.225614756
the mothers very upset,0.371089995
the little boy is crying,0.343804657
and the guest are starting to arrive,0.332010657
theres another woman with probably her son bearing a gift,0.272537798
and then another mother coming with a daughter with a gift,0.364302725
and theyre just standing in the doorway watching what is going on,0.289231211
I take two pieces of bread from the loaf of bread,0.265160561
put it on a plate,0.326963454
I open the peanut butter,0.334001809
and get a knife,0.315589815
and spread the peanut butter on the bread,0.371176243
I would put the two pieces of bread together,0.285024047
and cut them in two,0.356367618
and I have a peanut butter sandwich,0.318792492
okay the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago,0.226871789
I had vertigo,0.461687922
extreme vertigo,0.728606641
and I was working at the time,0.314362317
I couldnt walk without bumping into things,0.325865835
I was afraid to drive,0.32481873
and I went through all this testing,0.351728082
I was never hospitalized,0.42076081
but I hadta take six weeks off from work,0.261882901
I never miss work,0.452213764
and Ive never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me,0.220178396
I did cat,0.479394555
and they could never find any reason for it,0.405722767
all the blood work was fine,0.323464036
its very frustrating because they dont know how to treat it or what to do,0.351978004
you just hafta wait it out,0.37850219
so I stayed at home,0.336575896
went through all the testing,0.435127616
went to the doctors,0.40721035
finally decided to go to a chiropractor,0.364125311
and my doctor agreed that was fine,0.273832351
so I went for massage therapy and muscle and nerve stimulant,0.297813654
and that helped,0.56571722
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck,0.283190131
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium,0.272697568
now thats not proven,0.432107776
my regular doctor ofcourse doesnt go along with it laughs,0.220021591
my chiropractor thinks thats the answer laughs,0.274617165
but it was just a terrible ordeal,0.439862698
and Ive not had it return,0.304195255
just a little bit once in awhile,0.396279395
but I find that when my back is outof alignment and my discs are compressed that it kindof slows down your your functioning,0.295298636
so anyway that was the worse thing Ive probably experienced,0.351936907
somewhat yes,0.619471371
well my husband has been treated for lung cancer,0.276418895
and he had extreme hard core treatment,0.346885324
he had chemotherapy and radiation,0.406906277
and he had brain radiation,0.383838534
they do that to ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain,0.318743229
but in the process of doing this my husbands been on alotof medications,0.260543823
and hes a very bright man and very articulate,0.32980147
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow,0.302041739
his thought process was very unlike him,0.36006093
he just didnt process well at all,0.262537092
so you hafta be very patient,0.353452832
hafta listen,0.482024252
hafta try not to lose your temper,0.290166616
try not to be argumentative,0.439560711
tried my patience as much as its ever been tried,0.285402745
just kindof wait wait it out,0.488357395
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self,0.285723269
and you work back into it from there,0.369740069
he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment,0.28260994
but it his,0.537969828
and the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me,0.270009607
its just a matter of speaking distinctly,0.389701307
I hadta repeat my myself,0.537125111
I hadta make decisions for him,0.353403002
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it,0.270143718
so we did work through that,0.423671991
actually it went pretty well,0.435089409
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be,0.337064981
and,1
I do not wanna be a care giver laughs,0.292055964
but you work through it,0.488437891
you do what you hafta do,0.475064814
oh yes,0.78150177
lets see,0.576554179
I guess the most frightening time would be I lived in Colorado,0.254832894
and I worked for the telephone company,0.326058239
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley,0.264178038
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down,0.366353154
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities,0.34945938
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne,0.232171908

we closed that office,0.430444479
Boulder we closed that office,0.354002297
and then I went to Cheyenne,0.299464643
and thats about just under a seventy mile trip,0.246697828
and its on il twenty five,0.308735102
it was winter time,0.440777153
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible,0.340051055
I was on the road and a storm came up,0.249410674
I slid off the road,0.318857878
ditched my car,0.417805403
and I hadta call for help to come and get me,0.314041257
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up transmission,0.238749996
so I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley,0.17616798
and he came with a tow truck and got me out,0.236793593
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there,0.260847837
and its very frightening because youre not really sure whats going to happen,0.360752642
but he did get me,0.416859865
we got back to town,0.361903161
they got my car back,0.387955546
and I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne,0.235423326
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over,0.278093398
okay Im not real sure,0.336622566

and shes unable to get out,0.280940711

and he has on a life jacket,0.270922601
and he is going out to rescue her,0.272925436
and it looks like he is very close to getting her,0.30867663
and it looks to me like hes within reach of of grabbing her outof the water,0.201065734
very scary,0.636503398
theres a young boy playing with a soccer ball,0.271615267
and he kicks it,0.334304392

well in about I think it was two thousand and one I became ill with a fairly serious strain of viral something,0.242868528
they couldnt really tell me,0.428983092
but it was highly contagious,0.438797295
I hadta stay outof work for a week,0.223806009
kindof isolated,0.591000319
I was allowed to stay home,0.32119295
I wasnt hospitalized perse except for the initial diagnosis in the er because I had spiked a hundred and four temperature and was having difficulty seeing,0.240733325
the one er doctor that came and saw me thought I might have meningitis,0.264602363
but then his superior came and said it wasnt meningitis,0.259804994
it was just a really bad viral infection,0.348581433
so I was laid up in bed,0.22797063
and what happened throughout each day and evening varied anything from spiking temperature to chills and hot flashes,0.327945709
there was some vomiting ofcourse,0.452393025
alotof nausea,0.543408871
my husband was great,0.349300623
he he wasnt my husband at the time,0.262590677
we were living together,0.443092376
but he made chicken soup for me and and did youknow the clear liquids and and apple juice and things like that and made sure that I was eating,0.26972869
it was kindof frightening actually because I didnt know what was actually happening,0.412465781
a viral infection doesnt really describe much,0.298997521
but I came through it okay,0.357028961
I was really weak,0.426887214
I would say that after that week had passed it took me couple months really to feel like my old self again,0.265094966
but I was okay obviously,0.45521763
Im okay,0.396566153
thats it,0.506868482
sure,0.999999881
what I specifically did about it,0.433920383
ohmygosh I am trying to remember a specific incident,0.284738839
holymoly I cant think of anything right offhand,0.298314273
I know I have been in those situations before,0.349047095
ofcourse I witnessed,0.469861984
its not always me that solves the problem,0.387262821
let me think let me think,0.572076499
well yeah that has happened,0.351540208
on the phone usually,0.416758239
just becauseof cultural differences too,0.477936655
okay,0.99999994
well in the couple instances that I remember I hadta just keep repeating myself,0.355912685
I would try to slow down my words,0.335003883
speak clearly,0.653974056
try to find related words to what I was saying if they didnt understand exactly what I was saying,0.316873014
and ask them leading questions to see if they understood what I was asking of them or trying to explain to them,0.329494506
and I believe resolution came about,0.320256412
from what I recall it sounds like it,0.384312421
again I cant remember a specific instance with who I spoke to and what we spoke about,0.235838801
but in those cases youknow the couple,0.301589131
I remember youknow some time ago it worked out okay I guess,0.330722868
no,0.99999994
oh yeah,0.846038759
oh so many to choose from,0.274950624
she says trying to remember,0.362362295
okay frightened or scared,0.479304135
well there was a time I was actually afraid for someone else,0.31935817
my husband and I when we first started dating he was involved in a group that did medieval reenactment,0.251532942
and part of their events and group gatherings involved a a large gathering where the people could take on personas of warriors,0.349131316
and they would dress up in youknow armor and things like that,0.291868776
and go out and hit eachother with sticks and stuff youknow,0.273528367
no real swords or anything like that,0.410007179
thats not legal,0.463362634
but youknow like I said it was a reenactment,0.270542413
and at one point during a battle at this particular battle he was basically tackled by several members which isnt usual,0.245420411
and when he fell he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor,0.291587591
but they decided to step over him,0.401667625
and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids,0.320327938
and it wrenched,0.443411231
they hadta call the paramedics from a nearby emergency center,0.35012731
we were out on the outskirts of town out on the the country side of Phoenix west Phoenix,0.277849585
and so the closest place was several miles away,0.295168877
and they called the ambulance,0.440983266
they came out put the neck brace on,0.297055721
loaded him,0.467908323
he was in alotof pain,0.268124402
I was freaking out,0.373634875
I didnt know what was going on,0.298118651
I heard things like convulsions,0.436407208
I heard neck broken,0.416313231
I heard just it was craziness,0.403109342
so they loaded him up on the ambulance,0.297002435
I ran back to my tent because I was out there camping with him,0.269939661
grabbed my car keys and hopped in the the car we had taken together,0.229254574
and met him in the emergency room,0.285467535
when I got there they had him in the xray taking xrays of his neck,0.233530059
it turns out he did not break his neck which was a great relief,0.25568229
but he was pretty badly bruised and banged up,0.293638527
he had severe,0.518343687
I was very grateful that it wasnt worse than it was,0.303133637
but that time inbetween youknow what happened and finding out from the doctors was,0.304183364
I yeah I was off the charts,0.259726495
what do you do with that,0.466879636
you have no idea,0.454378068
so it was that was really frightening to go through,0.360205799

and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on stating how I was understanding him sothat at some point if I didnt understand him he would realize that I wasnt understanding him,0.259409457
and rel after several weeks it just got easier and easier to understand what he was saying,0.256674439

and so he was hosting a ball for all the eligible ladies in the kingdom,0.256925017
and Cinderella was also invited but the stepmother would was mean and would not provide a gown for Cinderella,0.256450832
so her Cinderellas animal friends made her a autipu beautiful gown,0.289856046
so when Cinderella was getting ready to leave for the ball the stepsisters saw and the stepmother saw her beautiful gown and were very angry tore the gown up so Cinderella could not go to the ball because she did not have clothes to wear,0.217792258
then the fairy godmother appeared created her a beautiful gown with glass slippers turned a pumpkin into a carriage and I think the mice into to horses but warned Cinderella that she must be home by midnight because everything would return to normal,0.22754693
so Cinderella is whisked off to the ball,0.22051689
gets there,0.574199677
the handsome prince sees her,0.386984259
is dancing,0.522659898
but then the clock starts to strike midnight,0.383247256
and so she runs down the stairs losing one of her a glass slippers,0.231166095
and the prince was unable to find her,0.336876094
and after she was away from the view of the the prince everything did turn back into the pumpkin and the the mice and the original animals,0.328135908
but Cinderella had got to keep one of the glass slippers because it did not go away,0.229264542
and so the prince was so smitten by Cinderella,0.258444101
he was determined to in find the person or the young lady that the slipper would fit,0.267398626
so he sent his one of his staff to try on the remaining glass slipper on all the eligible ladies,0.215886593
the stepmother was very angry when the person came in and tripped him and making the glass slipper break,0.289469868
but Cinderella had her other the other glass slipper and came out and,0.293856859
the the mice,0.587550282
she was put it,0.376834363
Cinderella was actually locked up,0.293643832
but her animal friends were able to get her the key and they unlocked the door,0.29752779
so she was able to show the princes assistant that the glass slipper did indeed fit her and she was the one that was wearing the slippers at the a at the ball,0.256303489
and the prince and Cinderella lived happily after ever,0.318710268
the end,0.63970381
the familys kittycat apparently climbed up the tree,0.351868838
the little girl is calling for the cat to come down but no luck,0.251569748
the dog is barking at the base of the tree to either try to get the cat down,0.261266023
but the dad coming to the rescue climbs up there but apparently he gets stuck in the tree,0.26615116
he cant come cant get the cat nor make his way back down,0.214277029
so,0.99999994
and they were coming to his s he and the cats rescue by bringing a ladder to climb up on the tree and get them both,0.241324887
it looks like they were having a birthday party for a little boy,0.287515044
and people were arriving,0.492676795
their moms and the kids a couple of moms a boy and a girl,0.270443082
and the birthday cake was in the room,0.27818042
and nobody was paying attention,0.338425934
and so the dog ate part of the birthday cake,0.222624972
and tracked it across the floor,0.373009086
is under the couch,0.324901462
and the moms trying to get him with the b,0.283258319
theres a big piece missing outof the birthday cake,0.214182034
you want me to tell you how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.304613203
okay,0.99999994
so you hafta get two pieces of bread peanut butter and jelly and a knife,0.21756202
you hafta put the two pieces of bread down on the counter or plate or something or other,0.255117387
open the jar of peanut butter,0.312414318
take the knife,0.399241
put it in there,0.374995649
take the peanut butter out,0.343082935
spread it out on the piece of bread,0.300978005
do the same thing for the jelly,0.308935702
open the jar of jelly,0.297354043
use the knife to take the jelly out,0.292906106
spread it across the other piece of bread,0.3438389
and put the two pieces of bread together with the jelly and peanut butter,0.318562537
put the lids back on the jars and knife in the sink and youre done,0.239738971
what happened,0.721885204
oh I went skiing and I fell,0.24131012
didnt think I had done anything but somehow or other I managed to break a bone in my wrist,0.25161168
and so I hadta go to the hospital,0.297885686
they hadta xray it twice before they figured out where it was,0.358565092
it hurt like cra,0.375463545
happened in Colorado,0.403254569
came back home,0.532803297
hadta put a cast on it ten weeks,0.230144322
atrophy,0.99999994
the most painful thing Ive ever had in my life,0.279724747
you cant move your hands afterwards,0.330098987
so I hadta go through physical therapy but now its perfectly fine,0.307839483
well its interesting to try to have a conversation with somebody who English is their second language and their first language is Spanish,0.292797953
and I dont know I know ke almost zero Spanish,0.243041575
and so to try to have a conversation of any depth or anything you can really just get the basics,0.330045849
so its very interesting to try to communicate with a s,0.325409323
I think Im communicating just fine,0.36608389
I think theyre not listening,0.447317541
but laughs do you mean ke they couldnt understand what I was saying to them,0.335753441
can I tell you how that was,0.366578579
do you mean ke what was I feeling,0.338044882
what how did I experience that,0.472692072
ohmygosh oh I guess the only time was when I traveled to Mexico,0.256936282
and oh they they stop you going down there sometimes,0.391800106
and theyll pull you over,0.323809534
and theyll ask you ke what do you have in your trunk or things like that,0.290627599
or theyll say something to me,0.341768742
I have no idea what they are saying to me,0.366777271
and then finally theyll find English words,0.319645226
and Ill be ke,0.239775464
and so its just its just its its a little scary because you dont know you really dont know what theyre trying to say,0.30682829
and you could get in trouble if you dont respond the right way,0.312835336
because of communication like that,0.499814153
or just when was I frightened or scared,0.354536355
you know what,0.707741976
it was the strangest thing,0.433769941
I I made a right hand turn,0.350337327
and I thought that I looked but I didnt see the car,0.320970416
and so when I turned once I was turning then I did see the car,0.309583277
and I thought I was going to get hit but I didnt,0.302562445
but its amazing because my entire body flooded with adrenaline,0.318950534
I felt like I had gotten hit,0.387731522
nothing had happened but it just it scared me like crazy because I just knew for sure they were going to hit the back of me but they didnt,0.326433063
there was there was a girl that was out hiking with her family,0.310868502
and all a sudden there was a storm that came up,0.304159611
and in Arizona we get alotof flash floods,0.208870396
and unfortunately she got in a part where theres the flash floods,0.276280254
and she got caught out in the water,0.280660778
she was able to get a hold of a stick and hang onto that,0.237293005
and so they called the rangers,0.391160607
and they came out,0.39896065
and they rescued her from the water,0.358178735
there was a little boy that was outside playing with his soccer ball,0.287866771
and he was practicing his kicks and kicked it,0.290806621
and it got away from him,0.309145153
and it went through the window of the neighbors house and landed in,0.342099428
and the neighbor was sitting in his easy chair,0.289584905
and he got up and saw the hole in the window,0.269056827
and looked out and saw the little boy,0.321414769
and said,0.513667703
well I guess youre gonna hafta mow my lawn for the next fifteen years to pay off the window,0.165787533
www,1.000000119
okay,0.99999994
there was a little boy who was leaving to go to school with his backpack,0.25322035
and his mom told him to take the umbrella,0.238306969
and he said,0.372952074
no no I dont need the umbrella,0.282834738
so he waves goodbye to his mom and he heads off to school,0.254311055
and sure enough it starts raining a little bit,0.368683338
and then it rains really really hard,0.47348544
and hes drenched,0.237902358
so he decides he better go back home and get his umbrella so he can maybe stay a little bit dry,0.261474788
okay,0.99999994
so,0.99999994
and they were mean to her,0.37349692
they made her do all the chores,0.312957406
and she became friends with all the animals because were in the Disney version the animals in the in the house and outside the house,0.35920915
and so there came the announcement that there was going to be a ball that the prince was gonna have a ball,0.269771993
and all the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball,0.342238724
so they got all ready to go,0.398995996
and Cinderella couldnt go to the ball,0.230077684
but her little friends decided that they would help her,0.434069991
and her fairy godmother came along and wanted Cinderella to go to the ball,0.268837482
so she turned lets see a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses and got her a gown and glass slippers and sent Cinderella off to the ball,0.201610595
and she met PrinceCharming there,0.36090067
and she danced with him,0.391316921
and just had a great time,0.390217125
but she hadta be back before midnight because everything would go back to pumpkins and mice and everything would disappear except for the glass slipper,0.300431192
so she runs outof the she runs out and loses her glass slipper,0.213433355
and so the prince decides hes gonna try find her by going through the land and taking the glass slipper around,0.220197365
and trying it on everybody,0.396942049
and they lock Cinderella up in the tower because the stepmother doesnt want her to try on the slipper in case it fits,0.217437088
she tries to get the her daughters to cram their feet in it but it doesnt fit,0.23749651
and their little friends get her outof the tower,0.288241893
she comes down,0.398232818
tries on the slipper,0.353587508
and it fits,0.372495621
and then she marries PrinceCharming and lives happily ever after,0.354996145
there was a cat that went up the tree and got stuck,0.238637045
and the little girl wanted her father to get the cat out,0.300851494
so he got the ladder out and climbed up the tree to get the cat,0.241595462
and then the ladder fell down,0.382182002
so hes stuck in the tree,0.220073491
the cats stuck in the tree,0.31303966
and the dogs barking below them,0.393683523
so they hadta call the fire department whos coming with a ladder so they can get the cat and the man both outof the tree,0.231307819
this is a story about a birthday party gone awry,0.279235005
here was a beautiful birthday cake with candles on it,0.253664672
and the neighbors were invited over with their children for Tommys birthday,0.273284018
apparently he was four years old,0.359285831
there were four candles on the cake,0.281252176
but Tommys dog saw the cake unattended and took a big hunk outof it,0.157163501
and then he ran underneath the sofa to hide from the mom who got very angry and had her broom out and was gonna beat the dog with the broom for chewing up the cake,0.186832607
in the meantime all the guests were arriving,0.382924199
there was a little boy guest with a present and a little girl guest with the present and their moms,0.281873137
and they were seeing the whole event unfold as they approached the room for the birthday party,0.317982763
the end,0.63970381
the boy was crying,0.360862732
he wasnt very happy on his birthday,0.221502006
in order you take out your bread,0.335719645
you lay out your two pieces of bread,0.268323421
you can put your jelly on one piece and your peanut butter on the other,0.278980464
flop them together,0.48616299
slice them,0.607384145
and voila you have your peanut butter and h jelly sandwich,0.267555565
I had a gallbladder attack on my twentieth wedding anniversary,0.204019889
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs,0.22946386
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown gallbladder attack which is very very painful,0.208706036
and so I went to the hospital,0.29969278
I was beginning to turn green,0.306297153
and I had the surgery done,0.301030278
I was in the hospital about three days,0.266440064
thats before they did it with any kind of scopes,0.313239098
youknow they did a regular open laparotomy,0.275131583
so,0.99999994
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work,0.255342275
so I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure,0.286974132
and then once its over you feel alot better thats for sure,0.285389394
okay the problems are word finding and the ability to speak,0.329214483
my mothers disability is apraxia aphasia,0.353323519
and so she sometimes uses different words to try to get her point across,0.289777398
what I do is I offer her extra time,0.300896823
sometimes extra processing time helps,0.472080797
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the is it this and touch,0.288850129
if its an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever,0.298194915
sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is alittle better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it,0.344199866
and then because we live with each other and were together so much I can kindof read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs,0.288064569
ke today with I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring,0.235393941
and I figured that maybe they didnt take her credit card,0.281621277
so for the most part I can kindof guess so,0.331058502
a little bit like VannaWhite,0.532334924
is it this,0.577016592
is it that,0.567281723
does it begin with the letter,0.327566296
sometimes beginning letters help,0.500572443
so thats how we work it out,0.394275069
my husband and I were in WashingtonDC doing some sightseeing,0.270548105
and it turned when we came off a a boat trip it it got a little darker,0.279809237
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel,0.351022035
and so we were walking along,0.361800045
and it went was pretty isolated street,0.30117318
there wasnt alotof people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station,0.248775393
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us youknow maybe twenty yards back,0.2275334
and it was three young kids three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough,0.305640489
and so I was very I I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing,0.326203287
and my husband said if they come after us Im gonna take the the movie camera,0.182949349
and Ill hit em,0.234632522
and you run like hell,0.349424332
so we were picking up the pace,0.308983326
as we picked up the pace they picked up the pace,0.291846722
and as we turned the corner there was a bus station,0.269791573
and people were waiting there,0.486917645
so we were just so grateful to see other people,0.390468985
and they backed off,0.423854411
and they left us alone,0.392535329
so I think it was a couldve been a robbery youknow,0.281817555
and thats it,0.421838701
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldnt,0.28142038
and this lady was driving her suv thinking she could get through the wash,0.252537817
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along,0.293944985
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her,0.355207324
and so it appears as though the hes strapped hes got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot,0.24088569
hes holding onto a branch thats hanging into the rushing water,0.272493094
and he is attempting the rescue,0.339085907
no Im not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but Im assuming thats the belt for helping her,0.218468979
I dont know,0.538106382
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer,0.209144905
so hes kicking a soccer ball down the neighborhood street and inadvertently kicks the wrong way and hits a bi,0.219115198
and the soccer ball goes through the neighbors picture window,0.304934323
goes through the window,0.418729305
knocks over the lamp,0.338262826
scares the neighbor,0.433451861
the neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it,0.264245063
and hes got the soccer ball in his hand but he cant seem to find who kicked it,0.187347367
but Ill bet ya,0.314657748
the end,0.63970381
well its time for Joey to go to school,0.244469464
and his mom said,0.28837055
youknow Joey I looked out the window,0.246020421
it looks like in the looks like it might rain today,0.355584085
and the weathermen said that rain could be coming today,0.347509533
oh,0.999999881
he said,0.528301835
no Ma,0.455533445
I dont wanna take that umbrella,0.320151269
only sissies carry umbrellas,0.384182483
not kids like me,0.474153966
Im not gonna take that umbrella,0.232395455
and I dont think its gonna rain anyway,0.244201675
well there he goes out,0.336912334
and whats happening but his mom was right,0.278960437
it starts to rain,0.403528452
first just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder,0.318092406
and the puddles are deep,0.380734473
and when he comes home he is soaked to the skin,0.243933603
his mother is very angry with him because he did not listen to her and take the umbrella,0.269113004
so the next time that this occurs and theres rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry,0.236358821
that was a lesson learned,0.398786426
hmhm,0
Cinderellas mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls her stepmother and her stepsisters,0.331970394
as time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls,0.284239143
and she is very cruel to Cinderella,0.267026514
she uses her as a servant,0.327534169
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning,0.321874857
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along,0.294957191
and the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals were not treated as well,0.354008198
but Cinderella loved them all,0.399643719
and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice,0.378927439
and and they all loved her,0.447019786
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle,0.291629136
in the castle there was a wonderful prince handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married,0.280233324
and the princes servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife,0.337997139
and so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball,0.274027944
and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery,0.257947475
and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time,0.287846178
well the stepmother got the invitation,0.376400411
she only considered her daughters and she didnt consider Cinderella at all,0.236666068
so she got the her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery,0.277013421
and they were ugly stepsisters,0.360723406
and Cinderella made her own dress,0.320769846
and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress,0.334510356
and when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball that they are gonna go to the ball but she is not,0.234331951
so she was put into locked into a room,0.284754902
and she was visited by the fairy godmother,0.305731267
and the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the the ball,0.291082591
so the fairy godmother with her magic bitty bippetyboppetyboo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown,0.253209323
and outof a pumpkin she made a carriage,0.247094065
and outof the mice she made horsemen horses to carry the carriage to the palace,0.285803854
and she was dressed in her the most beautiful woman in the in the land,0.336206973
but she did have a stipulation,0.357300192
she said that she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear,0.309389591
so she went to the ball,0.295837134
and she was the bell of the ball,0.321254849
and she caught the eye of the prince,0.335192055
and the prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters,0.30881232
so she danced the night away,0.342723459
and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes,0.274811506
and she knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the the night would disappear at that time,0.292915195
so she ran from the prince,0.271450192
and as she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps,0.224523023
and she ran and she ran,0.341162682
and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night,0.336810142
the pumpkin returned to its former self,0.275115997
and and the animals were no longer horses,0.393700242
and everything returned to theirselves to what they were,0.437273383
when she returned home the stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace,0.257800281
and they would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper,0.257124215
so the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it didnt work,0.244391263
and they a mouse brought her the key Cinderella the key,0.318935305
she got outof the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on,0.208590895
she tried it on,0.375440031
it was a fit,0.37116611
and the prince then designated her as his princess,0.392285436
and they got married and lived happily ever after,0.303366333
we have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard,0.249350622
but we also have a kittycat who loves to go up the tree,0.253370166
and the kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and couldnt get down,0.243063182
so dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all,0.204184666
it appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree,0.242025807
he then took a ladder dad did,0.285580277
put it up against the tree to climb and get the cat,0.247335538
but the ladder fell down,0.358130068
so after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree,0.278387785
the fire department not police department,0.470727175
and theres also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree,0.272423208
thats it,0.506868482
one afternoon the little girls cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch,0.237399682
and she was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down,0.291438341
and her father being the silly man that he is decided to go up and take care of the cat,0.22766009
try to get the cat,0.320117086
so as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch,0.245731011
and the ladder falls off of the tree,0.355266333
at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and which scares the cat all the more,0.275046885
and the cat is not gonna come to the father,0.237490475
but the father cant get outof the tree anyway,0.227372944
so they hafta call the fire department,0.254337698
who comes and rescues the man outof the tree,0.253179908
and rescues the cat,0.3520118
the end,0.63970381

slice it longways sothat its open,0.351597607
its nice and crunchy on top,0.274873704

I wouldnt use grape jelly,0.311704576
but you can use other kinds of jelly,0.338619262
and I I like strawberry,0.409256339
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together,0.360283792
I put it on there,0.366530299
and then I take that sandwich,0.360968173
and I put it in the microwave,0.270458192
and I heat it sothat the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together,0.2923868

four years ago I had my knees replaced,0.233099163
I had them both done at the same time,0.303519398
it was scheduled for July the fifth,0.268980831
however they fouled up on the scheduling so it wasnt done until the next week which is I think July the eleventh or twelfth,0.194854334
we I went into the hospital at seven in the morning six thirty or seven in the morning,0.272696584
they prepped me,0.51768893
and I went into the operating room about eight,0.285936624
and woke up about eleven eleven fifteen with two new knees,0.275902987
they told me to go ahead and use the the morphine drip for pain,0.234140128
and so thats what I did,0.347543925
I used the morphine drip for pain,0.273611903
and unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them I have a sensitivity to morphine,0.290838897

I I begin to see rats coming outof of the wall,0.218984723
I got real oozy,0.392985582
and I passed out,0.317512572
and the next thing I remember was the doctor standing over me saying,0.296754926

and I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again,0.227257282

they run me down the hallway,0.320249319
they were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that,0.333212137
so the next day I woke up,0.264595002
and I was fine,0.31330657
and they got me walking around,0.350802362
and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees,0.230297416
I did have some pain pills but it wasnt morphine,0.327124238
and my knees oh,0.317041159

inflections on the few words that she can say,0.278033674
and doing things that allow you to figure out what shes trying to say,0.329991579
she still has trouble just saying the most simple words,0.344493568
this morning when we got up why we were in the bathroom,0.277250439
and she was trying to tell me I always put a rubberband around the bottom of the toothpaste,0.223294124

because it had we hadnt started rolling it up yet,0.311467648
and it took her two minutes,0.267481059
when I get the newspaper in the morning I take a rubberband and put it on the handle of my chair,0.228229135
and so it took her two minutes to tell me to go in and get a rubberband off my chair and put it on the toothpaste,0.194838896

she cant get in it either,0.259788305
and the prince says,0.391356617
hey is there any other girls around youknow around the house here,0.28661266
and they say,0.439308643
nope there isnt anybody,0.27908498
and Cinderella on the other hand is looking from the kitchen where shes scrubbing the floors,0.270736217
and she hears this,0.380049676
and the prince says,0.391356617
wait a minute I just saw somebody in the kitchen,0.256788075
and they said,0.43198812
oh thats thats our stepdaughters,0.297737002
she doesnt she you dont even wanna see her,0.339279354
shes too ugly,0.352629483
and so he goes in,0.279469669
and she is shes pretty straggled,0.266596109
her hairs all all a flutter,0.379714221
shes in a charwomans dress,0.272345811
and he says,0.357835323

she looks alittle familiar,0.475406289
youknow if she had a good bouffant hairdo and a white dress Id probably recognize her,0.221012905
so he tries on the slipper on the Cinderella,0.256323844
and it fits fits like a glove,0.32530424
and he says,0.357835323

and she says,0.378272772

and he says,0.357835323

yeah they keep me tied up in the kitchen,0.216682956
I cant get out,0.376515746
I dont get to do anything,0.441773236
and he says,0.357835323
well well take care of them,0.390161902
and so he says,0.335171044
comeon lets go,0.439213872
lets get outof this hellhole,0.344131738
and so they get he he picks her up,0.312884808
he takes her over to his carriage,0.355500817
and they go back to the castle,0.362927407
the king is ecstatic because hes found she he he knows that the prince likes the girl,0.300622016
probably friends but thats alright,0.46241343
and and the prince and the girl they get married,0.352702826
its a storybook wedding,0.383020759
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
the end,0.63970381
oh,0.999999881
and there was a little girl that was caught up in that flash flood,0.280438215
and she was rushed down the river or down the down the area where the flood was,0.331197381
and she i she reached out and grabbed the tree branch,0.244664118
and the tree branch she held onto that tree branch until a rescuer came,0.271055996
and the rescuer he he came acrosst,0.365728974
and he got to the tree branch,0.301374286
and he has a big belt that hes putting around her waist and her arm and her head sothat he can keep her with him while they swim outof the flooded area that theyre in in the in the rushing water,0.232656464
a little boy was playing soccer,0.325858027
he was having a great time kicking the soccer ball,0.314337313
he did a he was a good kicker,0.324861526
and and but it went off the end of his foot one time,0.290854365
and it went through a neighbors window,0.312696487
and there was a gentlemen sitting there watching television nice and easy,0.303959846
he had a lamp sitting beside him,0.324418426
he was really comfortable,0.431752861
and when the when the ball went through the window it hit the lamp,0.33706063
knocked the lamp over,0.365064144
and startled the man cause his hands opened up,0.313156426
and when he was startled he jumped up,0.334874421
he looked out the window,0.356445879
was and was looking for the little boy,0.322069079
and he and he had the soccer ball in his hand,0.32212463
a little boy was leaving in the morning to go to school,0.265210986
and his mom says,0.29190886
hey take this umbrella with ya,0.236571252
it looks like it might rain today,0.448615223
and the little kid says,0.302137494
absolutely not,0.771212101
Im not gonna be some dummy and carry an umbrella with me,0.171931759
so she says,0.449297577
okay I think you really oughta take it,0.511031985
and he says,0.357835323
no,0.99999994
bye mom,0.59498024
Im not taking the umbrella,0.240388572
he gets about a third of the way to school,0.250470698
it begins to rain,0.379534096
he says,0.504161835
oh jeez its raining,0.343075693
so he begins to run back to the house,0.312122673
he gets back to the house,0.343431145
hes all wet,0.276388228
his mom is alittle perturbed with him,0.286788762
hes perturbed with himself because now hes all wet,0.261192679
and but oh in the next picture he changed his clothes,0.243650138
and oh picked up the umbrella,0.244043037
and and walked onto school went on back to school,0.30396542
the end,0.63970381
oh okay,0.663836598
first you take two pieces of bread,0.284545988
and you get out the peanut butter and a knife,0.28637141
and you smear the peanut butter on one side of the bread,0.281737715
and then you get out the jelly and a knife,0.303376883
and smear the jelly on the other side of the bread,0.341846645
then you take the,0.482491046
and thats your sandwich,0.337691456
you dig a hole in the soil,0.278594077
and then you take the flower outof its pot,0.266602665
and you hafta loosen the roots,0.274081975
and if you want you can put MiracleGrow underneath,0.408873796
I love gardening,0.494670242
and you put the flower in the hole,0.315688699
and then you fill it back up with dirt,0.33101818
and then you water it,0.460047334
it is the little boys birthday,0.28658703
hes having his birthday party today,0.282687277
but the dog found the cake,0.322478831
and ate a big chunk outof the cake,0.216037333
and left caky doggie footprints all the way under the couch,0.27457431
the mother is ma,0.302438706
shes got the broom,0.255903125
I think shes gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why its hiding,0.190696582
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived,0.31276843
so they are coming in with their presents seeing a a mangled cake for the birthday,0.254603207
oh and it looks like the little boy is crying,0.284221411
okay so I was hospitalized well sortof in November for abdominal surgery,0.215113387
and I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before,0.298417658
but it kicked in really fast,0.351739705
ke they tell you to take three deep breaths,0.276095718
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out,0.317218095
and it was kindof like taking a long blink,0.301753819
and then I opened my eyes,0.30070892
and it was like three hours later,0.278408557
which was really strange because usually ke youknow when you sleep you can feel time passing,0.316165566
ke it didnt feel like any time had passed,0.243115082
so it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that youknow three hours had gone by,0.215696171
everything was all over with,0.402177453
and then I was on pain meds,0.291825682
I stayed overnight,0.454583585
and then I went home,0.365488172
I was on pain meds,0.301121086
but then I I was able to go off of those,0.279530555
Im not sure what else you wanna know about it,0.384759128
no not off hand,0.403874516
okay so I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator,0.20499754
she would hold things in,0.339665562
and youknow you could just feel the energy that she was upset,0.294312149
but she wouldnt talk about it,0.362675577
I asked her on numerous occasions to youknow if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her,0.267590016
she always said,0.472317278
no,0.99999994
and then she kindof passively aggressively started youknow not participating in things or youknow just kindof being rude I guess,0.284504324
so it finally youknow broke my last little straw,0.320147723
and I yelled at her one day,0.246813953
and kicked her outof the group,0.263331622
so thats what I did about it,0.407501459
okay well Im afraid of heights,0.214808226
even little heights,0.587406218
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder,0.308387548
so I decided one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving youknow thing youknow jump I guess thats what you call it a jump for his birthday,0.227702722
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too,0.364484429
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights,0.260103375
so we went sky diving,0.337184101
and it was terrifying,0.401592255
and when I when we jumped outof the plane youknow youre attached to someone else,0.242825881
so when we jumped outof the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute while we were free falling because I was just ke,0.232532144
and then the parachute opens,0.390143365
and then you start gliding which is kind of nice,0.295228124
that was that was better,0.50033766
it was a little bit more like being a bird youknow and flying,0.290553689
so that was nice for a little bit,0.34238863
and then we landed,0.411098123
and then that was that,0.531902373
and I said Im glad I did it,0.299889505
and Ill never do it again,0.314762175
and Im still afraid of heights,0.248805791
so the story starts with the flood,0.350289255
theres lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city,0.281657457
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat to save her cat from the flood and the rains,0.246112958
so she got caught in the flood,0.268184423
she got swept downstream,0.341926128
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out,0.250429064
and shes been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her,0.285485238
someone saw her,0.447108626
called the fire department,0.483359307
and now the the firemen are there,0.44648096
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on,0.263604581
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him I think thats what that looks like to get her outof the water,0.241900593
and thats the end,0.393853188
okay the boy is playing soccer outside,0.248411044
he kicks the ball really hard,0.343434781
it goes crashing into the window,0.359148711
it crashes through the window into the lamps m,0.297753662
he jumps up,0.407207966
he grabs the ball,0.340800047
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it,0.239019364
yep,1
the boy is leaving for school,0.292783022
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella,0.247633263
it might rain,0.536611497
and he says,0.357835323
Ill be fine,0.337402701
bye mom,0.59498024
so he leaves,0.45608902
he goes outside,0.402307153
and its sprinkling a little bit,0.395255476
and then its r,0.397481084
and theres puddles all over,0.330083013
and mom was right,0.317110807
so hes running back home in the rain,0.260156423
he comes home all sopping wet,0.309070677
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face,0.228902012
and he gets the umbrella,0.309206367
and leaves again for school with the umbrella,0.353306919
okay well the father his wife dies,0.299101055
and he is left in the care of his single daughter,0.260103643
and he remarries,0.406693459
and he remarries evil but she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella,0.300647318
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own,0.266177118
and they live together,0.518913805
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen,0.355854392
and the dad is kindof nowhere in this part of the story laughs,0.274049789
and then theres Cinderella lets see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them,0.198808461
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream,0.271491736
so then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married,0.298178196
and he must have a ball to find his wife,0.256408781
so they send out invitations to around the town,0.309883058
and the stepmother gets the invitation,0.438463241
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince,0.282318234
so they get ready,0.545196414
Cinderella has the the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress,0.267440498
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them,0.289957643
but her sisters say no she cant go,0.259711415
she hasta stay and clean,0.285030454
and they rip her dress,0.306847334
she goes back up to her room crying while her sisters and stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball,0.304406494
then the ir her fairy godmother appears,0.31340611
and says she will create the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball,0.224430457
but she has back by midnight or shell turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin,0.226915523
so and she gets glass slippers,0.295329958
so she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers,0.243507549
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her,0.350035787
and her stepmother and the sisters dont know who she is because she looks so different,0.280943811
and then it gets to be midnight,0.349288523
and she says,0.378272772
oh I needta go home,0.363830835
so she runs away from the prince,0.276492596
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs,0.2309677
and she runs home,0.350958258
and the her dress turns back to rags,0.293380141
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin,0.291463941
but she still has her glass slipper,0.34002015
then the next day the prince sends out someone to fit the glass slipper on all the womens feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was,0.223121837
so they show up with the slipper at her house,0.264808297
and the stepmother locks her in the room locks Cinderella in the room,0.328365147
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsisters feet which it doesnt fit because they have big feet,0.246381983
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room,0.238335639
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper,0.271953076
and loandbehold it fits,0.372495621
so they bring her back to the prince,0.373031735
and they get married,0.360645145
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
the little girls pet cat is stuck up in the tree,0.224371225
shes gotten off her tricycle and is concerned,0.213574514
jumping up and down trying to get the cat to come down,0.310922712
the father decides to help,0.454669356
so he gets the ladder,0.308256865
climbs up the tree,0.388544083
and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down,0.30808118
and the dog is barking at him,0.279108375
and is probably going to bite him when he comes down,0.286592692
but in the meantime the fire department is coming,0.362455964
theyre on their way with the ladder to come save both the man and the cat,0.279349774
you take some bread,0.489758372
you take some peanut butter,0.436125666
you take some jelly and a knife,0.29994604
and you get two pieces of bread,0.287033021
you take the knife,0.374427348
spread the peanut butter on one piece of the bread,0.318705827
take the knife,0.399241
and spread the jelly on the other piece,0.350474775
and put the two pieces together,0.38987413
theres a birthday cake on the table,0.255875349
and its the little boys birthday,0.296854973
but when you look at the cake you see that there was a big hole a big bite taken outof the cake,0.233287781
and there are paw prints going to the dog thats hiding under the couch,0.260304183
so the mother is mad and chasing the dog with the broom because shes upset,0.239700273
and at the same time that shes chasing the dog and upset about the cake being bitten into the little boy has friends arriving for his birthday party with gifts,0.226163462
one time I was playing with some weights at a gym,0.258272111
and I was trying to fix something,0.31148088
and the weights came down and smashed my thumb,0.28656882
I remember it was throbbing,0.397132635
it hurt,0.615923643
but it healed and got better,0.381227195
Ive spent time outof the country with people that didnt speak English,0.197322771
and I usually ended up acting things out like I was playing charades to get myself understood,0.284625471
or scared,0.522030354
yeah I useta live in California,0.246975422
and I was there for the big Northridge earthquake,0.270577699
that was pretty scary,0.420110106
yeah it was about five in the morning and my dog started barking,0.221979916
and he usually didnt get up that early to start barking,0.269724637
so I was alittle alarmed,0.446573019
and I turned around,0.369461477
and before I could open my mouth to say what is it what do you hear allofasudden I started to feel the ground shake,0.267159015
and you could feel it,0.441622615
and then I heard crashes and boom and crash and boom,0.302026033
and I lived in California on a hillside,0.243487626
and so I was I was in the back of the house,0.281628758
and I was only afraid that the front half of the house had fallen off and fell down the hill,0.27465421
but when Ive it seemed like it stopped,0.400913626
and it seemed like it went on for a long time,0.28843528
but Im guessing it was probably ten seconds,0.305609941
but when I finally got up to go look my kitchen was a mess and and half the things in every cabinet had fallen on the floor but the structure of the house was intact,0.243663698
but I had alotof stuff to clean up,0.296161294
theres a girl caught in the water in a current,0.281933665
and shes stuck,0.258264303
and the guy with the life jacket on is holding onto a tree and trying to rescue her,0.250999391
theres a boy outside kicking around a soccer ball,0.287789136
he kicks the soccer ball,0.340687573
it hits the window,0.356788784
breaks the window,0.514734507
and goes into the house,0.387405813
it knocks over a lamp where a man is sitting,0.273371041
and the man gets up,0.315280467
takes the ball,0.437428147
and goes to look over the window to see where the ball came from,0.291382939
theres a little boy whos leaving for school,0.257128835
and his mothers handing him an umbrella,0.327991188
he tells her he doesnt need the umbrella,0.231015176
and he leaves,0.424337655
while hes outside walking it starts to rain,0.291800559
and then its coming down even harder,0.411746889
and hes coming home,0.286890209
and she looks at him because hes all wet,0.245345578
and he gets the umbrella and goes back out,0.295197219
now he has the umbrella to protect him,0.290217638
now youre really testing my memory,0.350454628
throat there was a a woman with two daughters,0.296757489
and she married a man who had a daughter,0.337956458
and once they got together the womans daughters turned the mans daughter into sortof their housekeeper their servant and treated her very poorly,0.281064421
and she was never very happy,0.364507884
then the mother got an invitation to a fancy ball that the king was having and the prince was having at the land,0.307383925
and the woman was getting her daughters ready,0.339479864
and Cinderella was looking at some pretty dresses and trying to decide what to wear,0.267596155
and the stepsisters were taking her clothes and taking parts of her dress,0.345074743
and she was all upset,0.31275937
and they were getting all dressed to go to the ball,0.330318987
and then a fairy godmother came and found Cinderella upset,0.269511402
and waved her magic wand,0.417650312
and gave Cinderella a gorgeous dress,0.277785778
and made her all pretty,0.364789784

one day I was out to lunch with my friend Bill,0.222365633
it was a work day,0.351221323
and we were at Mimis cafe,0.206320629
and my stomach started hurting,0.358399272
and I thought that it might just be stre,0.450408101
so I ignored it,0.529961109
but by seven oclock that night I was throwing up constantly,0.26492855
it never the pain never let up,0.381883919
and I was just throwing up throwing up throwing up,0.372466594
at five oclock in the morning I decided well I had decided before but at five oclock in the morning I felt comfortable calling my exhusbands father my ex father inlaw to come get the two older kids,0.197983265
who were ten and nine at the time,0.333146602
and I didnt have my third one,0.251141906
so my two kids,0.382169276
and take them to his wife,0.36412546
and drive me to the hospital,0.348087817
which he did,0.414891362
and I spent from,0.297483534
they did alotof tests on me,0.277498096
they found out that I have one kidney,0.375248432
I was thirty one years old,0.332327902
and I had no idea I only had one kidney,0.305749536
but they looked for kidney stones,0.370602399
and they only saw one kidney which was huge,0.293844044
and they thought,0.592085898
whats going on,0.35614109
they looked for the other one,0.432551593
they never found it because I dont have another one,0.387520522
so I found out I didnt have another kidney,0.304696918
and I also found out I didnt have kidney stones,0.255886257
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis,0.299360424
and it was about to kill me,0.289129525
so Doctor Geiger came,0.263829887
he was the anesthesiologist,0.437194049
he introduced himself,0.468057483
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists,0.226994574
I said,0.525946558
yes,0.999999881
I was in alotof pain,0.249384701
because the pain medication they had given me,0.365858436
I couldnt have any more,0.392590165
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons,0.417819411
so I was in alotof pain,0.248374626
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things,0.237010121
and so Doctor Geiger put me under,0.197580069
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly,0.279398829
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a,0.296742916
what are those things called,0.43854171
a ventilation tube down my throat,0.329933107
and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up,0.281056613
and they gave me some medication,0.336854726
and sent me home,0.318258762
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo,0.209373176
and now I have a third baby,0.2617037
the end,0.63970381
okay one time I was at,0.287841618
oh was it SeaWorld,0.264431834
it was SeaWorld in SanDiego,0.321841717
with three children,0.517735898
one of which was in a stroller,0.322622925
and I was walking,0.335155636
and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said,0.258755386
look,0.99999994
so I was looking,0.390480846
and then there was a man off to the right of the of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily,0.248427555
and I looked up at him and there was he was indicating to me something,0.266528487
and I looked to my right,0.34818849
and theres a woman there with a stroller,0.331073999
and shes fuming at me,0.251313746
and shes telling her husband six feet away to tell me that Im in her way,0.214835644
and I look over at the woman,0.262144595
and she looks at me like she wants to hit me,0.249811232
and shes yelling at her husband to tell me,0.249071732
so I looked at her husband,0.333197117
and I looked at her,0.292445004
and I said,0.329179674
she can talk to me,0.350721002
and the words excuse me work very well,0.311610341
and so I looked at her,0.293231845
and she continued to fume at me,0.263067871
didnt say a single thing to me until after her husband had told me to move,0.227974787
then she cussed at me and called me a name,0.24238649
and so I basically let her live her miserable life,0.34427157
and thats all I really did about it,0.368390977
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred and six degree temperature,0.233430058
so I took her to the emergency room,0.269945353
and she wouldnt take anything orally,0.329310089
she jus,0.545365334
and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard eventhough her temperature was a hundred and six was a good sign,0.291037083
so they gave her,0.378512442
whats the nice way to say this,0.319591105
a rectal fever reducer,0.452876866
and she eventually got better,0.382880569
we got her on antibiotics,0.299033672
but I was extremely afraid because it was my first child,0.344760597
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred and six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature,0.250970602
so I took her to the hospital,0.284171999
and she eventually got better,0.382880569
okay once upon a ti,0.253433794
it was raining very hard,0.401789308
but she hadta get home,0.435827434
and so she crossed the bridge,0.347713709
but the bridge wasnt very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was decaying the under girders,0.293408781
made that up,0.421673298
and so the bridge gave way,0.31498754
and the girl fell off of the bridge,0.312523693
for she was really riding a bike,0.31330961
and it was a rumbly bridge,0.340011954
and she fell into the water,0.340684772
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help,0.267369092
eventually someone heard her cries for help,0.332902402
and put on all the rescue necessary rescue gear,0.308281392
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her,0.286913067
and she was very grateful,0.346509248
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him,0.288984835
and he said,0.372952074
dont ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain,0.202229202
and be safe,0.456286758
the end,0.63970381
one day a bo,0.322470397
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball,0.294404179
and he kicked it into the air,0.301556259
and it crashed through a neighbors window,0.319850713
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window,0.281497687
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window,0.308668017
but the boy ran away,0.27690959
and the man walked outside looking for the boy,0.322459966
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball,0.263939232
the man scolded him,0.418402135
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge,0.227281451
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even,0.252257735
the end,0.63970381
one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain,0.240503773
and told him to take an umbrella,0.240839958
the boy said,0.320522249
no Ill be fine mom,0.240010783
and the mother was hesitant,0.431927532
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella,0.299472481
then the boy was walking to school,0.324921489
and it started to rain,0.346532226
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didnt have control over everything like he thought he did,0.294753522
and so he,0.447678149
and wetly came in the door saying nothing,0.311809391
but showing his mother that she was indeed right,0.423867315
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being,0.298612028
so she gave it to him,0.37260589
and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mothers love,0.287128329
the end,0.63970381
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella,0.267055452
I would guess,0.58945632
there was a little girl,0.396983713
and her father was widowed,0.44289729
and so he remarried,0.345779866
and the new stepmother had two daughters the girls age,0.327372402
and the stepmother was not very nice,0.332512051
and as the dad got outof the picture by an unfortunate series of events the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave,0.226649061
and turned her into basically a scullery maid,0.278342426
and made her clean out the fireplace,0.341251075
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I dont know what her name was before,0.235204831
and the one da,0.398266196
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife,0.271520078
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mothers old dress,0.20171085
and the,0.791413784
lets just call her the wicked stepmother,0.291586012
the wicked stepmother was not interested in letting Cinderella go,0.255754828
so when Cinderella came downstairs she,0.341953456
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress,0.270655066
actually not Cinderella,0.502779543
she didnt do that at all,0.288894713
and they had taken things from the sisters,0.373486549

and they surprise her with this beautiful dress,0.368342727
and shes so happy she can go to the ball,0.238510326
so she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and the her stepsisters to wait because she can go to the ball now because she has something to wear and shes finished all her chores,0.236943111
and the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks and her auti beautiful dress,0.322754741
and they see that the decorations are stuff that she,0.373348266
so they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back,0.401285768
and they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball,0.218716055
Cinderella goes running to the garden,0.304876238

and this fairy godmother appears and does this bippetyboppetyboo thing whips her up a real pretty white dress,0.274086356
and then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses,0.278299451
and she tells Cinderella go dance with the prince but she hasta be back by midnight or the spell will wear off,0.189061224

and she meets the prince,0.369686812
and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with,0.304604381
and she hears the clock strike midnight,0.324368477
and she hasta go,0.264638126
and the prince is like,0.367212564
but wait,0.634883106
but wait,0.634883106
I dont even know your name,0.3646442
and she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach which was starting to be a pumpkin,0.222728163
and as shes running down the stairs one of her shoes falls off,0.231671035
and she gets in the coach,0.273899466
and the coach takes her home,0.319586873
and she arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin,0.247997433
and the horses turn back into the mice,0.37207526
and dog footman turns back into a dog,0.258859098
and the next day shes walking around in the house,0.301137954
and she hears the the duke come to the door and says,0.292057306
the prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride but he doesnt know who she is,0.222278848
so hes going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that this Cinderella has left this maidens left behind,0.218166143
so he ends up going to Cinderellas house,0.271717727
and she hears the Duke coming to the door,0.291888356
and she goes to her room,0.336864978
and the stepmother locks her in her room puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the Duke into the house,0.2622042
the Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small,0.223495573
and as the mother is sitting there the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rescue Cinderella,0.221822754
and again they run into the cat,0.321829587
but they escape the cat again,0.388474137
they go underneath the door,0.370231241
and they hand the key to Cinderella,0.344401807
and she unlocks the door,0.321330041
and as shes leaving the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister,0.257890344
and one stepsisters too small,0.391859651
the other ones foot was too big,0.286636651
and as hes leaving Cinderella runs down the stairs and says,0.20977436
but wait,0.634883106
I I wanna try this shoe on,0.353775561
and the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderellas the one the prince was dancing with,0.308640093
so as the Duke is walking over with the glass slipper on a pillow to go give it to Cinderella the stepmother trips him,0.200466365
and he falls,0.390050083
and the glass slipper breaks into a million pieces,0.291510552
and Cinderella says,0.331690997
well thats okay,0.354997218
and she pulls the other glass slipper outof her pocket and says,0.22223708
I have the other one,0.435039282
so,0.99999994
lets see,0.576554179
lets see Fido the dog was chasing Fluffy the kitty,0.219213977
and chased Fluffy the kitty up a tree,0.238856286
and Fluffys owner a little girls riding her bike,0.292896301
and she sees Fluffy up a tree,0.230452135
and she calls to him,0.402018934
but he wont come down,0.295930624
so she runs to the house and gets her dad,0.258158088
dad gets a ladder,0.334533006
and crawls up the tree to get Fluffy,0.255428731
but the dog knocks the ladder outof the way,0.282588124
so,0.99999994
and they come out to save the dad and Fluffy,0.264542371
theres a bird singing,0.324942321
okay,0.99999994
a little girl was playing outside in the yard with her kitty and her puppy,0.24490346
and suddenly she realized her kitty had gone up into the tree and was lounging on the branch,0.257371187
the birds were singing,0.425964952
so it must have been in the springtime,0.337067306
and she was very upset,0.334549636
shed been riding her tricycle also,0.340129167
and she was very upset,0.334549636
she went and got her dad,0.335115194
her dad came out,0.378224909
climbed up in the tree,0.326680601
but he got scared,0.464178443
couldnt the kitty was on a branch he couldnt reach,0.206448019
and so he was sitting there and didnt know how to get back down,0.266377687
the dog was barking at the dad,0.268271685
and someone mommy probably realized what was going on,0.307265967
she called the fire department,0.381516337
and the fire department came with a ladder,0.348360002
actually it looks like a ladder laying there,0.417335033
so dad probably climbed up on the ladder,0.262325704
and then the ladder fell down,0.382182002
and he couldnt get up get back down,0.29986465
okay you get two pieces of bread,0.263165623
and you get your peanut butter and your jelly,0.365036994
and first you put the peanut butter on one slice of bread,0.264308244
and then you put the jelly on the other slice of bread,0.295372069
and then you place the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and jelly touching each other,0.339896679
and then you slice it in half,0.318801641
well it was in,0.365581661
and it was April first,0.320141792
and I has was working,0.340790212
and I had been ill for a couple of months,0.246284291
going to the doctors different doctors and doing tests,0.418080211
and I wasnt getting any better,0.28589049
and I went to the doctor that day,0.304899037
and he took one look at me,0.239249036
and said,0.513667703
youre going to the hospital,0.362732768
and so the hospital was right next door,0.301499486
and I went next door,0.280871272
and they admitted me,0.366902918
and I called work to tell them where I was,0.29087311
and that I wasnt gonna be in,0.193161041
but I was so kindof outof it I didnt even know where I was,0.336120009
and they couldnt figure it out for quite awhile,0.320913762
and I was in the hospital for a week with them doing intraveneous,0.268378228
which Ive been on antibotics,0.284428567
and they did all kinds of tests,0.360419989
they couldnt find out what was wrong,0.318580538
but I was slowly dying,0.399831921
and they knew that,0.475696325
and that I was filled with infection,0.327147424
and they couldnt locate it,0.348180294
and so finally a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory,0.288502157
and I agreed because I knew that I was not gonna make it,0.307742417
and so they went in,0.351138264
and what had happened I had ke peritonitis,0.27162537
and Id had diverticulitis,0.286717534
and one of them burst,0.350004196
and that would have been peritonitis with the infection bu,0.335626006
and they it had sealed it except for a,0.324923903
that,1
and so I was I guess what they call septic,0.316165894
and so they did the surgery,0.357328206
and it was a long long surgery,0.345965624
and I ended up with a lo colonoscopy no colostomy colostomy,0.234898776
it was the bag,0.339735806
and then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that,0.308098853
and then six months later I was able to go back in the hospital because they had removed a section of my colon,0.250994325
went back in the hospital,0.400168031
and they resectioned,0.66941309
and I was able to not have the bag anymore,0.286531895
so I can remember all of that,0.366446823
and and it was life threatening,0.418304324
but and I knew that,0.432575226
and and thats why Im not afraid to die now because it was very peaceful,0.267608762
it wasnt it wasnt like a scary thing so,0.311529607
yes,0.999999881
well its still on going,0.381988257
my mother as I said is eighty eight,0.205074877
she has a pretty profound hearing loss,0.324482083
and has for probably atleast ten years,0.332892209
but she refuses ta,0.343740165
so we have hadta deal with this,0.434099793
so when I take her,0.416689605
and Im the one thats responsible for taking her to all of her doctors appointments,0.2717987
and when shes in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth,0.318947583
and so I hafta yell at her all the time,0.211219802
and its so rude and awful to be yelling at her,0.238721609
and even when I explain to the doctors they still turn and talk ta,0.318860203
and thats frustrating for her,0.374113917
and once I leave Im feeling really tense and frustrated because Ive been yelling,0.299182475
and our bodies when,0.48686403
and my mother also is getting some dementia,0.357883036
and so the combination what Ive realized is more to just allow her to talk,0.288563997
and not really have a conversation with her anymore,0.384771883
and thats very sad,0.32542938
its I guess its not that unusual,0.367357522
and Ive already told my boys,0.259571105
and Ive had my hearing test here that I wont do that to them,0.28400746
youknow its really really bad,0.39185822
yes,0.999999881
and right from the beginning so that youknow you dont hafta make that huge youknow,0.233856708
and and I dont think that it works as well when its done later on youknow,0.234200999
so anyway,0.801772058
Im sure there has been,0.269233108
well yeah obviously Ive got with two boys,0.271701753
theyre adults now,0.427458286
but with them growing up there was youknow always something going on,0.314309567
because they were getting into stuff different things,0.442635685
probably one of the times that was really scary that first comes to mind is my oldest boy,0.267945319
when he was maybe,0.452757061
and they were doing swim lessons and in the neighbors yard,0.286696672
er with the pool was next door,0.229234233
and the neighbor and the and the instructor would come out to the pool,0.404239416
so he was very familiar with the pool,0.297892898
and there was two friends there that,0.415330738
and so we were over there just as a at a party,0.281109691
and so he had been practicing going off the board,0.293310374
it was just a little board,0.391828448
but hed been practicing doing that and he wanted to do that,0.337034971
but then he got scared just as he started to jump off,0.308020085
and he jumped toward the side,0.345479131
and so he hit his chin,0.267489791
and it just opened it up,0.368071377
and ofcourse he was hysterical,0.400743186
and I was getting pretty scared,0.348394126
but it you could see the bone,0.390957355
Imean it was really really scary,0.498257279
and so we had ta,0.293723941
and he wasnt knocked out,0.241392747
so we took him to the hospital into emergency,0.293931127
and then they ofcourse they hadta do stitches,0.438824177
and yeah it was kindof scary,0.308737457
but they survive those things most of the time,0.42209363
there was a family that was going home,0.362648487
and there was some water in the road where they were going to cross,0.345587522
and the father decided to go ahead,0.345524848
and that they could make it,0.501674235
but as they got about half way across the water was too deep,0.265959114
and started washing the car away,0.360937953
the windows were down luckily,0.334464043
and they were all getting crawling out the window,0.390066683
and some people they had called nineoneone,0.41727832
and there was a s first responder that came,0.322340518
had on a life vest,0.283275634
and grabbed a hold of a limb of a tree,0.289218128
and was reaching out to save the little girl that was in the churning water that had gone under but then had come back up,0.28380397
and he was able to rescue her,0.318190813
there was a young man that was learning to play soccer,0.296456814
and he was on the soccer team,0.310517877
and he was excited,0.344207197
and he was practicing with his kicks in the front yard,0.274280697
and he kicked it really good,0.361028016
only thing he kicked it too hard,0.396262258
and wasnt careful about where he was aiming,0.269457698
and it hit the window,0.322086632
and he had kicked it so hard that it broke the window,0.299296319
his dad was sitting inside when the soccer ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp,0.275982201
and he jumped up and grabbed the soccer ball,0.257065564
and looked out the window,0.385701954
and saw that it was his son that was practicing,0.321505845
and so he understood,0.431865811
he was had been a boy before,0.379588932
and knew that it was just a window and it could be repaired,0.32970199
the little boy was getting ready ta,0.26616779
he had his backpack on,0.337438852
and Mom told him,0.276577353
it looks like and I had read in the paper that its going to rain today,0.26214397
heres your umbrella,0.436436415
no mom,0.50063163
he told her,0.467611372
I dont need an umbrella today,0.267501026
it looks beautiful outside,0.479796797
and so he went,0.349233478
she wasnt happy about it,0.310695052
but he started walking and was on his way ta,0.251018137
and suddenly it started sprinkling,0.388218611
and he was getting wet,0.320798159
and he went running back through the puddles and through the rain back to the house,0.364540577
and he was all wet,0.291819572
mom looked at him and said,0.239737451
I told you so,0.502021849
and so he got the umbrella,0.274223447
and then he was walking to school with the umbrella even though he was already wet,0.305621266

alright well when I useta work with young children with disabilities,0.371941119
depending on their ability to speak,0.399097413
if they had cerebral palsy,0.407702357

most of them would sign,0.367147267
or they would use their,0.499393702
ohgosh whats that board,0.404449821
the communication,0.787775099
so we would just give them ways of making sure that they were able to communicate,0.383845806
with them with us,0.515494585
and then with my dad towards the very end of his life,0.289725691
he was having,0.55014056
and so he would kindof forget ke where he was and what was going on,0.25418216

sothat this way he didnt feel like youknow he was losing,0.260262251
okay my father was diagnosed terminally ill,0.2579844

but I was getting stiffer and stiffer,0.392472237
when we left the sun was shining and it was about eighty degrees,0.247463018
and just standing still in the sun felt really good but moving was getting incredibly hard,0.353875548
since my friend only lived a couple of blocks away I sat down and said,0.199085653
Im just gonna sit here,0.323332608

the refrigerated ke fruit drink things that are frozen,0.29012543
that was okay,0.377753347

it it was difficult trying to develop lists of things that she wanted done around the house,0.3143318
but we managed to work out a pretty good system of youknow,0.2590051
shed write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper which she always kept with her,0.236085951
and that seemed to help alot because youknow she could remember something short term but an hour from now forget it,0.26078108
but just by carrying that pad around with her all the time she was able to make lists of things so when I came home I knew what she wanted done,0.258477241

his name is Leo,0.31771794
and my roommate Suzette and the man I was dating at the time was named Lee,0.210338295
we took off on a hike,0.245486125
well equipped with backpacks full of snacks waters,0.323044658
it was an beautiful day,0.308500171
coo,1.000000119
and we planned to spend the whole day,0.333601177
alotof it our plans were based on Leo,0.166047543
he was more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy,0.330383539
so we went not knowing where we were going,0.398979813
we just trusted him,0.482788831
we got along,0.396516711
had a snack,0.371400625
and been gone about two and a half hours,0.282883406
and nex,0.447421968
ready to head back to our destination,0.417755127
and were lost,0.473964006
three of us have absolutely no clue no concept of where we are,0.264494687
were surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look,0.28215006
so there really was no direction,0.381677538
and we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend Leo,0.264080912
Leo doesnt panic,0.284906387
I started to feel alittle panicked because I had twisted my knee a little bit,0.320503891
so I had alittle compromised gait,0.384777397
and it was alittle tender,0.396275342
but I didnt wanna complain,0.402075946
and I knew theres nothing we could do about it,0.344816148
we just hadta get back home,0.496064752
so for the first time I really felt quite afraid that we might not make it,0.375447631
and what to do about my knee,0.284844398
we persevered,0.526983619
we trusted Leo,0.362098485
he he went off on a couple wrong paths,0.264941216
but he got us back on track,0.296602398
got us back to the car,0.327809095
my leg was fine,0.294907093
and it all ended very well,0.383045763
it was a great memory,0.370122999
we laughed about it,0.447526813
and I wont go hiking with Leo again,0.185754642
the end,0.63970381
it had been raining for days and days,0.328335762
and everyone knew the river was rising,0.325733274
residents in the area were warned to leave town,0.326955199
and to find shelter elsewhere elsewhere until the river river waters went down,0.340475947
one family the Jones would not leave,0.325445354
they were not afraid,0.516485095
theyd seen the river ride for many many many years,0.268087238
and never felt like they were threatened,0.412053794
well this day the river rose up,0.292235613
and came up to the bottom level of their house,0.321517259
they decide to move upstairs,0.440280944
and the water was still rising,0.42740801
the rain was still coming down,0.364763588
it was becoming r nighttime,0.293978184
they moved up to the top of their house where they were able to sit on the roof,0.283404469
and Mister and Missus Jones looked around,0.287607223
and they didnt see their daughter,0.282137156
their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddybear,0.289602697
and the water had already risen that high,0.380218148
so she had been swept away by the river,0.254909188
the parents suddenly realized,0.471668839
they heard a yelling and a screaming,0.385439813
they looked from the rooftop,0.336152464
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river,0.340941101
luckily with our technology the Jones had a cellphone,0.25086683
they dialed nineoneone and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid,0.344146639
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out,0.317364573
they threw out a line across the river,0.318099797
it was secure,0.413646698
he climbed out clinging to the rope,0.311428577
and saw the Jones daughter,0.315428823
he reached down,0.403803825
grabbed her,0.589152634
she grabbed ahold of his arm,0.236735374
he wrapped a device around her waist to secure her body to his,0.295108587
and climbed back across the rope back to the riverside,0.377472997
Jessica was safe,0.319971919
the family were delighted to see that she was okay,0.274225831
but they learned a lesson,0.429598927
next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home,0.332664192

ready to face the consequences of not listening to the good advice of his mother,0.321845025
the end,0.63970381
okay,0.99999994
there was a young woman and her father,0.376982301
and they lived in a town all alone,0.313230157
her mother had died,0.489858687
the father was lonely,0.392406285
and one day he met another woman,0.321809202
and decided to marry,0.437346935
make a new family,0.394569874
the woman had two daughters,0.377639353
and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created,0.277136505
well sadly the father died,0.334323525
leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and the two her two halfsisters,0.359681338
the stepmother was not happy about this,0.36679253
and she did not see Cinderella as her own,0.264041275
so she made her more of a house servant than a daughter,0.262173384
and she made her wait on her her two daughters,0.320333749
and clean house,0.531834066
and take care of them,0.380283356
Cinderella was not happy about this,0.335972071
but she felt like that was her destiny,0.386486948
so she cleaned and cooked and did everything that she was told to do,0.285451859
Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart,0.297490448
she made friends with the animals,0.355377078
they were her only friends,0.443352968
she was so busy,0.36189273
she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends,0.313461542
Cinderellas gentle heart would carry her a long way,0.283373386
she,0.999999881
lets see,0.576554179
lets back up a little bit,0.361763716
I aint,0.459613115
on the other side of of the town e was a castle,0.300286531
and throat the town was ruled by a king,0.293548256
the n this king had a son,0.280573547
and the son was of age to be married,0.252446681
they needed when he they needed a new heir to the throne,0.366610318
and if he wasnt married he could not become king,0.279343605
so the the th the king decided to throw a ball inviting all eligible young women,0.273511767
so he would have a large large number to pick from for his future bride,0.25558275
the invitations were delivered,0.50405854
and certainly the stepsisters were invited,0.397020519
infact every young eligible woman was invited,0.309276849
Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation,0.263737082
but the stepmother was not about to let her go,0.29473561
so she was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses,0.343123019
and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives,0.364497662
once in a lifetime opportunity,0.402580559
but she was unable to go,0.332057148
so off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball,0.323732674
and Cinderella stayed at home very sad very lonely,0.251578867
when suddenly some magical event appeared occurred,0.355535269
and the or her fairy godmother appeared,0.327972114
and said,0.513667703
do not cry,0.504222512
you can go to the ball,0.337524205
and Cinderella was very concerned about her dress,0.294986516
and the stepmother,0.605213761
and turned a pumpkin into a carriage,0.344009191
and the mice into horses,0.397985429
and Cinderella had was ready to go to the ball,0.249501079
but one warning she was given was,0.376142532
if you dont return before midnight everything all the magic wears off,0.277629793
your dress will become rags again,0.314572096
and your carriage will become a pumpkin again,0.308740348
and she said,0.380783647
dont worry stepmother s,0.312787503
I will,0.542298555
so she goes to the ball,0.293767571
has a wonderful time dancing with the prince,0.339968503
and he is entirely taken with her,0.317937702
noone knows who she is because shes never been dressed this way,0.272783369
the stepsisters didnt even recognize her,0.317662269
well its getting close to midnight,0.379794389
and Cinderella knows she must say goodbye,0.242467642
and the clock starts to strike,0.37396875
one two three four,0.800563931
all the way up until its almost twelve,0.329834282
and she flees,0.454867095
she tells the prince she hasta leave she hasta leave,0.306616962
she takes off,0.378591806
and as shes running away her clothes begin to change,0.254118323
yet one of her glash,0.360704213
she gets back to her house,0.383996308
and finds that she still has one of the glass slippers left,0.276035398
but she had a wonderful time,0.383916557
it was a wonderful memory,0.370115399
so magical she can hardly believe it happened,0.404462874
well the next day the king set out to n the king realized that his son said,0.26148507
I cannot I dont know who this young maiden is,0.278546453
Ill I dont know her from our town,0.211633936
Ive got to be able to find her,0.285851002
and so they sent out,0.363387674
I dont know what you would call them,0.433694005
sent out couriers to find out where this princess must live,0.303660333
she must live in the community,0.323282599
and the only way they know theyll know if shes the one is if the remaining glass slipper that was left on the stairwell would fit her,0.249885634
so the the princes men take the slipper and visit from house to house in the town,0.305661947
they come upon Cinderellas home,0.332602471
yet the stepmother in no way is going to allow Cinderella to try on the slipper,0.23720251
only she only wants her two stepdaughters,0.385367155
because she wants one of them to marry the prince,0.338500291
well both stepdaughters try on the the shoe,0.290873349
and ofcourse theyre trying to force it,0.386826724
but it does not fit them,0.483301312
Cinderella is able to escape from the locked room,0.260010839
and comes down,0.448667735
and they try on the the slipper,0.356577039
and ofcourse it fits,0.368467093
so the prince finds his princess,0.378471762
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
ohgee,0

and the Carlson family are at home enjoying themselves,0.288252264

subsequently after I moved down here I found out that he was able to have an operation,0.26155588
and get his hearing back,0.377816558
heard he went on to medical school,0.252958387
yeah,1
yes,0.999999881
yes,0.999999881
at the beginning,0.536548674
it was a regular night,0.365020066
we lived in a house that had an Arizona room,0.242261842
we got had the children in bed,0.253310353
and it was time for us to go to bed,0.274839044
through miscommunication I thought my husband locked the back door,0.300716639
from the Arizona room to the outdoors,0.356023908
he thought I had,0.501896203
wed gone to bed,0.282972097
and I woke up,0.265220493
I heard my husband whispering,0.418399155
I thought maybe he was talking in his sleep,0.30411765
but he grabbed my leg,0.355005562
and then I heard him say,0.344644308
yes hes in the house now,0.235483021
I heard that,0.526727915
and I got really scared,0.403971136
then he squeezed my leg even harder,0.357968181
this is while we lived in Tempe,0.242303908
right by the il ten over in the Peterson neighborhood,0.262747318
the Tempe police department were very prompt,0.32077831
not only did they have people in our,0.397888452
they had both sides,0.499132305
in a matter of minutes they also had a canine unit,0.270189762
and this man after having robbed us on a he was on a bicycle,0.249898329
the the canine took a bite outof crime,0.235125422
so they caught him,0.480188578
this was his third,0.408513606
and so we were good,0.368979007
it was youknow everything was most of the stuff was recovered,0.278734446
I hadta wait for some of it,0.298986405
but after that I think was when I was more scared because he went through our house,0.318021357
he looked in our childrens bedrooms,0.262257367
that was what if my kids would have woke up,0.277800351
youknow that was the scary part,0.289377689
what if theyd have woken up,0.287776828
what would he have done,0.426558614
but he wasnt a very smart,0.295228422
like I said on a bicycle,0.251748115
and then a couple of days later after talking to my neighbors he was going through the neighborhood,0.274995416
youknow,1
so from that day forward every every door in the house even after weve moved,0.273238242
and this has been a good nineteen years,0.318834752
yeah were still checking doors,0.354022533
there is a man and a woman,0.364304066
it looks as if the man is hanging on to a branch to rescue this young lady that is caught in the snow,0.227370158
possibly from an avalanche,0.439173877
the end,0.63970381
alright there is a little boy playing soccer,0.312659979
hes practicing,0.355849415
he practices his kicks,0.354202151
and the ball goes right into a window,0.334765911
breaks through the window,0.498680443
knocks over a lamp thats sitting on a table next to a man sitting in a chair,0.261368275
the man stands up holding the soccer ball and looks out the broken window,0.294836819
the end,0.63970381
a little boy is leaving the house with his backpack,0.298138142
and his mother is going to give him an umbrella,0.249880433
but he declines the umbrella,0.363158762
tells his mother,0.518534482
bye,1
starts to rain,0.421858162
doesnt have an umbrella,0.251163632
now its really raining,0.44437921
hes all wet,0.276388228
he comes home,0.40032208
and mother is looking very cross at her very wet son,0.251950741
and he gets the umbrella,0.309206367
and now hes drier,0.262731671
the end,0.63970381
story of Cinderella,0.429101616
Cinderella lived with her father and her dog,0.335431755
one day he brings home a new wife and her two daughters,0.262824804
now the father hasta go away and leave the stepmother in charge,0.264767647
her daughters the stepsisters are evil and mean,0.322440177
and the stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry,0.348749071
they get a notice because the prince hasta get married,0.276392937
and the king is just beside himself,0.375444323
he must find a wife,0.274487197
so theyre going to have a ball sothat he can pick out a wife,0.252361387
and Cinderella says,0.331690997
oh may I go too,0.335097551
well if you get all of your chores done,0.331437111
and then help your sisters get ready,0.392966986
then if you have any time you can go with us,0.389359027
so they give her all kinds of work to do,0.326013923
in meantime her little friends the mice help with getting her dress ready,0.307978421
now the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they dont want,0.310945451
theyre no good,0.394011855
so they take them and make her dress,0.381228715
she has this pretty little dress,0.394376099
and shes ready on time,0.284961671
the evil stepsisters take the the necklace and the ribbon and they just rip it right off of her dress,0.271449924
and off they go to the ball,0.325671732
Cinderella is very very sad,0.395940602
sitting outside crying to her mice friends and her dog,0.34394604
when her fairy godmother comes,0.390694052
and says,0.503794968
well you get to go to ball,0.364221871
and she puts her in this very pretty dress by magic,0.23529695
and turns the dog and the horse and the mice into a carriage and a footman and pretty horses,0.319728345
and takes her over to the ball,0.349979162
she looks very nice,0.453442574
she dances with PrinceCharming,0.464988112
they have a wonderful time,0.433684945
but she hasta be at back by midnight,0.233924344
so when the clock strikes twelve,0.347286493
she runs down the stairs but she loses a slipper,0.273781657
one of her glass slippers,0.288920105
she gets home just in time,0.341325045
but she hasta walk because the pumpkin the the carriage turned back into a pumpkin,0.272248834
the the horses turned back into mice,0.367956549
and the dog r the footman turned back into a dog,0.239955947
so then the I guess the the duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in this shoe,0.231504679
and asking all the maidens throughout the village,0.379246891
so they get to Cinderellas house,0.341988593
and the evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom sothat she cant try it on ju,0.196304679
and the oldest stepdaughter stepsister tries on the shoe and its too small,0.273903877
so they put it on the other stepsister and its too small,0.297895312
its like,0.499013186
this is the last house,0.391219258
we dont know what were gonna,0.32120055
in the meantime the mice get the key from the stepmother,0.354521126
and unlock the door,0.40138042
and Cinderella comes downstairs,0.334964961
and says,0.503794968
may I try,0.493173867
so she tries on the slipper,0.273003727
and ofcourse it fits,0.368467093
and she marries i PrinceCharming,0.317221552
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
the end,0.63970381
mom had planned a birthday party,0.287274569
it was gonna be the fourth birthday party for her her youngest boy,0.190529108
she had set out a the most beautiful cake,0.250185519
well the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake,0.215741307
so he got himself a big mouthful,0.310887843
and got his paws into it too,0.271704853
and ran and hid underneath the sofa sothat the mom couldnt get at him with the broom,0.204513699
the little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined,0.311764687
and his mom was trying to hit his dog,0.236691788
in the meantime the guest started showing up at the door carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on,0.265976638
you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking two pieces of bread,0.244070292
you on one side you spread the peanut butter,0.315483749
and on the other side you spread the jelly,0.347240388
and then you put the two together,0.390285641
ohmy in about nineteen eighty four eighty five,0.553388715
its been a long time,0.403473258
I had my four,0.355315328
I had as a precaution I was taking a really large dose of penicillin sothat I wouldnt get an infection,0.227294385
because when I was seven years old I had rheumatic fever,0.305618107
youknow and they always told me,0.311947018
well your immune system isnt gonna be near as strong so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery including oral surgery,0.22201775
so I did that,0.523409009
and a that evening I early evening my throat swelled up,0.295134187
dont know if it was from the penicillin or what but I ended up back at the dentists office,0.21517323
and they ended up having to take some epinephrine,0.340729266
they gave me shots of epinephrine,0.239402398
I think two of them,0.320387006
and they also took a syringe,0.335135847
shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called g,0.25733158
they called it then angioneurotic edema but its since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called hereditary angioedema,0.297675997
the difference between,0.609409213
hereditary angioedema cannot,0.464199632
it hasta be the only thing that until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that during an episode was the epinephrine,0.323572308
during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up,0.280490726
just outof the clear blue,0.325546771
I went to urgent care,0.324173748
in urgent care they started an iv on me,0.207617015
and the doctor,0.485611379
I dont know if she was a doctor or a pa,0.237014905
anyway she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline,0.217801005
and anybody thats,0.367871433
it goes intermuscular,0.417945713
because it takes within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty beats a minute,0.253168255
in my case I think I went over two hundred,0.251867414
and I remember my it felt like,0.367732286
youknow at the base of my skull,0.220201567
just from so much pressure,0.427834094
and Id,0.325627744
Ive been knocked out once youknow playing football but I never passed out,0.26553905
and I knew I was gonna pass out,0.250059575
and I told the doctor that,0.318741441
and she said,0.380783647
okay lay back,0.450529099
so I I looked at her and said,0.276560217
I cant I cant,0.521688521
I dont dare,0.523353219
so she put her hands behind me,0.367563993
and at that point I dont know what was going on externally but internally I was fishing with my grandfather,0.248270154
and he was it was at a favorite fishing place that I that I had when I was growing up,0.270444334
and he was walking up the the stream bank wanting ta,0.269437343
and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him,0.267877281
and I said,0.329179674
I wanna go,0.550441921
I wanna go,0.550441921
no its not your time to go fishing with me,0.281051755
go home,0.613855004
so I woke up and later was told that,0.229557365
I I can recall actually I dont I dont know if this is something you want on tape or not but,0.350272328
I I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was ke looking at myself and looking at the doctor and youknow watching what they were doing,0.247557655
and it was like,0.357922465
jeez what are you doing to me,0.326155573
and then it hit me that,0.36582005
oh yeah theyre doing it to me,0.322162747
my wife hasta fill in the details youknow of other stuff that happened,0.187722519
but apparently they brought in the crash cart,0.330444992
and I guess youknow zapped me atleast once,0.30470112
I did come back,0.458563149
overall I was out for seven minutes,0.266674787
not breathing for seven minutes,0.364997566
and to this day have had little if any effects youknow aftereffects from that,0.301801026
youknow they they say seven minutes your brain is dead,0.251467705
well I have no idea why but it didnt affect me,0.324529648
not Im sure sometimes it effects me youknow in some of my memory but that could be aging too so,0.2780523
that is very vivid to me,0.325470537
the probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee who was actually hired for me,0.247208312
he came in as I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe and needed an assistant,0.238395154
the assistant was brought in,0.424293965
and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kindof looked at each other and said,0.267104328
what did he just say,0.45423606
hes Filipino,0.320339113
hes he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog,0.19385992
I dont know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently,0.325033188
theres alotof people that wouldnt give him the chance,0.277585417
and youknow I actually was doing some interpreting for him ca youknow at one time or another because I understood what he was saying,0.264909297
and that was to me it was probably the most difficult one that I hadta deal with,0.340034902
not because I didnt understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him,0.399859101
but I also spent some time in Mexico,0.297864825
and theres people down there that speak no English,0.325552911
so Ive youknow hadta adapt,0.354628116
and Ive learned to speak a little bit of Spanish,0.235855997
enough to get by,0.327746928
things like,0.717295289
gustans,0
or,1
dondes,0
youknow the important stuff youknow,0.339263648
the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico,0.277838111
and we were at the time wed been discussing this,0.284496188
and we were just standing in line at the movie theater,0.286283225
and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico,0.281735629
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see,0.252629161
youknow to go to the the island of Cozumel and youknow travel around there a little bit,0.239243373
because theres some ruins there and its a really nice place,0.345709652
well the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there apparently was an ex marine or something,0.265823662
he was just perfectly built,0.340919077
and he had they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab theyd gotten near the port,0.252822578
I think they were doing one of the PrincessCruises or something,0.333717257
so theyd come into port and had been spent the day there,0.252934128
and then they hadta get back to the ship,0.411426425
so they hired a cab,0.297160923
well the cab starts going the other direction,0.372292995
and he kept telling him,0.377684563
no no no no youre going the wrong way,0.379850894
the ports over here,0.4876104
youknow,1
you needta go back this way,0.492924869
and he wouldnt stop,0.287925899
and he kept saying,0.358231276
not to worry,0.503814399
I know short cut,0.370514721
its okay,0.37727201
and he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop,0.308665574
and he and his wife just jumped outof the vehicle as it was moving,0.233414635
and people in the neighborhood that they were that they had jumped outof into started screaming about youknow at yelling for the federaless,0.264821798
so here we are,0.511618733
maybe a month away not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this,0.279927313
we get there to Cozumel,0.346369237
and soon as you get off the ferry theres all these cab drivers there,0.254376829
and wanting to youknow take you around the city or around the island,0.321439505
so this one n youknow kindof I dont know it was kindof like hey pick me,0.297738642
and and so we went over to him,0.334863663
and he says that oh yeah hed be glad to take us,0.204169661
and he says,0.357835323
Ill even give you a tour of the whole island,0.25038138
youknow,1
you can spend however long you want with me today,0.358183324
says youknow and he told us how much,0.247209162
and I cant even remember the amount,0.27814281
we get in the vehicle and,0.317732692
youknow we made the contract,0.270332336
we got in the vehicle,0.291063428
and right off the bat he takes off into the middle of town,0.282942116
dont worry,0.569102943
its okay,0.37727201
I just hafta stop and let the owner of the cab know where were going,0.20673874
so here I am with my wife and my sister inlaw,0.266718209
the three of us,0.403618395
and were sitting there,0.514281988
the sister inlaw is just in Lalaland like,0.260049611
hey this is just great,0.390991032
youknow this is fantastic,0.387302369
we paid this much money which was nothing for a cab for all day,0.260838211
and were gonna go see this youknow this island,0.228939623
and this guy goes in into its basically a bar,0.263015598
and my wife and I are going,0.276910126
ohmygod,0
this is it,0.577016592
were gonna were either gonna be abducted or were gonna be killed right here,0.241242513
well come to find out the guy was just going in to tell the cab the owner of the cab because apparently they owned it it was coownership,0.24266699
so he went in to tell the other guy that,0.261529654
hey dont worry about using the cab because Im using it for the day,0.193760335
and he was a very good tour guide,0.2656416
very good to us all day,0.381814152
but it was like I said it it was scary there for quite awhile,0.341650277
well it was the great flood of nineteen eighty,0.304400653
and people were doing such foolish things,0.389904171
but in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people,0.320029318
putting their lives on the line,0.425998688
we have a firefighter that jumped in the water to save a little girl who was about to drown,0.23921296
and he held onto her until other help could get there to help get her outofthe the water the swirling water,0.275659472
surely she would have died if he hadnt been there to help her out,0.273719788
well Danny was out playing soccer in the front yard,0.222455502
and hed been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well,0.237959594
so he gave it a boot one time,0.300133914
and he actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it,0.335585326
and it went over and hit the window of the the house nearby,0.325859606
and broke the window,0.401175976
and fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair,0.29088366
the father of the house,0.505660236
when they when he approached when it fell on his lap he was startled,0.341844976
and got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from,0.280057669
but ofcourse the little boy had run away,0.31807065
well it was a cloudy day,0.308106929
and mother had watched the or heard the news the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day,0.290577322
so when I was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella,0.259158462
and I said,0.329179674
oh mom its not gonna rain today,0.207877159
I have my backpack,0.44032684
if anything happens I can hold it over my head,0.331084907
and I wont get as wet,0.215530276
so Im not gonna take the umbrella,0.210462451
Ill be fine,0.337402701
I no sooner got down the road then wouldnt you know loandbehold it started to rain,0.271453738
the rain turned into a torrent,0.341903478
and I was actually getting very soak soaked from head to toe,0.232400358
my backpack was wet,0.30818975
my shoes were even wet,0.328173727
I got back to my to the house,0.331608176
and my mom looked at me and didnt say a word,0.180979282
but she knew,0.546461463
after changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack I headed out again on my way to school,0.269988686
this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain,0.30302459
the story of Cinderella,0.416193128
once upon a time in a land far far away,0.304349095
there was a young girl whose parents had died,0.314761639
she had an aunt but her aunt was a very bitter person,0.299530119
so she and the children her children her daughters were living in the house,0.358716875
but Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid,0.343490481
she hadta keep the house cleaned up no matter what,0.289478987
as she grew older she grew more and more beautiful,0.309229136
but even as beautiful as she was she was still just the housemaid,0.351660997
the other girls grew up,0.30355835
they werent near as beautiful as she was,0.24558875
in the meantime the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married,0.287175328
and to do that he wanted ta,0.313744336
he sent out invitations to all the the influential people within the land that they would could attend the ball,0.346762359
Cinderellas mother,0.614697814
and had decided to send her two daughters,0.303574979
Cinderella said,0.444069803
well can I also go,0.320367694
and they and her mother said,0.421275437
no you cant,0.421470165
youre to stay here and keep this place clean,0.354104698
so while she was doing that she was became a little bit disconcerted,0.327349275
and her all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball,0.273569167
because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her,0.26658988
and she asked what she really wanted,0.409029603
and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball,0.299860656
so her fairy godmother waved her wand,0.395253718
and gave her the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear,0.25655663
to take her off to the ball she hadta have a coach,0.269749939
so she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin,0.256325454
she turned the pumpkin into the coach,0.267021924
and the mice who were friends of and playmates of Cinderella were there to draw the coach,0.272664666
and the cat was there to to guide the coach,0.282670349
they get to the ball,0.38611275
and Cinderella meets the prince,0.360553622
she has a dance with the prince,0.348490417
and the prince doesnt wanna see anyone else,0.25182122
he is enjoying himself so much,0.355966926
but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight you will become the same Cinderella that you were before,0.283385158
no matter where you are you needta be you needta come home,0.392275661
so as this clock was striking d the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince,0.235395581
on her way out she lost her slipper one of her glass slippers,0.24978137
she got to her coach,0.329153359
and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin,0.325342864
and turned and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat,0.374248445
she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again,0.323036075
as it turned,0.405645967
the prince was so excited about this pretty young women that he wanted to meet her,0.300897896
he had kept the the glass slipper,0.304619968
and knew that he hadta see her again,0.350083321
so he sent out a decree to look for the young woman whose who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper,0.215609133
that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her,0.441816688
all of their all of the women the young women decided to go and try the slipper but none of them could make it fit,0.2883192
including her sisters,0.471092284
so eventually she was able to go and see the prince,0.289328486
and try on the slipper,0.326319873
and the prince announced that he this was the woman that he would marry,0.354127288
and they all lived happily ever after,0.364279985

and Ive and Ive cleaned the house and decorated the house and and got everything set up,0.28591001
and the people start to arrive,0.391967535

and loandbehold the dog is there underneath,0.363965273
and Im giving the dog what what for,0.251991212
and Steven Steven is my son is is telling me that theres guests have arrived,0.194411963
but Im so focused on the dog I could care less because he ruined my setup and ruined my cake,0.21252884
you wanna hear it,0.504514873
well theres,0.456019819
but the one Ill tell you is the is,0.285827577
I was at church,0.329462588
I help at at church giving out daily mass of Catholic,0.224270865
and I am Im a minister plus I I set up the altar and everything for the priest,0.189190894
and on AshWednesday about three years ago I set up and I was giving communion,0.212801293
and I held a pat,0.214795709
and my arm just dropped,0.323082656
and somebody was there to fortunately catch it,0.371949017
and it turns out that I found out I had AL ALS,0.246285498
I have ALS here to here,0.424038947
and Im not able to hold anything in my arm like this,0.247667864
I have a very difficult time,0.415882945
so thats thats what happened,0.43496123
okay,0.99999994
tu what the situation was hadta do with my wife my second wife,0.19729279
shes lovely absolutely lovely woman,0.40536961
and we got we ended up getting a divorce,0.270160377
however after my divorce I went to a a thing at a seminar at a place called LandmarkEducation,0.24182868
and I learned about,0.41831544
it was a weekend seminar started on Friday Friday morning and went through Sunday night,0.291944504
there was about a hundred and twenty five of us there,0.309564233
there was about fifteen men and a hundred some odd women,0.30261904
mostly maybe not exactly that but it was that kind of proportion,0.418951631
and I was I was Id felt very very kindof down after my divorce,0.259921938
and I had prayed and this was kindof a the Lord leading me to this session,0.266123146
so I listened,0.576269388
and I listened alot,0.325612962
and the conversation dealt with abandonment,0.492700785
and it turns out that in summary I think most women I think its fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do,0.256488949
and and I learned very significant things about the abandonment and how people feel and learned that you hafta forgive an abandonment,0.311272055
but I also learned that what you,0.478262454
this was reinforced,0.48263365
Id been I was told by a priest back in the seventies that when your wife speaks to you just listen,0.201560885
and when you what you remember is one or two things is whats important,0.312665462
dont solve every problem,0.381361157
well this reinforced that,0.573984027
and its very p,0.392721832
women have a,0.460286558
thats why if you go back to that story I mightve said this,0.312393934
women have a a need more,0.398077995
men do too but they dont they dont verbalize it,0.392762452
but women verbalize it alot more an,0.301504761
when things build up after a day they have a needta come home and dump,0.283687085
they do,0.708496571
and they need somebody to listen,0.444098979
they dont need any of the dialogue on it or not but they need somebody to listen,0.320174813
so I learned to to just sit and listen,0.359458596
and what I remembered from it is to then afterwards after partners finished what you remember one or two things you you talk about that,0.305737257
and then your partner is is pleased because then you that shows that youve listened to them,0.341047972
and thats makes more effective communication,0.440597385
hope you listened,0.55859679
okay when I was I believe around seven years old maybe it was five or six I m this this,0.225996166

and I and I fought the whole thing,0.345202029
and my tonsils came out,0.297219038

it looks like the river as was frequent at this time of the year has risen above its banks,0.244923934
and in one section this little girl got trapped,0.282350332
she was probably with her mommy or her daddy in the car or with a friend playing on the banks and fell in,0.215276003
and the river is with a xxx coming down,0.2723248
and she managed to hang onto a branch a little thicket,0.269215375
and while she hung onto that branch people had noticed her,0.287229061
and they called the fireman,0.432286799

the harness that will go on her with her safety jacket,0.285563529
tied a rope to it,0.312845737
and then they pulled both the fireman and the young girl to safety,0.357357293

and bam there it goes,0.286159128
it not only breaks the ball when he kicks it not only breaks the window,0.356908709
it also knocks over the lamp,0.303566366
and disturbs the father,0.495437384
or worse yet it could be the neighbor next door who wasnt a very nice person,0.232492462
but they pick up the ball,0.339038521
and he says,0.357835323
Im going out and straighten this mess out,0.314228803
young boy is on his way off to school,0.236470535
and hes now hes in second grade,0.223797321

but he took the umbrella from mom this time,0.258794069
put it on,0.390014291
and cheerfully went back to school in dry clothes,0.276667267
well the story starts with Cinderella being into with her father there,0.315084279
and I guess the mean old aunt came in,0.209273517
with the two horrible two beyond despicable daughters,0.347361892
they were terrible,0.554621398
they just looking at her as a downgrade,0.280267507
and eventually while the fathers away the aunts running the house,0.400296688
and Cinderella then becomes a servant,0.346005529
she hasta cater to them feed them clean the house wash their things,0.303031236
and shes treated just as a lowlife servant,0.293070376
she cant do nothing about it because Daddys gone,0.316058129
and theres nothing we can do about that,0.367374361
and then allofasudden the aunt gets an invitation to the great ball,0.282366306
or the king was saying to the before that time the king was saying to the son,0.35975334

and you should find your princess that were looking forward to all your life,0.367578
you get to be an old man,0.270868272
and he sent out invitations to all eligible ladies to attend the ball,0.270108342
so they sent out the invitations,0.337599307
and the aunt read the invitation,0.356616259
and heres Cinderella thinking that shes gonna become going to the ball,0.219007611
and she found this old dress and laid it out,0.260371029
and reading about the ball and everything else like that,0.381993592
and all of the friends that she got to know being in the house the mices and the meeses,0.35675475
they all got together,0.497712135
and they fixed the dress up adorable,0.326027572
and they,0.66941309
and the princess tried it on,0.33077997
and she looked beautiful,0.410751581
but then the aunt and the two ste cousins come in,0.263405293
and they were terrible,0.491064489
the stepdaughters they were going,0.404302567
blah blah blah blah blah,0.999999821
and they took the jewelery,0.352223366
and they took the dress,0.355546981
and they says,0.414451152
youre not going to the ball,0.350456893
and they got dressed up,0.335182488
she helped them get dressed,0.347492248
and they went to the ball,0.364615798
and then Cinderella is sitting there crying and upset,0.29976806
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother appears,0.416545182
and says,0.503794968
Cinderella youre gonna go to the ball,0.215607628
and she touches her magic wand,0.418445438
and then Cinderellas beautiful in her white dress flowing wonderful,0.319203258
and they even down to glass slippers,0.365006655
what an elegant touch,0.370574415
and as theyre walking out the door,0.306739718
and she says,0.378272772
but how can I get there,0.429958344
and she touches,0.43402952
and then allofasudden,0.707445979
she says,0.534550965
this will be your transportation,0.443259597
she says,0.534550965
but theres,0.488948286
and she says,0.378272772
you must be home by midnight,0.293303758
as if youre not home by midnight all this will vanish,0.27920261
she says,0.534550965
oh I will,0.396248221
and when she went to the ball and the prince saw her he was so taken with her that he spent the whole night dancing with her and having such a wonderful time,0.283205539
and unbeknownst to her but those two sisters or cousins or whatever they were stepsisters,0.31422466
they were so upset and depressed,0.401960999
and theyre squawking and everything else like that,0.395356119
and being that shes having a wonderful time,0.356937468
she forgot to notice the thing,0.344616383
and then allofasudden the clock strikes twelve,0.398512304
the first tick goes off,0.325457603
and she says,0.378272772
oh I must go,0.35680747
and the prince says,0.391356617
no stay stay,0.635895491
we the evenings young yet,0.349121481
were still going alot before us,0.324168354
and she says,0.378272772
no I must go,0.379742563
and she runs down this great staircase of red velvet carpet,0.222117558
it was wonderful,0.415820211
but she lost one of her slippers one of the glass slippers,0.256590039
and she ran home,0.313355714
and when she got home the only thing she had left was one slipper,0.297915995
but it will always be the memory that she was there,0.388121724
and she did this thing,0.380415112
and it was so great,0.363589019
but then the king yeah the young prince realized that this slipper belonged to the woman he wanted to marry and to be his princess forever,0.31308499
so he says,0.422071159
we will go scour the valley,0.312787175
and get everyone who was invited to the ball,0.275950074
and whosever foot fits this slipper becomes the queen,0.256670445
and he comes on,0.326020867
and he tries it onto the other big footed stepsister,0.256682038
and she was nowheres near it,0.317791075
shes so upset,0.356261194
and the mother says,0.425748408

shes she her foot was oo corns and aches all over the place,0.220540375
terrible feet that wouldnt,0.35283944
and then the prince says,0.392089128
and and whos this young lady here,0.309716105
and she says,0.378272772
oh dont worry about her,0.301803499
shes just our scullery maid,0.261773407
she dont know,0.43423146
and he says,0.357835323
oh I hafta try it on all women in the things,0.20131053
and theres the slipper on her,0.285304874
great,1.000000119
silk red pillow,0.580614507
and he takes the slipper off and then puts on,0.283456653
and magically it fits her feet,0.306279063
and the prince realizes that she is Cinderella,0.340060651
and then Cinderella stands up,0.316781163
and he sees her for what she is,0.279406101
really a wonderful person and not those scullery maid things,0.332705736
he sees back in that wonderful gown and remembers the dancing,0.264299572
and he proposes marriage,0.404682457
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
today is Timmys birthday,0.414330631
a very large party has been planned,0.347192168
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy,0.218970343
and good friends were invited over,0.344279647
well somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after of the cake after climbing up onto the table,0.216621682
mom sees this and is very very upset,0.283407152
very frustrated,0.69451344
and grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch,0.324946404
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy,0.197950363
to see this cake having much much less than its sposta have,0.342173219
first you,0.548122883
lightly toast them,0.512707472
bring the peanut butter and jelly to the table,0.344459772
apply jelly to one side,0.305389762
and peanut butter,0.508571923
and then bringing them together sothat the jelly and the peanut butter meet,0.350288481
put them together,0.529813349
and eat it,0.376779318
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the px,0.230463222
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck was kept up,0.302785009
and there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time,0.346513003
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible,0.272437781
but this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck,0.285750747
and as I left by kicking my left leg up and over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed of the truck,0.243106633
I was lightly tupped,0.411753625
because I had only been moved about a an inch and a half,0.249625906
if I had had this awareness it wouldve been much easier for me to push away from the truck and sustain less injury than I had,0.239125103
as that my left leg was kicked up and about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries Ive ever had,0.201066613
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest,0.191370249
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate,0.2485542
then falling down further the back of the bed,0.40399456
then the bumper,0.45726192
and in my attention anyhow almost eons later after I had thought that the last of the contusions were occurring the same spot on the under side of my left calf hit the the r the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle,0.246288881
the bed of the of the vehicle itself just,0.411098897
and coming down underneath,0.475507617
well this hit in the same spot one two three four,0.343590468
and I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries,0.25212124
at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle,0.236148417
and their discretion chose to take me to the hospital,0.36465466
and theyre my drill sergeants so I let them do that instead of saying its just a sprained ankle,0.244172007
and finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop,0.288510263
well I immediately went into shock,0.312144488
and being in basic training there is much suggestion to do as one is told,0.267082155
and a myriad manner of forms directly and indirectly,0.428299993
so my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and damage that I had just gone through,0.228366986
I actually hadta walk the next morning to the clinic on a very very swollen calf,0.249702856
so swollen infact that I was unable to take the bdus which are the battle dress uniform,0.275856316
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants from being able to be lifted up,0.250200242
my calf was so swollen,0.30633232
unfortunately that was the major holiday of that whole fort,0.376421571
combination of its anniversary and FourthofJuly,0.48989594
so the crew at the clinic on that Saturday,0.26722002
which then being a Saturday busses never ran so I hadta walk about two and a half miles on that condition,0.228172347
did a very cursory and less than effective look at my injury,0.250336856
and described me as rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches,0.285808086
the next and without and,0.515676022
the next day because it was a holiday and through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given kp duty,0.241836548
and the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing kp because everyone else had been working,0.28601563
and I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself,0.286544025
I was in shock continually this entire time,0.338913143
so I never volunteered for any of the kp duties,0.253894866
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and sprained almost knee,0.266546816
well regardless to say as I got back on Monday the staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physicians assistant,0.225888729
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms,0.256632656
and pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies,0.303435117

I I once owned two blacktailed prairie dogs,0.235308275
and we some friends of ours liked our prairie dogs so much that two,0.278817415
so we had,0.487709582
and then one of them was going outof the country and needed us to watch their m their prairie dogs,0.24391605
and so we did,0.405203998
and one of them was a male,0.334858209
and he was alittle aggressive,0.401648909
and he didnt like me very much,0.285872608
and so I was trying to,0.344608396
and so I was trying to pet him,0.300682783
and I was rubbing his chin,0.281439006
and he was getting all,0.383319259
and I really didnt read the warning sign very much,0.286143094
and he bit me,0.352128625
and took out a good chunk of my,0.24125737
so so Im actually home alone,0.391935378
and I,0.451039851
and I can see,0.336620569
its pretty good bite,0.366396487
and I realize well,0.42728588
I should probably not I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it,0.321617365
and I I dont always do well with the sight of my own blood,0.252610952
ke I have no,0.329350352
but I got,0.541783452
and then like,0.551984608
ohboy what do I do,0.637034655
so ironically or,0.52061379
so I hadta wrap,0.505150139
and interrupt her class,0.460484385
and to get her,0.398917973
and so I was standing there when she,0.356983721
youknow Im standing there,0.298857808
Im like,0.360845715
the prairie dog bit me,0.254328907
can you drive me to the urgent care,0.339989305
and shes like,0.321882874
okay,0.99999994
so she hasta,0.44219014
and then I get to urgent care for stitches,0.308425158
and prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona,0.262948662
I had bought it in Texas,0.247639477
and you can also buy them in Washington state,0.282677859
but theyre theyre considered restricted wildlife here,0.387798131
and so I hadta completely lie about the entire,0.34927398
because they ask you how you got the bite and was it an animal and whatever,0.293289721
and I hadta,0.451039851
they probably would have come and taken the prairie dogs away,0.311591655
so allofasudden it became a like I think I said a a ferret,0.301770926
because youre allowed to have ferrets here,0.38635987
a ferret bite,0.448361814
anyway thats my experience,0.360036939
my grandmother whos almost eighty is in a nursing home,0.221241444
and shes slowly been losing her mental,0.281438708
and Im actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama,0.166938066
and so every time I visit her Im never quite sure what mental state shell be in whether she recognizes me,0.24207814
she she usually she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year,0.314932853
and those people that she doesnt,0.359207541
so usually sometimes Im me her grandson,0.29314822
but other times Im other grandsons who see her more often,0.271065474
and so so you just hafta sortof its easier to just sorta,0.339710295
and get her youknow sortof force her to realize who you really are,0.300610006
so youre so you just sortof play along,0.405596882
and you basically just ask her how shes doing,0.328957796
and she kindof makes stuff up or doesnt make alotof sense,0.246558353
although Imean you can under you can she,0.366265416
and you can understand what shes saying,0.337630987
its just that the its not coherent sometimes,0.480910242
and so you just kindof hafta take it as it goes and stay for about ten fifteen minutes,0.232984588
and then then you leave,0.511938095
and its kindof sad,0.316982627
but I think she atleast is somewhat happy to have a visitor,0.331922948
so theres some solace in that,0.35164234
this is when my parents were still married,0.302345634
and we were I was a little,0.30987218
I was probably like seven,0.358644992

and the winds really picked up,0.349800885
and blew the tent started to blow the tent,0.301683873
off its,0.533051848
and actually started rolling all the way,0.457628012
so we were all in the tent,0.314626783
and it was ke rolling,0.274688214
and as it broke,0.318278611
and,1
and and my moms screaming,0.360471636
and my dads freaking out,0.334509343
and,1
I probably would have handled it different now as an adult,0.309961796
but as a kid its really traumatic when you dont know,0.275851458
and everythings,0.682526112
and and it stopped,0.445887625
it ke,0.488719821
and my dad was able,0.253475189
luckily we never got in the water,0.268512756
and he was able,0.357111484
but then but then everything,0.684320211
but we couldnt really leave that night,0.4117679
and there was some,0.462266624
so my dad sat up all night just to,0.298181266
and and it was just a really bad camping experience,0.34724465
and luckily I we kept going and I had better experiences so Im not afraid of camping anymore,0.261779666
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid,0.282189041
Im going to assume Ill Ill say this is this takes place in Arizona,0.191397876
and unfortunately Imean it was in monsoon season,0.276030183
and there was a huge storm,0.333868384
and caused what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent,0.27735877
and this poor woman decided that while she had gone that way home every day,0.32503587
and she really needed to get home to,0.392745167
and she was determined to get there across the wash that she crosses every day,0.281423926
but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash,0.285279185
and didnt make it but a few feet,0.245354459
and the water started surrounding her car and pushing it around and flooding her car,0.347820371
and she,0.562767684
she couldnt go reverse to get back,0.315161705
and started to tumble the car,0.312546968
and she managed to get her window down,0.307676077
and get on top of the car,0.27951923
and waved to some people that were on the bank to call nineoneone and,0.35224846
a rescue crew came out,0.330112338
and she was able to well she got right as they got there the water got higher,0.270275563
and she got swept off the top of her car,0.219985008
and it was floating downstream,0.396106124
and they were able to shimmy out on a a limb,0.263878882
and she was able to get close enough to him,0.333962321
and they were able to grab her and pull her to safety,0.317580044
and she was okay,0.30353868

but the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything,0.276698917
so the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home,0.315431327
in fourth grade I was outside during recess in NewYork,0.283918023
and as you may or may not know they have we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city,0.276757181
we dont have a playground,0.293312758
so they put up the barriers,0.351353288
and all the cars are there and everything and youre playing in the street,0.34459585
so I was standing against one of the cars,0.269596994
and a friend of mine ran right into me,0.236073583
and my wrist went right around the the rear view mirror and broke,0.287307888

and that was my first time having a cast,0.322433889
and got back to school and all my friends signed it,0.276291072
and so that was cool,0.344568074
and the part that I didnt like so much was when it itched inside,0.295476049
and so I remember one time my mom used ke one of the straws from the broom to try and itch,0.216266721
and it broke in there,0.340343773
so then that was even more annoying because I couldnt get to to it,0.384923905
and that was about all I remember about that,0.414125621
and I,0.451039851
oh and then I remember using it as a weapon too,0.27052173
if somebody bothered me Id hit them with it,0.308851212
but then I would feel it too,0.488121122

and then youknow after they say it a few times then we do understand,0.301638037
and just to switch really quick,0.45678854
actually when weve called to get help with ke computer service or something thats when it becomes a really it becomes difficult because were trying to first understand what theyre saying and then do what theyre saying and trying to figure out if they understand what were asking what for we need,0.306743234

youre not gonna believe me,0.343381852
but anyway two weeks ago I was Saturday night two weeks ago on a Saturday evening about six pm I started feeling a stomach ache I thought or like a side stitch,0.196085095
throat ironically enough the pain started to travel down my back,0.32174167
I could feel it moving,0.449648082
it wasnt a muscle I could,0.30556047
Im Im much a sportsman enough to know that it wasnt a muscle,0.241105586
it wasnt a bone,0.294560969
something was really weird and it was moving,0.365364105
they were kidney stones eventually I found out,0.342741758
but I remember thinking,0.590063334
I dont have yet insurance here,0.370695382
and Ive just moved back,0.315813422
and I havent been to a hospital here in twenty years,0.238687009
this is going to be really horrible,0.407988966
and and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where throat I had a fever of a hundred and one or something and just was doubled over and couldnt even and couldnt even really stand as this thing was making its way down,0.262082428
so we went to the hospital,0.321458012
and the first thing I walked in and I said,0.259242296
Im sorry bring you a bad news,0.240597814
and the woman said,0.365948975
why,0.99999994
did my husband die,0.381715059
thats the receptionist,0.474371076
I said,0.525946558
thats a good joke,0.341367036
but anyway I dont have insurance,0.404994816
and she said,0.380783647
thats no problem,0.436561376
thats youre gonna get a come on in,0.204455748
and I remember thinking,0.460623622

three hours later after some medicine and vomiting atleast forty times because of the intense pain the most intense pain Ive ever had in my life,0.27603665
just imagine ke stones going through that little opening,0.360066444
sorry,0.99999994
and whew,0.456057131
suddenly and I was having to use a little strainer thing and seeing them come out,0.322739899
and oh,0.42659685
and then for about a day the blood and everything else,0.328290105
but I was amazed the body and how,0.305513531
and once and once they told me what it was I read a little bit about and realized its not such a simple thing and how often we dont realize it,0.278310239
so water,0.594342351
people drink colas and,0.302426904
coffees colas bubble gas drinks are the worst,0.206107765
and then red meat is another bad one because they dont end up being digested,0.252109736
so I learned,0.554163039
and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasnt even vomit I thought,0.291631043
my my throats going to come out because of the convulsions were so strong,0.276749134
and I just remember thinking,0.491875291
my wife and son are coming next week,0.21372366

at the local government some friends of a friend of a friend of a friend found me and said,0.275911838
we are not able to communicate with them,0.422735423
can you please explain to me what the difference is to an American of Im sorry,0.215411082
what does excuse me mean,0.47692132
I am talking about having a meeting with the secretary of the Japanese selfdefense,0.283233911
so kindof a secretary of defense who I would never normally meet,0.28505218
and the mayor two congress people or parliament members,0.340060204
sorry,0.99999994
and about forty very very very pissed off Japanese parents who had lost children wanting demanding to understand what the English concept or the western concept was Im sorry,0.234239161
I hadta prepare a presentation for this,0.369338125
and then I thought,0.476410031
how am I going to explain what is Im sorry,0.292608202
its like movies and songs we use this so often,0.301772207
yet it it has very very traditional deep meanings and depending on the level of the insult sh perceived or injury perceived or not there are different ways to apologize in Japanese and all cultures,0.271798879
as we we have levels of formality,0.333666772
anyway my next job was then I was to go to the US Navy representative through the US Embassy to ask could they apologize,0.219142735
Im not a diplomat and I dont pretend to be,0.23303625
but I was also in the US Navy,0.270853996
so one thing led to another and I met with the people,0.289724767
I was flown over to Hawaii with several of these Japanese to act as an intermediary watching these two groups try to communicate over a week period over something that was just the most absolutely dreadful topic for them,0.242886066
dead school children,0.482252926
clearly a mistake by one an accident,0.327047974
and how do you get beyond it,0.36977458
all they wouldve been happy with if that captain of the US Navy had l if the US Navy had allowed the captain to do what he wanted,0.227205902
he wanted to apologize but he was not allowed,0.373908281
he was prohibited,0.450770587
US government policy,0.640957952
thats fine,0.434128344
but because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing the communication never developed,0.372135907
two years after the man was fired,0.323746771
the captain,0.593402624
he came back to that area by himself his wife and his children and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the US government even more angry,0.261674434
so I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends the Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends but what was caught in the middle were some families and a truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble,0.26568225
stupid,0.999999821
when my wife was seven months pregnant we got news from her family that her mother inlaw was dying of intestinal cancer,0.230474234
we were living away from them at the time,0.307155222
we were living in Japan,0.334405988
excuse me,0.691590726
we were living in Germany but they were back home in Japan,0.330717385
the my wifes pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy,0.232758358
and it was her first child,0.353494883
so I hadta go back to represent her in the Japanese mind anyway for my wife and I to see the mother inlaw,0.224731207
in a period of three months I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about,0.196264505
the biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die,0.242554814
I talked to the doctor,0.31810227
but the father didnt know,0.332613021
they kept that information from the father,0.388740391
they didnt wanna tell him,0.394298226
Ive never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying,0.262546152
the mother didnt know she was dying,0.29625845
so I was afraid that my wife couldnt get home,0.285356075
the sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary,0.225867063
and I will never be able to answer that question of what if,0.345427036
so that to me is a scared situation that I clearly remember,0.369072199
okay,0.99999994
after a series of unusually late spring excuse me late winter early spring storms and a very quick warm warming period the rivers and and the local area overflowed,0.291426867
there were flash floods and several people were trapped or swept away,0.295242995
in this case the a young woman was trapped in the river and holding on to a tree for probably a very long time,0.284841537
she looks tired and very nervous and distressed,0.366486073
and it looks as though that the rescue services or fire technician or whomever seemed to have arrived,0.269697547
its obviously very industrial,0.492927849
and there is two of them,0.348840564
and also the color of the vest,0.430256158
and that this man risked his life in order to save this womans life,0.336084008
okay,0.99999994
the boy is is on his has put on his backpack and is on his way out the door to school as usual,0.215778634
and his his mother is suggesting very strongly,0.411372125
please take the umbrella today,0.368003726
that I watched the news and I saw that there will be rain showers later,0.27494359
and the boys saying,0.388086051
no thankyou,0.532375515
its not going to rain,0.364387661
he then goes out the door and turns to say goodbye to his mother but shes reminding him one more time,0.25609079
are you sure,0.521938324
and hes,0.328487277
no,0.99999994
see you later,0.38965556
goodbye,0.999999881
well sure enough mother knows best,0.404676706
just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour,0.287838101
and the boy was running back home to get his umbrella,0.26417464
when he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him,0.2791695
I told you,0.531163752
and he then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school,0.271901518
nothing that any other boy probably hadnt done in their life,0.288313538
the young boys in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window,0.246511593
well in the tradition of good old story books once upon a time there was a huh what landowner well well endowed family who adopted a little girl,0.243396237
the little girl came into a family in which the mother and the two sisters the two daughters pardon me did not really appreciate having her around,0.274722546
and as she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse,0.220929831
but she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself,0.258346379
throat one day after,0.421431422
excuse me,0.691590726
the in the in the castle there was a prince and a king,0.409881592
and the king was adamant that his son get married and had been insisting and insisting,0.358356923
and in order to help the son decide who might be a f an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a dance,0.237039462
invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom,0.348623276
one day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that I mentioned,0.275046051
and the mother and the evil sisters were all happy to realize and think,0.362370849
heres our chance,0.45958662
one of us we can get married to this handsome prince,0.269096375
and so they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would go to the party,0.289760232
and meanwhile Cinderella had been listening and thinking,0.381557822
oh thats too bad,0.326932818
she was very sad about herself,0.359931767
but and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book,0.235813603
and throat one thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help Cinderella realize her dreams,0.250576854
she tried to create a dress and give hope to Cinderella that she too could have a better life,0.286527902
unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what Cinderella had been hoping,0.246898174
and they ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others,0.311071903
so Cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made Cinderella to be a very very attractive woman,0.214045316
on the eve of the on the night of the dance Cinderella attended the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person,0.266899526
noone could recognize that it was Cinderella because indeed she had changed so much,0.325424433
however the fairy godmother had reminded Cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because thats when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be revert to their original shape or character,0.25030601
so at the stroke of midnight Cillarella,0.282747477
he then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman mystery woman,0.272676766
he carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom,0.243112057
when he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where Cinderella lived he ofcourse wanted to have everyone try it on,0.274709225
and ofcourse the mother tried but it didnt fit,0.28837043
and the sisters tried and the shoe didnt fit,0.257838309
and Cinderella tried and it fit,0.298699349
and from then on love took over,0.330693483
and they lived happily ever after,0.364328027
yesterday I was watching the news when I saw this crazy story,0.301830262
turned out that this man was going to help his cat that was stuck up in the tree,0.243327573
so he took the ladder out,0.283729196
and the daughter was very happy that they were gonna be able to save the cat,0.231041357
but once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down,0.273365915
and the girl started panicking,0.39136079
so she ran and called her mother,0.307435483
and the mother called the fire department,0.456831276
and the fire department came to help him down,0.331044316
well its birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old,0.199811012
and maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite outof cake which he obviously knew he wasnt sposta do because hes hiding under the couch,0.184653923
and the boys crying,0.408907831
and the mother is waving the broom threateningly,0.379087001
and the guests are looking alittle startled,0.380954266
and thats the end of that,0.407036543
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich,0.431023687
get hafta get two pieces of bread,0.228526682
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top,0.254530907
and put them together,0.485986173
well this is fairly minor but many years ago I was when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was cleaning a glass,0.211796284
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand,0.268251866
and it it started to bleed all over the place,0.331671029
but I was also pregnant at the time,0.301517516
and I dont know if that had something to do with it,0.327262878
but I had this weirdest feeling,0.432283372
and my husband came in and I just passed out,0.269350886
it was the first and last and only time Ive ever done that,0.316665679
I guess the most the time the most of the instances Ive had with people that have trouble communicating its usually more of a language barrier,0.313929051
I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man who had a stutter,0.254938185
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too,0.316065758
but youknow I found it so hard to to talk to him that I tended to avoid him in a way,0.304783523
so I cant say that I really otherthan saying hi Julio how are you I never really went much beyond that,0.303207397
and plus at the time I couldnt excuse me I couldnt hear well,0.221027255
so I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway,0.376162648
so,0.99999994
thats about it,0.447779983
one time I was just moseying down the street in a car and was preparing to turn left,0.273843646
and I thought I had my signal on,0.302320629
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough,0.253152251
but then somebody else who I dont even know where he came from I think he was walking outof the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done,0.249765068
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something,0.243897185
thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didnt youknow wasnt upset,0.223687381
he just said,0.450800538
oh I ran into you,0.270658761
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness,0.341567755
oh apparently this girl has fallen into some water thats maybe theres a flood or a storm,0.243362293
and a man is trying to rescue her,0.285624087
apparently shes been holding onto a tree branch,0.27215901
and hes trying to get a hold of her,0.236389205
but she wont let go of the tree branch probably,0.214282081
about all I can say,0.386677384
well hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window,0.216955781
its really improbable,0.540202916
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp,0.255509079
but obviously the boy has ran away because the man cant see him when he goes in at the window,0.214080393
this is kindof improbable too,0.478382885
the mother wants to give the the boy an an umbrella,0.285347551
he doesnt want it,0.389122099
so he goes off and gets wet,0.274624377
this is the improbable part,0.503736436
he doesnt like getting wet,0.295311332
he runs back to his mom whos mad,0.198069513
and hes wet so he takes the umbrella,0.214629531
now my son would love getting wet,0.288308442
looking at that I can hear the music from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old,0.203171626
Cinderella is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother,0.300775975
wicked and stepmother always go together,0.371495247
she has two ugly st two ugly stepsisters,0.225047544
I cant remember their names,0.29206869
one of them is Drizella or something equally ugly,0.249125779
anyway Cinderella is forced forced to work like a drudge for the the rest of the family who are cruel to her,0.239085391
but an edict comes from the,0.318928838
I think Im spinning tales here,0.332203031
an edict comes from the prince that theyre going to have a ball,0.265441805
and every maiden is eligible to go to the ball,0.247564062
but Cinderellas mother stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready,0.26132679
and at last the girls drive away in their carriage and Cinderellas left behind crying in the cinders,0.285849452
then the little mice come to her aid and start,0.32861951
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working,0.261518776
and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because yeah they didnt want her to go,0.251418591
so then the fairy godmother enters the picture,0.362654746
this is not in sequence at all,0.307027638
and ofcourse she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the the pumpkin carriage,0.29620257
oh yeah,0.846038759
and she goes off to the ball where ofcourse she is the bell of the ball meets the prince,0.261358082
the prince falls in love with her on sight,0.301552206
but at twelve oclock she hasta run off,0.215939373
she leaves her slipper,0.463344663
I guess that story goes all the way to the end,0.318727463
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper,0.295299321
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they dont fit,0.260881215
so he find m,0.298348784
heres one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree,0.245473802
and then this the the father has climbed up to rescue the cat,0.300117791
and now he needs to be rescued,0.290361941
for some reason the ladder is on the ground,0.353580654
and nobody has put it up there,0.291824102
so here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad,0.274749994
thats all,0.482988566
yeah well get your slice of bread whether wheat or white,0.262496769
what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first,0.254468083
get a knife,0.395962566
take it outof open up the jar,0.24774155
put the knife into the peanut butter,0.314116836
take out a take out a scoops,0.366053283
spread it over the bread,0.415832967
and then I open up a,0.331741005
and I usually use a spoon for that,0.322211802
put that on the other slice of bread,0.323422223
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter,0.278212845
spread it over the bread,0.415832967
and put the two slices together,0.384010226
a little girl was riding through the neighborhood on her bike,0.288243502
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree,0.239515319
her father came along,0.430181861
and said,0.513667703
what is it dear,0.406164169
she says,0.534550965
Dad my cats in the tree,0.232634991
well I can get the cat out,0.275550514
let me go get my ladder,0.399449408
father went and got the ladder,0.308160454
climbed up the tree,0.369034916
and then a neighborhood dog came by,0.276946634
and noticed a man up in a tree,0.281917363
and started barking at the man up the tree,0.30168134
and accidentally knocked down the ladder,0.389904886
so the man was stuck in the ladder along with the cat,0.251127005
and the fire department hadta be called to rescue them both,0.341953844
it was about I guess about seven years ago I really hurt my back,0.287553698
theres this family that I go and visit that has a little child,0.296322286
and from the time that child was born as a little boy I always picked him up and swung him around,0.230637848
but as this boy was getting older as I was getting older I I guess I cant do some of the things that that I normally do,0.280524015
this particular time I picked the boy up,0.296500504
and I was swinging him around,0.317965269
swinging picking him up by the arms,0.314948291
and I spread my legs wide open,0.266783655
and I was swinging him backwards and forwards,0.353339255
and I felt something snap in my back,0.271251559
I was in excruciating pain,0.312379658
I almost dropped the kid,0.300621748
I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids,0.234607682
but this was pain like I have never felt before,0.387270391
because even just to walk or or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms its all tied into the back,0.271580309
it would be like a knife was twisting so,0.316551983
thats thats the injury,0.386976868
and it put me outof commission for a couple of weeks,0.19429253
and the thing that comes to the to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating with someone else,0.31701088
its the family that I described earlier with a child,0.311778218
theyre Hispanic,0.425181657
and their English is not very good,0.345802903
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school,0.315256029
but whenever oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want,0.299699992
I help them with their homework,0.416640133
my wife she speaks Spanish,0.31378445
so its alright when she goes over there,0.32908082
but when it comes to me trying to convey my thoughts,0.369772047
and trying to convey my wants and desires,0.397436798
and also me trying to listen to theirs,0.398416787
I dont always understand what theyre talking about,0.385467798
or and then and they dont understand what Im talking about,0.284781665
yeah in high school a friend of mine myself and a friend of mine we ditched class sothat we could climb CamelbackMountain,0.210325971
neither one of us had ever climbed CamelbackMountain,0.309858561
so we didnt realize exactly youknow where to go or where to start,0.305803597
we just picked a spot on the northern side of the mountain,0.305035621
youknow walked in between some of those very expensive homes,0.257984042
and started climbing,0.498818398
little did we know we really had gotten ourselves in in alotof trouble doing that,0.320281506
there were times where we were actually hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs youknow just to just to get from one point to another,0.283243388
about halfway up were sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot,0.261703312
and I said to him I says,0.316324919
man theres no way we can go back the same way we came,0.279341549
and he says,0.357835323
I know,0.711234093
and I said,0.329179674
Im serious,0.336475819
he goes,0.508027434
so am I,0.579804659
and so we knew the only way the only thing we we figured what we hadta do is make it to the top,0.323799282
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side,0.324409962
but then we would still hafta hike all the way back around the mountain to get to our car,0.296023935
to make a long story short,0.350918889
youknow we were all scuffed scuffed up,0.287413746
we were tired scratched up lor clothes torn,0.247573227
but we could finally see we were kindof getting to the top,0.341800809
as we were approaching the top we saw more people up there,0.273481488
and older people younger people,0.519746006
we couldnt believe it that youknow these people all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time,0.30018121
so when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we we asked them,0.385448217
howd you get up here,0.3626616
they said,0.538892329

and I understand how people can get stuck,0.340716779
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges,0.191151738

and off to the ball they went,0.335680425
when Cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty,0.267676681
they couldnt believe how incredible she looked,0.37477687
ah but she tried to remember as much fun as Cinderella was having she tried to remember one thing that her fairy godmother had told her,0.253686309

and that the horses were gonna turn back into mice,0.255766392
and that the chauffeur chauffeur was gonna turn back into the dog,0.22132811
so Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then,0.292116761
she was having so much fun she lost track the time,0.28173998
and when she looked up at the clock she noticed that it was almost twelve oclock,0.26608026
and while she was dancing with the prince she quickly broke away from him and says,0.288733512
I gotta go I gotta go,0.437258661
and she and the prince says,0.376416951

Cinderella continued to run,0.331242859
I got to go,0.398247123
I must go,0.441550642
and as Cinderella was running out she left a shoe behind,0.239253208

I must find this woman,0.38599214
whosever foot can whosever womans foot can fit into this shoe thats the person that Im going to marry,0.220050722
so so the prince went from house to house looking for females to fit that shoe,0.276685357
how one house after another,0.42032069
none of the females foot would fit into the glass slipper,0.253771216
and so finally he came to Cinderellas house,0.303236604
as the prince arrived the mother and the evil stepsisters they locked Cinderella into the closet,0.313248932
where she couldnt get out,0.323955148

and the two daughters tried on the shoes with all of their might the shoe with all their might,0.331474841
and they could not put their feet into it,0.332619637
however her friends the little mice noticed that that the prince was there,0.381418616
and so they found a key to the room,0.321014464
and they gave it to Cinderella sothat she could open the door,0.268657386
and the prince could see that there was another woman in the house,0.352351725

and but that was just because they hadta massage the muscles,0.418496549

and since Cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters the mother didnt want her to go,0.205375478
because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince,0.324875802
so she locked Cinderella in the tower,0.263420761
and they went to the ball,0.364615798
and so,0.590056539
oh ohwell this was before the animals made Cinderella a dress,0.243679091
and it was real pretty,0.354706198
and thats what infuriated the stepmother,0.40170747
and she tore up the dress,0.270054698
and then locked her in the room,0.372250915
and then Cinderella was crying,0.342326999
and then she then the fairy godmother came,0.389659047
and let her outof the room,0.260700017
and with the magical wave of her wand made her a beautiful gown and glass slippers,0.262465775
and fixed her hair all up nice,0.290140748
and turned a pumpkin into a coach,0.277308583
turned mice into white horses,0.339599252
and the dog into a coachman,0.296751231
and and so she was able to go to the ball,0.296153992
and she met the prince danced with him,0.317313313
and the fairy godmother told her that she hadta leave by midnight or she everything would return as it was,0.263096005
and so,0.590056539
and the clock started to strike midnight,0.363781244
and she said,0.380783647
I hafta go,0.344321698
and he didnt want her to leave,0.291068852
but she started to run away,0.343137085
and she lost one of the glass slippers,0.261511385
clicks and she ran and ran and got back in the coach,0.230215922
and they started going down the road,0.381181747
and then every ding when the clock struck twelve turned back to the way it was,0.324585348
and she was very sad but she had a good time,0.312583357
and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers,0.312856257
and so clicks she went home,0.275425941
and then the next day,0.425112844
and the prince really liked her so,0.363104492
and he had this glass slipper so,0.290972859
so he sent out a decree to find this woman with the glass slipper,0.224514708
and so they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyones foot,0.291869819
and it wouldnt fit anybody,0.324609309
and he finally came to Cinderellas house,0.32350862
and they tried the slippers on the stepsisters and and it wouldnt fit,0.283584625
and then n they were gonna try it on Cinderella,0.203826621
and the stepmother tripped the the the little guy with the slipper,0.395451933
and and he tripped and fell and broke the slipper,0.361739576
and so the stepmother was like,0.355180383
oh well the slippers broken,0.263396621
and you cant try it on Cinderella,0.233885273
and then Cinderella said,0.305623233
but I have the other slipper,0.378113151
and so right then and there the prince knew that she was the one,0.373390943
and they were happy and got married and lived happily ever after,0.303586155
a little girl has taken her not neccesarily taken but a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree,0.255821139
and the apparently a man has brought has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder,0.313275874
and hes attempted to get the cat down,0.229691863
and he himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down,0.243488744
a dog may well have accompanied him,0.293497235
there was a dog there,0.386668444
and the fire department has also arrived with their ladder,0.342961758
and they are approaching the scene,0.436809659
and they are certainly going to get the cat down and well along with the man more than likely,0.307213992
and everything will be just fine,0.404113501
the first step is to assemble the items you need,0.331284493
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread,0.311684966
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread,0.287225693
and you would how I would go about doing it I was I would put spread jelly on on one slice of bread,0.247045338
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread,0.278925627
and I would put the two of them together,0.328257143
and then eat the sandwich,0.35975638
my recollection I havent ever been seriously injured but one of the the typical but more unusual things Ive encountered would be chicken pox,0.264413834
not that thats unusual but for me a seriousness,0.38237685
and I dont recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that,0.224456981
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience,0.308694869
not excruciating pain but but quite a bit of c discomforts,0.359341651
ERROR,1
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didnt obey mothers advice fully of not picking at the scabs,0.221464872
so thats my recollection of chicken pox,0.266772032
the person who Ive had the most difficulty communicating with was my father,0.285585195
and I in part due to he suffered from a some type of ataxia,0.248415932
and and he was well I was I was born when he was in his forties so Imean he was by the time I was he was quite elderly by the time not quite elderly but up there in years by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so,0.24166204
but he in part I he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of his failing his failing ability to walk adequately and,0.292639256
but he was very very little bit short tempered Id say,0.30605644
and just wanting he badly wanted to do things himself,0.379832536
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind of thing,0.387890399
but he couldnt do it,0.415182412
so hed ask for help,0.256313264
and then youd try to help,0.380033642
and he would put his hands in the in the project,0.335236251
and it was just more trouble,0.378259599
and when you tried to say youknow,0.305388212
I hafta do this myself,0.378272057
he would get frustrated,0.391022623
and it was just very difficult time trying to communicate that we both cant do this,0.327637672
so and just just an overall difficulty,0.408262998
occasionally it would brew into an argument,0.338474303
and there would be some walking away because its either you do this or I do this,0.354117543
and we both cant do this,0.303147167
and youknow I know youd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but,0.315472394
its you you just try to remain calm,0.37319091
and and just explain the situation as best you can,0.359583676
and and try to resolve it,0.421874881
and ofcourse there were good days and bad days,0.330109388
youknow days where hed be more tolerant of of that kind of thing,0.237133384
but but just it was more of a communication issue that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do,0.326543957
so eventhough he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied assistance because it was more,0.351254165
I wanna be able to do this,0.368181765
so,0.99999994
the not too long ago maybe a couple of years ago,0.233915225
my girlfriend and I had taken a trip to Flagstaff to go into the lava tubes,0.189341173
there was something there called the lava tubes,0.34376055
its a its its near Flagstaff,0.4389413
and its its just an underground well it was produced by volcanic activity,0.300013244
and its a very large crevice in the ground,0.417001843
kindof a a tunnel,0.50619781
and we had gone in it then,0.311871082
I believe it was a Sunday afternoon,0.298056066
and it was rather late in the day,0.331394464
and by the time the,0.522054493
and in the center of this this thing,0.427733928
its basically a straight tunnel,0.4412193
ERROR,1
its not really a pole but its its,0.388831675
the the tunnel splits off in the center and goes around another chunk of rock,0.311145306
so you have it it splits into a wide fork,0.309641004
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel,0.370961368
well we didnt look at the map adequately,0.239261866
and we got in there,0.336493224
and and the the flashlight started to dim,0.414026707
and we were r we had gone all the way to the end,0.27775988
and we turned around,0.398651034
and we were unaware of this thing in the middle,0.318667978
and happened to be turning around it in circles,0.332310289
and the flashlights were going dim,0.32974261
and by that time the other people who had visited had left,0.350446165
so we were in there alone,0.367397726
and at that point going in circles in the dark or the dim lights,0.291357785
youre kindof like youknow how do you get outof this place,0.3344284
and it became quite quite fearful,0.39342162
not I wouldnt say terror but the the belief that maybe well be spending the night in here,0.304844201
and obviously its youknow you dont think youre gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes,0.166197211
but its certainly you dont have food you dont have,0.367594868
so,0.99999994
I cannot be certain of what happened,0.348770797
this is a photograph,0.484397143
but clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water,0.281650096
it may be a creek a stream a river or just an extreme extreme area flood,0.301529884
but thats really irrelevant,0.524888158
she is in trouble,0.299414873
and someone has either noticed a passerby or has,0.325393111
or she alerted somebody that of her her situation,0.326442778
and the authorities were alerted because it appears that a a professional is attempting to rescue her,0.329574227
he has on rescue equipment,0.291660219
and I really cannot give an end to the story because I dont know what the outcome of the situation was,0.268148601
I assume she was saved,0.348680496
but theres no telling based on this photograph,0.304116815
there is a boy and a young boy,0.326702833
hes outside,0.337011248
and hes kicking about a soccer ball,0.245506763
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house,0.243238196
shatters a window,0.465950072
lands inside,0.649545372
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it,0.251055807
he is quite startled,0.420009017
we then see him with the ball in his hand,0.296895385
hes looking out the broken window,0.271412194
he I cant tell that hes glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption,0.237179786
and hes certainly not happy,0.328999698
Im not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother removed it from his hand,0.253625691
and he is still asking for it,0.324993938
and she is reluctant to give it to him,0.329157829
hes then outside with,0.342241049
well he has a backpack on so I assume hes headed off to school but not necessarily,0.231777474
and hes outside,0.322901845
and hes walking,0.305815756
and he sees raindrops falling,0.300010085
and the rain picks up,0.310865015
and he is getting soaked,0.278821826
and it appears hes turned around,0.289438844
and hes returned home,0.296289384
his mother is looking at his his drenched body,0.280485094
and then he was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain,0.292238057
okay the story of Cinderella,0.270743728
well Cinderella is shes one of three sisters,0.237612382
and two of them are rather in modern terms stuck up,0.290397793
and and well theyre high on themselves,0.399236619
and they their mother is somewhat the same way,0.385451138
and she as the story progresses there is a one of the wealthy gentleman,0.314091921
the uppity ups in in the area,0.324148476
he is trying to I believe marry off his son,0.253746122
and there is a ball being held,0.300074011
and Cinderella is not invited because she she has been rather outcast by the family as just the the servant girl,0.260881841
and and shes to wait on everybody else,0.254403889
so shes rather lower class in the family,0.277253091
and it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the the ability to go to the ball I suppose youd say,0.260485798
and she goes there in this fancy fancy vehicle,0.257027864
and shes shes wearing glass slippers,0.265295565
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the son of the the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son,0.23489745
so shes shes dancing with the son and it it turns out that the son is is rather enamored by her,0.227649242
so but the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by I believe it was midnight something,0.287339836
or else she turns into a pumpkin something like that,0.303063512
Im not exactly sure what the the gist of it was,0.248184711
but regardless she it gets close to midnight,0.35839656
she realizes this,0.541038513
and she darts off,0.376973242
and leaves the the prince or the son of the wealthy landowner whoever he was kindof depressed that she hadta leave early,0.293751955
and she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers,0.248032942
and these glass slippers are magical,0.372046113
and then she the prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her her foot,0.302385986
so and then hes again youknow theyre together again,0.324655592
and hes happy to have found her,0.266051769
and the the other sisters are who had planned on one of them getting the the guy theyre kindof left in the dark,0.293052524
and and everyone kindof gets their their comeuppance,0.456318557
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after,0.316873521
well you go to the cabinet,0.321249753
get the peanut butter and the jelly,0.337065399
the jellys usually in the refrigerator,0.499989003
and a slice of bread,0.366356254
and put the jelly and the peanut butter on the bread,0.335663468
and fold it over,0.394690573
and eat it,0.376779318
the cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog,0.240815207
and the dad said,0.284843445
well,1.000000119
to the little girl because she was crying her cat was out in the tree,0.282253861
I will get the cat down for you,0.282678068
so the dad got up on the ladder to get up get up the tree to get the cat,0.249463961
but the ladder fell down,0.358130068
and so here the dog the dog is barking at the tree to get the cat,0.272994876
the dad is caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down,0.221581399
so the police the firemen have been called,0.37263751
and theyre coming in to bring another ladder to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy,0.26236251
and there is a bird singing in the tree,0.305057198
so the bird is happy,0.304829329
so it all ends when the firemen get the dad and the cat down,0.27766642
okay I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had GuillainBarre syndrome,0.272660255
and thats a type of paralyzing,0.374475598
its kindof its I think it was called French polio because the men were from France,0.260981679
and I was on a vacation out over in SanDiego with friends,0.267561674
and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet,0.292318135
and I was stumbling,0.361891389
I was having a hard time walking,0.355065107
and I knew something was wrong,0.345284015
and I just I really kindof thought it was fate,0.409009516
I thought maybe Id a brain tumor or something really pretty serious,0.354296654
but my daughter was with me,0.299339175
and we had planned on going to UniversalStudios,0.344496399
and I wasnt in pain,0.232851326
so but I was just having a hard time walking,0.392766714
GuillainBarre starts at your fingers and toes,0.321696281
and then works works in,0.499030232
so I cant I can remember this going to UniversalStudios in a wheelchair,0.279373705
so by that evening by the time we all go back to our hotel I was really quite concerned,0.264251739
I did sleep,0.526250064
and the next morning they took me to ScrippsMedicalCenter in the SanDiego area,0.298907578
and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because GuillainBarre affects its its a autoimmune disease,0.338385999
and he asked me if I had had the flu recently,0.266970575
and I had,0.39763248
and so the the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system,0.33583492
and this was what was happening,0.392920375
so they told first they wanted to admit me to the hospital,0.332959801
and I said,0.329179674
no way,0.563675404
I I was going back ta,0.353295654
oh and they did r they asked me to ke shuffle a deck of cards,0.176153645
I couldnt do that,0.447520673
and snap,0.43229866
I couldnt do that,0.447520673
so got back in the car with my friends,0.270389855
and my daughter was with us,0.271634132
and he said,0.372952074
if you have trouble breathing,0.516951978
because it can go all the way in,0.33441633
its youknow affects your s affects your muscles,0.339923859
to find the nearest hospital,0.376269251
but I got back home,0.421644568
and it took me about oh six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery,0.218684316
for about six weeks I couldnt drive the car,0.223922431
I couldnt I could feed myself but I couldnt cut,0.397242427
I could shower but I couldnt,0.434832275
I had no strength in my hands or my feet,0.23502399
I couldnt stand on my toes,0.276427627
any of that kind of thing,0.438398689
so then I started it wherever it goes youknow,0.3767353
and then it stops and its just your body stops starts healing again,0.37131393
then it was a slow recovery,0.390111208
I would start walking just out around the block a little bit,0.353444248
but I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister,0.250366122
she was living with us at the time,0.283549786
and I just felt like an old lady,0.262870967
and this was over twenty years ago,0.32432121
so I was in my forties,0.270680487
and I was just holding,0.343952477
and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over,0.281225026
but it I recovered,0.485651851
I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands,0.35018456
I I can occasionally have a hand tremor,0.34670496
but I feel like Im ninety nine percent better,0.253729671
so that was it,0.503803194
yeah,1
oh yes,0.78150177
well okay,0.538446307
my mother who I lost about a year and a half ago had Alzheimers,0.223448068
so we went through this process,0.37416783
and she was oh about eighty when we first,0.245694995
and it was kindof interesting,0.401156545
my daughter,0.558648705
like I said my kids come just every other year for Christmas,0.279463232
and my daughter from California was home,0.277739108
and within two hours,0.442406714
they were all at my house,0.320437342
Susie came up to me and said,0.20400086
Mother something is wrong with Grandma,0.295391917
and we had noticed a little bit,0.334343046
but it it just got worse and worse,0.441206694
and then then my mom and dad were in assisted living out in FountainHills,0.273441434
then we lost dad,0.367185056
so we put mom into a a nursing home up in Flagstaff where my sister lives,0.209488332
and she was up there for four years,0.277345479
and at first she could talk,0.278119445
she went through all the different stations ay stations of youknow aggression and meanness,0.272523165
and she would call me or dad would actually because she couldnt really dial,0.31351155
but dad would call,0.389997065
and shed grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes,0.269253701
and she was much thinner than I was so,0.310447276
or taking money,0.469127536
dad would call and hiding in the garage and this mother whos k maybe a hundred and ten pounds at the most youknow,0.193038717
he was kindof frightened of her because she got really mean,0.346298784
but then she got back into a very calm state,0.303568602
and slowly began to really make no sense whatsoever,0.32557556
but Ive I learned,0.461038411
and and Dad and I went to a Alzheimers support group which really really helped us,0.274865031
especially dad,0.459559739
and because my mom had done everything,0.333973914
Imean she had been the one to do all the shopping send out the cards,0.260051578
and I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards,0.22985892
but finally there was a point where when dad died that she needed full care,0.300537586
so and the last six months she she couldnt talk or do anything,0.227296591
and she broke her hip had a fall,0.276505589
and the saddest thing was that up until the last year she was very physically very healthy,0.279400349
so she died at age eighty seven,0.261157483
ERROR,1
so,0.99999994
I guess a long time ago,0.322483152
xxx,1
tell me the story start from the beginning,0.327924162
I was in an earthquake in California,0.287199885
and one of the major ones,0.44817394
this was in the fifties,0.463147283
and it was it it was we were visiting my dads aunt or my dads sister my aunt out in California,0.199168503
and it happened in the middle of the night,0.363860458
and it was it its listed,0.329375088
I think it was maybe a seven pointer something,0.346495569
Imean it the house was definitely moving,0.367301553
the bed was moving,0.37062645
I was sharing a bed with my cousin,0.235770851
and when I woke up at first I just thought she was shaking the bed around,0.266770691
but it was dark,0.447110981
it was early early morning,0.453386068
and so there was alotof flashing because the transformers going off,0.324635297
and my aunt and uncle had a a doorbell chime,0.247989029
the kinds that two hang,0.370371938
and,1
so we were up for the rest of the morning,0.302304208
this probably happened oh five oclock in the morning something like that,0.296977937
there were alotof tremors afterwards,0.322256356
and I remember back then in the fifties the newspapers useta do extras,0.323833436
and there was an extra out that day on the earthquake,0.279883772
so it was it was alittle frightening at the time because you just dont know whats going on,0.296626002
so it scared me,0.556794286
but I havent had too much to frighten me in my life,0.292627692
yeah,1
well there was a flash flood in the deserts of Arizona which happens frequently,0.275062352
and people are alittle careless,0.423010916
and they think they can drive their car out through this dry wash bed that allofasudden has a trickle of water,0.273032099
and they get their car out there,0.376068592
and the trickle becomes a flood,0.414719224
and they hafta get outof their car,0.216672242
and they are standing on the roof,0.381103635
and the paramedics the or the firemen come,0.44499442
the rescue people come,0.417005837
and the little girl falls off of the car into the raging flood waters,0.312819779
and shes holding onto a branch,0.278187007
and the firemen come out and rescue her,0.374612063
shes extremely scared,0.340419024
the boy is playing soccer out at his yard,0.204454109
and he kicks the ball,0.333056271
and it breaks one of the windows,0.358951092
and it lands in the living room where the dad is sitting,0.306854993
it breaks the window,0.442005217
but it also breaks the lamp,0.373515546
and the dad gets up,0.271107823
and holds the soccer ball,0.347827613
and looks out the window,0.378849059
and is yelling out to the boy,0.287283927
get in here right away,0.397547603
the little boy is going off to school,0.271011084
he walks to school,0.357047796
and his mother says,0.425196886
well it looks like it might rain today,0.418328583
you better take the umbrella,0.392079175
and he said,0.372952074
oh no I dont need an umbrella,0.237962157
I I I dont think its going to rain,0.336444259
so off he goes with his backpack,0.275687128
and sure enough it starts raining,0.40355581
and he gets soaking wet,0.326651275
its raining very very hard,0.462714076
and he runs back to the house,0.334625393
and and looks at his mother,0.365234792
and he is soaking wet,0.293081671
and the mother is alittle disgruntled at him for not taking the umbrella,0.266342849
but she gives him the umbrella,0.312405974
and back out he goes to school with the umbrella keeping him dry,0.261339545
okay this is the story of Cinderella,0.274400473
and Cinderella lost her mother,0.372575313
and her father married a new person a a woman,0.365062684
a and so Cinderella had a stepmother,0.325073481
but the stepmother also had two girls,0.362966448
so they came in and were living with Cinderella,0.298080385
the father didnt realize this but the stepmother was really treating Cinderella mean,0.313925505
and he she had her cleaning and washing while her daughters were being treated very very nicely,0.330916256
and Cinderella felt very sad,0.300621003
well there was a prince in the land,0.363456666
there was the the castle,0.483062059
and the king and the queen wanted their prince to get married,0.348960936
and they were looking for the best wife for for him,0.334432721
and they were going to have a ball to introduce him to all the single ladies in the kingdom,0.298341632
and Cinderella wanted to go,0.303567857
but the stepmother said,0.410380483
no way,0.563675404
you dont have the right kind of clothes,0.301328331
your hair isnt done right,0.308309197
none of that,0.486202657
so the the stepsisters were getting ready,0.368100196
and Cinderella was very very sad,0.316010326
and the book talks about her going up in the attic or down in the basement finding this chest with a book,0.262599856
this part I dont know but anyway,0.408573985
she calls on a fairy godmother to come and and help her,0.286593586
and the fairy godmother gives her this beautiful dress,0.336928129
does up her hair,0.371455371
and she has a coach,0.310827374
and off she goes to the ball,0.290258765
but she is being told that everything is going to go back to the way it was at the stroke of midnight,0.260223806
so her coachmen are going to turn into mice,0.240272045
and her coach is going to turn into a pumpkin,0.218847021
but off she goes,0.380462646
and she dances with the prince,0.410883397
and she falls in love with him,0.303425997
but then she hears the clock stuhtriking,0.377426654
and she knows that this is all going to just collapse,0.352261692
so off she goes running down the stairs out to the coach,0.269346237
and about that time it ri the clock strikes midnight,0.303681552
and shes back to her ragged clothes,0.281005621
but she has lost one of her slippers on the stairway as she ran down from the castle,0.214610726
so the prince wants to find this beautiful young lady,0.318414569
and he says whoever can fit into this slipper will be my new princess,0.22553432
and he they search high and low,0.373590559
and they go into the house of the stepmother and the and the daughters and the and Cinderella,0.422415078
and they try on the shoes,0.323520392
and they wont fit,0.295823693
but Cinderella tries on the shoe,0.264567733
and it fits perfect,0.392000616
so the prince knows that this is his princess,0.360832453
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
the end,0.63970381
pretty easy,0.680716157
well you get the ingredients out,0.364663064
you get the the bread that youd wanna use,0.314804614
I would first take a paper plate and put the two slices of bread on the plate,0.264485091
and then either before or after Id go get the jelly and the peanut butter,0.254771382
and if they were already open theyd probably be in the refrigerator,0.310133547
and then I would take two knives because I dont wanna adulterate one or the other,0.281403065
and I would I would probably put the butter on first,0.311284453
and I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly,0.327060103
and I would the put the butter on the one side,0.331806481
probably the right side just because its thats where its at in my mind,0.313713551
and I would put it on evenly,0.30652979
but I would put it on very over the whole area,0.303574651
not this area because I hate that,0.440700233
an,1
Id probably use alittle less jelly than the the peanut butter because Id rather have more peanut butter,0.287512958
and then I would put the two I would probably take the in the left hand take the one with the jelly and put it over the one with the peanut butter,0.297957808
so the two surfaces that have stuff on it face each other,0.334031165
and I would put them so the top of the loaf is where the youknow the top of the piece is where it has a symmetrical,0.250595629
and then I would cut it in half probably this way ri horizontally,0.28871575
and then I would know what Id eat it,0.335929722
I dont know if you wanna know that so,0.47899434
and at some point Id probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife wouldnt yell at me,0.197791651
looks like there is a kitty got up into the branch of a tree,0.243838444
and it looks like the father climbed up on the tree with a ladder,0.270717323
and somehow the ladder fell down,0.34491694
and the father is stuck in the tree,0.311273038
theres a girl up there reaching up for probably her cat,0.265172124
and theres a tricycle next to her,0.26695779
and theres a ladder there thats quite a ways from the tree,0.30556494
so I dont understand how it got that far away,0.356319457
but maybe it tipped over backwards,0.428674459
and then theres a dog probably their dog barking up the tree,0.297195882
and youknow why I have no idea what dogs do,0.307539076
and then theres a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree,0.336288124
and then smack evidently somebody called a fire department,0.307189703
and theres a firetruck,0.316825777
and theres a couple fireman carrying a ladder towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there,0.296875805
but maybe its not a good enough one,0.397794574
and thats pretty much it,0.388404995
so evidently the father climbed up the tree to get the cat out,0.271548182
and for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down,0.322496325
and somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the fire department,0.309757411
and theyre responding,0.460805655
an,1
looks like its low enough he can just jump down so,0.299190491
the thing was is that I never had a heart attack,0.330077946
and otherthan having a very little chest pain,0.395204782
it was kindof somewhat of a surprise so,0.351846129
I had went and had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician,0.235181391
and he said that was alright,0.350422889
which they dont show anything,0.360542119
so now he suggested a stress echo,0.290881634
so I I had a stress echo,0.324707329
and I went to it,0.323856533
and and I failed it,0.369469672
youknow I was kindof shocked,0.370236814
and I was gonna do things afterwards,0.262521744
and I just called my wife,0.282647669
and and talked to her,0.408275992
and then I went home,0.365488172
and smack and then they did a cardiac catharization,0.290438414
smack and between the first day and the second day they gave me nitroglycerine,0.242304116
and then I just didnt do anything because I didnt wanna have a heart attack,0.310183913
and I had a cardiac catharization,0.304973483
and I didnt know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was older and past his prime wouldnt have done anything if if if,0.251094431
and he wouldnt even put it in a stent,0.284078777
because which I wouldnt have used him if I would have known that,0.345398605
make a long story short I had three main,0.262681335
one was blocked a hundred percent,0.339572132
one was blocked ninety eight percent,0.38564828
and one was blocked eighty percent,0.326743305
so I was very fortunate that I didnt either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that,0.293565959
and I had surgery,0.346375883
and I had surgery by a a cardiac surgeon that was considered by the nurses and people in general one of the better ones,0.275763065
I went to ScottsdaleHealthcareOsborn,0.401341766
and before I went I called and asked them how many procedures they did the previous year,0.277193129
and based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance you had a better success,0.30527389
so they were even better than at Mayo,0.30183205
at the time Mayo was at Scottsdale Shea,0.266622096
and it was like oh three or four hours there,0.226226196
I to this day I dont know because what my wife told me and what she now says is different,0.261178583
so it doesnt matter,0.458055913
smack and when I got done,0.280172467
its its very intrusive,0.540707827
you dont know what the,0.405462831
and they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked really bad,0.334500313
but I was calm,0.416849703
and well my brother just had it a couple weeks ago,0.269086599
and his wife said he didnt look that bad,0.232279301
so I dont know what that means,0.447773099
well smack when I saw my mob,0.248902678
but she did r she recovered very rapidly,0.314989984
and shes still alive,0.320856512
and thats about fifteen years ago,0.274962008
smack and then I just remember that it it took a long time to recover,0.316376477
and then one day I went to the cardiologist and he said youknow,0.245103732
go back to work,0.439586729
which when I went back to work I had problems because it really was too soon,0.329564393
I should have said youknow,0.368848652
well Im not really ready,0.348085284
and my wife has always said that after that I acted like an old man,0.232756868
I was I was fifty five at the time,0.286416411
that must have been ten years ago,0.332102746
and the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems,0.310024321
and I would go from one room to the other to find out to get something,0.31238246
by the time I got there I forgot that,0.302390009
and they said that that was go away in six months,0.255507827
it never did,0.591603935
I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long,0.287433147
and at that time they didnt have a filter in there that filters out the little particles or whatever that causes your problem,0.31391871
and Ive never really been the same since then,0.345758945
and youknow thats the pretty much the end of the thing,0.304656565
the story,0.629450321
ERROR,1
and one day it it was a very very little right here,0.379040599
and just to be on the safe side youknow the other pharmacist said youknow,0.236353189

and and they it was very difficult to communicate with them,0.411908805
I had an aunt that had was very old,0.282084316
in the nineties and had Alzheimers,0.370356053
and and she didnt even know,0.323568344
she was a aunt that was very near and dear to me,0.242413491
and was always very nice,0.377544433
thats probably my favorite aunt so,0.313958198
and sometimes I have problems communicating with my wife,0.332668304
we both dont hear that well,0.339276016
and wed start talking and walk away,0.28183496
and and alotof people if you pay attention they just speak alot,0.30721119

and it was ke eighth grade,0.229696274
and we were moving from one location to another because my dads place of employment moved,0.283758581
and we were carrying some stuff on a a big long trailer that he was pulling with his nineteen fifty five Buick,0.229746327
and it was a rented Uhaul,0.273187459
and we were driving down the two lane highway and,0.333544225
probably going about forty forty five,0.461656153
ERROR,1
I didnt know what happened at the time,0.295046121
but subsequently I found out that one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch,0.290136784
because it was put in upside down,0.31054917
it came undone and it fell out,0.272366196
and because of that it the trailer caused the car to go like this,0.319409668
and the car was going like this,0.325273275
and I had a big round mirror that was above the dresser,0.252232909
and I had it in my in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side,0.250963092
because youknow so it didnt get broken,0.350278974
and the car whipped around,0.369617373
an,1
and to make a long story short,0.341629893
the trailer caused the car to spin all the way around,0.324333638
and the end of the trailer hit a big tree that was literally that big in diameter,0.271272928
and damaged the trailer,0.425893217
and the tree a little bit,0.381106019
and if he woulda,0.397162944
and and then I remember getting outof the car with my dad,0.261249423
and looking at the trailer and all that,0.384526938
and that was pretty,0.416023016
and then youknow it wasnt it didnt take a long time for all this to happen,0.254330248
but that kindof sticks in my memory,0.348267227
it youknow that youknow for the grace of God,0.253304034
or or my dads ability or something,0.407911688
otherthan having a damaged trailer,0.382776409
and I dont know cant remember if he hadta pay for it or it was covered under insurance or,0.215256616

tandem,0.99999994
two wheels,0.54754138
so that was that was I dont know if that was real scary but it it certainly left an impression on me so,0.310500979
well looks like theres a,0.37513113
oh,0.999999881
okay,0.99999994
I didnt get what this was to begin with,0.270778805

looks like there was a young girl,0.352320462
or maybe a young woman,0.354311436
I dont know,0.538106382
probably in the teens or maybe oh I cant tell really tell the age,0.209351778
looks like that she was in a an area where there was rocky or stony or cliff type things,0.237614572
and she evidently fell in the into the xxx,0.315303475
it looks like xxx on the t,0.254940271
I cant really see that xxx,0.338857532
its not that good a picture,0.412319303
and she evidently got fell in,0.31008628
and she hanged onto a a dead trees branch outof the rocks,0.246197864
and looks like theres probably some man,0.371113181
by the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person,0.244297415
in a red lifejacket,0.365399361

and it looks like hes just got to the point where hes up by next to her and hes gonna when he gets a chance put the belt around the girl and rescue her,0.204144344
probably paramedics or police,0.415284693
and looks like hes in well shape,0.276067495
hes got a a gigantic bicept,0.304538578
and the girl doesnt look really that she looks a little scared,0.312568963
Imean she looks alittle shocked out too or something,0.372280806

so I I dont know about that,0.455065548
well theres well theres a boy playing with a I guess thats a soccer ball,0.251730293

and hes looking out the window,0.284188956
and doesnt youknow cant see his expression on his face,0.191415682
but he probably in the either in the stages of finding out youknow who did it or whatever,0.281806231
and then hes probably gonna react to it one way or the other,0.261259705
well looks like theres a mother offering to a child,0.314552754
maybe a girl,0.467912048
I dont know,0.538106382
kindof hard to no,0.436636925
its probably a boy,0.347866207
unbrella,0
and he goes out,0.314507663
and walks with his backpack in the rain,0.311975718
and hes starting to get wet,0.236919865
and he,0.547172546
so he comes back,0.393399298
and hes all wet,0.26042366
and his mother seems to not that be happy about it either,0.364423543
and so then the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now,0.256297827
and hes youknow using it the proper way,0.268717825
that hes getting most of the rain not go on his upper upper body,0.235565826
and doesnt say if they he was dried out before that or not,0.268330663
but he doesnt seem to be wet from the picture,0.238505468
so I no,0.529154837
thats just speculation,0.437808573
well Id like to say that being a European I was not brought up to enjoy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,0.214096799
but I have learned to make them for various visits that I have from my grandchildren,0.308357239
I would get two slices of wheat bread which I enjoy very much,0.252757818
I first I would get the peanut butter jar outof the cupboard,0.238430187
not the fridge because you dont needta put peanut butter in the fridge,0.254419327
and I would take a knife outof the drawer,0.229063153
I would put,0.485738486
put the jelly,0.370061755
clap it together,0.387887955
and,1
okay the little girls,0.375007629
and,1
and she suddenly saw her cat in the tree,0.274563313
and she called her father,0.436259717
the dog,0.472513318
the mother in in meantime had obviously called,0.367289662
and,1
and he,0.547172546
we were living in LA,0.276203543
and we lost our house in an earthquake,0.251014203
and in which time we decided to move to Arizona,0.332952648
shortly after we arrived in Arizona I was diagnosed with breast cancer,0.243053377
it was a very hard time for me because I knew noone here,0.295733809
I had no friends,0.396245956
luckily I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me,0.197314069
and put me on a drug which I hadta take called Tamoxifen,0.220004454
I live in the LakesinTempe which is a very pleasant place to live,0.28412661
and over the years over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication I got to know very many friends who were extremely good very supportive to me,0.268353581
and I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time,0.285307616
and also grateful for the knowledge that its been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer,0.283814669
and up until now touch wood,0.31593433
I could remember when I,0.529981375
I was I was an actress for many years in London and in SydneyAustralia,0.220336825
and when I left with my German husband,0.281605422
when I left Australia to come back to Germany my my my German my gift to the German land which is not very large,0.231272519
and I already had one child who was born in Australia,0.256342798
and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home,0.296464384
and I hadta do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could which wasnt very easy because I had a sister inlaw who was not very kind at that time,0.241979688
and every time I made a mistake in Germany she useta she useta laugh and make fun of me,0.224494904
and I useta be very resentful about that,0.403566241
but because I was I guess so ambitious at that time and because I was good at dialects,0.317529619
and I I think this has something to do with musical ability because Im able to hear,0.285570771
I learned I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year I would say,0.245419875
and thats thats all I could say about language difficulties,0.3308101
very much so,0.615596771
I was four years old when the second world war started,0.266836971
and I was living in Cardiff that time which is the capital of Wales,0.275966138
and we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit,0.259609759
and my parents had decided to send me to,0.312585115
and about two days before I was due to depart to to live with my grandparents our house was flattened,0.242392406
luckily we were in the garden at that time in what they,0.284314036
and we heard obviously what was going on outside,0.315232009
and I I cant remember being terribly scared at that time because I was with my parents,0.277796656
however when our house was destroyed in an earthquake in LA in two in,0.28549546
and I had a nervous breakdown at that time,0.291377962
place in,0.643696308
this story took place in NewOrleans at the time of Katrina,0.271711648
when the whole city of NewOrleans was flooded this little girl was washed away by the the the water that had come through the dikes,0.300668627
and this,0.587765396
and grabbed,0.440359056
and with that he was able to help the little girl on land,0.293608457
and both their lives were saved at that time,0.352579296
little Johnny had been warned by his father not to play with the football close to the house,0.250913203
and he promises dad he wouldnt do that,0.298141718
however he got so taken away by his new football that he was kicking it,0.257823706
and it threw it flew the ball flew through the window,0.268587857
and made a big hole in the window,0.297206074
and bounced right next to dad,0.311451614
dad ofcourse was not pleased,0.319527596
and shouted through the window,0.412499994
I told you not to do that,0.422367603
it was time for little Johnny to go to school,0.245999277
and because the weather was looking gray and cloudy outside his mom said,0.271168351
Johnny do take an umbrella with you,0.211542368
no,0.99999994
he says,0.504161835
so off he walks,0.375564873
and hed only been gone a few minutes before the rain started,0.238443449
ofcourse he was feeling very guilty,0.36277312
and he ran back home,0.324176371
and his mum said,0.293515265
Johnny I wish youd listen to what I am telling you,0.339195788
and he said,0.372952074
I will in the future mum,0.242766112
so he walked off with his umbrella,0.267392218
and went back to school again,0.390963823
little Cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died,0.2733531
after which her father married a second time to a a middleaged woman who he fell in love with who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters,0.235835671
poor little Cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother her stepmother and the daughters,0.297486573
she did all the ironing the cleaning and everything else,0.369469106
and because she was such a nice person she did it willingly because she had a good heart,0.317512751
one day the old king approached his son and said,0.282656729
its about time you got married,0.281539381
Im going to throw a ball,0.267947346
and you I hope will find your future wife at the ball,0.248822629
the the prince wasnt too keen on the idea but finally he agreed,0.271158457
when the the stepmother and the and the ugly sisters found out about this ball they they tried their level best to make themselves look aswellas they could,0.301136553
they they bought new clothes,0.430359453
they they did their hair,0.503182411
they they made themselves as presentable as they could,0.458094478
Cinderella in the meantime was looked outof her window,0.219916776
and saw the the castle where the where the big ball was taking place,0.372934937
and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball,0.319987267
she was helped by her little friends the mice and and the owl,0.277648389
and they all said,0.427029014
oh Cinderella why dont you try and contact your fairy godmother,0.23187089
she might be able to help you,0.42471844
well Cinderella said,0.335146815
I dont know how to do that,0.429017633
and they said,0.43198812
well look look in the trunk,0.34552756
theres a book in the trunk,0.270525455
if you read how to find your fairy godmother she might turn up and be able to help you,0.318719059
and she did that,0.429217577
and whan,0.493618071
and said,0.513667703
Cinderella you shall go to the ball,0.258698642
and she suddenly with with her magic was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made outof a pumpkin,0.200304136
and coachmen she changed the mice into coachmen,0.258395791
and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress,0.253398061
and she said,0.380783647
you go and you have a good time my child but remember one thing,0.35647738
when the clock strikes midnight you must already have returned from the ball,0.316919863
so Cinderella promised to do that,0.352790803
she went to the ball,0.318856329
the prince fell madly in love with her and she with him,0.299747616
and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock r twelve,0.283696622
so she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could,0.269592404
and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step,0.280274838
that was the only thing that the prince hadta identify her with,0.41308406
shortly after that the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman,0.31369105
he who had no idea who she was,0.38041389
the only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper,0.288872123
so he sent a courtier around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper,0.263647497
and said,0.513667703
anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her,0.219284713
and ofcourse the courtier arrived at Cinderellas house,0.300846636
and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and ofcourse couldnt do that until Cinderella said,0.231687233
I would like to try,0.468440503
and she did,0.392446101
and ofcourse the slipper fit,0.359804988
and the prince was delighted to have found her again,0.336908907
and they married and lived happily ever after,0.343447834
apparently a birthday celebration is planned,0.343282998
and there is a cake with four candles on the table,0.282530963
we see on the right two women one already in in the room the other entering through the doorway,0.339368522
and each has a child,0.373531073
the women already inside has a little boy,0.336553693
and the women just entering is with a little girl,0.332443148
both of both children who are entering have wrapped presents presumably for the party,0.35362184
when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it a pretty good size portion of it,0.260010034
and there are pieces of cake on the table,0.31727308
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to what we percieve what we see as a dog sortof hiding underneath the sofa,0.252827764
and the hostess apparently the women whos giving the party is standing there facing the dog,0.329016417
she has a broom in her hand,0.300225675
she appears to be very angry,0.324239403
and the the birthday boy we cant tell what hes doing,0.189138353
he seems to be,0.393215775
I cant tell weather hes wiping his eyes,0.20811756
his u his mouth is wide open apparently to call or do something,0.212666005
and looks as though the woman the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom,0.293595701
oh my favorite food,0.347731531
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.321188539
my way or the common way,0.368231207
well we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all,0.220732465
but use a good bread,0.412807852
sometimes its nice to toast it first,0.305969805
on the other hand its not necessary,0.40150252
its whatever you feel like at the time,0.320531905
well having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading,0.311090946
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first,0.257573605
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it,0.399439782
it works better,0.533667564
spread spread the,0.70566237
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread,0.298811793
well after that a little bit of butter,0.327030391
not too much but some,0.558115721
tends to help make the thing a little bit more moist than usual,0.326260686
and on top of that goes the jelly,0.271260142
now having done so what alotof people fail to have ever learned is youknow regardless of how much bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth,0.248020887
well theres an easy way around that,0.333301008
most people dont know my special secret,0.286028981
my special secret is lettuce,0.274084002
nice leaves of iceberg lettuce,0.310088515
just a couple is just right to do it,0.38155821
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had,0.293956488
I got alot of them but I can tell you Ill tell you this one,0.301165819
when the KoreanWar started I was twenty one and Onea,0.332360566
and in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself in a in in a stinky rice paddy shooting people I arranged or I I applied for the Airforces Aviation Cadet program,0.205672339
and I was I was appointed,0.333269298
I finally got an appointment to an air air cadet class,0.225582182
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia,0.27172637
and in those times,0.461607099
well I never did do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid,0.350739509
in the I was still in the in the within the very first I guess it was just the first phase of of training,0.314605772
I had already had some flying instruction,0.402920783
and I awoke one Saturday morning,0.287737846
no actually it was a Sunday morning,0.313033968
I awoke feeling hungover,0.473653078
I knew the hungover feeling,0.401091874
but I had not had I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then,0.348412991
I was only in my twenties,0.256120086
and I thought,0.462097377
boyohboy this is terrible,0.543000698
so I kindof stayed youknow just I hung back all day,0.350477874
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover,0.317891061
well I knew that I didnt feel well enough to fly,0.312355787
I was not safe,0.386474371
so I put myself into sick call,0.332821637
well this was this was a civilian contract flying school,0.341883838
and they had a infirmary but only a youknow it wasnt it wasnt a hospital,0.268217832
so I found myself in the infirmary,0.290697694
well I wasnt feeling too good but I wasnt feeling quite as bad as I had,0.293615699
youknow little by little it sortof left,0.327813834
and it got to the point where youknow the doctors would come in theyd looked at me and theyd say,0.232157052
well you dont have any jaundice but your liver and your spleen are enlarged,0.307368875
and we know there is something very very wrong going on internally,0.372019172
we dont know what it is,0.402123302
well story,0.59507966
we even I I I I felt good enough at or for after awhile that I you could even played a little bit of wheelchair football,0.273363858
but then one of the medics came in and he said,0.306809366
okay,0.99999994
he says,0.504161835
Isd,1.000000119
and I said,0.329179674
no youre not,0.426789105
he said,0.528301835
yes I am,0.578143239
he says,0.504161835
dont worry sir,0.473595113
he says,0.504161835
I givesd,1
and I thought,0.462097377
oh not another one,0.394523859
well he did,0.431158483
didnt seem to make very much difference,0.349973351
upshot of it all was that they gave up,0.253618836
they didnt they couldnt begin to imagine,0.399693936
they had never seen a situation like this with an with a an enlarged and palpable liver palpable spleen and no jaundice,0.29380393
it wasnt anything they had ever seen before,0.338201344
next thing you know I was sitting in the back of a of a staff car being driven from there down to the Tyndall Air Force Base in Tallahassee Florida,0.186659768
well they put me in there,0.319544137
they still didnt know,0.458944559
youknow lotsof poking around but finally they just said,0.382519573
okay you are you are confined to just bed rest,0.352280319
dont get outof bed,0.358191729
except to go to the bathroom,0.349026412
okay,0.99999994
well it got pretty boring,0.425033152
and I was feeling pretty good,0.347012639
so Id wander around at night,0.258002073
and youknow Id have the buddies over in the next ward or something like that,0.236305237
wed have visit,0.359921277
or Id get the nurses to give me icecream or something like that,0.271034956
well one morning the flight surgeon came around,0.343082368
didnt find me in my bed,0.233832806
he was very disappointed,0.45706892
and when I returned from wandering around visiting my buddies I was feeling pretty good,0.273927361
he said,0.528301835
if you get,0.635504782
he says,0.504161835
if ever I catch you outof bed again,0.35916853
he says,0.504161835
thats court marshal,0.316284478
thats the story,0.424561441
well it turned out that there was a new disease that they nobody knew anything about,0.334450752
the year would have been nineteen fifty one,0.378788769
and the disease is called infectious mononucleosis,0.386654884
you get it from kissing,0.357647717
that was that girlfriend I had back in town,0.314011693
back up there in Moltrey,0.43160364
thats what it was,0.392235041
okay that was the adventure,0.318980992
however end of the story,0.427296132
one year later a little over a year later I found myself in Korea,0.252500564
and I was I I I felt the needta go to the flight surgeon for another slight malady known as crabs,0.220193401
you get them from toilet seats over there,0.324859649
this is in Korea,0.357200384
loandbehold it was the same flight surgeon who I met the year before,0.255818129
and we had a good laugh,0.285009056
thats the story,0.424561441
yes,0.999999881
I think I already have,0.580648959
not at all,0.419155866
I have a hearing problem,0.396747619
and you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU gave a a workshop over time it was several weeks where we come over and wed learn all about hearing loss,0.219612792
well it ended up with me being a regular patient here,0.281209797
and what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss,0.260542542
well even now I find that many people particularly young women theyve been taught to talk through their nose real fast,0.291887015
and thats what they do,0.388041496
and I hafta say to them,0.267082691
excuseme I have a hearing problem,0.396747619
its not your problem its mine,0.409722775
and after several times of asking them to repeat what they said Ive had I I explain that,0.283958763
I have a hearing problem,0.396747619
I dont understand what you just said,0.42581749
now if you would be kind enough please to speak alittle more slowly and perhaps put some space between your words then Ill not hafta then Ill not hafta ask you continually to repeat yourself,0.268214554
okay,0.99999994
thats how I handle that,0.422028333
you bet I have,0.513647556
the beginning is this occured in this occurred in Louisiana,0.399447054
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana,0.261921227
and we were then flying,0.41070953
I was a fighter pilot,0.365902632
we were then flying the the swept wing version of the Fl eighty four known as the Fl eighty four Fl,0.24237974
and we were we had been out or on a youknow a series of missions,0.216906101
and we were just returning to the base,0.364370525
well actually I was by myself,0.366616994
I was flying solo not in formation with anybody,0.226237491
it was it was just a just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane,0.249845684
and also proficiency,0.69731456
just practice,0.658389449
practice this practice that,0.694214821
well in those times we we had a a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at three hundred and forty knots air speed,0.2458819
when directly over the air when we were directly over the end of the runway wed cut our power back,0.277522087
and that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees,0.274152696
after that the airplane is slow enough sothat we would we would have not have touched the throttle,0.347261727
in other words it cut power completely,0.329554915
and just bring it on around,0.386065751
well the the the legs of the of a of the pattern are called the approach,0.449236125
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind,0.401998132
ninety degrees from that is the base,0.32200098
and following that is the final,0.440496564
so its just el if,0.320719361
well here I am on the base leg with no power,0.221171439
all the garbage is out,0.335098773
we call it garbage,0.428898931
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear,0.433332741
and allofasudden Im about I dont know three four hundred feet off the ground,0.201184317
no more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet,0.364532053
something like that,0.701598167
Im not really sure,0.398967147
the airplane started to shutter,0.375867754
shuttering is the sign of a stall,0.324449897
that means the air when an when an airplane stalls it means its falling outof the sky,0.267210186
and I knew immediately people do not survive these a situation like this,0.329724252
and yet I automatically didnt even I I almost didnt have time to think,0.333610356
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway,0.237375349
I didnt want that to happen,0.402868539
well what did I do,0.460432827
I gave it full power which did not catch in time,0.245738044
I pulled in the the landing gear,0.316513479
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone,0.275356382
well with low rpm there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended,0.278916121
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down,0.32191205
I overshot the runway,0.32896021
but I wouldnt I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side,0.27007547
and the Fl eighty four Fl has a a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left,0.224240765
you cant predict it but it will do that,0.403381765
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe because its a jet,0.209414154
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward,0.302379042
well pretty soon there came the ground,0.364454538
in retrospect I can remember very well that the the horizon was jumping up and down,0.275133133
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction,0.298557937
it yawed,1
and as I say I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on,0.251673877
well eventually it did it did come to rest,0.399150223
it had the it had yawed to the right sothat at full power the engine was or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in a which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people dont land wheels up,0.248605832
well they about panicked,0.527659655
well at which I followed the proper procedures,0.332435608
I cut all power turned everything off,0.339942396
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I I I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing,0.206374973
Im happy to report that the airplane flew again,0.227037638
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground,0.269714117
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels,0.291916966
and it it did fly again,0.368135124
so did I ofcourse,0.485646427
but in this this moment of panic was it it was only a a youknow only a quick flash,0.308858335
it was the the thought was,0.486421376
Ill do whats I know what I needta do but people dont dont walk away from these things,0.307463348
I walked away,0.471154809
it was later determined that while I was I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots,0.245811298
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone,0.229716897
and hes he was his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating,0.247836754
but he could tell that he was overtaking me,0.378020167
so obviously it was an air speed problem,0.324614197
from what I see I havent the foggiest idea of what it what is really going on,0.267172068
I see a man who appears to be lying possibly lying on his back,0.27365467
I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch,0.245520487
he is over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish,0.233203426
so possibly shes there to help him and doesnt know what to,0.308526218
youknow I dont know if she even knows what to do,0.37877503
I dont know any more than that,0.364062726
Imean I can tell you what I see which is some kind of a belt which he has around his left arm,0.217463255
he appears to be quite cu muscular,0.266304553
she appears to be very concerned,0.36294204
thats as much as I can tell you,0.288844913
a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks,0.260920137
it goes into the air,0.331405461
it encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it,0.3189767
a man sitting in a chair looks like an easy chair is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp,0.222212657
he then stands picks up the soccer ball looks out the window to see,0.263091117
lets see how did it get here,0.385673612
thats the story,0.424561441
a little boy is ready to go to school,0.270588756
apparently the weather is somewhat threatening,0.485167027
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella,0.293820858
well he refuses,0.421659768
he is going to be very brave,0.302751482
nothings gonna stop him,0.38121742
he doesnt need an umbrella,0.227513209
thats for sissies,0.336659074
out he goes into the weather,0.315337449
its raining,0.675891876
its raining hard,0.491343915
its raining so hard that hes stepping in puddles,0.252292126
hes getting soaked,0.283843637
his hair is dripping,0.335151315
he returns home much to the conversation,0.35223642
well apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella,0.263881534
well this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disneys thats for sure,0.237712041
Cinderella was a good girl,0.324992597
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters,0.267495394
and they were pampered spoiled and they were nasty,0.386301577
and Cinderella was called Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace,0.227170438
she hadta take out the take out the cinders and do things like that,0.34510228
so it was pretty dirty,0.430912256
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one,0.299054652
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother got an got invitations to go,0.226059169
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home,0.33308664
but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared outof nowhere and said to her,0.260196328
look you deserve to go,0.443857193
we could arrange this but there are conditions,0.426099241
first of all there will be a coach for you pulled by horses,0.214169294
and there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers,0.255389631
and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter whats occurring at at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be outof there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin,0.217873618
Cinderella went to the ball,0.289226502
the prince could not take his eyes of,0.304668784
and she had a wonderful time,0.344835877
but allofasudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve,0.344982356
she knew she hadta get the heck outof there really fast,0.276207149
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers,0.23466
but it didnt make any difference,0.380117029
she got out she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home,0.274956912
well the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away,0.300384969
but that didnt matter because he wanted her,0.401182204
he was he was so struck by what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was,0.278187186
so he decreed that there would a search would occur over the over the kingdom until until the until Cinderella was until the woman was found,0.292532235
now why was this why was this such a thing,0.344871253
well Cinderella had tiny feet,0.261157632
and the glass slipper was so tiny that very few people very few grownups could fit into it,0.277759284
so he he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who who whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one,0.287140787
well loandbehold in his search his search was successful,0.340652883
they did find they did find Cinderella as the one who whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper,0.224565804
and they were married and lived happily ever after,0.339177251
we see here a tree,0.385274291
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs holding on to it sortof so to speak and barking,0.224191397
in a branch in in the in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of rescuing a cat who is on one of the smaller branches,0.276885301
under directly underneath of which is a little girl who who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down,0.223856241
she has a tricycle in front of her,0.271556586
and we see near the little girl a ladder on the ground which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is,0.250689417
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains as I say remains on the ground,0.256900311
thats thats what we thats what we thats what we see to the left left side of the trunk of a tree,0.272626609
on the right side is another branch which had a few leaves on it,0.300897241
and one of on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing,0.26472801
at the same time we see in the in the distance directly to the right of the truck a firetruck and two what appear to be two firemen each each carrying an end of a ladder which presumably is going to be they will use to climb the tree rescue the man and probably the cat aswell,0.263034552
okay it looks like they have problems with their pets,0.340542912
and I have a cat,0.295837373
so I know that cats climb anywhere,0.393675476
and allofasudden its in a high tree,0.368154675
and it doesnt look like the cat is stressed,0.262719274
but the kids are or the little girl is stressed,0.30579409
so Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat,0.222192273
but I dont think hes able to,0.310083181
so he calls the firemen,0.348886847
and the firemen look like theyre going to get the cat down,0.29017505
and Im just gonna assume that they got the cat down,0.233391762
and the little kid is gonna be so excited,0.223333448
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down,0.249380514
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
okay you take the the loaf of bread,0.283666492
and you open the bag,0.329881072
and take two slices out,0.340209991
you get your peanut butter jar,0.433127105
you unscrew it,0.624680102
and you get your knife,0.388898075
and take out the peanut butter,0.325390428
and put peanut butter on both sides of the e I mean on one side,0.224682003
sothat both,1
and then you get your favorite jelly,0.363181174
and you do the same thing,0.373434663
and then you put them together,0.465596676
and serve it,0.445627958
and eat happily ever after,0.317541689
well I,0.573761106
and when I found out I had breast cancer,0.308356524
which runs very prominently in my family,0.275982559
my husband said,0.423293024
were gonna whip this thing,0.27783972
and so I had a mastectomy,0.304448187
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours,0.270302504
and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said,0.261715025
were going off to war again,0.355075896
and were gonna beat it,0.22307618
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing,0.324380785
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband,0.273313105
and my husband was trying to be strong for me,0.25647378
so we always had a positive attitude,0.381916255
and we we never thought negatively,0.473173022
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors,0.306808114
yes,0.999999881
okay well my mother was eighty nine when she had her breast cancer,0.272696406
and she came through that fine,0.361890674
but then after that a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes,0.362186968
and so she herself said,0.370671868
I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab,0.288796306
and she was living by herself at the time,0.306517333
and so she,0.468329489
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in near my sister in Dallas,0.235039741
and so then I went there once a month to visit her,0.278382182
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well,0.286159009
she she would start sentences,0.411848575
and never be able to finish them,0.392243326
and she would say,0.341635406
would you,0.731934905
and then she wouldnt be able to to finish the sentence,0.312449664
so it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted us to do,0.363061965
but we didnt really know what to do,0.442032129
so the only thing my sister and I did was we just smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf,0.268634886
so we talked slowly and loudly,0.313127309
and we always had a big smile on our faces,0.26864174
and we just showed her that we cared,0.368058264
and we would always read her mail to her,0.320096761
and we knew two favorite people of hers,0.258352101
so we would always read those more than once,0.407786608
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her,0.334883362
okay throat when I was working for this man he was the he was a member of YoungPresidentsOrganization,0.246614397
and it was made up of presidents from around the world,0.301225513
and they had a not a seminar but a they called it a university,0.34786132
and it was ke a week long,0.241006166
and it would always be one would be in the UnitedStates,0.335687608
and the second one of the year would be outside the UnitedStates,0.379535466
and this year it was going to be in SanFrancisco,0.283862919
and itll be twenty years ago next month,0.220901325
and my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening,0.319095314
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did alot of the background work,0.255194217
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working week,0.215452895
and so Don stayed here,0.27651006
and my sister from Dallas flew in,0.228875592
and that was the week that they had the SanFrancisco earthquake,0.400323182
and so we were at FishermansWharf because that was our one evening that we had free,0.311904311
and we were waiting to go on the trolley cart back to SaintFrancis the WestinSaintFrancis,0.28317371
and as were waiting in line the earthquake hit,0.311023295
and its really funny because weve never been in anything like that,0.332021266
and so my sister just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down,0.285121411
and she said,0.380783647
that was probably a two or three,0.346957296
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didnt know,0.252109766
but that was just her way of saying its a minor thing,0.324193597
well the electricity was off so nothing worked,0.298298299
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel,0.275053471
and in SanFrancisco youknow its pretty hilly,0.255802482
and so Imean it was it was quite a jog back there,0.325313896
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel,0.309318006
so we sat outside this big park area for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in,0.233315736
and the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was,0.292713225
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there,0.349946886
and we wanted to also call our two husbands,0.3210558
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news,0.24656707
she doesnt like to hear the bad news,0.244585395
and theres hardly any good news thats told,0.290108353
so we knew that she probably wouldnt be watching and know,0.347896934
but my sister said,0.35679841
mother what are you doing,0.438462675
and she said,0.380783647
well Im watching the news because soandso told me that there was a big earthquake in SanFrancisco,0.222774461
so this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco,0.209841236
so it was alotof fear at the beginning,0.252536952
we were on the nineteenth floor,0.287153572
so we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor,0.269868553
and then walk down with our luggage,0.331697673
so it was just the fear of the unknown,0.330857724
and not knowing if were gonna be able to fly out because maybe the the airline canceled the flight or whatever,0.266396314
but both of our flights were fine,0.314415395
and we made it home okay,0.299339384
and our families were okay,0.339850843
www,1.000000119
okay,0.99999994
first of all it looks like there has been a weather change,0.305157244
and so whatever the girl was doing at the beginning I would say she was,0.263824433
I cant tell if its a young girl or if its a young lady,0.206756204
so Im whatever she was doing I think its,0.292722404
she was riding her bicycle,0.386822194
Im going to say its a young girl riding a bicycle,0.213719845
and she the weather came up quickly,0.33972159
and it looks like it is flooding the roadway,0.327930868
and perhaps she was Im just gonna say a on a bicycle,0.187549159
and so it washed her haway,0.369665831
and shes very frightened and concerned and scared and all other emotions negative emotions,0.408088863
and this one,0.527400732
it might be a firefighter or whatever rescuer is coming,0.299708724
it looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb,0.266675085
and he is hes got his lifejacket on,0.207400948
and so he is coming to rescue the little girl,0.272006691
and being that hes a professional rescuer of one way or another,0.288959891
the family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land,0.281024069
www,1.000000119
okay,0.99999994
this young boy is practicing soccer,0.304354787
and as happens most of the time or many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood,0.304897159
whether its baseball or or golf or a soccer ball,0.293738574
it goes in a way that it shouldnt have gone,0.30131343
so hes kicking this soccer ball,0.283736318
and it accidently crashes through a window,0.380314648
Im going to say its a neighbors window,0.218098894
and allofasudden it,0.541534305
the neighbor is sitting in a chair,0.323034525
and this ball comes through,0.395801693
and knocks over a lamp,0.293813109
and then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window,0.317395687
and is looking outside the broken window to the young man,0.31662932
and being that its a neighbor I think that he knows that accidents do happen,0.334059864
and hes not happy what happened,0.309766471
but hes understandable understanding that it was just an accident,0.355050683
and is not going to be upset with the boy,0.251984954
but is just going to tell him,0.382897943
just be careful the next time,0.404883474
www,1.000000119
well little boy is is with his mom,0.271017402
and his mom is sortof insisting that he eventhough its not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast,0.282654285
and he should take this umbrella,0.322068423
theyd rather have the rain probably and play in the rain,0.312439978
but hes insisting that he does not wanna take the umbrella,0.273369193
so as hes walking,0.285662264
looks like to school because hes got a backpack on,0.236972615
it starts raining,0.504117072
its okay at the very beginning because its just drizzling,0.323286831
but then allofasudden it is really coming down,0.425379932
so hes you can see the puddles on the ground,0.241448238
so hes trying to cover his head with his hand,0.273017049
and hes turned around to go back home,0.272120029
and he comes in,0.346104026
and hes very sad because hes soaked,0.235006988
and his mother looks at him,0.326874614
and is disappointed that he didnt take the umbrella,0.246289104
but now he realizes that his mother was right,0.398612082
and he shouldve taken the umbrella,0.278427601
and he goes out using the umbrella,0.277958959
and though its pouring down rain hes now keeping dry,0.271250725
okay the story of Cinderella,0.270743728
Ive forgotten some of it but anyway,0.359103024
its a story of a family that has mother that has three daughters,0.336185306
two seem to be mean sisters to their one sister who is Cinderella,0.249787375
they always have fun,0.517913699
and they dress up,0.389589667
they go places,0.510485649

the prince has invited everybody to come to the ball,0.315032303
and so theyre all excited because theyre gonna go to the ball,0.269773215
well Cinderella gets dressed,0.345381796
and her sisters get dressed,0.364663631
and they take some of their things that she was going to wear for themselves,0.340442777
and so now Cinderella really doesnt wanna go because she doesnt look pretty,0.28037709
and so the other two sisters go to the ball,0.314301074
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother comes,0.380225301
and says,0.503794968
youre going to the ball,0.350331515
and waves her magic wand,0.412653208
and Cinderella looks beautiful,0.41313231
and so she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball,0.29398948
and she has on beautiful silver slippers,0.260301083
and so allofasudden she gets to the ball,0.30357632
and the prince dances with her,0.433116317
and she says allofasudden its midnight,0.287187457
and if she doesnt get out by midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin,0.20066008
so she runs away from the prince,0.276492596
and gets into the carriage,0.406341553
and somehow she lost her one shoe,0.319702864
the prince finds the shoe,0.379849046
and they try to find the person that this shoe fits,0.337072402
and he has help,0.356088609
other people are helping him,0.435456693

and one of the assistant project managers for the general contractor had a bad lisp,0.323782474
and he was very hard to understand,0.342323035
and if he got excited he would even have a harder time,0.31256178
so it was very difficult,0.477153689
but if you were very nice and talked calmly he would calm down,0.292429
and you could you were able ta,0.354815573
but you hadta be very patient and very caring with him to do that,0.370734632
it was hard,0.461687297
it was a cold,0.38922134
it was night,0.457939953
it was winter,0.439004779
and it was raining,0.403862447

and all of sudden the lightning started crashing nearby,0.371889412
and I couldnt move fast enough because of that lightning striking so close by,0.294157714
it was very scary,0.426712573
Leah,0.99999994
and it was one of the monsoons,0.33459869
and it was a torrential downpour,0.308616161
and suddenly she got caught in one of these washes that were full,0.251374513
and it was rushing so fast that she was the car was swamped,0.290127277

once upon a time back in the good old days Cinderella lived with her father,0.243046135
and nder Cinderellas father met this lady that had two daughters,0.25127992
and they moved in with Cinderella and her dad,0.285810858
and they werent nice,0.300128162
they didnt like Cinderella at all,0.260955334
and they kindof made her into a a a maid sorta,0.301231563
to take care of the dogs and the horses and the cats and everything,0.365573585
and to be kindof a maid for the ugly two mean ladies mean daughters,0.217516512
and Cinderella would look at the castle,0.278639764
and dream and think of her PrinceCharming,0.355435967
and in that castle they decided to have a ball to see if they could find a girlfriend for the for PrinceCharming,0.290581852
so they sent out invitations,0.352645278
and they Cinderella got one,0.300388068
but their her stepsisters wouldnt let her go,0.313374758
they were gonna go instead,0.301839083
but Cinderella called on a fairy godmother,0.290792286
and she dressed Cinderella just so beautiful,0.353571326
and the mice and the birds all helped,0.403790236
and Cinderella looked beautiful in her glass slippers,0.270702362
and but the fairy godmother says,0.342403024
you better be careful because at midnight all this goes away,0.327948421
you you go back to being Cinderella,0.346360058
so you hafta get everything done by midnight,0.252206862
so sure enough she met PrinceCharming,0.381692439
and PrinceCharming just went head over heels over this lovely Cinderella with,0.279224485
and they danced,0.485165179
and they danced,0.485165179
and they danced,0.485165179
and bango twelve oclock came,0.255927891
and Cinderella hadta run and leave because shed turn back to whatever she was before,0.29848218
and she was afraid PrinceCharming would not like that,0.375259161
so she ran away,0.348366708
and as she was running away she drops one of her glass slippers,0.227877602
and leaves it laying there,0.434879899
but she goes back,0.423621327
and suddenly she becomes Cinderella again,0.360904336
and the PrinceCharming is so sad that his lovely Cinderella was gone and he couldnt find her,0.210621476
so he assigns a bunch of people with,0.24704586
and try on this glass slipper to find the girl that it fit,0.273461431
and so first he went and went,0.337966323
and they searched and searched and couldnt go,0.350208551
and they went to Cinderellas house,0.317275971
and they tried the glass slipper on both of his,0.295020461
and they tried,0.515791118
and it didnt fit,0.291025847
and they saw Cinderella over there in the corner,0.292017251
and they said,0.43198812
come over,0.587604523
so she goes over there,0.365643144
and it fits,0.372495621
and everything goes great,0.448062122
PrinceCharming is happy,0.498037875
Cinderellas happy,0.566355705
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
smack Ill get two slices of bread,0.210893437
preferably whole wheat,0.571774065
because thats the most healthy,0.431068271
and a jar of peanut butter,0.316169262
I will get a knife to spread the peanut butter,0.256533593
and I will also get a knife to spread the jelly along with the jar of jelly,0.228301898
I will first put the peanut butter on one slic,0.253457904
I will either put,0.394555837
well it looks like the little girls kitten got stuck up in a tree,0.251413316
and dad went up to help her out and get it down,0.270888358
and then he got stuck in the tree,0.275067747
so they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down outof the tree,0.250797451
okay Im going to tell you about the time that I had cancer and began my treatment,0.238813713
I was thirty seven years old,0.339217842
an,1
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my,0.282927066
I had a modified radical mastectomy,0.310278416
a,1.000000119
so within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo,0.259889036
smack they worry alot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects ofcourse,0.283372641
so I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two,0.233206317
I did not,0.573614836
and so after that first initial treatment,0.423374653
they told me not to eat lightly on the days of my treatment,0.21326749
throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat normally,0.305415958
and,1
so evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses,0.264299482
smack the person that I that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the conditions getting worse is my husbands mother,0.2689147
smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have,0.255105317
so it did affect her ability to communicate because she cant hear what youre saying to her most of the time,0.263437241
smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her,0.182839066
speak directly to her,0.421033084
I think shes become very adept at reading lips and figuring out what youre saying without hearing it,0.244614303
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation,0.264921308
so that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad,0.315950096
she now has the beginnings of basically Alzheimers of the dementia type,0.329645097
smack so,0.567579687
and you can see her now and see her again in thirty minutes and she wont remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually as a normal rule,0.208935797
she does recognize us youknow and is able to communicate,0.273836076
but basically,0.793174922
otherwise youre youre having to repeat everything so many times,0.3735677
you dont know if shes heard you or not,0.351385385
so thats about all you can do with that,0.378660202
is just make sure you have,0.438705802
well let me think,0.434310615
lots of them,0.426432401
but how frightened or how scared,0.436185211
thats the trick,0.370988965
okay I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young girl,0.283766091
and throat my parents had a v we lived on a farm,0.191373825
and my sister and I slept in the bedroom that was farthest,0.253656715
and between the main part of the house and our bedroom was a long,0.342624962
so at night when we would go to bed we had,0.300426781
and I would lay there and try to go to sleep,0.319496691
but then I would go to sleep,0.412011594
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the stairs,0.311706215
and since the,0.589556217
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was next to the main part of the house,0.27059871
and there was no way to get there except going by,0.293217927
smack so I I lived several years in fear,0.217683479
I,1
and eventually the we,0.520809948
and,1
and,1
so I hadta sleep next to the door,0.309151173
and I hadta protect my little sister,0.330744803
so that was probably the most frightened that I ever was that I can remember,0.390008569
okay,0.99999994
this girl has fallen into the river from somewhere,0.30275628
Im not sure if shes had a car accident and got outof the car or if she just fell into the river or the was walking swimming in the river and it swept her away,0.189560547
it looks like theres a rescue person,0.31727767
I dont know if its a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the limb to try to get her outof the water,0.18784605
at this point I think hes talking to her trying to get her outof the water,0.233380958
and she has her head outof the water,0.272741377
so Im assuming shes not in the process of being sucked down,0.216149136
I think theyre trying to figure out a way to f safely get both of them back to shore,0.284011275
okay,0.99999994
smack son is out playing soccer in the yard practicing kicking his ball,0.208542868
it accidentally goes astray and breaks,0.405478507
his father surprised gets up picks up the ball looks out and sees the son,0.246336699
fathers standing there remembering his days of youth when he accidentally hit a baseball into his parents window,0.268335462
okay,0.99999994
throat moms trying to get her son to take an umbrella to school because as you can see its raining outside or its dark outside,0.217648357
son says,0.584144831
no Mom dont need it,0.353966355
dont need it,0.48367995
Ill be fine,0.337402701
dont worry,0.569102943
son starts walking to school,0.315191716
the rain starts coming,0.461219579
hes getting soaking wet,0.332927942
he runs back home stands by mom looking forlorn and says,0.198618501
okay Ill take the umbrella,0.261140913
she gives him him the umbrella,0.343699157
he gets some dry clothes on and starts back off to school in a much happier mood,0.2254031
okay,0.99999994
a father throat smack met a woman that he liked,0.271717697
they got married,0.408730835
and he had a daughter by previous wife,0.308904767
and she had two daughters by previous husband,0.349026322
the stepmother to his daughter didnt want her in the sa,0.240036562
so basically turned her into a scullery maid to do housework,0.2287056
the father along the way had after a few years had died in the meantime,0.303025723
so mom really took that to extremes and basically turned her into a servant to wait on her and the two sisters,0.264117002
smack smack it came about that the king and queen had a son,0.225820526
a prince if you will who was celebrating his twenty first birthday,0.247508824
and they decided to have a huge ball and invite all of the eligible girls in the country to come to the ball,0.297201663
so naturally the stepmother of Cinderella who was by then given this name by her mother and sisters since since she tended all the cinders from the fireplace smack to come to this ball,0.247602835
mom decided that her daughters were going and wearing the finest clothes possible,0.285410851
so she got them their gowns and got them all set up to go,0.273648173
Cinderella was very sad because she couldnt go,0.243402347
and she really wanted to go,0.368723094
she never got to do anything,0.401154399
she happened to stumble upon some clothes in an old chest and found that she actually had some friends in the in the animal kingdom that came to her rescue and helped her make a beautiful ball gown,0.238810614
smack she also had a fairy godmother that she never knew about who suddenly appeared and helped make everything right sothat Cinderella could go to the ball,0.247693673
she had a beautiful gown,0.325741202
she had a coach to ride in with footmen and everything that she needed,0.261944711
the only stipulation was she hadta be home by midnight because everything would go back to what it had been before,0.298973858
smack so Cinderella went to the ball was having a wonderful time and forgot about the time until she heard the clock striking midnight,0.236343384
she ran down the stairs to try to get away and in the process lost one of her slippers which was a beautiful glass slipper,0.204837188
smack she did make it home on her own,0.263058007
and noone ever found out,0.307705194
but in the meantime the prince had become so smitten with this beautiful girl at the ball that he was determined to find out who lost their glass slipper on his staircase,0.230498955
so he went door to door in the country with his helpers trying to find who,0.261093855
noones had so far,0.468130171
but when he came to the home of Cinderella her two sisters ofcourse hadta try it on,0.238587171
and Cinderella happened to overhear smack a,0.22738044
and the prince had found his princess,0.401262045
and they got married and lived happily ever after,0.303366333
girls cat went up a tree,0.268517822
her dad went up to get the cat,0.234790623
the dad got stuck,0.333294034
the fire department hadta come and get them both out,0.358210474
get out the bread,0.38637796
you put it on a plate,0.322430283

ke I had flu symptoms,0.293744415
I started throwing up,0.391950548
I got a plane,0.365720838
flew it crosscountry,0.405001819
thought I was better,0.449634284

strep throat feeling,0.585144758
fever,0.99999994
chills went on for days,0.297434896
started to get better again,0.429708481
developed a cough,0.473177373
went to the doctor,0.36630547
he said it was a respiratory inspection,0.300162315
I have an uncle whos from rural Appalachia,0.187495708
and he has no teeth,0.289957285
and he has a thick thick accent,0.314647049
and chews chewing tobacco,0.481018096
and when he speaks it sounds like a long slur of almost vowels when he mumbles,0.273836195
its almost impossible to discern what hes saying,0.323817134
you just hafta listen really intently,0.426778674
Im kindof useta the accent,0.273563921
if youre not useta the accent,0.347488165
youre not familiar with it,0.377181411
between the lack of teeth,0.377506703
so I was river rafting in West Virginia,0.222997233
and theres this part when you get outof a raft and jump into a hydro,0.235699981
which is like a whirlpool that sucks you to the bottom,0.281652242
if you jump into the whirlpool,0.299564093
even with the lifejacket on,0.365234613
itll suck you down to the bottom of the river,0.259258121
normally it spits you up five to ten feet after it sucks you down,0.265221745
if you hit if just perfectly you can ride the hydro the entire length of the hydro,0.282954007
and it takes you up about fifty feet,0.264955103
well I was about the fifth person to do it,0.264615715
the first four people jumped in and popped up ten feet later,0.249098837
I jumped in,0.312713087
hit it perfect,0.419008732
and it carried me down to the bottom,0.313711643
dragged me along,0.359893411
started to pop me up about ten feet,0.222734034
and sucked me back down,0.37702927
an,1

slept all day Sunday,0.368029773
a,1.000000119
went to work Monda,0.340763092
and then still kindof felt tired the rest of the rest of the week,0.351225823
and that was swine flu,0.314163864
so it wasnt as traumatic as I thought it would be,0.317978978
but still felt like crap,0.447607964
frightened or scared,0.54125309
ERROR,1
and this is why probably I pass out when I have blood tests,0.303115249
when I was five,0.362102568
and that was actually the second from last time was in the hospital,0.376474947
I was six was the last time I was in the hospital,0.305231273
when I was five I went to the hospital for an eye operation,0.223555148
look in the camera,0.37111038
anyway thee,0.564766645
who youknow asked the questions,0.295644939
and then she said,0.389076203
were gonna poke your finger,0.274072021
and take a blood test,0.346033514
and she reached around her neck,0.325325102
and attached to the cross was a needle,0.357530177
and she rubbed it with alcohol,0.353241324
and jabbed,0.440359056
and then took,0.488411009
and I just thought youknow thinking back,0.424370438
that is the most bizarre thing that can ever happen,0.392515868
Imean it can turn you off to,0.384438276
so theres my fear story,0.31967482
since that day I do not do blood tests,0.320999652
I havent had a blood test since I think I was six,0.256053954
yup my mom,0.498093009
she had CBGD I think it is,0.384706646
well it was progressive,0.432132781
she started out she said she noticed it when she was ke in her mid forties,0.272138
she was ke an office manager secretary and,0.267465472
but youknow whatever,0.538119972
she just kindof got on with it,0.348270953
and over over time she just kindof talked a little bit slower,0.336814165
and would use youknow shorter sentences,0.30725494
and course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic,0.274467289
so,0.99999994
but eventually youknow it was,0.399443895
they didnt really diagnosis it for awhile,0.347306132
and then she went to UniversityofMichigan where they have this neurology or aphasia center,0.313662499
some type of where they do alotof research in it,0.279464155
thing is she didnt like the doctor,0.263661385
and she told him to fuck off,0.26561299
so didnt really get the whole research thing on it,0.31252268
but over time she youknow just got less and less communicative,0.325926393
they thought she was having mini strokes for awhile,0.304488957
a,1.000000119
it was actually the evening of her sisters funeral,0.32609117
they went out to dinner,0.358624637
and she passed out,0.35515663
and they rushed her to the hospital,0.38395071
and the doctor,0.485611379
well the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital,0.358413279
after she woke up that evening she was talking perfectly normal,0.297392279
Imean it it youknow had gone away,0.370055765
she could full sentences and as if if shed nothing happened,0.29128921
ke take,0.469728947
she went to bed that night,0.338835925
she woke up,0.375359923
and then she was back to where she was before it happened,0.374274641
so noone could figure that one out,0.349960327
but meanwhile the doctor pulled her drivers license because she passed out,0.316312462
and youknow considered a seizure or something,0.303975523
and that really pissed her off,0.358476192
then she took her my dad hadta take away the keys,0.282167941
she actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up,0.281838745
and we actually kept her car until she died,0.265602052
she we couldnt sell her car because youknow,0.271186501
when you get better Mom you can have your car back,0.371728569
but eventually she ended up losing muscle control,0.333037555
and youknow she was working with a walker,0.251688987
and then within a year after that she was in a wheelchair,0.316341668
she was in the nursing home for about the last year and a half,0.288327813
and when she went in the nursing home she could still speak three or four sentence or three or four word sentences,0.255051225
and towards the end she could get youknow one or two words out,0.239078313
but the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time,0.298810959
and then eventually she died,0.432814598
she just decided she was not gonna eat,0.287313253
and she didnt eat,0.258928984
and the last that was it,0.399041861
up no its its youknow kindof brought the whole family together,0.274349064
Imean theres funny stories about it,0.373264015
I knew she had decided not to eat,0.332336247
and youknow ke one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge massive breakfast because she useta love to eat,0.208396733
and youknow we hadta tell her,0.296979815
nope Jeans decided shes not eating today,0.188536912
so Imean it was all kinds of stories about it,0.327424616
but so thats my story about that,0.391795844

and and her evil stepmother had two other daughters,0.389123738
and the evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but didnt like Cinderella,0.286462128

and allofasudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty gown ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking,0.238917574
and then they go out in the garden,0.336461306
and they dig up a pumpkin,0.254079252
and she kindof does the pumpkin,0.292507529
and turns the pumpkin into a carriage,0.334310263
and then she turns the nasty old horse theyve got in the barn into these really cool horses that pulls the h carriage,0.224976808
and because you hafta pull up the castle in a carriage or they wont let you into the ball,0.205409855
so anyways they get into the h she gets into the pumpkin,0.262487054
and the fairy godmother even put some ke air freshener in there so it didnt smell like a pumpkin,0.21925801
and they went to the ball,0.364615798
and they got to the castle,0.352865726
and they were able to sneak in,0.320998669

anyways the prince comes in,0.323865443
and youknow they have the dance,0.347759068
and theyre all dancing around,0.396006912
and he sees Cinderella kindof hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says,0.259863704

but she doesnt really know that the stepmother the fairy godmother put a spell on the shoes,0.259564102
so anyone in the shoes can ke dance like magic,0.234186321
ke and on top of that the shoes will only fit Cinderella,0.213968903
so ke Cinderella dances really well,0.311573625

except for the shoes for some reason but they never told her that,0.344804406
but the pumpkin turns into a pumpkin,0.31580621
and the horse turns into an ugly horse,0.276849568
and the dress turns into rags at midnight,0.255504549
and the clock starts chiming so they go running away,0.321817428
or she runs the downstairs,0.274366498
and runs home,0.452321738
and she gets ke around the corner just in time when all her clothes turn to rags,0.251657814

and then the mom even or the stepmom even tries to try them on,0.297300249
and course her feet have got big corns so she cant try them on,0.218760967
then Cinderella shes ke hiding in the back,0.23832792

so just shut up,0.447196007
so Cinderella tries the schipper,0.3141734
and then when she turns the slipper on,0.349136621

okay lets well lets see if we can throw some humor into this tragedy here,0.279635102
we had oh it looks like we had two people that were going for a drive,0.258260071
and they saw a wash,0.275057286
and they decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it,0.323649049
because theyre really cool,0.457052082
and they can do these things,0.476547569
and ofcourse the four wheel drive got run over,0.307222247
and they got washed off the truck and into the flood,0.315550238
and fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck,0.322961122
so they grab that on,0.386015773
and it ooks,0.541534305
and she is holding on to him,0.290132225
and hopefully the police are gonna come and rescue them,0.279615521
or it could be that this guys actually a fireman trying to rescue her,0.329748958
and she was the one that drove the truck into the wash,0.297341466
cant say for sure but,0.310042024
looks like theyre hanging on to the tree,0.288298905
and youknow maybe theyre going to make it maybe theyre not,0.343492597
but well lets assume that they do,0.409900188
they do make it,0.53683871
and they Sheriff Joe arrests them for five thousand dollar fine for doing the stupid driver law,0.21070379
driving through a middle of a wash,0.342785269
but after that they live happily ever after,0.419665426
okay it looks like,0.510781527
lets get a name for this stupid looking kid here,0.275550961
Reginald,1
Reginald decides hes gonna go out to play,0.192036688
so he goes out in the front garden,0.263645679
and hes playing with his football,0.308442682
soccers what they call it in America,0.325936615
and hes not very skilled because hes an American,0.261764735
and hes not ke British or German or anything,0.225989208
and he kicks it in the window of his neighbor,0.254820883
and kids actually pretty,0.456215084
well doesnt dont see the kid anywhere,0.277237833
looks like the kid ran away,0.277194858
so looks like the neighbors really pissed off because the window it not only came through his window,0.309236735
broke his lamp,0.376355588
and hes looking out the window to seeing if the kid is going to confess up to it or run away,0.232744932
and well we just dont know what happened,0.371505141
whether that happened,0.65337193
lets assume the worst,0.314642608
and lets say that the,0.328363121
and stecide,1
and calls the cop in,0.301366091
lets get Sheriff Joe in this again,0.177436247
and the kid come,0.339151502
Sheriff Doe,0.728050292
turns out the kids an illegal immigrant and gets deported,0.241709352
lifes hard but thats it is,0.388308465
well it looks like,0.499275565
oh lets get a kid for this name for this stupid looking little kid here,0.265664548
oh well name him after my nephew Eric,0.18996051
looks like Eric is gonna go to school,0.187692031
and his mom ofcourse is saying,0.266162038
you know what,0.707741976
I think its time that you take the umbrella,0.337190509
because Im guessing its gonna rain out,0.231940091
and he says,0.357835323
no Mom I dont want the umbrella,0.253643453
anyways somehow he gets outof the house,0.305751383
mom forces him to take the umbrella,0.2768327
but then he hides it underneath the the the car,0.395998269
and he goes off to school,0.275848746
and guess what,0.4427706
ofcourse mom is right,0.354480803
and it starts raining,0.436297894
and so he kindof ke gets halfway to school,0.224994868
and then he comes running home to mom crying because hes all wet,0.262229323
and mom kindof gives him a lecture,0.269294471
and doesnt let him have,0.290861011
youknow she actually reaches into his backpack and takes out the brownie shed given him take for dessert at lunch and says,0.198368892
no you cant have any brownies you naughty little kid,0.320482135
and gives him the umbrella,0.347108305
and makes him go back to school,0.303044111
and poor Eric then hasta go to school without any brownies because he didnt listen,0.199495852
h,0.99999994
and wouldnt come down,0.318168908
and so the man climbed up the tree to help,0.279034168
and I guess sothat then the man couldnt come down,0.28537935
so somebody call the fire department,0.339212447
fire departments gonna rescue everybody,0.292999059
okay I guess the reason the mans up in the tree is because the ladder fell down,0.243766263
take a slice of bread,0.337408662
an,1
and I put jelly on it,0.262204319
and enjoy all the grease and sugar you shouldnt have,0.320083499
Id had atrial fribulation,0.314951897
and during those times I got real dizzy and hadta get down in a hurry so I wouldnt fall down,0.221623138
and and a bright light appeared under my eyes,0.323750347
and I couldnt detect any pulse,0.300586998
so I knew my heart had stopped,0.377197742
so I performed a cardial,0.326819032
or defribrulated,1
I learned how in MensHealthMagazine,0.354404122
and I saved my life several times doing that,0.313187689
because this is a recurring problem with yi me,0.291684091
and the last time I had atrial fibrillation was Sunday morning,0.297974318
and it was so bad I couldnt,0.304117262
so I woke up my wife,0.321163535
shes a very sound sleeper,0.341112971
I woke her up and told her,0.273848951
and she come running around and pounced on it about a dozen times leal,0.282583654
and I knew to every time she come down I exhale,0.306507885
because it works better if my lungs are empty when she pumps my heart,0.288275719
and that brought me around real quick,0.354898363
so I dont think Ill ever let my wife travel without me from now on,0.232041448
shes the only shes the best defibrillator Ive got,0.237632215
the scariest thing I had ever had is when I I couldnt get my heart restarted,0.28176862
when I got arrhythmia youknow I can feel the,0.28300792
and they come more frequently than say two beats a second or something like that,0.304375708
and but when when you have atrial fibulation,0.460228354
whats happened was that your pump esn your heart doesnt pump blood,0.260557622
it just flutters,0.602554083
yes,0.999999881
my wife has a seventy percent hearing loss,0.233383611
she doesnt wear a hearing aid because its uncomfortable,0.26792264
and she should,0.462645531
she got no excuse,0.386847377
youknow I I go to SamsClub,0.441552967
I buy her a whole cart full,0.277170181
twenty four for twelve ninety five,0.669242144
and a battery lasts about three or four days,0.28668052
oh the rescuer and a girl about to be rescued is trapped in some brush in a swift swift water flood water,0.201203406
thats what you call a swift water rescue,0.274910122
the man in the flotation jacket is trying to rescue her,0.261600256
and it looks like theyre both in trouble,0.309001267
tangled up in the brush,0.324527383
trapped by the brush in a swift current,0.259223104
well a man a boy has kicked soccer ball through a window,0.255411744
the soccer ball nen,0.300177962
knocks it off the table,0.350830793
the man is getting outof his easy chair,0.219400272
and holding the soccer ball to see where it came from,0.279311299
I guess looking out the broken window,0.324775457
oh the boy wants to go out,0.229833543
and its raining out,0.46555993
so the mothers giving the boy an umbrella,0.276275158
s,1.000000119
he doesnt think its raining hard enough,0.299127758
e then it starts raining harder,0.360741168
and he comes in,0.346104026
all soaking wet,0.567284465
now hes went went to school again with a backpack on his back,0.239589989
this time hes happy because hes got an umbrella,0.241440251
well Cinderella was a beautiful young woman,0.338426054
single woman,0.56325078
that lived with her mother,0.433996737
and her single sisters that were not so pretty,0.338154554
the nicest way I could say it,0.363894165
and Cinderella wanted to go out dancing,0.288167357
but she didnt have a way to get there I guess,0.322914064
so her fairy godmother come to the rescue,0.308857471
and presented her with a carriage pulled by white horses,0.30787015
and to take her to the palace,0.400503516
where the prince was having a party,0.414012909
she was the belle of the ball,0.302010745
and but she hadta leave because she hadta be her fairy godmother told her she hadta be back home by midnight,0.307993054
or her carriage would turn into a pumpkin,0.281942844
and well she had a beautiful time at the party,0.296319991
and when it was midnight she hadta jump out in her she jumped out in her carriage,0.284136295
and it was taken home,0.32054615
shoon,0
and her carriage turned into a pumpkin,0.308231264
and so she went home,0.341678977
but when she ran outof the palace she lost one of her slippers,0.222981855
and some time later a knock on the door came,0.275074929
and here was the prince come to try the slipper on her foot,0.258918077
and her foot was the only one that fit,0.324406981
it wouldnt fit her,0.333383679
so so he wanted her as a i bride,0.310248524
so she,0.650917053
and her and the prince lived happily ever after,0.354216456
smack well at our house we take the bread outof the freezer,0.213060617
and toast the bread,0.444646895
and then put about a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter,0.262147278
the chunky kind,0.408355743
on the peanut butter sandwich smack,0.301628292
on one side,0.495810926
then on the other side,0.477571189
and smooth it clear across,0.403139919
and then we smack,0.337078989
the two pieces of bread,0.381784558
cut it in half,0.335750401
and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts,0.205061629
but if were gonna eat it we eat it with the crust,0.263577044
thats about how to make a peanut butter sandwich,0.287240267
the dog and the cat were fighting,0.367608607
and the cat climbed up the tree,0.304385662
and the do,0.411021978
and the little girl happened upon the scene,0.350224197
and realized that the cat was in the tree and shes gonna need her dad,0.203825608
so she got her dad,0.429161757
and her dad got the ladder,0.264250427
and they were trying to get the cat outof the tree,0.257747352
but the ladder fell down,0.358130068
but just in the nick of time the firemen who were called by the neighbors came,0.288693607
and helped get the cat and the dad outof the tree,0.241753072
smack,0.999999821
well yes I remember being hospitalized,0.35354358
the most recent one was in NewYorkCity,0.399038851
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at RooseveltHospital,0.293283552
and my right lung had filled up with fluid,0.286269069
and so they kept me,0.374771476
I realized how important it is to have someone with you when youre in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked,0.302580357
the towels were like sandpaper,0.324155301
you were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower,0.25628075
they didnt come,0.43831563
so I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel,0.231258988
I have veins that are very difficult to get blood,0.336725265
so Id always say kiddingly to the people,0.317428648
are ya really good at this,0.275436312
and one man named JoeL told me,0.25186497
hed hed shay,0.359251678
Ive,0.622671366
after about twenty pokes in my hand I said,0.21612078
could you find someone else to draw blood because were not getting it done here,0.371026605
and smack it was really all I could do to get better so I could get outof the place,0.291123331
because its too bad that the staff is so overworked,0.335925758
and probably underpaid,0.584939063
and that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need,0.429332346
I could also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night,0.265956223
ofcourse I wasnt breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things,0.300880194
and she couldnt find the bathroom,0.267057508
so she just used whatever facilities she could find,0.353879154
and when I said something to the nurses that Id like to be moved they just said,0.282522321
well youll probably hafta go on with a cancer patient thats dying,0.21624437
so I was so unaccustomed to hospitals,0.367106497
and Im probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because Im going back to Iowa thinking,0.280768752
and I was sortof on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get outof there,0.274482191
so that was my experience,0.363405645
thats probably the worst experience Ive ever had in a hospital,0.277981639
because everything else is always been won done very well,0.335913152
it was crazy,0.413200051
if you know Roosevelt Hospital,0.292229742
and it just felt I did I did learn though,0.39315021
when I was at RooseveltHospital I was watching Jeopardy on television,0.23682338
and they ask,0.425428689
who was the first SupremeCourt justice,0.413886636
and I looked out the window,0.321980327
and I saw the school at FordhamUniversity,0.259864688
and the first SupremeCourt justice was named for the one that is named in that school as the law school,0.318846881
smack,0.999999821
smack Im not sure if I was frightened or scared in this situation,0.237535045
but I was frightened for my daughter,0.310584724
in September of net September two thousand six,0.314947009
on the nineteenth day,0.397217393
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom,0.250133067
that her husband had threatened to kill her,0.400407135
and within twenty hours I was in RomeItaly,0.28673172
and my husband and I decided that one of us should go to help her,0.280583322
and to help her with her husband,0.417419523
and I arrived hoping that I could do something to get them counseling whatever,0.373116583
within twenty four hours he had called the police of Rome,0.283673376
I was alone with him in the house,0.298824251
and I had no help,0.297505289
but I didnt know how to get ahold of my daughter,0.248351574
and the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail,0.264026493
and I immediately thought,0.453075767
smack wonder if I can take my pillow,0.314613909
or should I take my Sudoku game,0.289011747
because if I hafta sit in that police with the police in jail what am I going to do,0.217694059
so I sortof youknow,0.531885028
and then I started trying to call my daughters friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan,0.226357013
and I kept dialing,0.361675739
because I think when youre nervous you dial the wrong thing,0.376913577
I finally got ahold of my daughter,0.249567151
and she came,0.411018223
and we called the carabinieris,0.413750798
and the carabinieris,0.791413784
and Im not sure if I was afraid,0.28694272
I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail,0.302589148
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth to make it happen,0.303593725
and I since then we were trailed,0.345555484
our phone was tapped,0.30220446
the computer was oh the computer was compromised,0.347115755
we we wrote to each other sitting on the sofa,0.255049646
and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time,0.253949106
and Im not sure if I was really afraid,0.312104762
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening,0.421942353
but that was probably the most resourceful that I ever hadta be to protect my daughter and grandson,0.309068471
smack so Im not sure I share that with everyone,0.299193323
but if you wanna know when I was really drawn to action,0.330159038
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating,0.379020065
smack,0.999999821
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it,0.319446623
I think its not so much communicating it as it is understanding,0.368141592
because when I was in Italy trying to communicate with people I used my hands,0.271112591
I used any kind of framework I could think of,0.303298652
another language,0.653845668
smack to communicate with anybody,0.309132576
so I learned street Italian,0.312768787
smack I became pretty clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me,0.23054789
and I learned the words that I needed to use,0.349383354
but I think communication is so vital,0.371644735
and when you dont know the language of someone else its hard to communicate,0.27568087
do you want us to be creative with it,0.351878375
do whatever,0.720807433
well this could easily have happened in Iowa,0.320919514
the DesMoinesRiver was rising in nineteen ninety three,0.42585966
and also in two thousand eight,0.469773173
and people were warned not to be near the river,0.296587735
but people do that,0.55898267
and the water has an undertow,0.41904223
and it can catch,0.372240961
that could have happened in this picture,0.436891824
and police and fire and safety people go to great lengths to help those people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time,0.295815468
a,1.000000119
and maybe he was playing soccer with his friends,0.291969389
and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it,0.291122645
it went through the window,0.365459591
and the man was not so happy about it,0.311280549
because he was sitting there,0.449081719
and it knocked over his lamp,0.283666909
and then Im not sure what hes doing in the last picture,0.227899998
but hes looking at the window,0.261054188
the man is looking at the window,0.307745218
and it looks like hes holding something,0.324284852
but maybe hes making a telephone call,0.280518323
I dont know,0.538106382
well typically little boys and umbrellas dont really wanna,0.283391982
because the little boy would be much rather be much happier if he doesnt,0.316831559
but his mother says,0.424116969
you gotta take an umbrella,0.252320379
and at the last minute he said,0.251231641
and he runs outside,0.354135484
and hes in the rain,0.280063868
and hes not so happy,0.308377147
and he goes back home,0.340919495
and he says to mom,0.269746006
I guess,0.784920871
and then he takes the umbrella and leaves,0.357084692
once upon a time,0.438798368
there was a woman with two ugly girls,0.265541106
and a father with a beautiful daughter,0.399065286
and they got married the the man and the woman,0.341629893
so the families were united,0.407899469
and the wicked stepmother with her two daughters made the little girl,0.332751006
who was the fathers daughter,0.428299785
do the cooking and cleaning,0.419209361
and by the way her name was Cinderella,0.278292865
smack and she worked and she scrubbed,0.292206556
and she had so many things to do all day long,0.312732846
while the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do,0.344450206
but one night there was a special party that the prince was giving,0.358859003
because you see these girls have grown up,0.368572354
and they were teenagers and they were older,0.489823937
and the prince was looking for a princess,0.362114429
smack well the two ugly stepsisters they were getting dresses,0.263064295
and they were gonna get to go to the party,0.273518324
smack but the poor little stepdasister,0.364714891
so off,0.615341127
and two mice came and said to Cinderella,0.241373166
were gonna make it so you can go too,0.324322343
smack and Cinderella they did their magic,0.256741107
and Cinderella got a beautiful dress,0.298272491
and she got a carriage,0.324044406
and she took off,0.318801641
and she danced with the prince all night long,0.34627369
but as the the mice had told her,0.2951231
at the stroke of midnight you hafta be home,0.202664226
so at the stroke of midnight she realized she hadta leave,0.275857627
so she ran,0.368681073
and she ran away,0.310649216
and she left her shoe,0.352559358
and the prince found her shoe,0.336973131
and then she got back home,0.389439583
and they went a and the wicked s stepsisters came back,0.28931433
smack then the prince was looking for the owner of the shoe,0.267751843
so he went out all across,0.317807049
and trying on the shoe,0.356941402
and they came to Cinderellas house,0.321122527
and at Cinderellas house the wicked stepsisters were,0.293538958
and they tried and tried to wear the shoe,0.343212605
but Cinderella wasnt given the chance until at the last they saw Cinderella,0.222877353
and the shoe fit perfectly,0.397521824
and Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after,0.318710268
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the first thing you hafta do is go to the freezer and get the bread outof the freezer,0.221243232
and you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesnt dry out,0.289428055
and if theres only two of you in the house you dont go through a loaf of bread a day so its important to keep it fresh,0.2138291
so you keep the bread in the freezer,0.3192586
so ya go to the freezer,0.261206299

it was a fairly long phone call,0.303395301
I get a stiff neck,0.356256247

I,1
so I figured theres something wrong with the ear,0.30403176
my left ear is not hearing the way it should,0.30104357
anyway went to the ENT specialist,0.274644226
and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma smack which is a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull,0.225365475
we did some research,0.416899502
found a surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery,0.314414114

for the surgery itself smack first thing they do is shave,0.245484695
I had I got a haircut before I went out so it would be short so it wouldnt look like I had,0.300321817
I remember the prep,0.369306028

I didnt wake up and have consciousness until,0.246733934
they keep you out because they dont want you moving around,0.415992081
the surgery involves,0.48332417

the nice part about heading back was,0.319306016
and Id sit in the chair,0.212356061
and Id Id sit sothat that side of my head was,0.193146974
and my wife would go over to the ticket counter and shed say,0.235031754
my husbands had some brain surgery and hes not feeling very good,0.280222863
and is there any possibility that we could move up to first class,0.326083988
and everybody would take a look at me,0.282700688
we got moved up to first class on every flight,0.257653981
kindof neat,0.609436035
but my wife is clever and she does things like that,0.318287253
smack probably but I dont,0.407293916
click nothing comes to mind,0.352509767
I dont remember any specific incident,0.326418906
oh yeah okay,0.700946391
I was listening to,0.365508795
I ate Wheaties for years,0.226033211
Jack Armstrong was some place,0.298395246
I have no idea where he was,0.333001316
I dont remember that episode that well,0.320207596
smack but the neat thing about radio was that it allowed you to use your imagination,0.271371633
television takes away your imagination because you have both the video and the audio,0.327513635
but back in the heydays of radio only you had was the audio,0.262088656
and you could create,0.467380255
and Jack Armstrong was someplace,0.325881839
mighta been ke in SouthAmerica or CentralAmerica,0.274682492
and he was in a cave or a tunnel,0.275849462
and it was very frightening,0.430892915
and it just scared the beejeebers,0.412620813
and thats the last episode that I ever listened to,0.294082731
how old was I,0.315188825
I dont know,0.538106382
six seven someplace along in there maybe,0.353574604
thats thats the one incident I can think of that was a frightening incident,0.311342478
I was scared,0.474036753
smack frequently,0.404662848
no I just I just know that people in general seem to h alotof people have trouble communicating what they really mean,0.344660044
alotof times its clear that they know what theyre talking about but they cant find the right word to,0.298629284
smack try to ask questions to get it clarified,0.323889136
sometimes people get alittle short tempered because they want h,0.377263337
if I say to you youknow,0.432578892
well its right there,0.485477984
well where is there,0.467474997
well right there,0.619318247
okay,0.99999994
how far away,0.44843182
you hafta try to draw people out through to ask them some questions sothat they can identify what it is theyre talking about,0.304378957
mkay,1.000000119
Arizona has this thing they call what is the,0.309823692
the dumb driver law,0.302367508
anyway the law basically says if you drive into a gully or a wash after its rained and your car becomes stranded you gotta pay to have somebody come and pull you out,0.218879417
thats what this pictures about,0.457606465
we have a situation here where smack a girl has,0.284158319
theres alotof water,0.333445519
its a flood situation,0.436623842
theres alotof water moving,0.324102908
its moving rapidly,0.559109151
shes been washed downstream,0.294791371
shes gotten to a branch thats sticking up outof the water,0.215201423
shes managed to hang on there for a minute,0.209043294
and one of the guys paramedics or firemen threw on lifejacket,0.235985667
and hes jumped in,0.228141665
and hes gotten to where she is,0.25116533
hes gonna get a hold of her,0.178490669
and theyre gonna get her out okay,0.257172197
and hopefully she wasnt a dumb driver,0.219068378
probably since its a young girl it was probably an accident that she fell in,0.278811514
and were lucky that she got to the point where she could grab a hold of something,0.262459666
and somebody would know where she is and get the paramedics called,0.297370315
and they could get there and rescue her,0.365619093
so yeah I predict theyre gonna rescue her,0.247566134
and theyre both gonna be on the evening news,0.227596238
and hes gonna get an award,0.148205608
smack heres a nice young boy whos out playing soccer,0.18539694

ofcourse it starts sprinkling,0.466718793
now any normal kid would just go ahead and walk to school,0.282346576

Tommy turns around and comes running back to the house,0.30185926
comes in the house,0.41879791
moms mad,0.521111488
Tommys alittle crestfallen about this business,0.30651316
see kids smarter they just go on to school,0.316221386
and then they dry out,0.438504994
and it stops raining by the time it gets time to come home,0.298915684
but Tommy went back,0.358904183
so now moms angry with him,0.301324129
and shes in this I told you so mood,0.239259899
so she gives him the umbrella,0.28742364
and Tommy puts up the umbrella,0.227775231

and suddenly,0.572651625
and as the clock is striking midnight she hasta run away from the prince before he finds out that shes really just this poor girl from the other side of the tracks,0.243650526
but as shes running away one of the glass slippers comes off,0.221374154
so the prince follows up on this,0.3097893
and he spends the next several days going about the kingdom trying to find somebody whose foot will fit,0.239265278
and the two sisters try it on,0.288674146

and he wont,0.259709269
and the dog barking at the base of the tree isnt helping anything,0.265441418
and then the father got involved,0.391582817
and he said,0.372952074
I can climb up and get the cat for you,0.244887561
but he got up in the tree,0.268543333
and the branch started to wiggle and wobble,0.333245039
and he got scared,0.337912738
so the mother looking outof a window in the house probably called the fire truck to come and get the cat,0.257546663
smack well Ive never been really sick,0.310597777
Ive never broken a bone,0.317861676
havent been hospitalized,0.381938577
but I did have breast,0.446236372
that was I hafta remember,0.311883748
was first diagnosed in January,0.404818714
I think that was in ninety four,0.282137454
and the doctor did a lumpectomy,0.321755469
smack outpatient,0.451852262
and then they put me on they tested to see what all the what kind of cancer it is,0.275957495
so they put me on radiation,0.299677789
and first it was chemo,0.367905647
and then they gave me followup tests for different things,0.314690739
but nothing,0.770876288
so they followed me as far as exams went,0.247034267
and three years later I went to the radiologist,0.277639121
and in his examination he said,0.333079457
my goodness I feel a lump,0.361275733
its just where the other one was,0.404680163
so he was in the same building as the surgeon,0.309797794
so I they called up,0.359776139
and the surgeon could see me,0.295152485
so he looked at and he said,0.286583304
ohmygoodness,0
so I guess within three or four days I had a mastectomy,0.234389201
and that was outpatient,0.448356867
and what they decided to do after that was put me on smack oh its a drug they dont use any Tamoxifen,0.202137575
so I was on Tamoxifen for five years,0.224644437
and I was glad,0.330191731
and since then I have had no signs,0.337881804
and for awhile they thought it was in my lungs,0.284615695
and they did alotof testing,0.340117007
but it wasnt,0.402158439
and then they thought,0.57822901
oh its in my thyroid,0.23262091
and they had some complicated tests,0.456603795
but it wasnt,0.402158439
and I havent,0.349418491
smack well I guess I was most frightened once as a young mother when our three children all of the family were out in the yard doing things,0.221061751
and I looked up,0.339406669
and I said,0.329179674
wheres Jenny,0.293810785
and Jenny,0.446961761

she was in her car,0.355352581
and it was swep,0.414238811
but she was fortunate enough to escape,0.405634433
and a smack fireman or a policeman had been aware of the situations,0.273850173
and either was called or was lucky to be there with a vest on,0.24022679
and he used an overhanging limb to reach out to her,0.273677409
and smack his hands arent around her,0.251104802
but shes hanging tight to his muscled arm,0.273890734
and I think he will bring her ashore,0.271853417
smack the boy is out practicing his soccer kicks,0.191983014
but he doesnt have very good aim,0.309149921
or is it good aim,0.334011734
he might have wanted to do it,0.422343105
kicks the soccer ball right at the window,0.31425041
it breaks,0.612895608
it goes into the house,0.347999156
knocks over the lamp,0.338262826
and the man that is in the room where the ball comes in stands up,0.313501596
holds the ball,0.431584954
and looks out the window,0.378849059
ohboy that kid better run fast,0.363314092
smack looks like a child is going off to school,0.238621294

turns around and goes home,0.372923881
and hes unhappy,0.274729311
and the mothers unhappy,0.430997372
but she dries him off,0.426899403
gives him the umbrella,0.343919963
and off he goes happy and content,0.270270944
alright,0.999999881
in this kingdom there was a family who a mother died,0.310774803
and they had one child called Cinderella,0.304540753
father remarried and the stepmother had two daughters,0.425579488

well this happened to be a winter night,0.33082661
and it was snowy and slushy,0.311162263
and it was slippery,0.337620348
we were early for the movie,0.301226795
and so we were walking,0.375751108
and having fun,0.439942241
somebody lost their hat in the street,0.267823815

and I went to kick it,0.272968382
but I,0.708145022
my foot was right at the edge of the hat,0.245123848
so I,0.744185448
and I didnt realize it,0.345491856
but it didnt go anywhere because I was holding the hat,0.262487471
so the only one who went somewhere was me,0.310228735
so I went skidding,0.396244615
landed,0.99999994
ended up sitting with it in a,0.300801933
and its like,0.487039983

it was one of the first theme parks one of the first rides that I had ever been on,0.286496878
and my dad took me on this ride,0.229252279
and I I think it was one of those where theres the two rockets,0.270925969
I was actually little enough that I remember the feeling,0.431648135
but I dont remember the ride,0.314270288
but I think it was one of those rockets,0.323687792
one on either side,0.490175098
and theyre going around in circles,0.358968586
and all I remember was being so scared that I was just paralyzed,0.366467118

and after she had her stroke she did have a speech therapist but only for about six weeks,0.276807755
and after that she sortof tried to communicate,0.356415451

and alotof times in order to relieve my father inlaw,0.234936506
the rest of the family,0.519527376
just to keep youknow obviously she couldnt stay alone,0.330177426
smack so youknow just to give them a break from each other,0.276213259
and youknow I would look at her old picture books,0.219563305
and ask her questions,0.366678536
and she had a book of the history of the town that she grew up in,0.276747406
so I was asking her questions about it one day,0.314557314

so he takes her home,0.34604916
and they live happily ever after,0.380815953
the cats stuck in the tree,0.31303966
the dad tried to get the cat outof the tree,0.22292383
but he doesnt look like he was successful,0.285947502
and his ladder fell down,0.339990079
and the little girls standing under the cat crying,0.354086041
and the dogs barking at the man up the tree,0.315983981
and the firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder,0.347933531
and theres also a bird in the tree,0.307074875
well you take two slices of bread,0.300094306
and you put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other one,0.27686286
and you put them together,0.455715984
and that makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.333127767
well not on camera but Ive already told you that five years ago I had cancer,0.244970798
I had surgery,0.45632866
I had radiation,0.378040105
I had chemotherapy which lasted well into three months,0.276183784
all my hair fell out,0.319130212
it grew back in,0.334756792
my eyelashes didnt,0.372294545
but,1.000000119
actually my eyelashes came back,0.368114561
I lost thirty pounds,0.350946903
and that was not from being sick,0.359692872
because I was,0.493471086
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo,0.299086839
I I lost it because something in the chemotherapy gave me a very bad taste in my mouth,0.24188529
it tasted like I was chewing on pennies,0.262355328
you ever when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth and felt that taste,0.240862727
thats what everything tasted like to me no matter what it was,0.343858629
and so food just didnt really have much of an appeal,0.278880805
but Im diabetic so I hadta eat,0.351924509
but I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check,0.259749532
so I lost thirty pounds which was not a bad thing,0.252447188
I wish I coulda kept it off,0.388570547
unfortunately as I once we got the the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation,0.345612496
it took about two and a half years,0.262939751
but I gained all the weight back,0.343089432
and I go in two weeks back to my oncologist for my five year checkup,0.204463273
and at that time if all sims,0.30170691
so thats thats,0.473839253
yes,0.999999881
well lets see,0.42255798
when it came to to me probably the most frightening thing I ever had was when somebody somebody a PeepingTom was standing at my window,0.295821607
and I just happened to look up and stared him right in the eye,0.285105884
scared me to death,0.374549538
but on a even deeper level the thing that scared me the most I think,0.329502583
I lived in Japan,0.308767617
and my daughters were one and two,0.367268264
and I had them my husband was in the field and I had them both in high chairs,0.262502372
and I was making hot chocolate for them,0.274891585
and it was the kind where you put,0.321514547
and then you pour the hot water,0.327106595
and my oldest girl was not in a high chair,0.210221589
she was at the table,0.330139607
and I had the powder in both in the cups,0.28963092
and I went,0.34481588
and as I did she was so anxious she decided to get up at the table as,0.233987093
and her fingers hit the,0.335637659
and flipped the cup,0.351698697
and scared me to death,0.315612137
what scared me was she didnt cry,0.319621325
she rtun it was winter and she had,0.374684632
and I hurried up and got that off of her,0.259851754
and got in my car,0.261752009
and you couldnt call nineoneone then,0.345413715
its this is fifty years ago,0.280640513
so I got in my car to take her to the dispensary which was a good ways away,0.22529687
and I had my neighbor I gave the baby,0.263291657
and,1
and started to the s the dispensary,0.371318817
and as I went through the,0.325976729
and honked the horn like crazy,0.296851009
and he came over,0.377639413
and I told him what had happened,0.325344384
and he said,0.372952074
move over,0.585686862
and he got,0.346828729
and the guy in the jeep in the MP jeep led the way with his siren on,0.231456712
the other MP drove my car,0.22285527
and we went over to the base to the the to the dispensary,0.402010232
and they took her right in,0.350971609
and while I was sitting there she passed out I thought,0.326016665
and the doctor said to me,0.305382252
talk to her,0.423833787
keep talking to her,0.393323302
and so I kept talking,0.363399893
Marianne its Mommy,0.304486334
Marianne talk to me Marianne,0.315213203
and Id watch,0.278857321
the next day he told me that her heart s had stopped,0.243514702
that she had gone into shock,0.351860166
and that it was only,0.456428021
but it scared me,0.547850966
Imean I wasnt even aware of how bad it was,0.255197942
he didnt wanna tell me,0.376396596
I said to him the next day when I took her back to him,0.308332831
I said,0.525946558
why didnt you tell me what was happening,0.350591332
he said,0.528301835
because I didnt need two patients,0.30100438
I only needed one,0.487252831
and you were the only one,0.416645467
it was your voice was the only thing that was gonna bring her back,0.263474077
so thats probably,0.491890222
yes,0.999999881
I worked as a speech therapist I told you this in El Paso Texas at the cerebral palsy clinic there,0.177369773
and alot of the people that I worked with had,0.289635837
they were children for the most part,0.404540539
and I loved working with kids,0.35360983
so that was it was fun for me,0.308302104
but they had all different kinds of problems,0.41209352
ERROR,1
we didnt know at the time,0.272152543
the diagnosis wasnt thrown around like it is now because this was fifty years ago,0.237371489
and some of them were autistic,0.406088859
the one little girl had had spinal meningitis,0.331759483
and had was now blind,0.348082423
and had a hard time hearing,0.366049051
and couldnt,0.400141835
she was nine,0.448058814
but she they hadta start all over with her like she was a baby to teach her,0.297818899
and they said eventually she was gonna be okay,0.235123143
and I only worked with her for a year or so,0.248416275
I dont know but I did speech therapy with her,0.301352054
the one patient that they sent me to see,0.332781196
Imean I had no business doing any of this,0.315587163
I had no background,0.356294006
but they,0.782902479
and the one patient was a woman who had had a stroke,0.328890979
and had aphasia,0.452863693
and,1
and she was talking about her cake,0.292431414
but,1.000000119
and I dont think I accomplished a thing with her,0.280471146
I I really dont,0.554288268
but that was before they placed so much value on early work with stroke people,0.316297472
and I,0.451039851
otherthan that I had a daughter,0.341257513
I have a daughter who is has a genetic shes missing part of a chromosome,0.247136503
and didnt talk at all til she was about two and a half,0.174101651
never,1
and then started off very slowly,0.410165042
and now I cant shut her up,0.222144037
shes fifty five,0.34945184
and has the ntal,0.574404001
well its,0.63857317
she would test probably at about ten years old,0.255649656
she reads,0.493905008
shes a sports fanatic,0.303821743
but it it was a long time coming and working with her trying,0.335997373
to express herself in any way really was difficult,0.33664766
otherthan that I dont think so,0.422655225
its a picture of two people stuck in a flood,0.259719044
and hes hanging on for dear life to a,0.219866931
a tree limb,0.468106538
but he also seems to be wearing a lifevest,0.347696215
so maybe he is a paramedic or fireman or something,0.292097002
I see nothing like that on her,0.360683024
so I guess hes in there to rescue her,0.245632991
yeah I think thats about all I can tell you,0.373720974
I wouldnt wanna be either one of them thankyou,0.262090504
okay,0.99999994
the little boy is kicking a soccer ball around,0.287140399
and it goes through somebodys window,0.348964542
into a room where it knocks a lamp down,0.304765552
and theres a man sitting,0.326519608
and he gets up and looks out takes the ball and looks out the window,0.294484735
I dont really see theres an end to that story,0.263528198
he winds up with the ball,0.319509566
but Im sure it didnt end there,0.304429501
thats about the best I can tell you on that one,0.309202522
mkay,1.000000119

and he tells her,0.388891727
its not gonna rain,0.263047606
he doesnt want an umbrella,0.240372151
and he goes out,0.314507663
and pretty soon its raining,0.348105133
and he goes running home through the puddles with his hands trying to keep the water off his head,0.28920576
and shes standing there waiting for him because she knew hed be back or drown one or the other,0.254023522
and he goes off again with an umbrella,0.244239271
a man has a daughter,0.399709046
and apparently is a widower,0.351416975
and marries a woman who has two daughters,0.316572428
and but he must travel alot because hes never around in the rest of the story,0.273543954
the stepmother doesnt like the the stepdaughter,0.31145215
and turns her into a maid for her two daughters and for herself,0.297386259
and shes the one that hasta clean and wait on them,0.259755492
and and shes very good with the anima,0.34666729
and and theyre her friends because she really has no other friends,0.353405625
and the meanwhile at the castle the king decides hes going to throw a ball for the prince because the prince should get married,0.285320252
and hes not showing any signs of being interested in anybody,0.275332868
so they put out the word that theres gonna be a ball,0.236697391
and they send out invitations,0.362300366
and the stepmother gets the invitation and sets to making ready her two daughters,0.323048145
and Cinderella who they dont even consider as part of the family goes into the trunks of things that o probably were her mothers,0.227066413
and makes herself a dress,0.368645698
which they totally destroy and tell her shes going nowhere,0.300056547
and and she cries,0.511860788
and shes all upset,0.271854639
and her fairy godmother comes,0.38495788
and dresses her in this beautiful dress,0.375973463
and turns her mice into footmen,0.301790833
and her horses into the horses for this beautiful carriage,0.357506484
and sends her off to the ball,0.311055869
but tells her that she hasta be home before midnight,0.294064909
so she goes to the ball,0.293767571
and ofcourse the prince falls in love at first sight,0.303194165
and shes all hes interested in,0.268346906
while stepmama and stepdaughters are just dont know what to do with themselves,0.303961813
and at five to twelve allofasudden Cinderella realizes she better get home,0.227509782
so she goes tearing out,0.354526162

and goes home and everything,0.429070294
the coach the everything the beautiful dress,0.394825011
and all she has left is the other glass slipper,0.267587185
so the prince is beside himself,0.347081214
he decides he hasta find her,0.334868401
so he sends this one of his people out to find her with the slipper,0.253089607
and they everybody in the realm hasta try this slipper on,0.266609311
and ofcourse it doesnt fit anybody because obvious she she had very tiny feet,0.267206669
and finally they find her,0.431488305
she tries the slipper on,0.301359862
and the prince marries her,0.41128993

I have not been hospitalized since having my tonsils out when I was in fourth grade,0.253432572
I do remember that,0.528347731
and know most people remember the great difficulty of swallowing,0.36448279
what I remember was the aftertaste of the ether that was used for anesthetic in those days,0.270764619
and the nightmares that were prompted because of the anesthetic,0.406730652
with recurring dreams about giant pythons and jungle creatures,0.299460232
but smack otherthan that my life has been pretty free of physical difficulties,0.272017092
nothing prolonged,0.669508457
probably the first thing that I came to mind was maybe seeing our son when he was maybe four or five years old go down a f,0.209454104
and hitting a cement floor on the on on on the bottom,0.414925158
that kindof stopped our hearts momentarily,0.439800143
but both of us were trained in rescue procedures,0.294030517
and so therefore we didnt particularly panic,0.333421797
we just dealt with him by the prescribed nna manner we learned from our emergency medical services training,0.24587144
and it all turned out well,0.377476424
but it was quite frightening at the moment,0.383342922
smack my experience has been very very limited with that,0.300284147
being that weve not had people in our family who have been physically challenged,0.34007296
and in our acquaintance group most of them are been very very healthy,0.343897879

that the motor had conked out,0.339517504
and that the the car was actually being pushed off the road,0.37992239
she was eventually q forced to crawl out the window and crawl up to the top of the car,0.236869365
and try to to wait there until some help would be arrive,0.342235774
she did have her cellphone with her,0.365918726
was able to call nineoneone,0.348914236
and the sheriffs department dispatched both their helicopter and the paramedics and rescue squad crew,0.359853595
the the car eventually from the force great force of the water was tipped over onto its side,0.347020745
and and the lady in distress was washed down the fast flowing stream,0.300800741
where she caught on to a branch,0.302591294
and eventually hung and clung on to the branch until such time as a helicopter,0.278651416
which was hovering overhead,0.471722513
was able to lower one of the smack paramedic technicians by rope down to be able to rescue her,0.225058958
and to retrieve her back to safety,0.410831541
her life was saved,0.373895079
eventhough she put the paramedics into great danger,0.31753391
the car was lost,0.348074466

Billy liked his new soccer ball,0.248229474
which he had just gotten for his birthday,0.278639406
and he was practicing kicking it,0.360230178
when the ball slipped off the side of his foot and went right through the picture window of his neighbors house,0.301051766
and landed in the lap of his neighbor,0.318266869
smack knocking over the lamp shade,0.295190334
and breaking the window,0.514873624
smack his neighbor,0.370029032
who was the soccer coach,0.331759602
would probably have been more angry,0.434293389
but he knew about the skill and he knew that accidents happen,0.339169174
so,0.99999994
youknow I think what we needta do is to be able to fix your directional kicking,0.28786844
and so they went to the playground,0.368498266
and to the ball field,0.468325973
and the coach soccer gave some direction to the ball player,0.305315435
and it all turned out well,0.377476424
hows that for a positive spin,0.306994587
a mother was reminding her son that it was,0.347049147
the weather forecast looked like it was going to be rain today,0.304074407
and she handed her son an umbrella,0.267590195
smack smack and he said,0.283244193

so off he went to school with his backpack on,0.248267442
and he got halfway there almost when it started to pour rain,0.258915752
and he didnt wanna go to school,0.23678197
and he didnt wanna face his mom,0.237190753
so he hadta choose between two bad choices,0.263175577
smack and he returned home,0.274918377
where he changed clothes,0.386490345
mom handed him his umbrella,0.320704699
and off he went to school,0.301450729
on his second trip that day,0.3153418

tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can,0.221871078
smack there was a smack man and a woman got married,0.234704599
and the woman had two little girls young girls by her first marriage,0.305914581
and the man had a little girl by his first marriage,0.293233216
and so they combined their families,0.477256835
and the two stepsisters I think were not very nice to the new stepsister,0.27255255
and they were alittle older,0.451242268
and they ordered her around,0.417041391
and and they were really really mean to her,0.419600397
so she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her new stepsisters or siblings,0.268146396
in the land that they lived there was a and they and the girls grew up and to become young ladies,0.304640949
and with Cinderella virtually becoming the the personal servant of her two stepsisters,0.352462649
in the land that they lived there was a a king,0.366321862
who who had a son,0.429558516
who would take his place,0.356498867
but the king was concerned that his son was unmarried,0.359312147
and they needed to socialize,0.516671896
and decided that they would have a ball,0.394487917
in which they would invite all the young eligible young ladies in the kingdom to come and to enjoy a a marvelous ball at the royal palace,0.252038032
and the invitation came in the mail,0.402939945
and the two ps stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to go to the ball and dance and maybe find the the young prince to be of interest,0.259907454
but they planned and schemed that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend and and was excluded,0.342921376
and when it came time to leave for the ball Cinderella was left behind,0.261658341
but was visited by a a a fairy prince,0.328341246
who knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella,0.332673013
said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella,0.26809153
and turned her into this beautiful young lady,0.319448411
and provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin,0.315745801
and told her that she wud,0.28990382
which she did but that she hadta leave,0.439166129
and be home by midnight,0.330065906
at which time she would be restored to her her normal self,0.29766643
so Cinderella went to the ball,0.258767247
and much to the chagrin of the stepsisters and the other young ladies in attendance,0.36374101
was immediately noticed by the prince,0.368574172
who was captivated by her,0.347222865
and the prince and Cinderella danced and danced,0.442371726
until almost the stroke of twelve when Cinderella remembered that she hadta back into her pumpkin coach,0.24003762
and ran outof the palace,0.261992633
and jumped into her pumpkin coach to return to her home,0.254919887
but in her haste one of her slippers that I think was made of glass or something would had fallen off,0.227144226
and she returned home,0.425551593
well the prince who was in hot pursuit,0.276699603
was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin,0.217909664
smack drawn by these horses,0.242142603
but did find the slipper,0.348871142
and commanded his his helpers to search throughout the realm for a young lady thats foot would fit in that slipper,0.241665542
and so the h,0.36364904
and eventually came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters,0.327151895
and try as they may the stepsisters could not put their large feet into the glass s,0.253785461
but the smack the attendant tried the glass slipper on Cinderella,0.238334164
and Cinderellas foot fit perfectly,0.329286069
and so the attendant knew that Cinderella was the the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball,0.318739027
and took her with him back to the back to the royal palace,0.360051721
where she and the prince were united,0.415506452
and became a couple,0.383486509
and were married,0.471937716
and lived happily ever after,0.356158435

well youve got to get the bread someplace,0.303169966
and then you place the bread on the table or wherever you wanna put it,0.318651587
you take one slice and put the peanut butter on the bread,0.289821178
then you go to the other slice of bread and you put the jelly on it,0.272950679

the gentleman I say gentleman because hes all muscular and looks like hes got a moustache,0.238581434
is hanging from a tree branch,0.340674132
which is either coming up outof the water,0.27888456
or going into the water,0.376538157
it looks as though its coming outof the water,0.287810564
s,1.000000119
to keep herself from floating down the stream or river,0.319769353
whatever,0.999999881
he has a a leather belt which he I presume hes gonna put around her,0.199997053
and maybe a helicopter or a another set of rescue people will pull her in from the precarious area shes located at now,0.204286799
looks like everythings gonna turn out okay,0.362931848
that is probably of the end of the story,0.401546717
alright,0.999999881
now,1.000000238
the beginning of the story is a picture of a boy kicking a volleyball,0.313361675
he seems to be having a good time,0.343073279
but negligent in the fact that he doesnt know where hes kicking it,0.291478842
now hes kicked it into the window of a home,0.226822242
and by some reason hes kicked it through the window,0.252052814
the ball has knocked the lamp off the table,0.335294753
a f,0.537678063
theres also theres stuff laying on the floor,0.298379749
the man now gets up,0.320481747
looks out the window which yeah hes closer so the window would it the hole will look open more,0.265481323
hes got the ball in his hand looking out I guess who to blame or seeing where it came from,0.210550308
hopefully the the story ends good where realizes he was a kid one time,0.298760206
okay,0.99999994

Ill be okay,0.348582745
as he goes outside it starts raining,0.30551222
I dont know how far he got but it looks like he got pretty far,0.331679821
because now theres water all over the ground where hes walking,0.327256888
looks like his heads getting wet and everything else,0.325863719
so finally he hasta go in and face mother,0.259923697
admit that hes wrong,0.369487315
mother looks very upset with him,0.337065667
she should be,0.492880762
he gets the umbrella,0.32241866
goes back outside and continues on his journey wherever he was going,0.297784209

and it looks to be a charge or whatever you call them guys,0.315741152
and the dog is sitting beside Cinderella,0.296457797
through the whole story,0.504984975
the king or duke or whoever he is,0.304651201
tells his servant make arrangements for the prince to meet with all the fairest maidens in the land,0.273617297
and sends out tith notices that a a partys gonna be held,0.211475074

enraged the stepsisters tear her dress,0.331381381
and just trash her out,0.379309803
and the stepmother seems to be enjoyed enjoying the whole thing,0.33724162
smack after that the Cinderella looks at the castle,0.244782433
and oh no that was before she was dreaming about meeting some PrinceCharming,0.276832849
now she has no dress or nothing to go to the ball with,0.238538504
and turns a pumpkin into a coach,0.271051377

in her haste and running she drops her glass slipper,0.261835128
takes off with the pumpkin coach and her cohorts,0.22439146
and she gets back to where she she began,0.346350431
and everything turns back into way it was,0.354414672

when I looked out the porthole,0.359878868
and I saw a plane go over,0.239979252
and it had the emblem of the rising sun,0.349012792
I just felt the hair,0.374391198
because,1.000000238
I looked over,0.440208495
and saw in the first explosion was on a destroyer,0.332714111
it was at dry dock,0.285779119
and then the battleships,0.562664807
this one after another,0.571396887
started exploding,0.706742644
and then about that time a five hundred pound bomb blew up on the hanger deck of my ship,0.225711644
and that was really scary,0.39559859
the,0.999999702
and I heard them yelling,0.391881704
hes coming in hes coming in,0.273952097

trying to hit,0.432226181
but he missed it,0.496905774
and he crashed,0.382699966
and that,0.731151223
yes,0.999999881

I nudn,1
and we couldnt get ow back to get any food,0.2595281
so the natives was looking at us and,0.290744305
so I finally took this,0.402065963
and he nodded his head,0.395642877
so they give us something to eat,0.426950246
and I still dont know what it was,0.320506334
but it was pretty good anyway,0.466370732
and thats the only time that Ive ever been that in that situation,0.381722897
throat well it looks like the girl is stranded on a a bush in the water,0.251590341
and the guy is trying to rescue her,0.269070923
hes trying to put a lifebelt on her,0.242118716
and and also a recovery rope,0.434969097
so they can pull her out,0.363965392
and hes got one,0.256411433
and and that looks as though were,0.455218166
and he kicks the soccer ball,0.304449409
and it goes through the window,0.362238109
and bounces in the guys bed that was inside,0.271882713
and broke the big window,0.330052495
and then he takes the ball,0.36716345
and hes standing there,0.358750224
looking out to see if hes gonna come and get the ball,0.219731987
so,0.99999994
and mother s,0.421602279
you gonna take your umbrella with you,0.33618024
so,0.99999994
why oh yes,0.572285533
he said hes gonna take it,0.218275473
but he gets to school,0.356713474
and he starts home,0.372977614
and he forgot his umbrella,0.295152307
and its pouring down rain,0.4214755
so he decides hes gonna go back and get it,0.244942352
and he forgot his before,0.370211035
and he went on home without it,0.294314861
so then he went back and got it,0.354649037
after hes all wet,0.247376144
and,1
well it started out as a wicked witch and her two daughters,0.251647681
was very,0.611502707
and she was taken to live with them,0.31075874
and they made a slave outof her,0.250607759
and they put her in every kind of a bad n circumstance that they could,0.285969377
and she went ahead and did the work very jolly,0.257831842
and then she got to,0.381284714
so she wanted to,0.467629582
a,1.000000119
and the fairy godmother waved a wand,0.350601852
and got a coach uh outof a pumpkin with a handsome prince in it,0.205761001
so he had a pair of glass slippers for her to wear,0.216793925
and if she wasnt back home by midnight well the coach would turn back to a pumpkin,0.207565829
and the prince would leave too,0.368748367
so,0.99999994
she ran off and lost one of the slippers,0.226381838
so the old man he found it,0.3023251
and he went around trying to find who it was that who had the slippers on,0.253361046
so he finally tried the wicked witch,0.35746178
and her feet was way too big,0.255867869
and her two daughters ugly daughters,0.354596734
they couldnt fit into it,0.362302452
and they had her locked in the basement,0.364774048
and the two mice got the ke,0.268427879
went underneath and gave it to her,0.283655822
so she was able to get out and go up,0.265033185
and he tried it on,0.325914204
it fit her,0.441065252
so she become a princess after that,0.371019453
and she,0.562767684
lived happily ever after,0.401098311

well it looks,0.522301674
thats water isnt it,0.312280357

looks like a little girl fell into the creek or in the river river where there was branches or logs or or branches from trees there and twigs,0.264056593
she fell in there,0.354653001
and I guess she was hollering and scared hollering,0.328881592
and perhaps the people,0.509465933
wait I cant see that,0.362939209
maybe it was in a a boat or on the bank or something with them lifejackets on,0.24724862
and they jumped into the water,0.365691632
and I dont know what that is there,0.334171772
jumped into the water,0.387907088
and saved the little girl,0.340304732
she hadta hold onto the branch to save the little girl,0.2753205
but theres really dangerous,0.499915153
but evidently she was saved xxx,0.356390506
well well the little boy was out,0.333017886
you ready,0.757641315
the little boy was out playing with the basketball I guess soccer ball,0.249936029
kicking it and playing,0.457285941
and it it went right he kicked it right through a window and broke the window,0.307243347
and inside of the house was probably his father sitting there,0.375738204
it knocked over broke the window,0.338807613
it knocked over a lamp,0.31349346
and his dad looked very surprised,0.331807822

and just looking at the window,0.367422253
and thats it,0.421838701
thats what I can see,0.366591275
the little boy was going to school I guess,0.291710973
he was going to school,0.355293632
and it was ready ready to rain,0.326374561
his mother wanted to give him the umbrella,0.33295536
and,1
so she was giving the umbrella,0.295487553
and he wouldnt take it,0.302623361
he said,0.528301835
bye bye,1
hes going on to school,0.258582324
so when he got out there it started raining real hard,0.342646897
he ran back to the house in the rain,0.29343617
and his mother told his mother,0.466103017
she gave him an umbrella,0.275928497
and he went on to school,0.299509853
once a,0.600359857
there was once upon a time a a tha ugly mother and her two ugly r and her two ugly girls daughters,0.20973511
and they were very selfish children,0.413143814
and evidently the,0.671839356
I dont know who it was,0.319453597
but it brought it brought the other Cinderella to her home to take care of,0.284122497
she hadta take care of the the Cinderella,0.300940484
well Cinderella was a very beautiful little girl,0.342244565
and they the stepmother and daughters treated her terribly,0.423850298
so she just went try to do the best she could,0.315540493
she hadta do all the work for them,0.351853907
and one day she looked in a trunk,0.268550515
and there was a beautiful dress in there,0.334314257
so she hung this,0.400719762
and I and then the fairy godmother came and to her and was talking to her,0.338564724
so then the evidently the fairy godmother must have talked to her,0.333672941
then the the th the ugly mother received a invitation to the a ball for them all,0.298823893
and Cinderella wanted to go,0.303567857
and the fairy godmother was there for her,0.333408564
and she put on I think she put on this pretty pink dress,0.26867649
and then there was then when she then the fairy godmother evidently ordered a pumpkin with four horses and a fellow to to take her in there,0.295375407
and she was dressed up,0.316603422
then they had put beautiful clothes on her,0.315160513
beautiful clothes,0.691534758

beautiful clothes,0.691534758
she had this glass slipper on,0.292693913
and she was leaving she dropped it,0.369197547
and they looked all over for the slipper and where the little girl was,0.325908005
because the prince was very enchanted with her,0.371349782
well I guess the jester or the footman or somebody had tried the i the slippers on all the other daughters and the mother,0.247292578
wouldnt fit,0.419154793
but it fit the little girl Cinderella,0.342234313
then nder then I guess the footman went back to the prince and told him,0.26828289

depending on the requirements of the eater you may cut off the crusts or not,0.295067906
you butter the bread in my opinion,0.30018723
then you put on peanut butter,0.347394824
and then you put on the jam,0.291300476
and then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top,0.290027559
and cut it in any way you so desire,0.323362857
ri,1
al,1
we have a man stranded in a tree,0.283151507
because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat,0.28233555
because a little girl was crying because a cat was up in the tree,0.290007919
and smack after the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down,0.247937173
a dog came along and is barking up the tree,0.268653631
and the firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man,0.325607836
and Im assuming everything ends up okay,0.252042532
the end,0.63970381
well the most recent episode is a broken bone,0.253910571
but it was,0.554361522
I had been having pai,0.383015811
the more I walked the more it hurt,0.301476598
but I really just kindof ignored it,0.565472841
I was more concerned about my right foot with the toe nail looking like it was lifting off the bed,0.233984247
and I didnt quite know what to do about this,0.34564063
so I made a appointment with the foot doctor,0.252049059
but my foot doctor is in Waukegan smack Illinois,0.154984862
and lets see,0.377603769
how did that work,0.500311255
ohboy,0
we came we came directly from we had been on a a cruise,0.249680802
and we had visited our children in in Orlando,0.281757563
and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan so I could see the foot doctor,0.210305348
smack a,0.499402106
but anyway when I finally got to the foot doctor she just explained that the,0.340213478
so she just,0.62602973
took half a,0.440235466
that was done,0.445600092
and then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting,0.303715825
an,1
an,1
and that led to xrays,0.340639114
which showed there was a small broken bone,0.334567219
which led to my having to wear a boot for a month,0.239195853
and then come back for more xrays,0.359862864
so,0.99999994
then I turned arou,0.434748173
more xrays,0.589650989
and the stupid thing is not healed yet which is usual for me,0.274212599
because this whole scenario happened once before,0.508362472
and she says,0.378272772
another month with the boot,0.360681236
smack an,0.444409996
and I forgot to do it,0.353964537
no I did it yesterday,0.425968945
and smack she also told me that when I came when I would be coming back the end of this month she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else,0.260730565
and ofcourse shes following him,0.314698458
smack and nice thing about the visit is I really like that foot doctor as a person,0.248421058
and shes pregnant,0.328348219
and shes gonna have her second child,0.213074386
and I thought that was real nice,0.349317342
but anyway I said,0.48742789
well since youre not gonna be here in a month I will get a foot doctor in Arizona,0.184645712
so thats where I am now,0.339454174
Im waiting for this stupid foot to heal,0.229285583
the end,0.63970381
ohmy,0
lets see,0.576554179
right,0.999999821
first I hafta think frightened or scared,0.279028028
smack,0.999999821
smack we had in the bathroom was a crawl not a crawl space was a a a cubicle,0.253805667
I dont know how to describe it,0.368548751
you had your linen closet,0.361837238
and then underneath the linen linen closet was an open area,0.311463147
which had a area inside of it to get to the plumbing in the bathtub,0.281680614
and we used that open area for a dirty clothes,0.27664113
except there,0.740254641
and for a reason I dont remember smack the children told me that there was a big animal looking outof this area,0.209171221
so,0.99999994
well,1.000000119
but nevertheless I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldnt get out,0.30304715
and then we we went outside,0.403001189
and we saw,0.332362145
Im not sure,0.363532603
with its,0.634010732
looking out at us from the air vents I guess you call those that are in the foundation of the house,0.247919038
smack and that really scared me,0.359817266
I thought,0.680924118
if that thing gets in the house or gets out it could bite the kids,0.273139507
and it might be b rabid,0.291210055
so I called the animal shelter I think it was,0.296379
smack and they told me that they everybody was on lunch,0.257171452
smack and so they wouldnt be there for an hour,0.227936015
which,1
because if someone gets bit I will sue the city,0.266473532
smack so,0.567579687
and the men were not happy to see this,0.31674087
because he really looked,0.547108889
and they took off the vent,0.3296929
and somehow they caught him,0.445872873
smack and then they discovered I believe this is they discovered a nest of baby opossums,0.257282078
which all looked very cute,0.359011382
when theyre babies theyre all kinds of babies look cute,0.293193817
so anyway they took the opossum and babies away,0.281889647
and the story ended happily ever after,0.338010579
okay,0.99999994
well my mother had a stroke,0.326204836
and but thank the good lord that he,0.336192548
so I was able youknow we were able to communicate with no problem,0.270479202
but I remember one time again living in my own home in in Waukegan,0.28644073
my neighbor who who was going to be my husband,0.294546902
but ofcourse,0.735915184
he he rents out a I call it a garage,0.287792265
it was,0.562905312
so anyway he rents out the garage and theres Spanish speaking couple there,0.257750988
smack smack and the lady comes over to my house and somehow communicated to me that she had locked herself outof her house,0.229626596
smack an,0.444409996
smack so,0.567579687
and I dont I didnt have any children that would,0.329601198
and I dont even remember if the kids were home,0.271943808
but then I took her,0.390702933
and spoke Spanish,0.431327552
smack and so then we found out for sure what the problem wa,0.243067548
and I volunteered to take the lady to work,0.318092793
and that wouldnt wasnt feasible,0.316088527
because she hadta have her id,0.353236318
which was locked in the house,0.388198018
so then we went down the street further where I knew a,0.30204612
and we got this asked this child to help,0.342339844
but ofcourse he answered the door very cautiously,0.352170765
and told us that he couldnt come outof the house,0.227680773
because hes not allowed to come outof the house when mom and dad arent home,0.213223517
well when mom gets home come and see us,0.281494647
so wasnt too long mom came home,0.2552948
he comes up the street,0.322458446
he climbs in her,0.353981316
and end of story again,0.354248434
smack well Im ready,0.238792241
this this looks like a a a picture of a flood,0.432700783
smack and of a girl I would say rather than a young woman kindof trapped in the in the flood,0.226059452
and a fireman or some kind other kind of rescue personnel is going to try to rescue her,0.274188995
hes hanging on for dear life to a limb,0.197688937
and hes got what looks like a belt over an arm,0.204738408
perhaps to put around the smack girl to rescue her,0.258102387
and this looks like it could be an actual picture of a real happening,0.337391526
smack the end,0.368731976
okay,0.99999994
Im ready,0.356046945
smack we have a boy playing outside with what looks like a soccer ball,0.244430497
and he kicks the soccer ball,0.304449409
which goes through a window ofcourse breaking the window,0.376206398
knocks over a lamp,0.323363066
which startles a man who is sitting in a chair,0.273730516
and the man gets u,0.263815045
an,1
and hes looking out through the broken window,0.293219417
and thats the end of this story,0.360379398
oh,0.999999881
okay,0.99999994
smack we have a child a mother holding an umbrella and a child who I would guess is going to school,0.235887736
because it looks like hes got a backpack on,0.272530735
and hes telling her,0.32458058
and moms not too happy about this,0.353844881
but she lets him go,0.323997617

and he goes in the house,0.326306343
and mothers not happy,0.439890683

and then the next picture shows him back outside with an umbrella,0.319248796
and he has miracasly,0.453633368
the end,0.63970381

and we had gone to a bar and played pool and met up with some of my friends friends,0.230993554
and he was walking his date back to her car and we were waiting at the top of the hill for him,0.243128747
he got about halfway up the hill,0.268401265
and two guys ke ran across the street and just started beating up on him,0.231638744

and he stands up and a and a minute later ke were running up to the top of this hill,0.239749029
and one of the guys is lying in the gutter,0.301611394
so we get up to the top of the hill and there happens to be a cop car,0.222999901
and the cop gets out,0.289777011
and theres two cops,0.268784761
and one of them goes down with the the guy laying in the street,0.322211802
and the other guy stays with us and asks what happened,0.270621896
and the friend tells the story about how hes he got punched,0.233707353
and the cop asks,0.278707564

he had assault charges in several states,0.355875611
and,1

just a second,0.507973433

so I took a couple years of sign language,0.209335774
and they challenged us the first semester to go out into the deaf population and go to an event,0.255931407
and so I actually ended up going to TheVaginaMonologues all done in sign language,0.277544886
and it was really a f,0.317645222
and they did a voiceover on it,0.300822437

I had been in class youknow maybe six weeks or something and just really feeling at a loss youknow only being able to say a few words,0.216647848
I felt like a child,0.359931499
okay,0.99999994
on a very sunny summer afternoon three girls went out into the desert,0.251643181
and they were out behind their house in the desert,0.356590509
they were playing in a wash,0.279244244
and eventhough there were no storm clouds there a storm came up in the mountains and flooded the wash,0.293348402
and the three little girls were swept away in the water,0.30442372
and one of the girls ended up finding a tree branch and held onto it for dear life,0.227548286
and finally a rescue helicopter came along because some other people had seen the girls in the wash,0.284814209
and one of the rescue workers,0.40164125
okay,0.99999994
one day a little boy was out in his neighborhood playing with a soccer ball,0.252187461
and he kicked it really really hard,0.410784364
and it went through the window of his neighbors house,0.31273362
and the neighbor was just sitting there watching some television,0.375404
allofasudden the soccer ball comes in,0.329190701
so he gets up,0.391100556
and he goes to the window and he looks out,0.285020471
but he doesnt see anyone because the little boy got scared and ran away,0.24877952
okay,0.99999994
there was a mom and a little boy,0.309217453
and they were always arguing about the little boy taking his umbrella,0.302472532
and he always said,0.370036304
Mom I dont need it,0.407776713
Im fine,0.381371558
stop telling me what to do,0.419566274
so just another typical day he leaves the house thinking that hes gonna be fine,0.250391304
and it begins to rain,0.337161481
and he splashes through puddles,0.310568959
and he ends up soaked,0.269305587
and finally he comes home,0.387008131
and he says,0.357835323
Mom Im soaking wet,0.308336318
I need the umbrella,0.333347052
so he gets his umbrella and goes back out so he can go to school and stay dry,0.230700806
okay,0.99999994

and its been about two and a half years now,0.303371519
and the pain has gone away,0.295703471
but I still have side effects that probably will stay with me,0.362695336
however I would rather have those side effects than the severe pain and not be able to function,0.358792752
so there,0.689646423
okay,0.99999994
on,1
and so my daughter took him in,0.258799374
and we found out through several tests mris ct scans that that he had a tumor,0.276994497
and this tumor had wrapped around the kidney and had pushed out the liver,0.318133444
and thats how we found out that he had he had a tumor,0.277209342
smack so we went to,0.308683038
and it was diagnosed that he had a rare form of kidney cancer which is called clear cell sarcoma,0.260560185
which only one in about twenty children a year get,0.30130738
and it was it was diagnosed as stage three cancer,0.289875716
which means that it had well smack it had metastasized to,0.309515625
however it was in contained to the lymph nodes hopefully,0.326361239
and so that was a scary situation in my family,0.272254586
youknow not knowing exactly what the outcome was,0.369102925
and having to with my daughter youknow it was it was a very hard situation to know that your daughter is in this with her little boy,0.259247631
and you cant say,0.286762893
yes,0.999999881
everything will be fine,0.444283694
a hundred percent sure,0.343261778
and so it was scary becau,0.38458097
and number two it was such a a little little child that you didnt know what the results or the aftereffects of,0.268166095
and so that was a scary time in our family,0.277952492
okay,0.99999994
I am a a school nurse,0.322531968
and I have a program in my school,0.269264102
and its called SMD which is severely mentally disabled children,0.319601744
and these children have traumanic,0.552037776
or theyre severely disabled where theyre they barely can function,0.369329721
theyre usually in they are in wheelchairs,0.345839143
all their ADLs are done for them,0.410473138
they are they dont communicate at all verbally,0.358513445
and so basically the only way that you can communicate with them alot is,0.360993832
by the way maybe,0.310485482
or if theyre,0.442504555
the way that you touch them,0.49072966
smack maybe just communicating,0.40426895
some of them well smack I have several classes,0.301534742
theres another class thats MOMD which is alittle more,0.354500175
and so in that class we communicate by sign language,0.300250828
ke this,0.497100174
or youknow something like,0.448044777
so sometimes we do sign language with those kids,0.348820895
and we m communicate with them that way,0.361503989
okay,0.99999994
the beginning of the story it looks like there is this little gir,0.317864627
and somehow I dont know how she got into a raging river,0.240950033
but it looks really cold,0.541393757
smack and the fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her,0.230595201
and he has all his equipment on,0.314691573
and basically he hasta go out into this raging river,0.257040918
and hes grabbing on to some kind of,0.256263077
and then hes got some kind of a belt or something to,0.255672336
but hes also out there in in danger in his life too,0.283570498
smack okay,0.637660027
theres this little boy probably ten twelve years ol,0.263342977
and hes out playing soccer just having a really fun time,0.289810687
and the ball goes through possibly maybe the neighbors window,0.326909721
or maybe its his own front window,0.299979746
and smack the ball n knocks over a lamp,0.212596565
so actually it breaks the,0.486029178
and the man was sitting in a chair,0.328170955
and then he picks up the ball,0.327632427
and he looks out the window,0.323236167
and thats all in those pictures,0.381171793
so I dont know what the end of the story is,0.241362944
I dont know what the little boy does,0.324832857
okay,0.99999994
I love this one because this is typical typical of kids and mothers okay,0.302946955
so the little boy is getting ready to go to school,0.283962876
he has a backpack o,0.24723047
and his mom says,0.29190886
I think its gonna rain today,0.266890645
will you take the umbrethar,0.450768679
smack and the little boy goes,0.266600966
no,0.99999994
Im not gonna take it,0.27809298
its not gonna rain,0.263047606
trust me,0.603000998
okay,0.99999994
kids think theyre smarter than the parents,0.315421224
but theyre not,0.521296442
and the mom says,0.276319742
you need the umbrella,0.413439155
but,1.000000119
so what happens,0.618170202
he goes outside,0.402307153
and it starts to rain,0.356020004
hahaha,0.99999994
and so the little boy,0.364591599
and hes hes soaking wet,0.263550043
and he comes back in,0.341003865
and his mother is alittle upset with him,0.310623169
because in her mind,0.38950038
and hes sopping wet,0.249304846
and so he takes the umbrella,0.287396342
and he goes to school,0.308819473
and I hope he learned a lesson to always listen to your mom,0.296537966
once upon a time smack there was a little girl named Cinderella,0.236521453
and she lived with her dad,0.336264312
her mom had died years ago,0.32279408
so it was just her herself and her dad,0.373559892
and then one day her dad remarried,0.301796436
and brought the new mom with two,0.329259455

and the stepmom smack was not a very nice mom,0.206506327
and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella,0.281271309
and so they made Cinderella do all the chores,0.284412414
they made her do the dishes,0.304685771
and scrub the floor,0.422973782
and make the beds,0.390867978
and make the food,0.458309472
and they would not let Cinderella be part of the family,0.283359408
and they made Cinderella smack sleep upstairs in the addict,0.189208299
and so all her all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there,0.344666183
and she would look out her window,0.328547001
and she could see far beyond the city the castle,0.324471235
and she would sit and watch and wonder,0.322859436
oh what a beautiful place that she maybe some day would wanna go and see,0.261750072

they could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear,0.382538617

Cinderella,1
Walt Disneys Cinderella,0.604652762
there once was a little girl a beautiful little girl whose mother had died,0.313982159
and her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her,0.334443212
smack unfortunately he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom,0.253015727
and she had two spoiled rotten little girls,0.307676017
and then unfortunately he also passed away,0.388289154
so the the mom and the stepsisters made little Cinderella do all the work,0.286651254
all the cleaning,0.576174021
all the cooking,0.567813456
all the sewing,0.527512074
and she didnt have anyone to talk to,0.306519359
so she made friends with the animals,0.330785602
shed go out and feed them,0.354519695
and theyd talk together,0.350257367
and just they were her companions,0.43770355
one day the the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife,0.304675877
so he sent out an invitation to all the il eligible young women in the land,0.225127637
and smack the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it,0.252629995
and her daughters were so happy,0.346655607
and they said,0.43198812
youknow okay sure Cinderella you can go,0.351359606
but you dont have anything to wear,0.400104642
so the little animals made her a dress,0.324967623
they made it look beautiful,0.425238997
they sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way shed be able to get it done and go to the ball,0.249126747
smack so when it was time to leave she came down,0.291910738
and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be,0.27712065
and they said,0.43198812
oh Cinderella thats my scarf and my my necklace,0.264407396
and they ripped the things off because they s,0.352102458
so now she really does have nothing to wear,0.386255771

she goes off to the palace,0.299199432
and the prince sees her when she comes in,0.31453079
and he stops dancing with all the other fair maidens in the land,0.298361242
and the stepmother and the stepsisters think theyve seen this beautiful girl before,0.316108763
but he dances with her the rest of the night,0.355134159
and he falls in love with her,0.310251057
the stroke of midnight which is when the fairlry,0.372511894
she hears it striking,0.461675197
and starts running down the steps,0.424257547
she loses one of her shoes but cant go back because she doesnt want the prince to know that shes just poor little poor little girl,0.253203869
and she doesnt want him to see her in rags,0.229168355
she gets home,0.444617599
and her little mice friends arent horses anymore,0.284721315
but she does get to keep the shoe,0.287333727
well the prince is devastated,0.380708665
hes got to find her,0.260007292
so he gives his I dont know what you call them right hand man the shoe,0.275963962
and has him try it on every fair maiden in the land,0.239454105
doesnt fit the stepsisters,0.256843001
but he they see Cinderella,0.372855067
and they have her try it on,0.345819682

spread the peanut butter onto the one slice of the bread,0.34118849
actually I like alotof peanut butter,0.396335453
so I usually would put it on both slices of the bread,0.282312274
and then just put the jelly in the center of it,0.311934918
and close it up,0.398687899
put the bread away into the cupboard,0.341884017
and put the other items away ofcourse,0.350711912

the dog is ofcourse barking and barking,0.392302483
but thats just to see whats going on,0.344014138

I got I,0.692913532

and they go home,0.404430687
one time a long time ago when we lived in Colorado we had a little dog,0.248628736
we called her Heidi,0.269194722
and I had three boys then and the dog and a husband,0.291956782
and we played in the yard,0.274502426
when I I was running with Heidi and just chasing her,0.27686277
and my left foot bent,0.316000164
I heard it crack,0.461032867
and it made a snapping sound,0.370793134
and I knew that was not a good thing to hear,0.306870461
so I went down on the ground,0.297156453
sat down immediately,0.401951671
and got off my foot,0.304335684
I dont remember where Heidi went,0.243776008
the dogs name was Heidi,0.257202864
and she was there,0.403120041
but I went I got up the stairs because it was,0.305874616
the yard stairs went into the backyard going,0.321019292
so I hadta go up the stairs that my husband build this porch,0.263676643
it was a patio porch and with stairs,0.283480257
and we would sit out there and have our barbeque and that,0.332678378
so I climbed up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kindof dragging it,0.252674758
I would not step on the other foot that was broken,0.288870245
so I got upstairs and went onto the couch,0.248584822
and I layed down,0.34783709
and I it was wasnt hurting,0.280571342
and when my middle son came home from school he said,0.246511355
what happened to you,0.529392481
and I said,0.329179674
well I think I broke my foot because I heard this snapping noise while I was playing with Heidi,0.249410912
he said,0.528301835
well you had better get to the hospital,0.334852308
and I said,0.329179674
oh no,0.545691967
Im okay,0.396566153
I dont hafta go to the hospital,0.197262138
he said,0.528301835
oh yes you do,0.522592902
he must have been in about fifth grade,0.249723867
say,1
you hafta go to the hospital,0.24784027
no I no I dont,0.458822459
and he said,0.372952074
well Im going next door to talk to Steve,0.209336698
his wife is a nurse,0.326690584
so he went,0.43797043
and he told Steve,0.284742117
and Steve told his wife the nurse what happened,0.242656395
since I wouldnt do what my son told me to do he ran off to find out some other advice,0.220304489
so the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor,0.290875733
so then I called my husband,0.341970325
and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious,0.286362499
nurse would know what to do not me or not my son,0.325053573
but obviously he did know what to do,0.454514086
so when I went to the doctor he they xrayed my foot,0.300635576
I had broken my fifth metatarsal or think thats how you say it,0.2442936
and its the the bone thats on the side of your foot,0.343603343
so he they xrayed it,0.602500677
and they saw that was broken,0.353402734
and that being a the foot has so many bones in it you cannot put a cast on it,0.255250067
so the doctor suggested instructed me to buy a pair of heavy hard shoe hard tie up shoes hard toed tied up shoes,0.197089955
and to get to get to the shoe to fit is to fit it in your good foot,0.289654166
and then to stick your,0.446205676
I could lift my foot up and down,0.291524053
but I couldnt I couldnt move my,0.391444057
so I did get the shoes,0.325685263
I still have them and havent worn them,0.359587342
theyre brand new,0.455561131
and I wore the shoe like he told me,0.214909524
and the,0.791413784
and I was so proud of my son for helping me,0.209513262
yes,0.999999881
I worked I was sixteen a teenager and I worked in a hospital,0.253635734
and we were walking oh me were walking home another girl were walking to the bus,0.256607056
and we had a friend there,0.33951056
he was a older man,0.368015468
he would joke with us,0.303198904
and he would talk with us,0.30750376
and he was friendly,0.378218174
hes a very nice man,0.303399086
and he was off alittle earlier than us,0.27428931
so he stood behind a tree,0.295332819
and by the time us girls got walking up close to him he jumped out in front of the tree to scare us,0.220265761
and we just ke stood there in a shock,0.235331446
and you could feel your body go into holding your breath and adrendaline,0.341463894
it would go flow through your body,0.36188978
not fall from the inside,0.410744935
and you just stood there stunned for a minute,0.27899307
he saw what he had done and was so sorry that he scared the dickens outof us,0.245886251
it was obvious also it was dark,0.389569253
it was late at night,0.343734205
maybe seven by that time was would be late for us because it was dark and in the wintertime which would be is doesnt matter what time late was,0.252162039
it was dark was dark,0.429444045
and so that was it,0.432888418
not really,0.792273641
have I haver,0.686585665
sometimes you have a little trouble explaining something to yourself to your children what you want them to do,0.436072826
well you tell them I would tell the children or my son what to do,0.295633763
and if he didnt do it he would get the belt,0.264696747
well they went on he went on,0.322613835
and he did it again,0.3995758
so cant remember what he did,0.365768403
he maybe he was,0.515741527
must have been pretty good to get the belt,0.294463724
so I told him,0.444302261
okay,0.99999994
you did it,0.594604492
youre gonna get the belt,0.250072479
so I would put said,0.396297693
put your hands on the bed,0.333093554
so he put his hands on the bed,0.27486214
gave him one one whopo with the belt,0.324387699
so then it would be next week,0.386645019
so I said,0.480681747

if you dont stop doing it youre gonna get two belts,0.280112445
so he kept doing it,0.423701882
so he got two belt swats,0.262862861
so he hadta put his hands on the bed again,0.28763774
so went on again,0.381855577
and then he did it again,0.434053898
so I guess he wasnt getting the communication part,0.262752354
or I wasnt communicating to him very well with the belt,0.233195707
so I said,0.480681747
youre gonna get three belts,0.251323491
this was the time when you probably would nobody knew what was happening,0.387993753
so you wouldnt get hauled off to to jail for whopping your son with the belt,0.218602687
so he got three l three swats with the belt,0.213305771

get a knife and spoon from the silverware drawer,0.263360918
and use the knife to get some peanut butter outof the jar and spread it on one of the slices of bread,0.251535028
and then you get the spoon to get the jelly outof the other outof the jelly jar and put that on the second slice of bread,0.240755662
and you can use the knife to spread that around,0.347515762
then you put the two slices together on the bread on on the plate to make the sandwich,0.312186152
and youre ready to enjoy your peanut butter sandwich,0.311131328
okay,0.99999994
this was about two years ago,0.294546157
and I was having pain in my left hip,0.252531648
and Id had a car accident earlier that year,0.238980025
so I thought maybe it was related to that,0.373666763
but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an xray,0.235661864
and they found out that the bone the joint was actually dying because I had what was called avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didnt join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off,0.23798798
so,0.99999994
so we set up the appointment,0.296560109
or the the specialist set up the appointment youknow with the hospital for the date of surgery,0.302238286
and I went into the hospital,0.301348835
and,1
Ive never really been sick or anything in my life,0.288747311
so they put me under,0.345364749
and I actually kindof woke up before they were completely finished,0.30820933
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldnt feel anything from the waist down,0.294506878
but they were finishing up,0.412848651
and I was ke looking around,0.24998045
and the doctor was kinda surprised,0.300094157
he was like,0.416968197
oh just be calm,0.377748966
were almost done,0.467204362
and so then after that they wheeled me into the recovery room where youknow I kinda came more outof the anesthetic,0.246294662
and then I spent two days in the hospital before they were before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home,0.257498443
and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work,0.287600726
and then it was a year before they said I was completely healed,0.296326578
but yeah that was the the only time Ive ever really been in the hospital,0.315538526
no it was really kindof strange because I youknow I trusted the doctors,0.337739408
and I thought I would be afraid youknow especially when they were putting me under,0.313310623
but I really wasnt frightened or or scared,0.334322661
oh yeah definitely,0.581397116
sure,0.999999881
alright this was gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager,0.243304178
and my family we lived in Anchorage and wed always every weekend we would go down to the KenaiPeninsula to either the KenaiRiver or the RussianRiver to go salmon fishing because the salmon would run,0.252458245
and so I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught,0.272276938
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite,0.256463051
and I was wearing,0.334202766
everybody wears waders,0.451593518
so anyway I was,0.489656389
and Im walking along,0.287804782
and I hear something,0.411079198
and I look over to my right,0.332504779
and I see a little baby moose,0.291132301
and Im like,0.277573854
oh how cute a baby moose,0.286839217
well I hear something,0.472154379
and I look over and its the mother moose,0.306287318
and it freaked me out,0.343401194
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby,0.236544341
and I had this huge thing of fish,0.285701632
and I was like I I didnt wanna drop the fish because I thought that would make noise,0.289755404
so I was trying to ke tiptoe as fast as I could through that area,0.238955826
and I was able to get past that,0.308539152
I dont know how I was able to get through there,0.304522514
I dont know how the the mother moose didnt hear me because they have good hearing,0.289383352
they dont see very well,0.366167337
but apparently,0.82641542
I dont know,0.538106382
but yeah I was ke scared for my life there for a little bit until I got past that area and back to camp,0.229514018
theyre huge,0.415761501
and they look so goofy and,0.379069686
but they can be really dangerous,0.511813343
yeah actually my grandmother on my dads side youknow as she got older,0.235500813
shed had a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks in her life,0.265348196
but as she got older her memory started to go,0.254894018
and it was I think she,0.364924699
I dont know if it was Alzheimers that she had or dementia or what,0.272067696
but we would go to see her youknow from time to time,0.301494122
and youknow sometimes she would be really youknow with it,0.322642714
she could remember lots of things,0.333614767
and other times you would kindof hafta tell her who you who you were and talk really slowly,0.285696805
and youknow she would keep repeating,0.290782571
and shed be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother,0.242992669
and so,0.590056539
no,0.99999994
you hafta say,0.366046906
no Grandma its Rich,0.20534122
and shes,0.353868306
oh Richie,0.472585231
and so then youknow she would remember who I was for awhile,0.296992183
and then shed kinda fade out again,0.329552352
so it was difficult to communicate,0.400826007
it was kindof hard emotionally too youknow because I remember her from when she was younger,0.315137327
and she was ke my favorite grandmother,0.248686597
and she was really alotof fun,0.269923568
and then to see her in that situation where shes just kindof a shadow of her former self was was upsetting,0.260711461
so,0.99999994
well I would hold her hand youknow and just be youknow modulate my tone of voice,0.233614355
youknow just repeat it if if she couldnt understand,0.383680314
youknow just be there for her really,0.35350734
sometimes she couldnt understand,0.406106651
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didnt,0.32934624
youknow you would talk to her and she may not understand,0.31898132
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm,0.280558616
okay,0.99999994
Joey had just joined the soccer team and he was very excited,0.23032859
so he was on his way home with the soccer ball kicking it around as he went trying to make sure that he would be ready for the big soccer match next weekend,0.228234425
unfortunately he got alittle too enthusiastic with his kicks,0.32159707
and the soccer ball went through a window in his neighborhood,0.287297726
MisterMoss was sitting calmly in his chair watching tv when all of a sudden the soccer ball came crashing through his window in the living room and hit a lamp and knocked it over,0.226846337
he jumped outof the chair grabbed the soccer ball and looked out the window,0.237569481
but he couldnt see anybody because Joey had hidden in the bushes,0.234844327
and he was perplexed as to who had done this and what he was going to do about it,0.278504848
the end whispering,0.534228325
okay,0.99999994
one day a little boy was getting ready to go to school,0.273030072
and his mother said that he had better take a rain,0.284273833
the little boy said,0.324148893
it never rains when they say its going to rain so I dont need the umbrella,0.285092533
Im just gonna go without it,0.294727266
its something I dont needta carry along with my backpack,0.242294505
well hed barely gotten outof the outof the house and down the street when allofasudden it didnt just start raining,0.225238189
it started pouring,0.470123827
so he ran back to the house as fast as he could totally annoyed at himself for not taking the umbrella,0.233061463
he got inside the house where his mother was also not very happy with him because he was soaking wet,0.28914836
and she was afraid he was gonna catch a cold,0.224270478
he he took the umbrella this time and then walked and went back outside and headed on to school where he made it safely and dry,0.269441873
the end whispering,0.534228325
okay,0.99999994
once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella,0.275436789
and unfortunately her father passed away,0.394061744
and she was sent to live with her stepmother and stepsisters who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful,0.289422899
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun,0.288873523
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm,0.302604795
one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son,0.243752792
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that somebody was would be able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king,0.306054205
so couriers went across the land and delivered the message or delivered invitations to all the eligible bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom,0.260912091
and the the stepsisters were very excited,0.403304458
and Cinderella was excited too,0.272803128
but then they laughed at her saying,0.363026679
you cant go to the ball,0.26599285
you dont have a dress,0.324238509
youre just a scrub girl,0.339412183
and Cinderella was very sad about that,0.287418962
but her friends the animals made a dress for her so so she could go to the ball,0.277440071
unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her,0.343833923
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball,0.310239255
so they ripped the dress up,0.32152763
and Cinderella was sent down to the to the cellar,0.294066101
and she cried,0.426966757
and then allofasudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying,0.292820394
and she told her story to the fairy godmother,0.314209342
and the fairy godmother waved her wand,0.364854276
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with with glass slippers,0.295834243
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin,0.28474161
and it turned into a beautiful carriage,0.343124926
and she waved her wand over the mice,0.316286892
and the mice turned into horses,0.353628486
so Cinderella arrived at the at the royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress,0.212934881
she met the prince,0.377201855
and they danced the night away,0.384580016
but the Cin but the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight,0.259371698
so Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away,0.257764876
and the prince tried to catch her because he was so enchanted with her,0.303668052
but he couldnt catch up with her,0.280601919
she Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden ip or one of her glass slippers on the stairs,0.226605028
she made it to the carriage and got home just in time,0.294373661
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin,0.342445105
and the mice turned or the horses turned back into mice,0.312958211
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because he was his heart belonged to her now,0.263362586
so he sent couriers across the land again with the the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper,0.240718499
and then he would know who who was the beautiful woman at the ball,0.280686617
so when the courier got to Cinderellas house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting to try the slippers on,0.260848492
but unfortunately they the slippers didnt fit either one of them,0.317399174
and Cinderella came outof the cellar and sat down,0.232559741
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle,0.26782757
and she and the prince lived happily ever after,0.349179417
oh youll need,0.430077493
youll need a jar of,0.275503248
youll need a jar of jelly,0.259075016
I prefer seedless raspberry,0.438609004
you need a knife,0.414723933
you will open the package of bread,0.320913285
you will take out two slices of bread,0.279533267
you will lay them face up onto the counter,0.321274787
you will take the knife and,0.335180819
you will,0.70655179
you will spread it down,0.419617236
either is fine,0.454311371
you will then fold the two pieces together,0.371738493
you may choose to slice it into triangles,0.334960788
so little Amina went outside to play with her cat,0.240408644
and her cat got excited and scared because the dog started to chase it,0.260475665
which is what the neighbors dog always does,0.325300455
his very annoying dog,0.378211945
and the neighbors just dont keep it in his yard like theyre sposta,0.223310903
and so the cat ran up the tree,0.248277918
but it got stuck because it went,0.43356359
and Aminas father came and said,0.418713748
no problem,0.623380125
Ill go up,0.391029596
Ill rescue the cat,0.271742254
and he climbed up,0.318972498
but then the ladder fell over,0.368892789
and he got stuck,0.304835707
so then the neighbors eventhough theyre very bad with their dog they were also very kind neighbors,0.339749277
and they noticed he was stuck in the tree,0.271091402
and they called the fire department which is kindof an overreaction because they couldve just fixed the ladder themselves,0.313290268
and the and the bird was singing very contentedly over this entire scene,0.36607635
the end,0.63970381
I did trail riding recreational trail riding on horses in NorthernCalifornia in college and most weekends,0.279839873
and I went out with the other riders,0.31700629
and I actually fell off the horse and got a concussion,0.269845992
and in the midst of that got back up onto the horse,0.286826193
fell,0.999999881
Imean very tall horse actually,0.4180049
Quasar was ke sixteen hands or something,0.212751448
and fell right,0.442930639
I lost consciousness for a few minutes,0.245378569
and then when I came back to the college campus I went to the health clinic,0.302467823
and they sent me to the hospital to get a cat,0.268858016
and they kept me overnight,0.367796987
I remember I remember one of the girls at the end of the hall,0.277685195
I think it was ke Thanksgiving weekend or something,0.278968036
it was some holiday weekend,0.367720962
there werent alotof people around,0.316380858
and so Katie of all people happened to be around,0.256425917
not a close friend but someone I knew,0.385149717
and she was so nice,0.305227369
she took me to the hospital,0.301339239
and it was the emergency room,0.344561964
and it was just ke crowded,0.267767429
and I think it was maybe even a Saturday night,0.300891787
and there were police bringing in ke people with cocaine in their stomachs,0.273981333
Imean it was an interesting,0.35142529
it was like one of those ke tv movie situations where there are all these things going on,0.267102033
I think there was ke some gunshot wound youknow,0.25810039
and here I am just sitting here with ke,0.313502461
and they needed to keep me overnight,0.403985471
they did the cat,0.360570639
they kept me overnight,0.413969189
I remember I just really really wanted to go home and take a shower,0.358139902
and the person I was sharing a room with I think was having some sort of family difficulty,0.298541218
or she was very unhappy and possibly very sick or in pain or something,0.283484042
and so she was having a hard time and,0.353317797
I remember that my friends came the next day to pick me up,0.277294755
and they forgot to bring clothes with them,0.382037491
so I was wearing a hospital gown with a a,0.289537728
basically thats the time I was in the hospital,0.322450638
certainly,1
Im going to recall yeah,0.270808339
frightened or scared whispering,0.500647724
oh,0.999999881
last spring right before summer vacation I was in my house small apartment complex small apartment just doing some schoolwork or something,0.294186562
and I suddenly started hearing this,0.368216038
and I,0.451039851
and I went into the kitchen,0.290706843
and I notice theres a bee in my inside my house which I dont understand how,0.222242236
because its absolutely closed all the time,0.428021729
screens on the window,0.45828706
theres no way,0.406096935
so I thought that was odd youknow trying to get out the window,0.27308175
and I captured it,0.330450535
and I put it outside,0.331464916
and I noticed there were some bees flying around outside,0.364902884
I go into the bathroom,0.295299768
and my bathroom my shower stall has been invaded by about fifty bees,0.189761981
Im telling you it was like a horror movie,0.257229388
it was the sound of,0.364273608
yes,0.999999881
and Im not overly phobic of bees,0.207423538
I like them in their place,0.36355564
Im not like someone who runs away from them,0.248236865
but alotof them in my house in my bathroom,0.274122745
and that feeling of going in,0.402415633
and it was like a horror movie like,0.308055341
so,0.99999994
and theyre all trying to get out the window which was good,0.288532019
they were focused on the window,0.33609274
so yeah I I freaked,0.573312759
I,1
I actually got a dirty towel and ke,0.234678581
because you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes,0.412730843
and gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying,0.259534001
you needta get here now,0.599158168
we needta figure this out,0.463524073
whats going on,0.35614109
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole,0.280987591
they were looking for a new place to start a hive,0.312288523
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting,0.309323788
we hadta get someone,0.595489204
youknow were they going in everywhere,0.329589546
how were they getting in,0.390086055
they hadta call a bee expert,0.310303509
so then but yeah that was a freaky moment,0.35781163
and I was very creeped out,0.264520109
I remember going into my closet and ke,0.260829121
and Imean they were very focused on the windows,0.318747044
but it was alittle creepy to think that ke it might be,0.34805873
that was creepy for sure,0.271810144
youknow and the bathroom is the last place you need anything,0.277672917
yeah youre vulnerable enough,0.364115298
lets be honest,0.343862206
ke you just dont need anything coming at you with a stinger,0.280672967
so yes that was that was that was scary,0.395655632
certainly,1
Im trying to think of specific examples in the moment whispering,0.2727862
its interesting whispering,0.579883695
Im trying to think of,0.258533835
certainly while teaching sometimes having students particular students who really are struggling,0.465381414
and you feel like theres not clear communication,0.362948567
its not a coherent reason for why its not working and a resolution kind of thing,0.334960103
and youre struggling to understand,0.411534131
certainly sending emails to find out,0.395694911
taking a moment saying,0.472405553
I wanna talk with you,0.387606174
Im feeling youknow this this is this is these are my concerns,0.286795557
how can I better support you,0.456890792
is there anything going on that you wish to share with me,0.325744957
like those trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy and whatever theyd be interested in,0.312174886
asking them,0.697709143
youknow I think it really helps to just start with youknow,0.349465668
these are my concerns,0.42432797
ie missing work or behavior in class or something like that,0.343452841
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of where to go next with that,0.31901291
Im trying to think,0.343833625
Ive had Ive had some really difficult situations with students of youknow basically just really disagreeing over the the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences,0.303977638
and oh Im trying to think specifically,0.24992983
Imean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because then its not just you and the other person,0.386103749
is it just in this situation,0.404744178
or is it a broader picture problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers,0.315420479
and those are things I can think of,0.355612397
mhm,0
one day after schoo,0.448347628
and he did an amazing kick that kicked so well that the ball went all the way through the window of his house and right into his dads lap,0.236235961
his dad was very surprised and went to the window and looked out to see where the ball had come from,0.254502714
the end,0.63970381
mhm,0
one morning this little boy was going to school,0.319930106
and his mother was saying,0.418423533
you should really take your umbrella,0.460322499
and he was saying,0.396866918
no no no,0.999999881
I dont want it,0.491838336
I dont believe in umbrellas,0.264663965
so he left,0.454243511
he said,0.528301835
goodbye Mom,0.670193017
and he started walking out the door,0.331651419
and then loandbehold it started to rain a few drops,0.293790609
he put his hands out,0.377538443
and allofasudden alot came down,0.295715541
he was covering his head excuse me and running back to the house,0.28258425
he was all wet,0.312098742
he went into the house and he was soaking wet,0.282462984
his mother was very displeased because she,0.431885689
and this was something they were working on,0.364694446
his ability to listen to her and accept her direction,0.379232496
long term goal,0.461589873
and then he took the umbrella and started walking back to school,0.322572321
and it was okay because the umbrella kept him from getting rained on,0.261228502
the end,0.63970381
okay,0.99999994
so,0.99999994
and she loved her father very much,0.399900228
but her mother died,0.45380342
so her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl,0.271807939
her name was Cinderella,0.372582287
this woman came with two daughters,0.321347862
but they were unpleasant,0.524470389
and they were ugly,0.374842167
we hafta be honest,0.331215829
they were very ugly,0.396954626
so theres a great deal of stress after Cinderellas father,0.248941243
she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters,0.336566389
and they useta make her clean,0.409311831
and they useta make her cook,0.370224297
and they were very mean to her,0.360514075
and they made her live in the attic,0.299132466
and they made her wear old ugly clothes,0.265855014
but she was very very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative,0.395879149
and she befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds,0.366288096
and when she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of Fantasialand,0.300312907
and so she useta dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown,0.258418679
but she never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didnt have any nice clothes to wear,0.327969134
and they always said to her,0.388237238
youll never go to the ball,0.303523153
youll never go the palace,0.317605555
so one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big a very big dance because the king was,0.308004826
seriously,1
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men,0.300889432
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day hes going to be the king,0.273701102
and he needed to have children,0.399422795
and he needed to have a wife,0.313565046
so they were gonna have a big ball,0.259970009
so they were having a ball,0.372638464
and Cinderellas ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go,0.226918012
and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes,0.378520846
and Cinderella really really wanted to go,0.362912655
she was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go,0.347016543
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds,0.318595469
and they knew how to sew,0.316518903
and they knew how to accessorize,0.356232941
and they knew how to design dresses apparently,0.363035381
so they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella,0.254581809
and she was so surprised and so excited,0.36116749
I wonder what was next whispering,0.339529693
then she,0.715965807
and at the ball she met the prince,0.287595272
and it was just love at first sight,0.295454502
the way it should be,0.450698465
he loved her and she loved him,0.455443084
and they had a wonderful time dancing,0.358219028
and then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there,0.322839975
and they were pulling her dress,0.371473193
and they were tearing her scarves,0.345371664
and they chased her away and made her go home,0.298467994
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry,0.349827319
and so he sent out a message to,0.284045845
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry,0.269671232
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldnt let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper,0.249398887
so the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out,0.235252544
and then the prince did find her,0.343420327
and then they got married,0.362525165
and then the king was happy,0.384595931
and we dont really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters,0.303409666
the end,0.63970381
open the fridge,0.472542405
and I get out the peanut butter and the jelly and the bread,0.317605972
and then I put it on the counter,0.329112947
and I get out a plate from the cupboard,0.274751604
and I take I open up the bread container,0.277205914
I dont know what its called,0.282276571
bread bag I guess,0.459348977
and I take out two slices of bread,0.263247848
and I put it on the plate,0.28216067
and I take out a knife,0.281313449
and I open up the peanut butter jar,0.268823326
and I,0.451039851
and I,0.451039851
then I get out a spoon,0.351305246
and I open up the jelly,0.27196002
and I take out some jelly,0.32106182
and I spread it on the bread,0.312445551
and then I put the two,0.335284024
and then I cut them,0.406591326
and thats it,0.421838701
it looks like little Susies cat had gotten stuck in the tree,0.270039082
so,0.99999994
the dad climbed up the tree to get the cat and now is stuck in the tree,0.223160535
the dog is trying to help out the situation,0.332397401
in the meantime the mother inside has called the firemen to come and get the cat out cat and the man outof the tree,0.274307281
Ive only ever had one major injury,0.325893104
and that was when I was probably twenty twenty one,0.369314194
and I broke my ankle all the way around,0.263365477
we were just outside where Im from in Michigan,0.248394206
and I fell in a hole,0.236812592
and it,0.541534305
and I heard a crack,0.286513686
and it was not fun,0.312542528
it was not a good FourthofJuly,0.400743663
yeah they they took me to the hospital,0.299057633
and the the doctor just said youknow he just said,0.286371589
Im gonna put your,0.273223102
so he said,0.426555753
on the count of three,0.431834102
and one two three,0.614522576
and then,0.707445979
so yeah,0.688268423
but he told me I was tough,0.344162971
so I liked that,0.527606964
Ive just traveled alot internationally since I was a little girl because my dad worked overseas and just different countries,0.245125532
I think we were in Korea,0.286288142
and we were standing outside,0.43740195
yeah we were in Korea,0.245672494
we were in SeoulKorea because we were all outside,0.392155588
and we were sortof getting into,0.359680444
like the like this picnic story,0.369180322
everybody was loading into a cab,0.28768608
and I they wanted my dad wanted me to get in the front,0.279582947
and so I stepped outof the car,0.232085213
and the cab took off,0.291296601
and it was Imean I was like eight years old,0.250851601
and the cab just took off,0.282399923
and Imean Im standing there,0.31176132
Im like,0.360845715
ohmygod,0
but I guess my dad was like,0.37994656
turn around,0.616817355
was gonna hit the guy and everything,0.215128094
so they came back like five minutes later,0.307611495
but yeah that was pretty scary,0.405802608
definitely,1
oh it was I I was in shock,0.287388176
Imean I I didnt know,0.498849332
everything is running through your head like,0.374259651
whats gonna happen to me,0.309624672
plus I was eight,0.262007475
so youknow in retrospect,0.264955223
but I just was I knew I was all alone,0.416888416
and I was all alone,0.336274564
and I was white,0.320543945
and everybody was ch youknow Korean around me,0.20141159
and nobody looked like me,0.367007375
and I was yeah it was very it was very scary,0.332892865
okay,0.99999994
I have the gift of gab,0.222710073
I like to talk alot,0.340801388
and I have alotof comedy gifts too,0.241931841
so even if somebody doesnt speak English I I can make them laugh eventhough,0.342450351
so Ive kinda been able to communicate without speaking,0.304814935
so that thats always made me feel good that I can communicate with somebody who doesnt doesnt understand English,0.291910559
but they always end up youknow feeling happy,0.376934946
so I havent really ever frustrated anyone,0.439444959
but yeah sounds like seems like comedy is sometimes is the way to communicate with people if they dont speak the same language as you,0.270432502
okay so little Tommy is outside playing soccer,0.245938361
and he gets alittle outof control,0.277148902
and he kicks a soccer ball through the neighbors window,0.262440234
the neighbors inside sitting there watching tv on his couch,0.310622096
and here comes the ball,0.389657676
and he grabs the ball,0.312189639
and he looks outside,0.373821914
and hes contemplating what hes gonna say to little Tommy outside,0.186961889
so little Bobbys mom is telling him on his way to school that its its about to rain and he needs his umbrella,0.240450248
but little Bobby says to his mom,0.250901639
you know what,0.707741976
so he doesnt take the umbrella,0.242499754
but on the way to school it starts raining as hes walking,0.260333121
and hes just freaking out,0.320999503
he cant even believe he he didnt take the umbrella,0.26762259
but he goes back,0.416904807
and he says to his mom,0.280904353
you know what,0.707741976
Im really sorry,0.406123936
I need the umbrella,0.333347052
and so he takes it,0.354470909
and he walks to school,0.335158944
and all is well,0.448711038
okay Cinderella is a girl who goes to live,0.213686302
oh no,0.545691967
Cinderella goes to live with with her evil stepmother and her two evil stepsisters,0.281306088
one is named Esmeralda,0.317448765
I dont remember the other ones name,0.286410421
but theyre just nasty nasty three nasty women,0.330569744
the the the stepmother and the two sisters are just really nasty,0.372075379
and they force Cinderella to become their maid and take care of the house,0.291308105
and they just they just are mean to her that she has no friends,0.362219453
and so she befriends all the the the little creatures,0.407280624
and she theres a big ball thats happening where the prince is going to find his,0.261335433
he needs to find somebody that he wants to marry to inherit the kingdom,0.334833354
and so behind every behind her familys back she goes to the ball,0.299589992
nobody knows her name,0.382887959
and she meets her,0.4143309
I dont know what the what her what,0.396096796
its the,0.823819816
oh her fairy godmother,0.377295882
and the fairy godmother says to her,0.323665708
Im gonna make you,0.318425566
Im gonna let you go to the ball,0.24335736
and she kinda,0.408752441
and so she goes to the ball,0.291107506
and she meets PrinceCharming,0.390498936
and they dance,0.537355363
and there theres just sparks fly,0.355813831
and then she realizes that if she doesnt get back in time,0.289823234
she hasta be back by the stroke of midnight,0.213423416
if she doesnt get back in time then shell turn into a pumpkin,0.238802776
but as shes leaving she drops her shoe,0.269134015
but she doesnt realize it,0.42147699
so she goes home,0.383118749
and then the next day the prince is beside himself because he feels like he met his soulmate,0.270840883
and so he he orders his his people to go around and find the woman whose shoe fits whose whose whose feet whose foot fits the shoe,0.223822996
and so they go to the house,0.362793863
and its her its her shoe,0.423849493
and then everybody lives happily ever after,0.397092193
okay,0.99999994
first you get some bread outof the pantry,0.281458288
and then you go to the refrigerator,0.363590211
and you get a jar of jelly,0.246908084
and then you hafta,0.332954586
and you,0.53373462
you open up,0.480368733
you open up,0.480368733
and then you open up the bag of bread,0.289158851
you take two slices of the bread out,0.290502638
and you get a butter knife from the drawer,0.27388683
and you take out,0.402572066
and you smear it,0.38278234
and then you take that same knife and use it to,0.359776884
and spread that,0.585805595
and then you,0.543174982
hadta think about that,0.650385737
I was like,0.403032511
wow how,0.528566778
so little Sally was playing with her cat out in the front yard of the house,0.239948407
she was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them,0.24145177
the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree,0.238383099
and little Sally was worried about,0.358721584
so she went and found a ladder,0.266213387
she was gonna put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said,0.176812232
ohno no dont worry about it,0.38480857
at which point the dog came back and scared the man,0.270603359
and he ran up into the tree,0.267366499
little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree,0.270767331
so she hadta call the oli the firemen sothat they could come and rescue everybody,0.319287002
I will tell you about having my tonsils out at the at,0.247971743
I had had strep throat five times in one year,0.299768925
and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to hafta come out,0.2486673
which most people thought really was weird because Im an adult,0.277557492
and I still had them at all,0.336067915
so my sister came into town to stay with me,0.239166185
and I hadta go to Scottsdale,0.257687688
I think I went to ScottsdaleSamaritan to have it done,0.374182373
but it they did it ke on a day surgery,0.284486473
but what I remember about it most is al it hurt,0.325942695
but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning,0.247528449
but I couldnt have anything to eat or drink after midnight,0.301758558
so by the time I got in there I was ke a little bit dehydrated,0.217764661
so they couldnt find a vein,0.312624007
and they hadta stick me ke six times inorderto,0.238748044
and that was very very unpleasant,0.460125983
they they finally got it in,0.424914032
they had TheWall on for the music,0.334214628
and I was like,0.326814711
oh thats gonna be great,0.21370703
youre gonna gimme drugs,0.274140507
and Im listening to PinkFloyd,0.287122846
so this is gonna be a good day,0.261893779
so did that laid down on the gurney,0.276167393
they gave me,0.389501303
and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery,0.286362648
it was painful,0.469587654
I felt I wanted to cry,0.419843614
infact I did cry just because it was so unpleasant,0.411686927
and it hurt so bad,0.381357789
they were trying to give me ke some water to help kindof,0.308691502
and I couldnt swallow it,0.348887086
so it was coming back outof my nose,0.281482011
it was just it was a mess,0.420369864
it was horrible,0.47368589
but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out,0.291712403
but it was like,0.457442582
and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out,0.322752386
so I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to to feel better,0.286120802
the only thing I could eat were popsicles,0.331192255
youknow people were like,0.372069776
oh you always get ice cream,0.3453857
you get ice cream,0.445626318
but Im lactose intolerant so I cant have ice cream,0.2626957
so that made it that much worse,0.478256702
I couldnt eat anything really hot because it was hurt it was burning my throat,0.301086307
and it was probably it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that,0.350170672
and Ive had people ask me youknow,0.264393777
if you hadta do it all over again,0.419372171
I was like,0.403032511
Id have just Id just continue to have strep throat,0.344323307
thats what I would continue to do,0.387646914
I would not have had them out at my age,0.291424632
so,0.99999994
mhm,0
yes,0.999999881
and they were actually I spent alotof time in Iraq and Afghanistan,0.284468353
and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you,0.372871935
so its its collectively a scary situation all the time because youre in a country and kindof a situation where not everybody likes you,0.308403432
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just dont want you there,0.409057617
so when we would hafta go,0.306664526
any time youre on the road youre essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks,0.303690553
so youre constantly having to watch and look around,0.352023423
one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you dont stop on the road,0.291312128
you just you always keep going,0.616687417
you always keep going keep going keep going,0.577916741
and we were part of a convoy,0.299107999
it was like a,0.387135386
but I guess,0.66138798
or he didnt get the memo that you dont stop because it makes you a target,0.273589879
and he decided to stop for some cows,0.300956488
so he decided to stop,0.380646527
and we all lost our xxx,0.29982245
Imean we were like,0.433865964
what are you doing,0.506122887
but you dont wanna get out because that also makes you a target,0.322992533
so everybodys,0.749606431
get back in the vehicles,0.36244452
get back in the vehicles,0.36244452
and youre having to yell it,0.295095503
so it was a little bit of a of a crazy situation,0.30031839
the whole thing probably lasted maybe two minutes,0.354294986
maybe two minutes,0.414525837
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to to everything,0.311255485
so yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation,0.296465397
yes,0.999999881
this person they have dfklpu,0.589460969
Imean they have the ability to talk,0.387601584
they are dont have the skill base in talking with adults though,0.284158796
its a friend of mine who teaches at a,0.260359883
so she spends alotof time around,0.313493818
so when it comes time to,0.430912852
more its being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time,0.34290719
I think theres probably some selfesteem issues that go with that,0.358454555
so shes not out,0.348533362
shes not socializing,0.34449172
and then when she does go its like,0.303595543
its like,0.499013186
or if theres something thats bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like youknow,0.304750383
do you wanna talk,0.574002743
do you wanna talk,0.574002743
do you wanna talk,0.574002743
and you dont ever say anything,0.370315909
so eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as thats just part of that persons behavior,0.330347449
and thats how theyre theyre choosing not to communicate by,0.335964441
okay,0.99999994
so little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer,0.210864261
he had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him,0.270003319
but his dad said,0.342343509

I hafta watch tv,0.355560184
so little Billy was kicking the ball around by himself,0.253234416
and then the ball went too far,0.320604205
and it went,0.362026483
and it smashed,0.364111453
little Billys dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said,0.215704352

his mom said,0.353414834

so,0.99999994
okay,0.99999994
so Cinderella was living with her father,0.303656906
her mother had died a long time ago,0.296421736
and her father had decided,0.445696175
its time that you had a mother,0.358282894

and theyre like,0.41118592
she looks familiar but we cant quite place her,0.293025106

and at midnight bingo,0.322668552
and everything goes back to normal,0.401278406
but she still has the other glass slipper,0.322465301
so she says,0.449297577
