but I love to work in the garden,37.5
and I was working in the garden,57.14285714285714
and allofasudden it was getting youknow I was getting a little not dizzy but I just wasnt feeling right,35.0
and I thought,33.33333333333333

and I went shopping,25.0
I was looking for curtains,60.0
and it was getting later because I always like to get home by three oclock to watch my program,31.57894736842105
so on my way home I was passing another store i which had curtains,50.0
so I thought,33.33333333333333
so I went in there,20.0
and as Im walking around all of sudden Im like the,69.23076923076923
nothing hurt,50.0
nothing hurt,50.0
but it was just getting weird,33.33333333333333
and I thought,33.33333333333333
so I thought,33.33333333333333
so I thought I better go home,28.57142857142857
Im driving and Im by myself,62.5
so I went home got ea cooled down and I had a something to eat,46.666666666666664
and then I sat and my story came on,33.33333333333333
and I dont remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything,33.33333333333333
but allofasudden my son who lives with me hes calling me,58.333333333333336
and he comes home about five oclock,28.57142857142857
and,0.0
and he says,33.33333333333333
he says,50.0
he says its,66.66666666666666
I says,50.0
and he says,33.33333333333333
he says,50.0
so between that time when the story was about to start and five oclock I was out,41.17647058823529
but I could talk,50.0
I could walk,66.66666666666666
I could nothing nothing bothered me,83.33333333333334
but I got in the kitchen and I stood there,40.0
and I said to him,60.0
so I took a a few more steps and I says,36.36363636363637
he says,50.0
we were making lambchops on the grill,57.14285714285714
and I had them marinated,40.0
and I says,33.33333333333333
so he he told me,60.0
and I says,33.33333333333333
I didnt even know where they were,62.5
he says,50.0
and I didnt even know what a refrigerator was,50.0
and then I started to get not scared but I thought,18.181818181818183
but I didnt know anything that was going on,60.0
in my mind I did but I couldnt get them out,58.333333333333336
so he looked at me and he says,50.0
I says,50.0
so I have a daughter who lives in Vernon,44.44444444444444
and I said to him I says,57.14285714285714
and he looked,33.33333333333333
I said,50.0
so I couldnt get her name out,50.0
so he called her,50.0
he realized what I was trying to get,50.0
so I got her on,60.0
and I told her,50.0
I says,50.0
so she says,33.33333333333333
I says,50.0
so then allofasudden her name came,16.666666666666664
because its going through my mind,66.66666666666666
and I says,33.33333333333333
and I started to cry,20.0
so she says,33.33333333333333
then she got her other phone and she called the doctor,36.36363636363637
and the doctor said,25.0
so they took me up to the hospital,62.5
she called her husband who worked down this end,55.55555555555556
and he came and my son took me to the emergency room,41.66666666666667
and I was there for oh I guess about oh twelve hours thirteen hours,28.57142857142857
and they didnt know what was wrong with me,60.0
because every question they asked me I said right off correct,45.45454545454545
everything,100.0
and count backwards,0.0
went right back,0.0
and we were youknow talking and I was walking around,50.0
and I hadta go to the bathroom,42.857142857142854
and I knew where the bathroom was laughs in the hospital,54.54545454545454
and I went there,25.0
and we came out and we were talking and talking,40.0
and the one doctor said,20.0
so meantime I didnt realize that I didnt know the names of my all my other family,52.63157894736842
so they they just kept me there,42.857142857142854
and allofasudden one doctor says,0.0
it was on a weekend which is a bad time,70.0
Februa Fridays,0.0
and he says,33.33333333333333
now when somebody doesnt feel sick and thinks theyre doing everything theyre not gonna say,42.10526315789473
especially on a weekend laughs,40.0
so we went home,25.0
so my my son inlaw took me home to her,50.0
and I was there for the weekend,57.14285714285714
and they had gone away for the weekend,50.0
not the the whole weekend just over overnight that one night,27.27272727272727
because originally I was sposta babysit for them anyway,55.55555555555556
so just by luck my daughter said to her husband,40.0
so because I had,50.0
so the father came up,40.0
and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart,42.857142857142854
I cried,50.0
and I just wouldnt stop crying,28.57142857142857
and then allofasudden Id sleep,0.0
Id sleep for hours,20.0
and I didnt realize it,50.0
and then we went the weekend we went to the doctors and,41.66666666666667
and I said,33.33333333333333
I says,50.0
so I ra I went home,33.33333333333333
I was,100.0
and about a week later they my doctors sent a neurologist to me,46.15384615384615
and when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me he says,58.82352941176471
he says,50.0
so thats how I knew I had a stroke,60.0
it was really really weird,40.0
but I I forgot so many things,28.57142857142857
ke in the morning every morning after I got my breakfast ready I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper,47.82608695652174
and,0.0
I looked at it and I couldnt get the words,54.54545454545454
I u I knew what they were but I could not say any of those words,62.5
and I what I did get to read I didnt understand,50.0
so I tried for a couple of days and like,40.0
after a couple more days Im sitting there and I thought,41.66666666666667
I started reading it,50.0
now I read a paper,40.0
and it didnt take me long but I worked hard at it,46.15384615384615
and every morning when I got up after I youknow into the bathroom and everything Id go back in bed and Id lay there,46.15384615384615
and Id think of my daughters family,37.5
theres four people in the family,42.857142857142854
theres two boys her husband and herself,37.5
I knew her name but I couldnt get his name out and the two boys,43.75
and I would just close my eyes and visualize it,40.0
and gradually allofasudden Id see their names,12.5
and gradually it would come,40.0
then I went with my oldest son with his family,50.0
it was tiring,66.66666666666666
and I did that at night too when I went to bed before I went to sleep,47.05882352941176
I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother were in all that,52.63157894736842
and it was a long time but it it worked,50.0
it really really worked,25.0
and I said to my daughter one day I says,40.0
I says,50.0
and I says,33.33333333333333
she says,50.0
I says,50.0
I says,50.0
she says,50.0
but it all came,50.0
its just now I I have trouble every once in awhile to get my words out,37.5
and that and when I write,50.0
its getting better,33.33333333333333
sometimes when I write,50.0
and allofasudden I look at it and I thought,44.44444444444444
and the first time I saw that was when I made my first when I was going to the store,60.0
my little shopping thing,25.0
I needed mayonnaise,33.33333333333333
so laughs Im writing and writing,28.57142857142857
I get to the store and I came to that word,54.54545454545454
I couldnt figure out what it was,75.0
the,100.0
and I couldnt remember what it was,62.5
and by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back,47.05882352941176
then I knew what it was,66.66666666666666
it would come,66.66666666666666
Id forget it again but then in it but thats the way it goes,43.75
I know everything but I still hafta I forget alotof things,36.36363636363637
but everybody says,33.33333333333333
youknow and its fine because I I laugh about it,60.0
because when Im with my friends and out I see people having trouble,42.857142857142854
they cant remember,50.0
and theres nothing wrong with them,57.14285714285714
so I think,33.33333333333333
but I have had so much pleasure here and learning,20.0
and so many people,0.0
I says,50.0
and I says,33.33333333333333
I said,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
but I says,33.33333333333333
and I says,33.33333333333333
and I says,33.33333333333333
and I says,33.33333333333333
and I says,33.33333333333333
yes it has really helped,40.0
still helps yeah,0.0
it is,100.0
for each one,66.66666666666666
alright the story is about a boy playing soccer,44.44444444444444
and he breaks a window in a house,50.0
and then,0.0
and the soccer ball coming through the window to hit him,36.36363636363637
and then he gets up and hes looking out the window holding the soccer ball,43.75
and thats about what he has for the whole story,63.63636363636363
but it more or less is a lesson for him that you dont do that kind of ball playing so close to buildings to houses,46.15384615384615
and,0.0
well theres one thing that I have been always happy about what happened to me,56.25
ke the fortunate stroke that I had that wasnt too bad was it was in nineteen seventy five I had cancer,45.45454545454545
and I had a s okay masectomy,28.57142857142857
and I came through it very well,42.857142857142854
and there was alot that was in there,50.0
but I got it through finally,50.0
so thats what about thirty some odd years already,50.0
and Im very proud of that,42.857142857142854
and I was the first one in the family to have cancer,41.66666666666667
and then allofasudden other members of my family,25.0
immediate youknow my living home family,16.666666666666664
they have come down with it,83.33333333333334
and theyre gone,50.0
and I have always been very thankful that I came through the way I did,60.0
and the doctors were amazed because it was so fast that I I healed and everything,56.25
I didnt go home the way alotof people who have masectomies,33.33333333333333
and at that time it was about five years later when they started to come out with the,50.0
how do you call it,80.0

before I did not,50.0
no,0.0
no not for two or three years,14.285714285714285
I have a good speech therapist,33.33333333333333
her name is JeanieLastname,50.0
my first stroke,33.33333333333333
Ive had two strokes didnt one on each side,45.45454545454545
the first stroke,33.33333333333333
when did you have that one,66.66666666666666
on in ninety four I think wait wait no two thousand four,33.33333333333333
and I forgot family friends husband everybody,28.57142857142857
I could I couldnt remember anybody,71.42857142857143
I didnt know how to drive,42.857142857142854
I started hitting cars because I thought I didnt know where I was going,53.333333333333336
I didnt even know how to start a car,40.0
and maybe like three years then I was able to start driving,16.666666666666664
and then my speech got better,16.666666666666664
I still have I have some difficulties still with with numbers youknow,41.66666666666667
but I can speak alot better than I useta be than I was,53.84615384615385
well probably in the last year its gotten much better when I started at the aphasia,43.75
before I was very youknow unsure not confident,37.5
but youknow when I speak to people everybody talks to me I talk to them,60.0
and you get a nice rapport with them and you feel better,41.66666666666667
oh I speak English,25.0
I useta speak Spanish,25.0
no,0.0
when I had my my first stroke I forgot all the Spanish because I needed to concentrate on the English,55.00000000000001
so it just went,25.0
I do a little Spanish now but its,37.5
youknow I do try but sometimes it just doesnt come out proper,38.46153846153847
if Im upset or something I start youknow the words dont come out,53.333333333333336
I just get more flustered,20.0
what else,50.0
I think the saddest day was probably when my father passed away,50.0
and that day I had gotten a raise from my job,54.54545454545454
and I was so depressed,40.0
six months later I had my stroke,28.57142857142857
and nobody really knows what happened,33.33333333333333
because now Im heavy,40.0
before I was very slim,60.0
and before I was youknow I was very happy,55.55555555555556
I was I would always be with my dad and my mom but theyre divorced,62.5
but he was youknow the light of my life,55.55555555555556
and so when he passed away I just couldnt take,45.45454545454545
it it was just too much for me,62.5
and then I had my first stroke,28.57142857142857
and I then I would start thinking youknow,37.5
now I cant because hes not here,44.44444444444444
and I couldnt continue working,33.33333333333333
youknow because what I useta I useta work at a legal office,50.0
and I useta hafta read land leases or sell sites,10.0
and,0.0
and I just couldnt read them especially when I had my first stroke,42.857142857142854
I like I said I couldnt even read,44.44444444444444
I still have trouble reading,20.0
so it was just it was probably the worst times of my life,53.84615384615385
the happiest time is probably when my husband bought me a dog a service dog,46.666666666666664
and he is the light of my life,62.5
he is great,66.66666666666666
I love him,66.66666666666666
he takes care of me and I take care of him,54.54545454545454

yeah its crazy yeah,25.0
I can hear AmazingGrace at a funeral and,50.0
dont ask me why,60.0
because youknow Id be able to be cracking a joke for me or something during youknow youknow the playing of AmazingGrace,54.54545454545454
but youknow it youknow its just very very awkward,22.22222222222222
well it it happens too too often,28.57142857142857
and youknow watching a tv show youknow,14.285714285714285
it might be something stupid like the Bachelorette,75.0
if I come in and my wifes watching a show and youknow if they have a little n snmlu,36.84210526315789

and the first picture shows a a young guy playing soccer,27.27272727272727
he kicks the ball,50.0
and he must be too close to the house because he put the ball right through the window,55.55555555555556
and as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed,52.94117647058824
and he knocked the window,40.0
so he did considerable damage I guess,28.57142857142857
and the last picture shows the homeowner youknow holding the soccer ball and looking out the at the guy,36.84210526315789
so I can only imagine what happened on the if the fifth picture if there was one,52.94117647058824
well I guess it shows a woman and probably her son,36.36363636363637
and he wants to go outside I guess,25.0
and she says,33.33333333333333
and hes he didnt wanna take it,44.44444444444444
and she offered it to him twice I guess,55.55555555555556
and he still didnt take it,42.857142857142854
he goes outside,33.33333333333333

the girls crying for her cat,50.0
oh the reason the guy cant get down is because his ladder fell down,53.333333333333336
so hes stuck in the tree,42.857142857142854
and the dog youknow bark,20.0

I think it couldve been extended with the expansion of the words more than just twenty on the object and twenty subject its subject,52.0
after awhile that gets a lil,50.0
yeah atleast to me it did,50.0
to others probably not,25.0
knowing the depth of the group that you have,55.55555555555556
but to me it got really p after awhile I got tireding,50.0
bltu,0.0
so I like a small expansion with with xxx words wouldve been nice,50.0
I dont know if you could do that with the group or with the coming group,58.82352941176471
it would it be pkblu,80.0
well it depends on probably where the person is,55.55555555555556
where the where the person sits in that that group,70.0
if they if they reach a certain mark then Id Id then I said say,35.294117647058826
if they dont they stay on the same words,50.0
and they keep going through it youknow,42.857142857142854
and I doubt that that some of the people would would be able to take that kind of expansion,57.89473684210527
it wouldve been putting an awful lot of pressure on them,66.66666666666666
so that was good,50.0
but it got a little boring towards the end,44.44444444444444
I think it more severe at the beginning than it is now,58.333333333333336
but yeah when you say,40.0

tell me how,66.66666666666666
well I havent done that lately,42.857142857142854
but it is really the best thing going,37.5
the what you do is you get the peanut butter and and and and jelly all together,41.17647058823529
and you hafta kindof look at it and say,33.33333333333333
okay Ive got myself a loaf of bread,55.55555555555556
and Ive got a a firm and a and a a lighter loaf,50.0
and Ill choose the firm though because the peanut butter is gonna be sticky and when you spread it,40.0
especially with one hand left hand,16.666666666666664
thats gonna tear the bread,42.857142857142854
and so the lighter loaf cant do or youll end up with with your bread all ripped up,50.0
so you take the thicker loaf and slice it down,40.0
and slice it into two slices each about inch,44.44444444444444
and took those and lay them down,42.857142857142854
and take the peanut butter first,16.666666666666664
and bread,0.0
and the bread wont tear,33.33333333333333
that bread stays the same,40.0
then you take the the the tlu,57.14285714285714
oh its good tasting jelly,20.0
so you dip,33.33333333333333
and you spread,33.33333333333333
and it is on top of the peanut butter because I guess because if you put that on first the jelly and then the peanut butter it would splatter all over,51.61290322580645
so you spread the peanut butter,33.33333333333333
so you got a loaf s,33.33333333333333
and you take your bare piece of bread thats thats thats thats thats not used,45.0
and you pick it up and put that on top of the whole thing,50.0
and itll press it down just enough that itll start the jelly falling of the edges,55.55555555555556
and then you pick it up,50.0

I stopped at this in Petersan,66.66666666666666
and they were having they were having artwork there youknow,50.0
and I talked and when I went in when I went in there alot of the e one of the women I actually knew her,52.0
and t she she actually ran for a representative,44.44444444444444
xxx she lost last year,20.0
and she also writes books,20.0
and Ive seen her talking about this,62.5
she wrote a book about this this man that was in Worldwartwo,66.66666666666666
and he he was caught in the baton s,55.55555555555556
when somebody when they die,80.0
a march,50.0
did I can I say that right,71.42857142857143
and that man when I was young when I was eighteen he he would he he he he talked to me,76.19047619047619
and he said who he who his name was and everything like that,69.23076923076923
and he told me that he was always in love with my art,61.53846153846154
in Worldwar this is in Worldwartwo,66.66666666666666
and but and he was he was his name was FirstnameP,54.54545454545454
and he wasnt he was about as tall as I was,58.333333333333336
and my aunt,33.33333333333333
and he asked her to marry him,42.857142857142854
and she said that no she wouldnt do it because she liked taller men,46.666666666666664
but he would tell me about this,71.42857142857143
but this woman that I was talking Sunday that she tried to be a she tried to to run for as a representative,52.17391304347826
and she and she lost,40.0
she useta she useta be a writer for a representative in in Massachusetts,53.84615384615385
when she was young she useta did,57.14285714285714
this and anyway,33.33333333333333
so I know I knew her,50.0
so I talk to alot of these people,50.0
and I was doing very well except I got to a word,50.0
and I told them,50.0
and she said nobody had any idea there was wrong with me talking until that until that time,55.55555555555556
and so they were getting youknow it was it was eight it was six oclock,53.333333333333336
they were all ready to everybody was all all done,70.0
and I bought I bought the book,42.857142857142854
and I was outside talking to this other man,44.44444444444444
and he was probably our age,50.0
I was Imean I was his age,71.42857142857143
and he was he was h he was slender,66.66666666666666
and he said that he had migraine headaches every two or three days,30.76923076923077
and he said that he had extremely bad magrnu,33.33333333333333
and he youknow and but he said,28.57142857142857
Imean we shook hands and everything,33.33333333333333
and he talked quite about what his problems that he has,63.63636363636363
and he told me how he has he s he suffered from that,61.53846153846154
and I had read recently that there were some new drugs that might help out people that have that,52.63157894736842
and he said that he he saw a doctor,55.55555555555556
and the doctor told him that it they gave him some of his drugs,64.28571428571429
and it didnt do him any good whats what not xxx,46.15384615384615
so that was so that was that,71.42857142857143
so I so I guess my little bit of story is is I said this quite a bit before anybody knew there was anything wrong with me youknow,57.14285714285714
I guess the and I my feeling is is that I dont think Im doing much better,57.89473684210527
people will say boy Firstname sounds hes alot better,20.0
and but Im afraid that Im not getting much better,33.33333333333333
thats thats one of my,57.14285714285714
I think Im probably a little bit better than I was,50.0
but I still dont think Im really really well,27.27272727272727
youknow and Im always surprised when people tell me,30.0
youknow because to me it sounds horrible to me,66.66666666666666
this is how I feel about it,85.71428571428571
is that because I I think that I was very good at at speaking,71.42857142857143
and I knew I knew so many different things,22.22222222222222
and I was witty and things like that,50.0
and so Im not h Im not depressed or anything like that,35.714285714285715
and Im hoping Im going to do better,40.0
its just that I dont think Im doing that,63.63636363636363
youknow okay,0.0
actually I dont think Ive had any problems,50.0
I think that I remember everything wonderfully,57.14285714285714
and as a matter of fact I wanted to tell you about about,46.15384615384615
I was with FirstnameG,75.0
and I was driving,50.0
I was driving a van,60.0
and we were going at the HomeDepot,57.14285714285714
youknow and for year for a long time I could not say HomeDepot,38.46153846153847
so I I admit that Im alot of the words Im doing alot better than I than I was,61.904761904761905
ke it took me maybe a month before I could say BaldwinHillRoad which is where I youknow where I live,60.0
and I actually I was probably since I was like one year old I lived in the same in the same house,50.0
so I actually knew knew how to say it,33.33333333333333
so when I was with it was like our it was our it was eight sixteen two thousand thirteen August,65.0
and I was driving,50.0
it was about nine oclock at night,42.857142857142854
and we had just left HomeDepot to buy,25.0
I was actually she had an apartment in her in her,72.72727272727273
the this lady who had lived there for twenty four years had died recently,42.857142857142854
and we were fixing up her apartment,57.14285714285714
and one of the things was that her the the bath had an old steel tub,50.0
and we just bought a,40.0
and Im good at finding deals,28.57142857142857
and I found a nice a nice new tug,33.33333333333333
and we were just bought it in my van,55.55555555555556
and and so then we were gonna have a supper we were gonna go suppering now,27.77777777777778
so I was on route I was on BostonRoad,66.66666666666666
and I was driving,50.0
and this is about nine oclock at night,37.5
and she said,33.33333333333333
she said,50.0
and apparently what happened is that I had paralyzed,55.55555555555556
I was i,100.0
and on the she said that one of my eyes youknow I my I couldnt see on this side,60.0
its like this whole whole side,50.0
and I was driving,50.0
I managed to get the van on the side of the road,50.0
and it was right where we were going to the restaurant,63.63636363636363
and and then I would just hold onto the steel,40.0
and and I was so I was really lucky that FirstnameG was with me youknow,53.333333333333336
and and the other thing that was that worked out well is that there were there were there were doctors,50.0
and there were there was two nurses and a doctor that just happened to be driving their cars,33.33333333333333
and they saw it what happened,50.0
and everybody got out,50.0
and they all got me we opened up the door,60.0
and they got me down on the ground,62.5
and and they called up,40.0
what do you got that say it right,62.5
it starts with the truck,60.0
its its its not the right term for for the truck but they took her to and they took it to Baystate,59.09090909090909
and while it when I was there,71.42857142857143
and during this time I started losing the color,44.44444444444444
I could I could still see my vision but it was like black and white,53.333333333333336
we got to we got to Baystate and their emergency,50.0
is it emergency,66.66666666666666
well anyway y it it all came back to me,50.0
the color all came back,40.0
Imean I was on a diu,66.66666666666666
what do you call it,80.0
they carry people,33.33333333333333
dizu,0.0
dizu,0.0
I was on that,100.0
and they were taking me in on upstairs,62.5
I think I probably took I dont know if I xrays or something like that,56.25
or maybe it was like couldve been an mri or something perhaps,53.84615384615385
and then then I finally made,16.666666666666664
it was almost like one oclock in the morning,55.55555555555556
I was in youknow there was like a nurse a young nurse,58.333333333333336
and FirstnameG was here,25.0
and I wanted to I knew everything was happening,55.55555555555556
youknow I was saying to myself,66.66666666666666
I said,50.0
and so I wanted to so then I wanted to I kept on trying to talk to FirstnameG about what was happening,40.909090909090914
and I couldnt say anything,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
so they think that theres probably something alot worse than me,50.0
because I think I understood everything that was happening during during this whole thing that was happening,64.70588235294117
and so thats thats pretty good,25.0
okay well I was I was at I was at Baystate,72.72727272727273
and I was there for ke I think it was eight days,50.0
and then it was very not very far away,22.22222222222222
we went to Mercy,50.0
and I was there for ten days,42.857142857142854
and then I I was talking I was there they tried to seem,46.15384615384615
they I said to her,80.0
and I could do everything,60.0
I had no trouble,50.0
youknow they they started off youknow trying to move my youknow youknow how I can move and stuff like that,45.0
and and they actually after like two days they said,30.0
so I was actually talking I talked to this this this woman that was the speech therapist,58.82352941176471
and I talked with her for for like nine nine days I think,46.15384615384615
and then the last day last day I was there I think the ninth day I think I they they had this group of people,44.0
they had they had,50.0
that you would you would this one this one woman had I think you probably you probably knew her because she was from Umass,62.5
and she was going at that time,57.14285714285714
shes still going atleast almost a year,37.5
she was going to be youknow helping at Umass,44.44444444444444
so we had this group of people that suffered from from from speaking well,50.0
and I listened to youknow I listened to what she was saying,50.0
actually the whole group of e of people,37.5
and apparently they do that every,50.0
I dont know if they come every month or something,54.54545454545454
and they they talk to people about that,62.5
so and then and then after ten days I was there,27.27272727272727
we c decided that we went to in Amherst,66.66666666666666
and it was like rust,60.0
and youknow what happened is that the speech therapist would come,45.45454545454545
and she was there for like fifteen minutes,37.5
and shed do the same kind of testing that youve been doing,46.15384615384615
and is is like the same thing,57.14285714285714
and youknow it was like I had seen it,66.66666666666666
and and the next day another speech therapist,25.0
I think there was only a couple a couple of people,45.45454545454545
and she started the whole thing all over again,22.22222222222222
right,0.0
and she wasnt here that long,42.857142857142854
and then the next day this other person came again,20.0
and we were doing the same thing,42.857142857142854
but none of them,50.0
it was only very short period of time youknow maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving,40.0
and so I think FirstnameG and I we actually we actually went for a walk youknow because where she was isnt really that far away,42.30769230769231
so in the center of town we went to dinner,50.0
and we were talking,50.0
and she was saying,50.0
oh the other thing is the speech therapist had been there for like thirteen years in the same place,42.10526315789473
and she was and she was shes getting a new job,58.333333333333336
she was gonna lose she was gonna leave,40.0
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks,40.0
and now its getting youknow its the middle its the beginning,45.45454545454545
so I when would it was I just had I had a birthday there that week,56.25
and we were thinking that maybe we would stay,55.55555555555556
and I was gonna stay with FirstnameP and FirstnameYs house,27.27272727272727
I was gonna stay there,33.33333333333333
because I think what happened is that we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse,65.0
the nurse,50.0
and the thing is that that this,71.42857142857143
and this is what,75.0
they wanted to to youknow if I wanted to go to the to have my my bath and stuff like that,42.857142857142854
they wanted to take me,40.0
all of the people that worked there,57.14285714285714
they youknow and when I was in in I was in Mercy all of the they let me do it all by myself,73.91304347826086
and some of the nurses would let me do it at four oclock in the morning,56.25
I could I could go all by myself,75.0
I could I could they had like a room,66.66666666666666
I could I could take all my clothes off,66.66666666666666
I would Id take a nice bath,50.0
Id put everything back,40.0
and then I would even I I would like with my razor I would I would youknow I would I would,71.42857142857143
what would you call that,80.0
not my beard but I would cut my beard and things like that,46.15384615384615
and I didnt have any problems when I was at Mercy,58.333333333333336
no problems whatsoever,33.33333333333333
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the NewYorkTimes,37.5
thats basically the only thing I hadta try to read,27.27272727272727
and I would say if I read something like one section of the NewYorkTimes it would probably take me maybe it would take me an hour just to read one one,48.38709677419355
and then Id only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read youknow,26.31578947368421
ofcourse if it was maybe if it was an newspaper that was easier to read I might do better,57.89473684210527
but it was still the NewYorkTimes and the i editorials and things like that,42.857142857142854
I was having a hard time understanding it,50.0
but I had an ideara,40.0
so so so FirstnameG and I were going we were we were at we were having supper,52.94117647058824
and she and and she said,33.33333333333333
what she should do,75.0
I said,50.0
so then she tried to find people in in that area that would they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist,40.74074074074074
and this one woman came,20.0
and I really I really I thought she was quite good,45.45454545454545
but youknow what happened,25.0
I think they found one in Athol,42.857142857142854
and then I started to drive too,14.285714285714285
and if I could drive then you see you you couldnt have a person that would come to my house,57.14285714285714
right,0.0
so so what happened,25.0
I really liked this woman the speech therapist,37.5
but I hadta give her,40.0
and she had all of the she had all of this she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could I could probably learn with this,67.74193548387096
how do you say the right term,57.14285714285714
we I started doing that,60.0
youknow she would do things like writing a picture,44.44444444444444
thered be pictures or something like that,62.5
and wed be like,60.0
youknow and the clock would be wed be on like a twelve,61.53846153846154
and itd be on six,66.66666666666666
and itd be on three,66.66666666666666
it would be on youknow it would be on eight or something,75.0
and I would hafta write write it down which one it was,58.333333333333336
so that was how I started doing with the with the speech therapist,61.53846153846154
but then I couldnt youknow I I couldnt drive,45.45454545454545
youknow Id we we cant let her keep on coming,41.66666666666667
and and she knew I could drive,42.857142857142854
and its and Im gonna still Im gonna go Im going three times a week to see FirstnameE,34.78260869565217
and,0.0
yeah okay so thats basically it,28.57142857142857
okay,0.0
oh,0.0
and you remember you started you youknow you were starting to do some of the work with me,55.55555555555556
and you had like pictures,20.0
and I hadta ke try to say what the words were and stuff like that,40.0
yeah I remember that,50.0
I was remembering that,75.0
and I was and I remembered that I was having a hard time to say what the words were,52.63157894736842
and youknow and you in the beginning it was pretty easy,45.45454545454545
and then ofcourse the words got more difficult,12.5
and so Imean that was alot of the work that you did,50.0
and I think the reason why you were involved that you were involved with that is that we were worried that we couldnt even find a speech therapist,62.06896551724138
and I think thats how FirstnameY found you youknow,40.0
and then we finally then we then we did find someone to go down to Athol,43.75
so and then you were also telling telling me that because I had recently had that problem having trouble with with the what had happened in that part that my then I needed I needed everybody to ke to become,50.0
what do you what did I hafta say what it,70.0
my my brain was was still needed to be get better,45.45454545454545
I hadta get better before I could I could come over here to have to have you help,38.88888888888889
so we waited,33.33333333333333
we hadta wait,33.33333333333333
so do I wanna tell,40.0
you said you wanted another story,50.0
this is just a story about how I met you,70.0
how I met you,75.0
I thought that was pretty I thought that was pretty I thought that was very important that this was gonna help me,56.52173913043478
okay,0.0
yup,0.0
well this is a this is a boy,75.0
and hes hes kicking a,57.14285714285714
and I know what kind of like,42.857142857142854
its a ball,66.66666666666666
its a sklu,66.66666666666666
and she,50.0
and ofcourse what happened here is he he he kicked the the ball,53.84615384615385
and he hit the a window,50.0
maybe its his neighbor,50.0
and or maybe it was his father,42.857142857142854
I can call it his father,66.66666666666666
his father is in the living room,57.14285714285714
and hes sitting there,40.0
and he actually kicked the ball,33.33333333333333
and it went it went on the other side,44.44444444444444
and it fruu,33.33333333333333
and it actually hit I guess it hit the lamp the lamp too next to his perhaps to his father or a r a neighbor,44.0
or maybe it was like a young man,50.0
I dont know who it is thats here,60.0
and youknow the problem over here is is that he he looks like hes standing up,58.82352941176471
and this this fourth one is hard to tell exactly what this is,46.15384615384615
whether,100.0
this looks like this could be this could be,88.88888888888889
whether this is like a a ball or whether this is his brain that got knocked outof it,72.22222222222221
I dont know,50.0
this looks like its opened here,50.0
I dont know what this is,71.42857142857143
this doesnt this isnt very,57.14285714285714
its hard to tell very much of this otherthan theres somebody standing up,42.857142857142854
I dont know what that person is holding is holding onto,58.333333333333336
if its sposta be that it could be this,88.88888888888889
I dont know what it is,71.42857142857143
okay,0.0
thats all I can say,66.66666666666666
mhm,0.0
okay,0.0
I guess he wanted the,60.0
this thats what the,80.0
youknow I I,66.66666666666666
the umbrella,50.0
okay the umbrella,33.33333333333333
finally I got to say umbrella,16.666666666666664
the little boy wanted the umbrella,33.33333333333333
and his mother had it,40.0
the mother doesnt look very happy,28.57142857142857
she doesnt actually its hard to tell anything about how she looks,53.84615384615385
she changes over here,25.0
so or he either that or he tried to grab it from her,46.15384615384615
Im not sure,25.0
because it looked like something happened,66.66666666666666
the second he looks like well hes going to leave,36.36363636363637
and shes gonna she still has the umbrella,50.0
so heres the the little boy,33.33333333333333
hes actually getting wet,40.0
hes walking,66.66666666666666
and hes getting wet,40.0
and now hes really getting wet because its probably really coming out alot,35.714285714285715
you can see right here,40.0
its like this in pltu,80.0
well hes a pool s,33.33333333333333
pool s,0.0
hes on this this pools on his shoes and stuff like that,61.53846153846154
so hes back in his house,42.857142857142854
and hes all covered with water,42.857142857142854
and his mother she doesnt look like this was a great decision on her part,56.25
she doesnt look happy,40.0
its hard to tell really but its kindof like the cartoon is,41.66666666666667
its hard to tell what she really looks,37.5
so I guess that she decided shell let him use the umbrella,41.66666666666667
and its still really raining,20.0
but he atleast hes dry with the umbrella,44.44444444444444
yeah,0.0
well this is pretty funny,40.0
well this is a little girl who has a cat,50.0
and the cat is up the tree,57.14285714285714
and I dont know if she was driving,55.55555555555556
she had her ci she was on a tricycle,66.66666666666666
so and heres a little the dog is up to is at the tree too,46.666666666666664
and hes barking,50.0
maybe thats what caused the the cat was afraid or something and went up there,37.5
either that or theyre afraid of the sun,44.44444444444444
Ive always said that as a joke,62.5
so so heres the ladder,20.0
now what it looks like the the maybe the ladder was up there,53.84615384615385
and it fell over,50.0
and so now the this is funny because now the this man maybe its maybe its her her father,52.63157894736842
because hes hes up there too,37.5
hes hes lost,60.0
he cant get down,60.0
and so what happened over here,16.666666666666664
a firemans over here,50.0
and hes gonna perhaps hes gonna save both the his,50.0
and then theres a a bird up here who probably enjoys this whole thing,33.33333333333333
its not gonna run,20.0
now Im xxx,25.0
looks like its some looks like somebody draw a picture of a dog on here,60.0
yeah not years and years ago,0.0
nah I dont remember it,50.0
sure,0.0
www,0.0
well the first page is its on the lefthand side,50.0
it looks like maybe its could be it could be their mother and their two daughters,62.5
and they had like a little they had a little cat,36.36363636363637
and the little cat,25.0
they all look kindof like nervous to me,62.5
they they didnt look like they were the little girl was the two little girls they look like they were dangerous people,56.52173913043478
and the cat looked like it was somebody that,66.66666666666666
the the cat was like a funny looking cat too,50.0
and on this side there was a like a little girl,45.45454545454545
and she was very nice looking,33.33333333333333
and Im not sure who this guys sposta be,50.0
hes hes a man,50.0
and hes got like a beard,57.14285714285714
not a beard but what would you call that,55.55555555555556
mustache,0.0
and he seems like a nice person,42.857142857142854
and he was inviting them to come into their house,50.0
I dont know exactly what I could say about this whole thing,53.84615384615385
if I was a little girl I bet you I could remember all the details on this alot better than I could right,65.21739130434783
so so then I think what you you get to see this this castle from the distance,47.05882352941176
and I think theres this young young woman,33.33333333333333
and she looks like she works there,42.857142857142854
she probably works at the at the somebodys house,55.55555555555556
and she probably hadta like her job was to ke clean,36.36363636363637
and she was she was trying to help out,55.55555555555556
she probably wasnt rich,40.0
but I think they were looking,50.0
the the major part of the story I think Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna continue with this is that they were looking for a for a young for a young a young man handsome man who was gonna get married,60.416666666666664
and they were and he was he was probably in the in the,76.92307692307693
what do you call that place again,57.14285714285714
I said it right but now Ive forgotten what to call it,46.15384615384615
the castle,50.0
they were gonna have like a dance there with music,36.36363636363637
and and they had this glass shoe that they found the right one that would fit,43.75
that would be his that would be his his wife,90.0
so alotof people came to the to the castle,44.44444444444444
and they had the they were dancing,57.14285714285714
and and I think this this young woman who was very good looking she was like she hadta work there,45.0
maybe it was her maybe it was the mother or something,63.63636363636363
but she had her two daughters older daughters werent very attractive,25.0
and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would somebody this handsome man was gonna marry her,47.82608695652174
so so she was so mainly I think they went,40.0
Im not calling it a dance,57.14285714285714
I know Im sorry,40.0
and Im trying to think who the who the who this this am this sweet lady whos like,65.0
shes a magical person,40.0
and shes gonna like,33.33333333333333
so this this poor this u poor girl she needed to have a beautiful dress,33.33333333333333
but I dont think she had anything,50.0
but this,50.0
what did they call it,80.0
this this that woman that could make things happen,55.55555555555556
I dont know what you call her,62.5
but she wound up going to the going to the dance in this beautiful dress,53.333333333333336
and and what had happened is that she was gonna at at the head of of twelve she hadta run back home again because she would all of that that magical dress and everything was gonna be was all gonna be gone,55.55555555555556
and shes gonna have her her clothes that she just worked down in the in the cellar or in the floor or wherever she worked,55.55555555555556
to go back to work,20.0
so she was trying to run away from this beautiful man that wanted to marry her,37.5
and she lost this the glass the glass shoe,44.44444444444444
so she managed to make it,33.33333333333333
youknow she ran away,25.0
she lost she lost that that that the magical shoe that she was wearing,64.28571428571429
and so they what they did is they they hadta find all the all the different women that perhaps would wanna marry him,60.86956521739131
if they had they hadta fit the right glass shoe,40.0
and I think they kindof they had it they had that they had the that they had the shoe,57.89473684210527
and they hadta decide,25.0
everyone was gonna come and try to put it on,36.36363636363637
and the only one that could put it on was the young woman that didnt have any money was poor,52.38095238095239
and she put it on,60.0
and then they decided that she was the one that was gonna that hes gonna gonna marry her,50.0
I dont know,50.0
thats kindof like,50.0
how would I would do it,83.33333333333334
well the first thing I would have is a knife,50.0
and I would have a a a plate,62.5
and I would have some bread,50.0
and depends on what it is,66.66666666666666
if if the bread was never uh if it was it was whole youd hafta take a knife,57.89473684210527
and youd hafta make two sights,14.285714285714285
I dont know what youd call it,55.55555555555556
when you when you have bread and you cut it into two pieces what do you call that,61.111111111111114
anyway I have the this,60.0
what Im gonna do is Im gonna have Im gonna open up the the,55.00000000000001
see Im forgetting what the names of things are,60.0
and then the peanuts,25.0
and the and the the other one starts with an,50.0
its kindof white,33.33333333333333
and it looks like,50.0
it starts with an fl,60.0
and what you do is you put them together in the bread,66.66666666666666
and then you could cut it in the half or something like that,61.53846153846154
and that would be your sandwich,66.66666666666666
but I cant think of what you call that funny name,50.0
that white thing that taste is probably tastes really good with the peanuts,38.46153846153847
Im sorry,33.33333333333333
yeah I was trying Im trying to think of what you,58.333333333333336
slights,0.0
is that Im close to it,71.42857142857143
the slight,50.0
yeah,0.0
closer,0.0

two thousand and one,0.0
yeah,0.0
I was at work,75.0
I was at work,75.0
and people came down,25.0
one of the women came down,50.0
and she said she was talking that her husband called the telephone called him,50.0
and one of the planes too,33.33333333333333
one plane hit,0.0
it was probably,66.66666666666666
what was it,100.0
it was eight fifty nine in the morning I think,50.0
and at first they thought it was like a small airplane,54.54545454545454
and it hit the it it hit the Twintowers,55.55555555555556
but then they realized it was really it was north and,45.45454545454545
I think it was north and south,42.857142857142854
is that the different towers,60.0
and they thought that it really was a much bigger airplane,45.45454545454545
and anyway her husband said that he had heard that maybe theyre,46.15384615384615
this is later on that there was they were like,70.0
all around the country the other buildings were gonna get hit,41.66666666666667
and but basically we saw that there was really the the pntnu,41.66666666666667
and the other plane,25.0
and then this is this was a number of I think there were four four planes,50.0
the other one people that were were riding got up and tried to like talk they got it to hit the ground,36.36363636363637
and lemme think what else happened,16.666666666666664
I think there was four planes,33.33333333333333
and okay yeah,0.0
so there were two there were there were there were there were two of the Twintowers,43.75
two h two different planes hit that,14.285714285714285
and and then the Pentagon hit,16.666666666666664
and then the other plane they actually got it down,40.0
and and the plane never hit anything,28.57142857142857
it it hit the ground,60.0
okay,0.0
yeah,0.0
yeah,0.0
but it was funny because they thought that it was gonna that it was gonna,58.82352941176471
the her husband thought that it was gonna happen to alot more than that,53.333333333333336
where they where they got their information,71.42857142857143
they they they claimed that they could hear,75.0
I dont know what they did but they claimed that it might go everywhere around the country,55.55555555555556
but nothing yet we never ofcourse we realized that never happened,36.36363636363637
yeah okay,0.0

and he hit the the window,50.0
and in the back actually it was his it was his house,66.66666666666666
and inside the house it couldve been an an older man got hit by the ball,64.70588235294117
it hit the the window on the outside,62.5
and on the inside it went through the window,55.55555555555556
and it hit the person that was sitting,50.0
and and look like the person got up,37.5
and he l hold the held the the ball,44.44444444444444
and he was out looking at a big hole in the in the window,57.14285714285714
and he was trying to see who actually hit him,40.0
I dont know thats,50.0
this is funny,66.66666666666666
Im gonna call this a heavy carousel,44.44444444444444
because if I took a little Ill if I if I spend more time Ill say what it is,57.89473684210527
anyway itll come up to me,71.42857142857143
I know what it is,80.0
Ive been practicing,75.0
where you were doing on the,83.33333333333334
I was I was,100.0
umbrella,0.0
okay umbrella,0.0
thats why I called it a heavy carousel,55.55555555555556
I thought that was kindof funny,50.0
I meant that I meant that to be funny,55.55555555555556
okay so anyway Ive been talking about this and I havent really been looking at this,55.55555555555556
sorry,0.0
I dont know what this means,57.14285714285714
is it its either the little boy was going to going to use that,50.0
or either that or his,40.0
I guess,50.0
is he heading is he is he in the beginning of it is the little boy talking to his mother that he wanted to to use this,62.96296296296296
or he either that either that or he wanted it,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
Im Im not sure exactly how this is,50.0
so the little the little boy is still looking at his mother,41.66666666666667
and shes holding the the heavy parasol,50.0
and anyway hes out the house,42.857142857142854
and its raining already,25.0
and now its really heavy rain,16.666666666666664
and so he came back,20.0
hes back to his house,50.0
and hes covered with water,50.0
and the rain was heavy,40.0
and his mother didnt look like shes very happy,36.36363636363637
and it doesnt say exactly what happened to the juslu,45.45454545454545
but he has it now,40.0
and hes back hes outside again,25.0
and hes not get his hes not get hes not get his hes not hes not gonna on his head hes not gonna get hit by it,51.42857142857142
and he so hell be drier,33.33333333333333
I wasnt sure how how that worked with the mother whether she really wanted him to use it or she wanted to keep it,52.0
Im not sure,25.0
okay,0.0
okay,0.0
oh okay,0.0
okay this is kindof a fun story,42.857142857142854
this is like the so ke theres a theres like a little girl,60.0
and she liked liked the the cat,57.14285714285714
theres also a dog,40.0
now the dog could belong belong to to the the their family perhaps,53.84615384615385
or it could be somebody elses neighbor,57.14285714285714
and they had a dog,40.0
and the dog actually skedu,20.0
and the dog,33.33333333333333
and it was on the up there pretty high,44.44444444444444
so his,50.0
and the little girl probably was driving,28.57142857142857
I dont know what you call that it starts with a kl,61.53846153846154
its like a,100.0
anyways she she still she really liked the cat,44.44444444444444
so somebody,50.0
it was either,66.66666666666666
theres also a theres also a bird up here,36.36363636363637
but I dont think that that that has anything involved with the cat,57.14285714285714
I dont think the cat is afraid of the of the of the the the bird,70.58823529411765
so you would think that the little girl if she was strong if she was older she could help lift up the ladder and put the father back on,55.172413793103445
but she cant,50.0
and I dont know,40.0
she doesnt look like shes involved that that she has a small a telephone,62.5
and she could call up nineoneone or something sothat the fire people could come and put the ladder up and get his,45.45454545454545
and then and she also shes not gonna they like w birds so theyll theyll they wont try to hurt the the bird either,51.724137931034484
and they probably will get the,50.0
ofcourse the thing that would be kindof fun,50.0
if they were more interested in getting the cat theyd leave the father up there,43.75
I dont know,50.0
thats my little story,40.0
oh yeah I knew that was,50.0
I I saw,66.66666666666666
I saw it,66.66666666666666
I saw it,66.66666666666666
sure,0.0
okay,0.0
www,0.0
my version,50.0
well the first page these there are little girls,33.33333333333333
and theres a h theres a mother,44.44444444444444
and they had like a little a cat,37.5
and the cat,33.33333333333333
so those so and then on the second page I dont know if its her husband,47.05882352941176
and theres like and theres another girl,33.33333333333333
its possible that they that the mother had had three girls,54.54545454545454
and the two of them were kindof her pals,55.55555555555556
and maybe they were twins,40.0
Im not sure,25.0
but they werent very attractive,33.33333333333333
and the and the cat looked like it was alotof trouble too,41.66666666666667
it had a kindof it was almost like their mother,60.0
their mother didnt look like she was alotof fun either,45.45454545454545
and maybe perhaps it was her husband,42.857142857142854
and they had like a dog,33.33333333333333
and the dog looked like a nice dog,37.5
and little blonde girl was she was she was nice too,45.45454545454545
and the husband perhaps it was the husband,50.0
he seems like a nice person also,42.857142857142854
and the mother and her two little twin girls and that little and the cat are just trouble,27.77777777777778
so so whats happening,40.0
theyre we can see that this happened in a much later period of time,53.333333333333336
and the the the the three little girls got older,40.0
and two of them werent very attractive,37.5
and the mother was perhaps its her mother she much preferred the the two the two twin sisters that werent very attractive,43.47826086956522
and so they actually if I remember correctly the they useta let the little the little the pretty little girl hadta do crappy work,33.33333333333333
and she wasnt treated she much preferred the the twins if they were twins,53.333333333333336
so and I think the mother the young the young girl the at one time she was a blonde,47.368421052631575
I think her hair is u,50.0
she was looking at a beautiful dress,57.14285714285714
and she also looked out the window,42.857142857142854
and she saw this beautiful place where the,50.0
I hafta say how you call that right,50.0
it starts with a cl,60.0
its probably the head of the,66.66666666666666
if if there was like there was a town,55.55555555555556
he is either something like the y the mayor or he was a important person,60.0
he had like a young he had this this young man that perhaps was gonna be the king or something,47.61904761904761
Im not sure exactly how you say it,44.44444444444444
and its like,33.33333333333333
Im having a really hard time calling what the name of that place was,53.333333333333336
starts with a cl,50.0
castle,0.0
the castle,50.0
they saw the castle,50.0
okay,0.0
so so were were setting up here,42.857142857142854
we see the the young the the attractive young girl,50.0
shes our nice she had youknow she had shes older,41.66666666666667
she saw iz this very attractive dress,42.857142857142854
and she looked out the window,50.0
and she saw the castle,40.0
and this would be a nice,66.66666666666666
thats the area,50.0
so then the mother got a letter claiming that there was gonna be a a big dance or a big area where people,37.5
I dont think hes the king or whatever he is were all gonna take a look at this,57.14285714285714
its gonna be around,40.0
it must be its a important area because people were going to theyre gonna dance with this young man,57.14285714285714
theyre gonna have music,33.33333333333333
theyre gonna have food perhaps,28.57142857142857
it seems like a great time,50.0
but the main reason was is that all those all those young girls all around the country they would decide which one the the kings young son was gonna marry,51.61290322580645
hes gonna marry one of those women,44.44444444444444
and so I also I if I remember correctly the the their the pretty girl couldnt really go to couldnt go to this this this this interesting plriu,53.333333333333336
lemme see what you call it right,42.857142857142854
so theres a rr magic grandmother,28.57142857142857
and she decides that that the little that the young woman this young woman could could wear nice clothes,47.368421052631575
she could wear nice clothes too,33.33333333333333
youknow theres a beautiful white gown,28.57142857142857
and she would go,50.0
and she danced with the she danced with the young man who was gonna be the king in the future,57.14285714285714
and they seem like this is the one,62.5
and she had this there was a glassed,50.0
and alotof different people tried to put that on,22.22222222222222
and only one had the right the right feet that that would be able to wear the glass shoes,36.84210526315789
and so the so they the young man was ofcourse quite happy,33.33333333333333
and but the problem was is that things are gonna change at at twelve,46.666666666666664
theres a midnight time,40.0
and I think all of that,66.66666666666666
I dont know if this story says it rr was correctly that that they were all in this beautiful place,61.904761904761905
this this not a wagon,60.0
Im not saying the right term of what this thing is,58.333333333333336
but at twelve this thing that everybodys riding on turns into,45.45454545454545
you cant ride in it nicely,57.14285714285714
its,100.0
Im having a hard time when I was doing this,63.63636363636363
I it starts with a,80.0
that orange thing,33.33333333333333
it starts with a pl,60.0
and we were doing this when we were together,66.66666666666666
I couldnt say it right,50.0
and it starts with a,60.0
anyway thats it turns its got wheels and all of this,50.0
and and at the when it turns twelve the whole things gonna ke turn into something else,38.88888888888889
and everybodys gone,0.0
and there the girl the girl was xxx the the the actually the attractive young woman shes running away because its gonna turn twelve,42.30769230769231
and she still has one of the glass one of the glass shoe,38.46153846153847
so theyre looking the the king is wondering what happened to the other glass shoe,50.0
and people are going around to all of the different places,45.45454545454545
and went over to the the one house that the that the the mother had the two twins that they never really liked very much,48.0
ofcourse she couldnt fit she didnt have one like that,50.0
so then the little blonde girl the little blonde woman had the other,23.076923076923077
oh I know what they did,50.0
they found one,33.33333333333333
they found one that,50.0
and they had like their,40.0
and the only one that could do it was the one that was like doing all she was a worker,65.0
and she wasnt treated as nice as the mother and they the twin sisters,40.0
and she wound up she could fit that,62.5
and they decided this is the one,57.14285714285714
and the thing ends that theyre gonna get married,36.36363636363637
Im sorry,33.33333333333333

and alotof it was coming back perfectly fine,37.5
and then some of the some of them Ive added,72.72727272727273
Ive added that I really couldnt I wouldnt be able to do correctly,50.0
but I think Ive done a little bit better,40.0
like somethings planting youknow,25.0
it has planting in the ground or something like that,70.0
yeah,0.0
I dont know if theres anything else youd like me to say,53.333333333333336
yeah,0.0
yes,0.0
okay,0.0
yeah,0.0
a young man is kicking a ball,42.857142857142854
and hes really not looking where hes going to do it,46.15384615384615
and it comes over to a neighbors window,50.0
and the and the ball goes right through the window,40.0
and the its hard to tell whether thats its an old its an older its a,58.82352941176471
it could be a elder a young a old an older man not an older man thats sitting in the sofa,54.54545454545454
and the the ball just knocked over the lamp,44.44444444444444
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp,27.27272727272727
and and probably probably could hit the the third this third person here,30.76923076923077
theyre sitting here,50.0
so the the man stands up,50.0
and hes picking up the ball,57.14285714285714
and hes looking out the window to see who who probably threw it,50.0
yeah,0.0
well this is an umbrella,60.0
remember I couldnt even say umbrella,28.57142857142857
so the mother mother is holding the umbrella,37.5
and the little boy is is looking,42.857142857142854
and she probably saying saying goodbye,16.666666666666664
and she thinks,33.33333333333333
he said,50.0
but then hes out,20.0
and hes,33.33333333333333
you can see its even its even getting worse over here,36.36363636363637
and he hes back,40.0
comes so he runs back to his house,50.0
and the mothers there,25.0
and shes saying,50.0
theyre both looking,75.0
hes soaking wet,50.0
and the mothers looking at him,50.0
and shes gonna probably give him the umbrella,40.0
and hes going back,40.0
I dont know where hes going,62.5
hes probably going to school,33.33333333333333
and he has an umbrella,40.0
and now hes going back to school,37.5
yup,0.0
and,0.0
yup,0.0
well the little girls looking at the at the,55.55555555555556
theres a tree here,40.0
and now this thing probably was start I think this was started that the dog was running after a cow,50.0
and the cat ran up the tree into a a a,63.63636363636363
how do I say this,80.0
oh a breach,33.33333333333333
Im doing two with and Im not saying it right,50.0
anyway its the its part of the its part of the tree,66.66666666666666
so this is where the cat eventually got up was up here,50.0
so the little girl couldve been couldve been actually seeing the the dog a chasing the cat,57.89473684210527
and but anyway she she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down,36.84210526315789
she was probably riding a ic tricycle,42.857142857142854
so the probably her father put the ladder up on the limb limb the limb and went up there,36.84210526315789
and the and the ladder fell,33.33333333333333
so the its pretty high up,50.0
and the cats up there,20.0
and the the man is way up high,37.5
and he doesnt have a ladder,42.857142857142854
and his and by the looks of it his actually his daughters more interested in the cat than than her father,57.14285714285714
or thats or its a man perhaps,37.5
and theres a bird on the in the tree also but I dont think theyre involved in,55.00000000000001
yeah and I dont think theyre afraid the cat or anything like that,46.666666666666664
so the firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going to first take the the father down,30.0
and then theyre gonna get the cat,33.33333333333333
and the little girl will be happy,42.857142857142854
and the the dog,50.0
who knows whats gonna happen to the dog,50.0
its gonna probably chase after her the cat again and find another tree,35.714285714285715
I dont know,50.0
Cinderella,0.0
oh yes,0.0
yup,0.0
www,0.0
okay,0.0
on,100.0
and theyre not very attractive,16.666666666666664
and theres a theres another girl whos a blonde and quite attractive,40.0
same age,0.0
but she hasta do things to ke do all the work,27.27272727272727
and the I think that the the mother,62.5
and Im not sure whether that the mother the attractive one is part is shes shes part of the family or one of a younger a younger woman,45.16129032258064
well with with the with this mother,71.42857142857143
Im not sure how that works out,50.0
theres a handsome man too,33.33333333333333
Im not sure that thats her husband,44.44444444444444
and youknow and maybe youknow thats the reason why he has those two the two the other two woman that arent very attractive,36.0
so hes the the young the young lady is looking looking over the over the window out into the city and sees the the ss castle which Im sure that who whos probably the king of the of that area lives at the regular city,54.166666666666664
and the the the people live in a regular in the the house regular house with the mother and the and the other the other three young women,46.42857142857143
and two of them,50.0
I dont even remember if if theyre twins,50.0
Im not sure the the they have ke dark dark hair and stuff like that,37.5
so shes the the king wants to have a party for his his young his young son,44.44444444444444
and itd be nice if he might if everybody in the city that are they get a letter,73.68421052631578
Im not sure everybodys gonna get one but theyre gonna have this dance,23.52941176470588
and theyll they could actually meet the this young man coming up,53.84615384615385
so the the young the young girl the blonde lady is like down in the has her own room,57.89473684210527
or maybe it could be in the basement or something,60.0
and shes looking at at a at the different ah the,66.66666666666666
what do you call that,80.0
the dress the dress is not apparently its not perfectly beautiful in the,46.15384615384615
and the other the other,40.0
so theyre going when theyre going to the party,63.63636363636363
and actually three of the three of the girls the two twins,41.66666666666667
and shes shes going,50.0
and theyre not,25.0
I think part of that Im missing whats happened,54.54545454545454
well anyway what what happens is that the the the young the young girl talks to the magical grand grandmother,50.0
I know Im not using it correctly,50.0
and she she has a magical,50.0
I cant think what did I call it,66.66666666666666
anyway it turns her into a beautiful white dress,44.44444444444444
and she also has the her shoes are made outof glass,36.36363636363637
and shes dancing with a young with a handsome man,54.54545454545454
and they seem like theyre getting along,62.5
and ofcourse the the women the other the other children theyre probably adults now arent really that happy about the fact that she has a beautiful gown and and shes dancing and obviously the young gentleman prefers her,41.46341463414634
and they also know that that that all of that the beautiful dress and everything like that that was given by the this magical grandmother,64.0
I know Im not using this right,50.0
knows that at twelve oclock everything will will change,55.55555555555556
and shell hafta like shes gonna hafta run away,27.27272727272727
so right she realizes that its almost twelve that e that evening,41.66666666666667
and shes running away down the stairs,50.0
and she lost the glass shoe,33.33333333333333
and and all of the she had a castle,55.55555555555556
not a castle,33.33333333333333
well she,50.0
Im having a difficult saying how this this young woman was riding,53.84615384615385
but anyway at at o at twelve oclock everything goes back to its original what it was,52.94117647058824
and so shes gone,40.0
shes back at the house,50.0
and the king found this beautiful glass shoe,25.0
and he wants to go all the way around around the city and try to find this this woman,36.84210526315789

and the everybodys really pleased about it,42.857142857142854
and they realized that the the king,57.14285714285714
I guess hes a prince,50.0

and the more I did that the better I could get at it,61.53846153846154
and I would say really at the end I would do if I was if I would if I would do twenty of each I would probably be nineteen or twenty youknow,62.5
I thought I was very close I was very good at that I thought,57.14285714285714
and and then the last thing I did is I was doing ns I was writing nsin snssz,38.88888888888889
Im not saying it right,50.0

if I was trying to write a sentence about it youknow,54.54545454545454
I I was trying very difficult,50.0

and I think the Ipad is the really the thing that that started me doing that youknow,52.94117647058824
I dont know if what Im if if if thats fine,64.28571428571429
yeah yeah,0.0
yeah,0.0
sure,0.0

I just I just walked in the door and I knew that,50.0
its not gonna be me,50.0
okay,0.0
well I think in the beginning there was the little girl,45.45454545454545
she she really loved her cat,50.0
and the cat went up the tree,42.857142857142854
no its not,33.33333333333333
so she tried to get it down,42.857142857142854
so then I think that was probably her father,44.44444444444444
so shed say she said to the girl said to her father,41.66666666666667
so the the the father took a ladder,50.0
and he went up the tree,50.0
and maybe this is why the cat went up there though,36.36363636363637
I I guess the dog the dog caught the the cat up up up the tree,56.25
so anyway the the ladder fell down,42.857142857142854
and the the father was caught up there,37.5
so and ofcourse years ago she would hafta go home and call and call up the fire the firemen to come but now she probably has a smartphone and she could call up the firemen,31.428571428571427
and theyre gonna come back,28.57142857142857
and theyre gonna get not only are they gonna get the her father,37.5
theyre also theyre gonna get the cat,40.0
and I think that theres a nice bird up here,36.36363636363637
and the bird the the bird is is is just looking up there,46.15384615384615
and its kindof like singing about,50.0
I dont know what its gonna be singing about but shes gonna be happy about it,55.00000000000001
I dont know,50.0
something like that,100.0
I tried to start in the in the beginning and you could see it progress,53.333333333333336
mhm,0.0
sure,0.0
oh okay,0.0
yup and,0.0
www,0.0
Im not good at telling this story,37.5
in the beginning I guess it was like an old town probably in Europe,57.14285714285714
and there were there was a mother with little girls,40.0
and the and then there was a blonde girl who when she was young I dont know what she was doing but she useta help she was helping,51.724137931034484
she didnt really do great work,28.57142857142857
Imean she wasnt she wasnt part of the family,54.54545454545454
and I think that the the mother with the the two girls,58.333333333333336
and they had black hair,20.0
and they werent very attractive and when they were young,45.45454545454545
and the little girl when she was,57.14285714285714
I think they were probably nine or ten,37.5
and the little blonde girl looked she looked basically the same,27.27272727272727
when she got older she still was very attractive but she did she was doing she was just doing work down in youknow down in,56.00000000000001
she was doing work like washing clothes and and cleaning the house and things like that,37.5
so anyway I Im not sure whether thats the king or the mayor or something thats gonna,42.857142857142854
theyre sending a letter to everyone that they were gonna have a dance or,56.25
I guess there was a castle in the background,55.55555555555556
and they were invited to go to see the her son her her son who,46.666666666666664
and Im not ofcourse when I even when I was young I dont remember this story youknow to be honest with you,50.0
but I think that the the the young man wanted to get married,38.46153846153847
whether he was I dont know if he was going to be the king in the future or whether he was just an important person young important person or something,54.83870967741935
so they they they invited probably,50.0
I dont know if the people were probably had more money or something like that,50.0
but the mother she was kindof an evil person,44.44444444444444
and I think that the older those two little girls now that theyre older theyre I dont think that theyre theyre theyre not,44.827586206896555
youknow theyre not wonderful people either I dont think,27.27272727272727
so the the little the blonde the blonde girl she was looking at beautiful a dress,50.0
no thats not a dress,33.33333333333333
if Im saying now xxx term dress,37.5
is that a dress,75.0
I guess its a dress,60.0
pictures of it and stuff like that,57.14285714285714
and she was thinking about she has the three mice and the the cat and the and the and the horse,47.61904761904761
that was part of her jobs down in the youknow maybe its in a barn or something like that,68.42105263157895
and so I think what got things alot better is that the fairy godmother helped her out when she went to the dance,47.82608695652174
and so the there was a pumpkin turned into this,50.0
so the the fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a,50.0
I dont know what I could call that,66.66666666666666
and the and the the the horse the I think maybe the three the three mice became theyre gonna carry this rri carriage,44.0
xxx its a carriage,50.0
they they they went to they went to the dance,70.0
and she looked gorgeous,25.0
she had she had a beautiful dress and she was a blonde and everything,50.0
and she danced with the the prince,57.14285714285714
and but what would happen at at at the at noon at the not noon at at twelve oclock the everything was gonna go was gonna return,48.275862068965516
so the the three mice are gonna turn are gonna turn into theyre gonna theyre gonna go back to like mices,40.74074074074074
and the the the other horse or something like that was,63.63636363636363
theyre all gonna go back to the to the barn or something like that,62.5
so she says,33.33333333333333
she runs away,33.33333333333333
and she had like a glass slipper,28.57142857142857
and she and she was running away because it was gonna be right at at at,58.82352941176471
I keep on saying noontime but its like twelve oclock,30.0
she so so anyway the the king and his a,50.0
it it it was actually one of his his like his like lieutenant or something like that went all around the city or the large town,57.692307692307686
and she,50.0
and the the prince was hoping if she,62.5
so she,50.0
and she actually found the the the blonde this,55.55555555555556
I dont know if she was a maid or something,63.63636363636363
she was doing that kind of work,57.14285714285714
and she had a glass shoe that matches with the one that the the king or the re mayor something,50.0
and they said,33.33333333333333
and all the other women would try to put on the glass slipper,38.46153846153847
and ofcourse youknow it would it wouldnt fit,44.44444444444444
and especially the this evil mother and and her two daughters were not happy about it at all,33.33333333333333
so then at the end she had the glass slipper,40.0
and at the end you could see that the prince and that the blonde woman are gonna get married,45.0
I was trying to do it,50.0
sure,0.0
I think its its August,60.0
and it was a Friday,60.0
it was about eight fifty eight eight fifty nine,22.22222222222222
it was almost nine oclock,40.0
I was driving on the BostonRoad,66.66666666666666
I was driving a nineteen ninety three Ford van,33.33333333333333
we had just gone to a HomeDepot,57.14285714285714
and and she brought,25.0
a bathroom s,33.33333333333333
a bathroom s,33.33333333333333
it was made outof fiberglass,40.0
and then I showed her a thirty foot long ladder that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less,40.74074074074074
and then I started driving,20.0
like I said on BostonRoad,40.0
and I was going to Yuno,50.0
and FirstnameG looked at me and she said,37.5
and I wasnt going very fast anyway,25.0
so I managed to ke not hit anything,37.5
and I managed to turn right,16.666666666666664
and I pulled off of the side of the road,60.0
and I put on the brakes,50.0
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that,58.333333333333336
I was holding on to the wheel,71.42857142857143
and then and that was that was,57.14285714285714
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor,36.84210526315789
and they all could see something was happening,62.5
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground,46.15384615384615
and then somebody somebody with a smartphone called up an ambulance,54.54545454545454
and they said,33.33333333333333
and after that I it took me a long time before I could say Bay BayState or something like that,60.0
and youknow I was saying to myself I said,55.55555555555556
and then I tried to say something to FirstnameG,22.22222222222222
and then I couldnt say anything,42.857142857142854
and then I couldnt say the right words,33.33333333333333
Imean I knew what I could say but I couldnt say it,53.84615384615385
and thats when I realized that that I probably had a stroke,53.84615384615385
I think thats,50.0
have I said said that before,66.66666666666666
oh okay,0.0

well in the beginning theres a little girl,44.44444444444444

I dont know if its male or female,44.44444444444444

maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get away to this far away as possible,37.5
either that or the the dog wished the father hadnt fallen down the ladder,46.666666666666664
so then theres a bird,33.33333333333333
I dont know how what the the the bird is involved,66.66666666666666
its gonna its its making a song perhaps,55.55555555555556
and theres another ladder thats involved with the firemen,54.54545454545454
and theyre trying to lift up the theyre gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his,47.82608695652174
if the if the cat was more important ofcourse the the firemen would get the cat first and then the r the and then then then get the the father down,41.935483870967744
is there anything else,75.0
yup,0.0
yeah youknow I I,50.0

Ive forgotten what I should call the right term to call the grandmother,50.0
yeah yeah,0.0
oh I cant look at it,57.14285714285714
okay,0.0
www,0.0
okay the version,33.33333333333333
okay,0.0
in the very beginning theres a mother,50.0
there are two two daughters,20.0
and Im not sure,20.0
theres another woman young girl,33.33333333333333
and shes a blonde,40.0
and she has blue eyes,20.0
and the the two the two daughters have dark hair,30.0
and theyre young then,20.0
and then then this continues in the future,37.5
time is going on,50.0
and the the girls are much older,42.857142857142854
and the two two daughters are not very attractive,22.22222222222222
and the blonde lady has her hairs now kindof light brown but her you can still see her blue eyes,30.0
and shes,33.33333333333333
in the beginning I have no idea why that young the blonde girl is there,53.333333333333336
whether shes an shes like,71.42857142857143
something happened to their family and theyre just taking you theyre gonna live,50.0
so anyway Im not sure about that,37.5
so so anyway shes like her friends are all other mice,41.66666666666667
and the cat seems kindof evil to me,37.5
the cats alittle evil,25.0
theres a horse theres a horse there,44.44444444444444
there all these little there are three or four mice,30.0
and the they realize that theres that theyre going to theres a theres a king,57.89473684210527
and he has a son,40.0
and they they n theyd like to have a dance because they would like to marry the the son whos probably a prince,48.0
and so they invite everybody in the town,50.0
I think,50.0
or just people that have alotof money and youknow the,20.0
so theres a litter,40.0
and they could they could go to a prawn,66.66666666666666

its okay,50.0
and theyre going to the dance that evening,55.55555555555556

and the horse is beautiful,40.0
and the the thing shes gonna carry and is very interesting,38.46153846153847

Cinderella wouldve gladly come to with to be with all of the other creatures who got to be there in that wonderful place,54.166666666666664
but she ofcourse was not allowed to come,25.0
then her fairy godmother showed showed her a whole pile of Versace that she looked really good at,38.88888888888889
and and and for a little bit of awhile she was allowed to go with these creatures while all kinds of of extraordinary kinds of extraordinary coachmen coachmen were riding through all of this place,48.57142857142857
the n the prince who was necessarily unhappy with the scabrous looking women that were that were hanging around in his house decided that that that Cinderella was really much much more charming and wondrous than she had knew she had thought herself,51.162790697674424
and so she,33.33333333333333
but at that point the it became clear that the that the the the belle of the ball the the the the the,69.56521739130434

and ofcourse the the scabrous and nasty creatures were horrified that Cinderella would wouldve been the other person that they were that they were looking for,59.25925925925925

I think we just shut it all down and and just sat there and began to try to deal with it a little bit,33.33333333333333

though where she was she she came from noone seemed to know,58.333333333333336
mother was very mom her her mother was very angry with that idea and thought well I suppose that Cinderella can simply be a servant this for her for herself and for her own two daughters,50.0
and sure enough thats what Cinderella mostly did,22.22222222222222
she s she mostly worked terribly,33.33333333333333
and as she was and and the the other three daughters were ofcourse hideous and and and vicious,33.33333333333333
and they they were of they were they they they they they really they didnt stay in the in the in they didnt sit stay in the in the,74.19354838709677

there was a there was a you could see the the the kings castle look looking kindof twinkling in in everybodys eyes as as they looked besides,59.25925925925925
but luckily there was something that that that helped Cinderella during this time,53.84615384615385
mostly some rodents that that appeared n constantly in in in in what wouldve been I guess a very needed wouldve needed a a,53.84615384615385
oops cant do it never mind,28.57142857142857
lets forget that part,25.0
and also there was a horse lying around and I think maybe a dog aswell,26.666666666666668
at that point the two other daughters of of of their mother heard that there was going to be a special ball today presumably for the princes birthday or something like that,50.0
and there Cinderella thought,0.0
and she got she got the a little a little dress herself,50.0

shes a servant youknow,40.0
and they are they were the hautesadj old bourgeoisiesn of the place,58.333333333333336
so they said,33.33333333333333
and there was just no no no point in in her being here,46.15384615384615
fortunately for Cinderella who wouldve been no doubt weeping in for for the the misery of not being at the at the castle n Cinderella had a fairy godmothmother,60.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
I will get your I will get you a beautiful dress,63.63636363636363
here comes trouble,0.0
coach,0.0
a magic coach that that that you can ride,66.66666666666666
and sure enough there were also two beautiful horses that were not like the mangy old horses that Cinderella knew,30.0
they move then to the the the beginning of the of the of the ball,73.33333333333333
and allofasudden the the princes,40.0
and she danced with him,60.0
and they danced the the ball together happily for many time many hours,30.76923076923077
however Cinderella also hadta stop because the in the in the at the at the at the croak,66.66666666666666
no xxx,0.0
at the at the croak,80.0
and and so she hadta walk back from from the the the the the the she she had to walk she hadta drive back,50.0
but allofasudden but at that point she also no longer had her beautiful gown,28.57142857142857
at this point the the king,66.66666666666666
this the the this the prince said to the king,70.0
and they looked all around to try to to discover her but she they they couldnt or not readily,30.0
eventually they came up to the to the the place where Cinderella,66.66666666666666
no no sorry,0.0
where the the two nasty creatures that normally bat inhabited the place would would have their would have their their missing slipper,50.0
and they tried each one,40.0
and the these these nasty creatures were unable to to to to to fit with the were unable to to to to fit the slipper,32.0
however Cinderella was,33.33333333333333
and they were delighted to be able to discover her,40.0
and they brought her back to the castle where she she eventually lived there and and married with the king,45.0
that was sloppy work,50.0
I shouldve done better with that really,62.5
yes,0.0
first I would I would get some bread,62.5
and then I would probably get some butter and slop the bread out,38.46153846153847
and then I would I would get some I would say probably jelly,53.84615384615385
Id slop the the jelly in,42.857142857142854
Id Id bring it all back,25.0
then I will would cut the other portions of it,60.0
then Id eat it up,50.0
well I think that we were I was I was hoping that I would really just be able to get all of them all the time,65.38461538461539
and I think we were close to being able to do that,50.0
and maybe the little the little hiatus here has not has not been good because I should be thinking about this,52.38095238095239
but somehow I I I really found that I could really do it again,50.0
youknow Ive seen alot of that of those names and stuff so I didnt I didnt sit there thinking about it,45.83333333333333
perhaps that wouldve been a good a good thing to do,50.0
because its really not that one doesnt know these things,54.54545454545454
its more like just the its just like these are quick quick things that you hafta say quickly,50.0
and and and it does just allofasudden something off something oh kindof physical xxx,35.714285714285715
and thats it,50.0
youknow you cant you cant really figure it out,54.54545454545454
so so what did I think about that,62.5
I dont know,50.0
Imean all of these games are kindof fun,50.0
and and they they enable us I think to to see these these to see the the these pictures are moving around,45.45454545454545
and I think from that point of view I think we can all imagine that as as as something that that is a kindof a logical set of motions,62.06896551724138
but youknow its it seems like the the difficulties with seeing those individual names they that seemed like it was a big deal,56.52173913043478
whereas sitting around working with the with with youknow with a couple of of of of games like,61.111111111111114
whats the name of that one again,50.0
see I cant even tell you the names of them,54.54545454545454
but even so I think there was we were making those things,50.0
youknow it was it was like looking at the youknow from the from the from those,81.25
its not my its not my day today,50.0
thats all I can tell you,71.42857142857143

well lets see,0.0
for some reason a young a young man who was was living in his parents,60.0
its not his parents,50.0
the lets try it again,40.0
for some reason Cinderella was was discovered living with the the Galumpy Galumpky family of of of of Sweden when when allofasudden they discovered that this brand new kid in the in the house,58.82352941176471
somebody that they dont know before whos whos living there,61.53846153846154
the the the three horrible Galumpkys Gonoral and Ragen turned into the the most awful ach creatures ever and began to make make fun of them at these poor people while the thing was going on,38.88888888888889
then as as it happened the Galumpkys were were waiting to to get the invitation for a beautiful wedding,47.368421052631575
not a its not a wedding sorry,42.857142857142854
when the theres going to be a big party of some kind or another,60.0
so they go out there and theyve got all their fancy clothes,38.46153846153847
but there is there are once again the these these the Gonoral and Ragen are so awful and stern o droning and and and youknow,28.000000000000004
and eventually it looks like theres gonna be no fun for poor Cinderella at all,41.17647058823529
so shes she goes away,33.33333333333333
and she cant she cant be voi invited for the the rest of the the party,66.66666666666666
so she goes over there,20.0
and and suddenly shes been sitting around most of the time calling or talking to youknow barnyard animals which is what I guess you hafta just live with once youre if youre an orphan,48.64864864864865
and and allofasudden they said,20.0
and here comes,0.0
what is her name,75.0
the this magical creature is gonna fix everything for you,54.54545454545454
and and she she has all the all of her her clothing is wonderful,64.28571428571429
and a magical a magical,40.0
wait a second,33.33333333333333
so then the the fairy godmother is going to look at this and see how wonderful that these two women are,42.857142857142854
so they go,33.33333333333333
no his his,66.66666666666666
sorry,0.0
his,100.0
nope its not working,25.0
lets try it again,25.0
Cinderella wanted to go to the to the the ball but she couldnt,50.0
but now but with the,40.0
whats the name of that fantastic creature,50.0
with with this fantastic creature who will deliver give her this beautiful new new gown theres theres no reason to to to be worried about that because its gonna look absolutely beautiful for all time,44.73684210526316
so there the the s,40.0
I guess hes a king or or some such,40.0
no hes a prince,40.0
thats what it is,80.0
ofcourse hes a prince,40.0
and and allofasudden the the prince,33.33333333333333
so but youknow when when the when its its time for the clock to to to get get,44.44444444444444
but when the clock clock strikes then then Cinderella hasta hasta to run away before that comes,23.52941176470588
so now theyre waiting on to see what happens,40.0
who is this new Cinderella this strange and wondrous person that thats with us,53.333333333333336
because weve never seen him,66.66666666666666
so the the the prince says,50.0
and and so they look first at the at Gonoral and then Ragen and said,26.666666666666668
whereas suddenly when Cinderella is is shown they say,55.55555555555556
and now she can go,40.0
and youknow with Im assuming that assuming that they can get married immediately for all of this,66.66666666666666
then the the the prince will be delighted with Cinderella,60.0
and they will live happily ever after,42.857142857142854
yes,0.0
well that shouldnt be that difficult because Ive known been known to have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,35.0
first I get some bread,40.0
then I get some peanut butter over here,25.0
and then also its time to get some some,33.33333333333333
its not butter,33.33333333333333

xxx,0.0
oh,0.0
mhm,0.0
thats an interesting question isnt it,50.0
well it seemed it it probably presumably you could actually do this on on a on a less high tech,55.00000000000001
but it is nice to have,33.33333333333333
and it it it has several different functions,37.5
one is the,66.66666666666666
what do you call that thing,66.66666666666666
know yourself,50.0
that the the thing we always talk to together,55.55555555555556
the,100.0
thats one one thing,20.0
then theres the stprwtu,40.0
and theres the the the the the the basic media of the of the thing,68.75
so it has alotof different uses I think,25.0
so it I guess its its probably exactly what you need for your,61.53846153846154
well Imean sure,0.0
because youknow something got t got better here through the through the whole operation I think,43.75
youknow it certainly seems thats that seems to be the case because I was really flailing there at the beginning,47.61904761904761
and and then I flailed again when when I was trying not to look at the at the letters,47.368421052631575
youknow just I would I would just push it,55.55555555555556
so that and that seems to have been the second way to help help myself here,43.75
is because then I I could get to the point where I could sortof write these things a little bit,60.0
and and actually everyday this is getting a little better now,27.27272727272727
Im still using the using the the whatchamacallit,55.55555555555556
the the,100.0
yes,0.0
yeah the the Ipads great actually,33.33333333333333
it works perfectly well,25.0
and I do really like a Ipads as a as a genre,58.333333333333336

a young orphan was brought to the house to live with two there where where two odious women were where two odious women were holding forth,42.30769230769231
when they began at at the very beginning the Cinderella as her her name would would be known later was now just a a kind of a servant waiting waiting on these two women and their foul mother,52.63157894736842
Cinderella noticed the the beautiful the beautiful,42.857142857142854

where the the young prince could meet all of the other women that were around in the valley,61.111111111111114
Cinderella would gladly have taken had had gone to that party except she was not allowed,56.25
the two hideous women were all deck decked up looking their very best,38.46153846153847
but Cinderella was not allowed to go,14.285714285714285
at that point a fairy godmomother,50.0
here the the two women who lived in in the house were were not very attractive,50.0
and the prince was not much interested in them,44.44444444444444
but in turn in time he discovered that Cinderella was really quite charming and delightful,33.33333333333333
and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit a bit longer,46.666666666666664
but then came the stroke of midnight,28.57142857142857
and she she got back her her her she got back to her her to her to her room and had a wonderful time,58.333333333333336
the prince there would would still had not found the the the the the perfect woman that he adored,63.1578947368421
so several people started looking around to see them and to decide which one was really Cinder was like n which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted,31.03448275862069
one after another several of these terrible creatures proved that she could not she could not fill fit the the the she couldnt fit the the portions the the could not fit the,58.82352941176471
lemme try it try it again,33.33333333333333

well Cinderella was was apparently adapted,33.33333333333333
and so they they hadta they hadta to to work all the time and hadta to deal with the the the hideous sisters while they were they they were just having to having to to get to be her work person,43.90243902439025
so at that point then there was a moment where the the prince wanted to meet all of the eligible women in in the in in the the the town,56.666666666666664
and as Cinderella was thinking,40.0
but they said,33.33333333333333
only only the only these the terrible creatures that that were that were living in the house are the only ones that could really do this,57.692307692307686
then there came a,50.0
what do you call those creatures,66.66666666666666
its a its a a magic personage,71.42857142857143
a,100.0
what do they call those e creatures,57.14285714285714
anyway this magic personage wanted to change all of the the all the all of the things that Cinderella wanted to to to to read to to,44.44444444444444
she wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened,46.15384615384615
and it was the this magical creature that made that all possible,58.333333333333336
then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw the prince,16.666666666666664
and the and the and the prince s,37.5
whereas the the the horrible creatures that that lived in the house no had no real particular interest in the the prince,54.54545454545454
sooner or later then the the prince was was was doing quite well,38.46153846153847
and but it was time for for Cinderella to leave because she hadta do that,46.666666666666664
and and and eventually then this the the the wonderful time that they had disappeared,46.666666666666664
nevertheless the everybody wanted to to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for,52.94117647058824
and yet that was not to be the case,44.44444444444444
then only and then only did Cinderella take all of her of her fancy clothes once again and sure enough was exactly the person that that they were hoping for,43.333333333333336
then the prince went clomping back to the to the the whatever they are to all these to all of the the workers that they hafta deal with,71.42857142857143
and sure enough the prince did see her,37.5
and they decided to live happily ever after,25.0

they told they told me or they told my sister that they were gonna let me youknow rest for twenty youknow for twenty four hours and evaluate it which was the most asinine decision they ever made because by waiting and I dont know remember the medical terms but basically I was out,41.81818181818181

and she came back up the hospital the next morning,40.0

its been alot better than it was yeah,62.5
ten years youknow ten ten years right,0.0
I had encephalitis ten years before,33.33333333333333
and I hadta remember everything,40.0
so its in my head,60.0
but its how when you get it outof there so,50.0
I had I had ke encephalitis for it was about a month,50.0
I dont even remember anything about it,62.5
but I was in the but when I remember they got me to start up another time,58.82352941176471
hadta remember how to remember how Ill talking about abck one two three noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff,27.27272727272727
just remember how do you rewrite everything,57.14285714285714
just taking your time,25.0
but its still in there,20.0
and you cant just get it on there,33.33333333333333
you might talk acouple times about it,57.14285714285714
then youre talking about the decks,57.14285714285714
and then you forgot about that one,42.857142857142854
so its always kindof like that,50.0
but you can still do it,50.0
so Im still writing and preposition and all that kind of stuff,38.46153846153847
just sort of thing you can do,28.57142857142857
just keep make sure its still doing than better than it was,41.66666666666667
yeah oh its unbelievable yeah,20.0
mostly hadta remember how to,20.0
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get,35.714285714285715
its funny how my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that,60.0
I could go in the kitchen first,57.14285714285714
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that,54.54545454545454
the name,50.0
I dont remember anything about it with my head,70.0
I could sit there and making breakfast and stuff like that,36.36363636363637
and shed say,0.0
shed put toast and Id say,0.0
but eggs,0.0
but it takes time to get everything outof your head outta there so,23.076923076923077
alotof its there,33.33333333333333
but most of its just you cant get it outof my head on there,40.0
its hard to come back around everything like that,55.55555555555556
and also its also because when you talk to me doesnt get the same way coming back to me,50.0
and its also kindof weird because if you talk to one person and me it kindof kills me,44.44444444444444
but if you have another person here I can understand alot better with that,50.0
but its depends depends on how its coming on to me yeah,58.333333333333336
like I said I hadta remember doing abck one two three everything like that,35.714285714285715
they took me at oh to books for the first year,54.54545454545454
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that,66.66666666666666
just trying to get back where it was,37.5
I just write trying to just getting everything on there,30.0
so its its like that,80.0
its just hard,33.33333333333333
you start getting little things starting through there,25.0
but then I went to,40.0
I dont know if you go to Chicago,55.55555555555556
theres five weeks,25.0
there we got back how to do different things around there,18.181818181818183
how youre kindof think youre on this place I think then maybe a different one,47.05882352941176
its like you had different places you get around there helped around,41.66666666666667
but so it does get outof there more than you can,45.45454545454545
Imean the first time youre just going straight,33.33333333333333
and its hard to get anything outof there,25.0
but I dont know,40.0
is that did I tell you anything,85.71428571428571
when I was little first time,50.0
well it also can be that too for like I said for ten years its kindof I really hadta remember start everything,45.45454545454545
so I did get a remember,50.0
I did start up another time,66.66666666666666
so it did help,50.0
Imean my mom helped me,40.0
and different places theyve they help everything about it,50.0
but it is nice to get back up where you can go,50.0
the bottom,50.0
Imean it wasnt a real big deal because I couldnt go down,42.857142857142854
I hadta go up,25.0
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were,41.66666666666667
so its been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that,38.095238095238095
it helps alot better,25.0
okay,0.0
the boy was t outside with a with a soccer ball,54.54545454545454
and he was kicking around,60.0
and he kicked one really good,16.666666666666664
but it hit right in the middle of the window on the on the house there,56.25
so the next one over there her,42.857142857142854
gotta might have been sleeping and jumped out,44.44444444444444

and I think the the boy musta ran away,33.33333333333333

so because hes still looking to see what hes doing,50.0
okay,0.0

so hes moving onto the next,57.14285714285714
he says no big deal with the he doesnt the umbrella,50.0
so he got outside,25.0
and it rained,33.33333333333333
that was on number three,60.0
hes over there raining on him,42.857142857142854
number four,0.0
and its really raining him,40.0
hes gotten water all over the place,50.0
number five,0.0
he finally came back,25.0
and and he didnt look that very good,33.33333333333333
and she didnt she told him its not very good and probably smarter that he didnt take it,45.0
so next time hes gonna take the umbrella when it rains,38.46153846153847
www,0.0

but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder,33.33333333333333
but it fell down,50.0
so hes stuck up there the whole time,22.22222222222222
the dogs kinda barking at him xxx,42.857142857142854
really helping there,0.0
but the firemen are coming over there,28.57142857142857
theyve got another ladder,60.0
theyre gonna help him back up,50.0
but I dont understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree,56.25
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat,30.0
and the cat gets by itself anyway,42.857142857142854
its just kindof,33.33333333333333
yeah I dont know,40.0
its probably about what it is I think,75.0
so Im ready huh,20.0
okay,0.0
what it was she has shes not actually with the the people,61.53846153846154
but theres two,25.0
its not like theyre cousins or something like that,60.0
theres two girls,25.0
and were next by him and their mom,50.0
theyre really bad ones and stuff like that or not very very not very hasu,18.75
ofcourse shes not very good very good to her,30.0
then she always hadta work outside and do all the the hard things,30.76923076923077
and they dune,33.33333333333333
theyve got enough money and doing whatever they could,50.0
so they gave a time that they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the the money the,54.166666666666664
Im trying to say something,50.0
trying to say all the good people there,25.0
they had to go see them,33.33333333333333
and theres they got to play and music and stuff like that,30.76923076923077
so she would never get to go there,25.0
but I forget how,50.0
somehow she got in here,40.0
but she got to go,20.0
say exactly,0.0
it came that she had a very unbelievable great clothes and stuff like,38.46153846153847
they took her sothat one one night where they got to see everyone,46.15384615384615
and and actually it was the the guy who came to see her,46.15384615384615
he was probably the best one there,42.857142857142854
he was very nice and very the best thing he could,45.45454545454545
and he really liked to see her,28.57142857142857
but when it was done that time he,62.5
so he,50.0
and so it was all done,33.33333333333333
but the next day someone actually brought those to him,50.0
because it was his,100.0
because the only ones that are big enough for him,60.0
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that,36.36363636363637
so it didnt work for them,57.14285714285714
so it came to him,60.0
they just told him,50.0
so it came on to him,66.66666666666666
it goes to that,75.0
Im not done yet,40.0
the guy hes the the one guy that I saw,54.54545454545454
the two sing with him and play and stuff like that,45.45454545454545
thats where he was that night,71.42857142857143
so he came back to make sure it was her,40.0
so since its her hes taken with her,77.77777777777779
so its going to be with her for all this all the time and stuff like that as much as it could be for him,68.0
that tell you anything,75.0
okay,0.0
you should take a bread,60.0
get some butter outof the refrigerator with a knife,44.44444444444444
put some of those on the bread and also some of the,66.66666666666666
theyre not peanuts exactly,20.0
e closeby the peanuts,25.0
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread,53.84615384615385
so everything feels pretty good,20.0
except for your hand probably gets all over the place,50.0
but its a real easy one,33.33333333333333
you can do it for about two minutes,50.0
and thats a good one to eat if you if you you need to get something to eat,42.10526315789473
got enough,0.0
pretty much,0.0
something probably something to xxx,60.0
I think you just youknow you just take the you took the butters,46.15384615384615
the the peanuts,66.66666666666666
thats not the same thing,33.33333333333333
they sit in the its in the kitchen,75.0
put on a bread,50.0
and put it on a probably put it on a plate,54.54545454545454
go over sit down on the on the table,55.55555555555556
and have something to eat,20.0
I guess thats it,60.0
how it was,100.0
mostly when I started,50.0
I had a month I dont even remember anything about it,58.333333333333336
but it was like ten days,33.33333333333333
they finally got me in there to I finally started Imean I could actually talk or anything like that,47.368421052631575
but I had to remember how to remember everything,33.33333333333333
and were everything is gone back,50.0
I mean everything about abck all that kind of stuff like that,66.66666666666666
everybodys name,0.0
everybody the computer on there,60.0
the the Coke sitting there,40.0
everything,100.0
the wrong about it,75.0
you have nothing about it,80.0
you hadta remember everything about it,66.66666666666666
so we went to,50.0
I had like thirty thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first,32.142857142857146
and then we went to,40.0
after that thats when we started to talk and to get in the sort of thing,47.05882352941176
make sure Im forget something,50.0
its ten years before,50.0
but we did start ke abck one two three or something like that with my mom,50.0
started to its in books,60.0
I went there,33.33333333333333
there is someone we got a talk over there,44.44444444444444
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abck one two three and stuff like that,52.0
and it took a long time,33.33333333333333
it was about a year the start over that,66.66666666666666
and Ive gone down,40.0
it was Monday to Friday,60.0
now its down Monday Wednesday Friday,16.666666666666664
then after that theres a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks,46.15384615384615
just try to talk alittle better and that,12.5
because Imean at this time I could talk alittle better,50.0
but it just hard to get back everything outof there,20.0
so that helped different things about it for those six weeks,45.45454545454545
and youre trying with computer,50.0
or trying to try to write on there,12.5
trying to do something about it get alittle better there,30.0
and thats how they tried to,42.857142857142854
after that they started IU,60.0
and thats when they started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that,52.94117647058824
theres so much you couldnt remember anything about it,54.54545454545454
but its you just take your time trying to,33.33333333333333
me me and my mom my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that,50.0
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things,52.63157894736842
so it doesnt keep everything in there the whole time,45.45454545454545
so you just gotta keep everything keep where youre getting things youre doing there and still be able to talk,34.78260869565217
mostly taking my time,25.0
so if I talk too much people have no idea what Im doing,42.857142857142854
and they talk to me real quick,42.857142857142854
this is kindof weird because if one person talk,44.44444444444444
if theres three people I can understand other people,40.0
I can understand more of this,66.66666666666666
but so it takes time getting around everything,37.5
so so its just it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting alittle better,27.77777777777778
I dont know how long I can go,55.55555555555556
but its just it seems like Im still doing something with it,61.53846153846154
so and it keeps going over time,28.57142857142857
so so I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that,38.46153846153847
and the and its my moms very helping,37.5
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too,36.36363636363637
they need to do something like that,57.14285714285714
but I have my brothers too,33.33333333333333
one of them Imean one I dont see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other,50.0
so it just its not it as it used to be,54.54545454545454
I knew alotof people and all that kind,37.5
now Im kindof move down ke acouple people I knew and just take my time,37.5
so its alot easy as how it was,62.5
I dunno,50.0
is that come around or,40.0
xxx about it was like I said I had to remember everything,50.0
Imean I wasnt really didnt get me out that bad because I said,53.333333333333336
so you hadta restart everything to get back on there,20.0
so you took your time and tried to get through it,36.36363636363637
and Imean if youre going to yell at it its not gonna do anything for it,50.0
so youre the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that,53.333333333333336
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that,58.82352941176471
Id be outside and doing stuff like that or youknow,36.36363636363637
but it really doesnt bother me that much,33.33333333333333
Imean I just take my time during the day,44.44444444444444
ke Im Im gonna dry s,33.33333333333333
and I might go outside and working on the a branch or something like that,53.333333333333336
just keep going back and forth,0.0
ke Id Id go get my aunt,11.11111111111111
shes ninety seven,25.0
I get her on almost every times for a week,60.0
and maybe ke one day of the week and well see her,25.0
but I get her on the phone every day,55.55555555555556
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving,27.77777777777778
and and its another way to get through to me and everybody else,46.15384615384615
Imean alotof them cant understand what Im doing,50.0
but alot I know they know everything about it,55.55555555555556
so its easy about it so,50.0
just anything youre telling me or,57.14285714285714
I thought it was kindof totally different when I I I restarted here,53.84615384615385
I hadta remember how to do everything,42.857142857142854
which was it was kindof its alittle weird for every everybody too,66.66666666666666
because Imean I knew right away my mom could ask me youknow what this was in the kitchen or something like that,59.09090909090909
yeah I knew how to make it,42.857142857142854
I can make my breakfast and all that stuff,55.55555555555556
she goes,50.0
no cant remember,25.0
like that,100.0
I knew everything,66.66666666666666
its all on my head like that,85.71428571428571
Imean made my breakfast and youknow ke the eggs bacon microwave and the whatever ke things like that,33.33333333333333
and always be there in the morning,42.857142857142854
always my breakfast first,25.0
people think Im weird,20.0
but but but its just something that,42.857142857142854
it is another way I tried to keep doing what Im doing,53.84615384615385
but it also is doing whatever I need to do,40.0
Imean I hadta do everything like that anyway,50.0
so it took some time on that,57.14285714285714
and its it was a long time to do,44.44444444444444
but you had just took your time and do whatever youre doing I think,46.666666666666664
its I dont know how to,57.14285714285714
youre not gonna too quick,28.57142857142857
and you hafta do sometimes,20.0
so you just kinda do whatever youre doing but then a little bit farther,33.33333333333333
number one the the boy was sitting outside with a soccer ball,41.66666666666667
and he kicked a good one there,28.57142857142857
but it went over by the house over there went into the umbrella not the umbrella howabout the window,42.10526315789473
went into the through inside there it look,37.5
theres a guy sitting in number third,37.5
the soccer ball came in,40.0
knocked out the lamp,50.0
knocked him out too,50.0
he was probably sleeping I think and scared him out pretty bad,41.66666666666667
and then number four I gotta see what I can move around here,28.57142857142857
hes over looking through the window to see who it was,58.333333333333336
their probably probably ran away,20.0
but hes not very happy somebody threw the soccer ball into the window there,33.33333333333333
about it,100.0
mom told the boy that she,50.0
and she,50.0
on number two,33.33333333333333
number three he went out there and it rained,22.22222222222222
so hes walking,50.0
and its raining more,25.0
and hes getting his feet in there,37.5
but he got all the way back,42.857142857142854
and shes not very happy with him,37.5
moms very happy with him,40.0
and he knows,33.33333333333333
he had water all over the place,42.857142857142854
but next time he changed and took the umbrella with him,36.36363636363637
enough,0.0
okay,0.0
looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree,63.63636363636363
which they could do anytime I think,57.14285714285714
well I dont know,40.0
they cant get everything but theyre they do to know to enough,42.857142857142854
but the the girl shed like to get her cat back,27.27272727272727
but so shes waiting there,33.33333333333333
and her her dad decided he could go up there to help with that,42.857142857142854
when he took the,75.0
I know what it is,80.0
lak lddu,0.0
something close like that,75.0
but he took it up the top,57.14285714285714
and and it fell down,40.0
so hes gonna have trouble anyway,25.0
the cats too far away,20.0
but hes stuck,25.0
he cant get down,60.0
the dogs kinda barking at him for no reason driving him nuts,50.0
but but the firemen came in here,28.57142857142857
theyre gonna help for him,57.14285714285714
so theyre walking over this way,57.14285714285714
so theyre walking,50.0
and theyll get up here in a little bit,50.0
theyll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him,62.5
but the the birds happy,40.0
theyre on the other place over there away from everyone else,41.66666666666667
so theyre singing something like that,71.42857142857143
but its pretty much about what it is unless theyre waiting on he gets down and the cat doesnt wanna come down,58.333333333333336
did I get enough,50.0
okay,0.0
looks like for some reason they gave it seems like another cousin with them,64.28571428571429
they gave her with her aunt,66.66666666666666
so Im not sure why hes they send that way,41.66666666666667
but anyway whoever gave it said thatd be nice,40.0
well give it to you and stuff like that,55.55555555555556
and theyll keep and and theyll make it good for you too,50.0
but then the aunt,25.0
she made her pretty bad,40.0
she had to go work outside and and everything else,20.0
and again shes certain s,16.666666666666664
but her cousins,33.33333333333333
they got to do whatever they wanted,42.857142857142854
and theyre kindof a pain in the butt,55.55555555555556
but so thats how it was for all the time,63.63636363636363
she tried to be nice,40.0
but they were still not very nice,28.57142857142857
but the one time they were gonna have they were,45.45454545454545
I guess they do for the sometime the year they get to see everybody,50.0
so they went to see if this would be see,50.0
their their aunt,66.66666666666666
so theyre gonna go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that,26.31578947368421
but their cousin,33.33333333333333
but a what would you say itd be,77.77777777777779
not a ghost or some I dont know what,50.0
they had one they would bring on the way,55.55555555555556
thats not normal how the people and stuff like that,45.45454545454545
this was totally different,50.0
how they,100.0
but they,50.0
so she could go on that way,57.14285714285714
so she got to go in that place,37.5
then went to see there to that night,25.0
got up,50.0
she could go sing and play or was out there,30.0
got some people,33.33333333333333
and thats where they saw the big,50.0
its one of the,75.0
I think hes,50.0
I dont know if he is the king,66.66666666666666
or he might be just the new king coming there,40.0
he was out there,50.0
he was with her for a while,85.71428571428571
but then she hadta leave,20.0
and he is worried what happened her,57.14285714285714
but she left,33.33333333333333
and he was worried about that,66.66666666666666
but she did drop one of her shoes,50.0
so he had that,50.0
so they went back,25.0
she was going back her place where she was just n not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff,40.909090909090914
but her cousins,33.33333333333333
and they put them on there,33.33333333333333
and her feet are huge,40.0
so it wasnt gonna work on that,44.44444444444444
but then while theyre there they did he did bring them over to her,66.66666666666666
and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes,41.66666666666667
so he knew what it was,66.66666666666666
so he took her back,40.0
and thats one of the great or the best thing you could ever do,40.0
she went back,33.33333333333333
shes shes like a queen now,50.0
so best thing that came on that way,37.5
so enough,0.0
okay,0.0
you I would take two the bread,57.14285714285714
put it on on top of plate,57.14285714285714
I got some butter,50.0
and I really cant say what it was,55.55555555555556
its in the,100.0
well I took one of those out,57.14285714285714
so you take the knife and and just lot s,20.0
so you could flip both sides so comes in in the middle there,46.15384615384615
Ill take the knife and go wipe it off put it in the dishes something like that,52.94117647058824
usually get something to drink,20.0
Coke mostly,0.0
but go sit down on,40.0
and just in in your hands,33.33333333333333
and you got your got the sandwich,42.857142857142854
and should be pretty good,40.0
my speech,50.0
I think its alot better than what it what it was,72.72727272727273
and Im hoping that it gets better,50.0
actually Im hoping that it that it gets back to where it was,71.42857142857143
yes but to be honest with you I if if if what youre asking is I think that I didnt exactly understand what had all happened youknow,62.06896551724138
and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and alot of it,31.25
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were were were kindof funny or werent making sense,52.0
so I I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand,53.84615384615385
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would remember everything,59.09090909090909
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought,41.66666666666667
there I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset not upset sad sad,26.31578947368421
and then but then,0.0
anyway sorry,0.0
well most of the time Ive been pretty happy sorry because Im very fortunate that Im still here and have a second time to be alive and be with people that I I care about,44.73684210526316
but its just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything,33.33333333333333
I was I was home when it happened,75.0
and I it just really hurt,33.33333333333333
for me it was on my left side,75.0
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down,36.36363636363637
but right away I could tell something wasnt right,40.0
and then I my wife realized more stuff that was going on,41.66666666666667
and she was able to ask me es quite a few questions,50.0
and after a few questions she could realize I wasnt making sense,46.15384615384615
so I guess thats the answer,42.857142857142854
sure alot,0.0
Im trying to think where to start,37.5
from the time that I was at the,87.5
I cant even think what its called,50.0
where was I at,100.0
after the stroke happened at first,50.0
yeah icu and then the,20.0
did it,50.0
where I was for awhile,80.0
yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me,38.46153846153847
yeah rehab thats the one,33.33333333333333
its hard for me to answer when I cant think how to say it,53.333333333333336
rehab,0.0
and they were helping me,60.0
and they they were very kind,50.0
and my wife was wonderful,40.0
and they were just telling me things that gave me it gave me alotof hope that they realized I was pretty much I was alittle weak,50.0
but I was physically able to walk around and do alot,18.181818181818183
and that remember I told yesterday I could remember alotof like well how to play a guitar and kindof singing,30.0
although I guess you would know how this stuff means,60.0
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was,53.84615384615385
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something,37.5
but that gave me alotof hope,33.33333333333333
and then I got back home,16.666666666666664
and Ive worked with a whole lot of things,50.0
Ill show you one of them,50.0
xxx,0.0
here it is,66.66666666666666
one of these things,50.0
so not every day but for alotof days I just go back,25.0
and I look at this,60.0
and I started going backwards just to try to read it,18.181818181818183
youknow dog and cat,0.0
so theres a whole bunch of these things that they had,50.0
and then some of those in the other room that I cant always get a hold of but I I managed to get a hold of these,53.57142857142857
I usually I can usually get them,57.14285714285714
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something,61.904761904761905
and when I started playing,40.0
is it okay if I keep blabbing for a minute,60.0
this is actually I guess my wife can tell me I I kinda blab,57.14285714285714
so I dont mean to be that way,44.44444444444444
but youknow I guess she realized soon,28.57142857142857
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing,22.22222222222222
and after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with older people,50.0
and then it made me think more about that after something I was going through,60.0
and I really wanted to to just sing,12.5
I I I realized that I missed that,75.0
so we were talking about me doing that,62.5
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened,41.935483870967744
somehow one of them got got missed,57.14285714285714
and so it was about a month I guess later,40.0
yeah yeah July,0.0
one well Im forgot to say it,37.5
bottom line is one of them called not long before,40.0
ohmygosh youknow we didnt tell him s,37.5
and so I still said,20.0
so I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs,47.368421052631575
and I I did it,60.0
and I was nervous,50.0
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to to start doing it again,29.411764705882355
and I did a whole lot of shows again,33.33333333333333
and I think that really helped me because it it started remembering and alotof that,46.666666666666664
so I guess thats the answer to alotof it,50.0
yeah and I was feeling so good,28.57142857142857
I I musta done a hundred shows at least,44.44444444444444
she could tell you,75.0
there was a ton of them I did,62.5
and pretty much not having any problems,14.285714285714285
but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing,27.27272727272727
and I was singing all not making sense,37.5
and that just destroyed me,40.0
Imean I just that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I I was back,58.82352941176471
and then that happened and the next thing I knew were going to the hospital,40.0
and I just couldnt believe it,42.857142857142854
I just I just said,40.0
and that was that was probably the worst,62.5
but then came back around again,0.0
so I was doing better again,33.33333333333333
and then allofasudden Covid came in,16.666666666666664
so since its been so many weird things in my life becauseof just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything,36.36363636363637
and then thats come along,50.0
and its just every were all going through that,66.66666666666666
kindof figure out whats whats all gonna happen,45.45454545454545
and how are people and etcetera and,28.57142857142857
so yeah its been really really crazy,28.57142857142857
ohmygosh so many,0.0
I dont know where to start with that,55.55555555555556
I I can only tell just just the one huh,40.0
well I would talk about my wife and I getting getting getting married,46.15384615384615
I guess thats pretty obvious that I would say that,54.54545454545454
gosh Imean Im trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more,50.0
I got I forgot a little what you asked me,60.0
but this might be part of it too,62.5
we got to go to where we useta go every year,45.45454545454545
up to up north from us which is up by Wisconsin,63.63636363636363
FirstnameT my wife,33.33333333333333
youknow I wasnt able to actually I used to always be the one that kindof was the ke main ke driver,36.36363636363637
and so ofcourse she youknow I knew that I couldnt we werent going to do that especially with our kids with me driving,48.0
so she she did,50.0
but going there again was a really wonderful time,22.22222222222222
it really reminded me of alot of places,50.0
because we we usually would go in the same places,60.0
and so that sortof is a long thinking about,44.44444444444444
I just felt kindof,25.0
we we married there,50.0
so I guess I dont know,42.857142857142854
I dont think Im really answering what you asked me,58.333333333333336
just like happy times of just one happy time,22.22222222222222
yes I would I would love to,57.14285714285714
well first of all were just friends,42.857142857142854
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church,52.94117647058824
and I was really interested in her,57.14285714285714
but I took a long time,33.33333333333333
and finally I mentioned about if we could go out,60.0
and she said yes which is wonderful,42.857142857142854
we went out,66.66666666666666
one of the happiest,50.0
the that first date was just amazing,42.857142857142854
I felt like I was this younger person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of,46.666666666666664
and we just went out to see a movie,33.33333333333333
and then we just talked for a long time,33.33333333333333
and I told her good night and drove home,22.22222222222222
and that was incredible,50.0
and so we started going out,16.666666666666664
and when we got married it was such a happy time,63.63636363636363
I remember I went it didnt right away go,40.0
before we got married that last night for,62.5
but I did,33.33333333333333
and I woke up,50.0
and I was really happy,40.0
and I was looking fairly forward to it,50.0
felt alotof peace,0.0
and so we had a pretty special wedding that we had done,41.66666666666667
and the way we did it was that youknow I didnt get to see her how she was looking when she walked out,58.333333333333336
and I was standing way back,33.33333333333333
and I saw her coming,40.0
sorry,0.0
its nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda,54.54545454545454
but I cried because she was coming orry with her dad,54.54545454545454
and that was amazing,50.0
and we had a fantastic wedding there,28.57142857142857
and anyway the whole time it was happy,37.5
I dont know why I cried sorry,50.0
I think I might have thought of becauseof FirstnameTs FirstnameTs ke FirstnameTs ke mom who who had passed away a year and a half ago,44.0
so I think that kinda got me,42.857142857142854
but everything else was was really happy,42.857142857142854
ohboy,0.0
well in this case its a its a its a guy a young boy,64.28571428571429
and hes got a,60.0
oh what do you call those things,57.14285714285714
things that you,66.66666666666666
see now I get stuck on,33.33333333333333
I I I owe,75.0
totally I cant think what thats called,55.55555555555556
bouncing go,0.0
ohno,0.0
I Ill get that,50.0
do I have much time because because I can think of that,66.66666666666666
is there a timing on it,83.33333333333334
okay I hope thats okay and thats doesnt drive you crazy,35.714285714285715
youre like,66.66666666666666
Ive got this,75.0
its oh what do you call that,71.42857142857143
mom the moms go with,40.0
oh Im stuck on something really obvious,37.5
but anyway hes gonna hes taking it and using his foot,42.857142857142854
and as he does hits it alittle too hard into the I guess the right,53.333333333333336
and its going right toward a persons house,37.5
and oops looks like in number three you can see that it it actually broke there,43.75
and theres this persons probably somebodys dad just sitting there,18.181818181818183
it looks like he mighta been reading or something,66.66666666666666
Im Im not sure about that,50.0
ke ohmygosh got alittle startled,0.0
now hes looking down at the fourth one,55.55555555555556
and he can look back there and see what happened,30.0
and then probably can see behind who that probably was I would assume back there,46.666666666666664
so thats my answer to that question,50.0
okay,0.0
on the first one xxx on the first one there is a person,46.15384615384615
this is a xxx I guess,66.66666666666666
and yes which is like sorry which is like mother,60.0
and it looks like to me like she is telling him that he should take a,75.0
its going to be the hard when we hadta think what thats called,57.14285714285714
to not get wet,0.0
like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain,46.15384615384615
stuck on what thats called,66.66666666666666
but I know what it is,66.66666666666666
and so she it looks like hes going like,50.0
and the though the the second one it looks like hes oh like shes,50.0
oh I see what happened,40.0
shes looking a little bit upset like,50.0
and then the third one hes now outside,22.22222222222222
and boyco guess what happened,20.0
now its its hes getting soaked,71.42857142857143
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house,30.76923076923077
yes and she does look a little bit upset,33.33333333333333
and hes looking kindof like,50.0
and hes soaked,50.0
and now she has the other thing I cant think of what its called around him to keep not getting wet,40.909090909090914
thats pretty much what I have,42.857142857142854
okay so first first Im going to look at what I see,38.46153846153847
and then theres alot going on there in there,30.0
okay,0.0
there is a,66.66666666666666
okay,0.0
I see its a tree,60.0
there is a man standing outside or up high with the tree,33.33333333333333
theres a dog,50.0
cant help it,50.0
I always notice ke dogs and cats,14.285714285714285
theres a dog at the bottom under there looking up,54.54545454545454
kindof looks like its barking,40.0
probably saying something like,50.0
and theres a cat just sortof hanging out,33.33333333333333
oh I see,33.33333333333333
and then are both under the cator at the bottom of the cat or whatever is a young girl whos probably trying to help with with the with the cat,58.06451612903226
interesting enough there there is a,50.0
what is that called,75.0
ohno,0.0
I can point to it,80.0
but I cant say it,50.0
there is a thing that which the young girl could take with the with the man,62.5
and he could he could walk down there,50.0
cant think of what its called,57.14285714285714
okay,0.0
on the right see is a is a,75.0
crud I forgot what thats called,57.14285714285714
Ill skip that one,25.0
at the bottom there we do see there is a acouple guys a person people who are gonna probably help him,45.45454545454545
the which forgot what thats called too,62.5
like a like a,75.0
I cant say it,60.0
with a,100.0
I I got it,75.0
with a fire person whos gonna come and probably help him up there,33.33333333333333
thats what Ive got,66.66666666666666
okay,0.0
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella,46.666666666666664
but Cinderella starts with she was had a wonderful mom and also dad father and mother,25.0
and they were loving and and kind,28.57142857142857
and she was too,50.0
and something happened which alot lot of,42.857142857142854
and that was her her sorry her ke mother,55.55555555555556
so her dad her father met this other woman and decided to hed like to have him and her get married,36.36363636363637
and as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go,50.0
but he did,33.33333333333333
and that person had a couple a couple like sorry acouple ke daughters that she owned,31.25
and its showing that theyre all very very mean not only to to Cinderella but even to themself,26.31578947368421
they just theyre just very all they think about is themself,50.0
and the the mother is just interested in trying to make alotof money when she gets married,35.294117647058826
so they realize that Cinderella is just is a very beautiful person,41.66666666666667
Imean shes shes very shes very pretty and beautiful,25.0
but shes inside shes just a really sweet person who who cares about people,37.5
so the oh I think its called stepmother,37.5
I think thats what its called,57.14285714285714
realizes they need to she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters,31.25
and so Cinderellas life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that shes m,48.148148148148145
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy at least for the most part and just doing alotof lovely things in taking care of them,28.57142857142857
and so around that time the the prince,37.5
let me see,33.33333333333333
his dad,50.0
I cant think of what thats called,66.66666666666666
wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all,55.00000000000001
who would be just a lovely ke a girl,55.55555555555556
and so they have have this ke this ke ball,40.0
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that youknow,48.148148148148145
but they showed that the other two stepmothers,37.5
and that their mom,50.0
and theyre excited that they can maybe be the one thats chosen,57.14285714285714
woo this is hard,50.0
but the mom realizes,25.0
so Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready,22.22222222222222
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful,51.515151515151516
so they made is made her beautiful thing,37.5
but then the stepmother got where she she she couldnt go,50.0
and so then Cinderella was really crying,14.285714285714285
as I remember thats the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken,44.44444444444444
and youknow how could they not even let me do anything,45.45454545454545
and then theres fairy godmother person pops outof nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what shes going to wear and where she can be driven,38.70967741935484
she gets there,33.33333333333333
and she can dance,50.0
and he sees her and wants to dance with her,40.0
and hes captivated by her,66.66666666666666
and allofasudden Cinderella realizes ohno its by this midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back,40.0
so Cinderella gets home,0.0
and shes still kinda happy,16.666666666666664
which is I thought that was always amazing,62.5
she was still she just happy and so honest about,40.0
and she thinks thats the end that would ever be,54.54545454545454
but she was still happy,40.0
and so then with the prince he is like,55.55555555555556
which I I wouldnt really blame him,62.5
ofcourse hes gonna wanna meet her,37.5
and goes he wants to he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her,31.818181818181817
so he hasta go has a decree I guess that popped in decree to every single unmarried person,44.44444444444444
hasta be figure out who that was because,75.0
oh yeah I forgot when when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things,46.666666666666664
I cant think what its called,57.14285714285714
behind your foot thing,50.0
so they know that if they can go to each person theyll find out who that was who that fits,71.42857142857143
so they go,33.33333333333333
and at the end Cinderella its obvious that shes the the correct one,50.0
so they get married,25.0
and then shes happily ever after,28.57142857142857
thats it,66.66666666666666
my my brain is like,80.0
okay,0.0
take take my peanut butter,20.0
hafta open it,33.33333333333333
take it out,66.66666666666666
probably get wanna get ke not just ke one but get get two,0.0
lay them down,66.66666666666666
grab something to go under thing,33.33333333333333
I cant think how to call it,50.0
under the jelly,66.66666666666666
and go in there,0.0
and take one and put it around the peanut butter,30.0
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three three or four,14.285714285714285
and thats how I would say,57.14285714285714
I dont know what to call that sorry,33.33333333333333
well for the most part or or I guess Id hafta say most of the time I think its doing alot better than it it it had done,41.37931034482759
and and were talking ofcourse after my stroke right,33.33333333333333
hopefully I wouldnt have,40.0
yeah so I think I Im doing better,44.44444444444444
have a way I hafta ke go,28.57142857142857
but I think Im doing better,42.857142857142854
Ive been trying really hard to think,37.5
and and I dont mean to keep blabbing,22.22222222222222
Im sorry but,25.0
Im just talking,50.0
earlier I think it was yeah this morning I was telling somebody here my wife or my kids or something about how sometimes I feel like a person thats just not born but whatever,51.42857142857142
what I mean is theres things Ive just forgotten all about,46.15384615384615
we we got to eat a couple of things and I just forgot,38.46153846153847
oh I forgot what that even is,57.14285714285714
and so in a way thats kindof exciting,44.44444444444444
but then you feel like,40.0
so but yeah but overall better better hopefully,0.0
Im hoping,66.66666666666666
yes,0.0
absolutely,0.0
no I I probably feel like I blabbed too much about that last time,42.857142857142854
so it,50.0
I had come home,50.0
and it wasnt very late in the day,44.44444444444444
I think it was maybe twelve or one oclock I think,36.36363636363637
and I had decided to look outside to see if we got any yeah any ke Im sorry any ke any Im sorry any mail,40.74074074074074
and I walked back in the house and said hi and gave them the mail I think,35.294117647058826
and anyway I just started feeling really weird,12.5
and I cant even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it,43.75
but I decided I wanted to just to sit down with our with my ke bedroom,43.75
and I did,33.33333333333333
and right away it just started getting worse,12.5
and it really hurt,25.0
and for me it was youknow my left side I guess,54.54545454545454
but it was probably other ones,33.33333333333333
but I think I felt more here,28.57142857142857
and something I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really very very different and strange,25.0
and something was was kindof scary,50.0
and she started talking with me,50.0
and realized she asked me a few questions,37.5
and she could tell after several things shed asked me that I wasnt making enough sense,41.17647058823529
and then I started feeling almost sick,14.285714285714285
and she got me a thing in case I did,50.0
and I did getting sick,40.0
and she right away knew to get me to a a hospital,41.66666666666667
and I think that well my wife and my kids knew they probably figured some things out because with my wifes mom had passed away about six months or something I guess it was before that,47.22222222222222
I think thats about right,50.0
and I think last thing Im saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit,61.29032258064516
and so I was thinking about that and praying about that,54.54545454545454
and thats the last thing I can tell you,50.0
we were going to the hospital,66.66666666666666
and I was trying she was asking me alotof questions as she was driving,57.14285714285714
and I was doing the best I could,62.5
but I I couldnt really explain very well,33.33333333333333
so it was a pretty whew wow pretty intense thing that happened,33.33333333333333
that is a fantastic question,60.0
and if you asked my that before Im not even thinking of that,64.28571428571429
so Im just saying thats a really excellent question,36.36363636363637
well my wife and my kids came from church,33.33333333333333
friends had been all so wonderful,50.0
and especially as a wife and kids they asked me alotof questions,33.33333333333333
and part of the whole thing I dont know how to say it is theyve had to figure out what Im trying to say,48.148148148148145
and theyve been very patient about this when I get stuck on something,64.28571428571429
and every now and then I get a little bit upset,27.27272727272727
but not upset like crazy scary something,28.57142857142857
I just I just get frustrated because I know what Im trying to say but I cant think how to say it,50.0
but anyway so theyve also also with them I should have said my sister,53.333333333333336
my sister is always always one of my best friends,40.0
shes a couple years younger than me,50.0
and and her husband too,20.0
theyve all gotten back,40.0
and they showed me alotof photos and remembrances youknow,22.22222222222222
things that I remember,50.0
and snu,0.0
I dont have it here,50.0
but ke theyd gaven,20.0
ke if it says ke dogq a picture of a dog,45.45454545454545
they give me tons of those,66.66666666666666
but my wifes is the main one,42.857142857142854
shes helped me out so much,57.14285714285714
and like I say theyve had to guess what Im trying to say,40.0
or ke Ill say,0.0
and then theyre all trying to,28.57142857142857
and then finally someone will figure,33.33333333333333
Ill say,0.0
that thats it,75.0
youknow but its getting to the point where hopefully as Im getting better I hope theyll sometimes say,50.0
youknow so thats been alotof alotof it,62.5
and then I think also with me with me playing music my wifes realized that so much of that seems to have come back which is amazing because for a long time I didnt do music for a long time in my life,47.72727272727273
I started again awhile back,40.0
but stuffs back there from when I was a kid,50.0
its just back youknow,25.0
oh and one more thing,0.0
we really love certain tv shows and sometimes movies,11.11111111111111
and alotof those have have helped me too,50.0
theres certain ones that we just really like,33.33333333333333
that I dont know it just helps me youknow with anyway,50.0
so that helps at all,20.0
so it was gonna get something else but I cant think what to say,37.5
sorry Im stuck on what the name of the show is,58.333333333333336
I guess that thats probably not very important sorry,30.0
we I liked I watch alotof older shows,37.5
and some of those are just great,57.14285714285714
theyre just great,25.0
anyway so thats what Ive got,50.0
cool yeah there are just certain ones,14.285714285714285
and some of the especially Im not trying to say anything whatever bad about newer shows because theres certainly some good new ones Im sure,42.857142857142854
but some of those older ones are just just so great,36.36363636363637
sometimes theyre so well thought out or just so funny,27.27272727272727
the and so even when I was a kid there were certain shows that everybody remembered,50.0
youknow its just Ill say something thats kindof probably silly,36.36363636363637
but theyre showing with tv now the guy with the Fonzi going heyq,42.857142857142854
youknow its just one little thats not a very deep thing,25.0
but something like that back then that was everybody knew who that was,69.23076923076923
anyway its the best Ive got,57.14285714285714
sorry sorry that Im Im Im taking a second,50.0
Im trying to decide which one I had mentioned,50.0
my wife and thats a very very vital one,30.0
I thought Id try to think of something else too,36.36363636363637
and every one Im thinking of isnt much to say in there,42.857142857142854
so and theres alot I just just just think of it,33.33333333333333
I thought of one that would be very hard for me explain that,61.53846153846154
I just I wouldnt be able to get all in my head,53.84615384615385
well okay,0.0
with my wife again when we got married when we were married,66.66666666666666
I mentioned that,66.66666666666666
but I dont think I mentioned this,50.0
after wed been married for a couple days we went up north up to Wisconsin and no yeah,52.63157894736842
and no yeah and then we went,14.285714285714285
sorry Wisconsin,0.0
s what I meant to say was actually actually next to that which is like which sorry which which is Michigan,57.14285714285714
and we went up to Michigan to stay,37.5
ohbrother it,50.0
how could I not think of that,71.42857142857143
I could draw a picture of it,71.42857142857143
I could drive where to get there,42.857142857142854
I cant think what its called,57.14285714285714
oh Mackinaw,0.0
and we stayed at Mackinaw,40.0
and that was fantastic,50.0
we had a few days,40.0
and we stayed at a beautiful place,42.857142857142854
and it was just so peaceful and just beautiful,22.22222222222222
and at at that place I had mentioned which took me while to get out as kku,58.82352941176471
well up in Mackinaw they cant have any vehicles and cars,33.33333333333333
so you just hear this little clip clip clip clip clip of of of sorry of a horse horses going,35.0
and we just were out there,33.33333333333333
we had a suite I guess youd call it our third floor,46.15384615384615
and we could open it up and look down there and just see these these horses,37.5
and it was just so peaceful and so beautiful,22.22222222222222
and that was a wonderful time,50.0
just being married and having a life together with each other,36.36363636363637
and looking back at that and seeing theres alotof other all around that whole place,31.25
but I remember that particular part of it,50.0
and theres another one thats close to it,50.0
I guess it was,75.0
I forgot if its before or after,57.14285714285714
right around there we went to a place called the Sleeping Bear Dune that this guy that I knew years ago had just told me,40.0
and so we went there not even knowing how to how to get there because back then we didnt have ke our our interuhnet,36.0
we had to just figure out how to get there,30.0
but we found this place,40.0
well you you you you go up real high,55.55555555555556
and then when you finish you can just run down,50.0
that was one of the neatest things,57.14285714285714
when I went up all the way high and we could look down there it was just beyond beautiful just unbelievable,47.61904761904761
and so when I think about that too I just I just I just get just get happy,44.44444444444444
so thats my little stories,33.33333333333333
www,0.0
on number on one theres a guy a boy whatever,54.54545454545454
and hes got a soccer,50.0

but it looks like hes probably angry,37.5
but hes hes ke holding it,50.0

and and that was on on number two,37.5
on number three looks like hes now outside,33.33333333333333
and its starting to rain,20.0
and he now realizes he needs to,28.57142857142857
and can now Im on four,42.857142857142854

and she looks understandably kindof upset,33.33333333333333
dont want to say angry but kindof upset,11.11111111111111
and so now hes going,33.33333333333333
this is number v six,60.0
hes going back outside,40.0
and he now has what he should have had for the dang it for the dang it for the the umbrella,66.66666666666666
and oh as hes going now hes not getting soaked because he is wearing having an umbrella,52.63157894736842
thats it,66.66666666666666
this is hard because I hafta,66.66666666666666
okay I understand whats going on,57.14285714285714
I gotta think of all the different what theyre all called,61.53846153846154
well okay Im just gonna put it the way I would say it,46.666666666666664
I dont know,50.0
there is a dad,50.0
and s oh I see what happened,28.57142857142857
it looks like he might have tried to,62.5
could be two two possibilities,40.0
okay he has a very tall ke tree,25.0
and hes hes hes up there,33.33333333333333
and hes ke stuck,20.0
it looks like the,75.0
what is that called,75.0
web,0.0
what is that thing called,60.0
I guess thats what makes it what I have whats happened to me,60.0
I cant think how to call a certain thing,40.0
a thing that he normally could have stuck in front of,63.63636363636363
oh I just touched something sorry,33.33333333333333
touch something thankyou sorry,25.0
and that looks like that had ke fallen down,55.55555555555556
looks like he was going up there to get a to try to help to get to get yeah to to get a a cat,24.0
and looks like his I guess daughter is looking up at the cat,53.84615384615385
probably shes,33.33333333333333
ke shes concerned about the kitty,42.857142857142854
theres a little,50.0
its hard to explain isnt it,42.857142857142854
theres a little thing that she could have been maybe,63.63636363636363
what do you call those things,66.66666666666666
as a kid you can you can get there,66.66666666666666
and you can drive,50.0
it could have even have fallen down the fallen down what he needs to not be stuck,58.82352941176471
Im not sure,25.0
anyway on the other side behind him thats a dog,54.54545454545454
dogs up there woofing woof woof woof probably wants I dont know saying,14.285714285714285
I dont know,50.0
and then on the last part here there are two responders rs people coming trying to help,29.411764705882355
and there is a,50.0
something else I forgot what its called,57.14285714285714
oh what is that called,60.0
we see that where they would use to have gotten around there,50.0
I cant think what its called,57.14285714285714
and the last thing on the very top of that is a a bird,57.14285714285714
thats the best I can do right now,44.44444444444444
the story of Cinderella,50.0
I guess it starts off,60.0
as at least the way I remember,57.14285714285714
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very very good people,35.714285714285715
and they treated her as they should very very very kind and with with alotof love,43.75
and that would would ofcourse have been great except her her ke mother died,57.14285714285714
and I guess alot of those ke Disney shows do that sometimes,33.33333333333333
and so the dad was a good man,37.5
but like alotof people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else,31.57894736842105
and so that ends up happening,33.33333333333333
and really messed up by marrying this other woman,33.33333333333333
who ends up shes just so cruel and so selfish,27.27272727272727
and oh okay what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life,47.82608695652174
and so what I mean now is that the,55.55555555555556
what is it called,75.0
the other woman she now has the power I guess where shes really being awful with with with Cinderella,55.00000000000001
and I guess maybe even the her dad mightve died,45.45454545454545
I dont remember about that,66.66666666666666
anyway so theyre showing they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed,42.857142857142854
she went through a really nice life which was deserving to her because she was a very very very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldnt hurt anyone,41.66666666666667
so now that the other mother is now there the other mother makes Cinderella do everything,31.25
all the washing and everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do,56.25
and these those two sisters the k s the other,40.0
what are those called,75.0
those two other girls are just so mean to her and so just very ke very snotty horrible,22.22222222222222
dont even care about Cinderella at all,25.0
only that they can get whatever they want,62.5
they make her do everything,60.0
but even so she still seems to still have an amazing way to be lovely and sweet and caring,21.052631578947366
and so I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place,37.5
I cant think what its called,57.14285714285714
beautiful place,0.0
so sorry somebodys walking back here and Im Im getting this for,42.857142857142854
okay so okay I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman,48.484848484848484
I guess,50.0
so oh this is hard,40.0
so the the ke,50.0
hows that Im in track where they are,70.0
so the so its made by decree that they should have they should have this ke yeah okay this ke this ke ball,47.82608695652174
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta hasta come there,42.857142857142854
and then theyll be able to c to figure out whos the best one that he should he should marry,50.0
so then they showed in the picture if I remember right his,50.0
and shes excited because she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will will be that they will want one of them,64.0
so theyre all excited including Cinderella was excited,22.22222222222222
but loandbehold I think it showed that the other mother says,36.36363636363637
seems to me ke I remember ke the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear I think,50.0
anyway so Cinderella part of her part of how shes just so lovely and kind even the little a little ke sorry ke nblu,28.000000000000004
so they even do what help to try to make her what she can wear,40.0
and I think Im what happened with that,55.55555555555556
anyway yeah then it gets messed up,42.857142857142854
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think thats where it shows Cinderella really for the first time really crying,42.30769230769231
really just destroyed because its like,33.33333333333333
Im being its like they think shes just nothing,72.72727272727273
and she doesnt deserve any of that,62.5
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother pops outof nowhere,11.11111111111111
and she makes a beautiful outfit,33.33333333333333
and then she,33.33333333333333
ohboy the the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where,53.333333333333336
yeah with with with its ke a pumpkin,62.5
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in,63.63636363636363
and the animals are made to look like theyre people,36.36363636363637
and just the fairy godmother has told her,37.5
so I think it showed Cinderella arrives,28.57142857142857
and they can see that the other the other the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like,50.0
and then the,33.33333333333333
why this is really hard to explain this,50.0
then the guy,33.33333333333333
I cant think what hes even called now,50.0
oh how embarrassing,33.33333333333333
I cant think of the name of the guy,60.0
the young man whos gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her,31.25
and he is is very interested in her ofcourse,55.55555555555556
and he seemed like a nice man like a good man,45.45454545454545
and and she ofcourse is a absolutely very wonderful and very very good girl,21.428571428571427
and they get to dance,20.0
and its just almost magical,20.0
theyre just obvious those two are meant to be ke in love,38.46153846153847
so then Cinderella leaves or sees,0.0
so she has to suddenly run,16.666666666666664
hes thinking,66.66666666666666
and as shes running down her slipper a grass,60.0
and she hasta keep running,40.0
so then I think the pictures show that shes back home,33.33333333333333
and shes shes just happy that she got to do something,38.46153846153847
and then they find out that,50.0
boyco my brain,33.33333333333333
that there was a grass,60.0
or theyre theyre gonna find who was that woman who we actually would ofcourse have been n n n Cinderella,52.17391304347826
and so they go to every unmarried young woman,33.33333333333333
and none of them it doesnt fit right with any of them with the slipper grass,58.82352941176471
I cant talk right,40.0
with the slipper,66.66666666666666
and it does for for Cinderella,50.0
and so she becomes married,20.0
and I think I missed one thing in there,22.22222222222222
seems like the the mom ends up breaking that or something first,50.0
I dont remember that,60.0
but anyway they find the other one like I say,40.0
and and that fits,25.0
thats the only one that that fits right,44.44444444444444
and its obviously shes shes the one,44.44444444444444
and then it shows that they get married,37.5
and theyre happily ever after,33.33333333333333
I think thats it,60.0
yeah youd open up each of the each of the ke sorry each of the ke jellies,61.111111111111114
excuseme let me let me start over again,37.5
peanut butters,0.0

and then get peanut butter,0.0

yeah sometimes I say things backwards,16.666666666666664
does it does it is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching,57.14285714285714
I said some things backwards,40.0
so if Ill say,25.0
I think those are the main issues I have,55.55555555555556
no I dont remember anything for about six weeks,40.0
the first memories that I had after my stroke are were very cloudy,53.84615384615385
and they were not accurate they were not accurate,44.44444444444444
for example I I remember being in a wheelchair,66.66666666666666
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair,60.0
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the werteru,50.0
and I was strapped in because I couldnt sit up on my own,64.28571428571429
those for about two months I I I really didnt I couldnt remember I remembered remembered almost nothing,45.0
and some of the things I had were very much incorrect,45.45454545454545
I found out later things I thought,42.857142857142854
and then when I first started remembering things I was oz was at that point I was moved to a rlbltenu,52.38095238095239
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct somewhat accurate,40.0
and that was probably month and a half or two months in,33.33333333333333
then I I started remembering things but but it was slow coming back very slow coming back,23.52941176470588
one thing that that I didnt know was that as I was as it was coming and waking up I guess I was getting getting around to being able to talk,56.25
I thought I was talking,60.0
but I found out later that I wasnt that I couldnt talk clearly,53.333333333333336
I couldnt say anything,60.0
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling,28.57142857142857
and so I dont remember when I started talking because in my mind I was always talking just just fine,42.857142857142854
and I felt like feel like you feel like maybe I was a baby tried to talk,41.17647058823529
and I thought everybody should understand me,57.14285714285714
but apparently infact nobody did,20.0
and that happened for a long that,57.14285714285714
well in my mind Ive always been able to talk right,41.66666666666667
now maybe in the last year or so Im much more aware of the fact that I dont talk plainly,36.36363636363637
that thats thats kindof the the story of my memories that I that I have,64.70588235294117
well it was,66.66666666666666
still is,50.0
well I was I spent six months in first of all in some oh I guess critical care places,47.368421052631575
and then went to went to after about two months I went went into the long term,29.411764705882355
well I went to went to a couple of rehab hospitals for awhile for two or three weeks each,36.84210526315789
and then I started remembering,20.0
and I started doing some some therapy of that sort at that time,53.84615384615385
I couldnt do much of anything,57.14285714285714
I thought I could do more than I really could,60.0
but I really couldnt do much,28.57142857142857
I after six months I got got home,50.0
and I did some I had somebody come on outpatient basis and work with me for about six weeks,42.10526315789473
a physical therapist was a speech therapist and and occupational therapist,27.27272727272727
at that point I really wasnt doing much by myself because I really didnt know what to do,50.0
probably after about oh maybe after about a year I started kindof figuring out on my own stuff I needed to do,36.36363636363637
I started youknow I did I did have somebody that I worked with,69.23076923076923

well the the the the little kid is going off to school,58.333333333333336
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him,46.15384615384615
but hes kinda waving it off saying,50.0
so he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye,33.33333333333333
and he gets out there going on his way to school,36.36363636363637
and it starts raining,25.0

and now its its a downpour,50.0
and its raining pretty hard,20.0
and hes kinda running to get outta the rain,30.0
and he ran back home,20.0
and he he did see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didnt want to take the umbrella,50.0

well the story is that this little girls cat got up in the tree,50.0
and the the dad went up to get the get the cat down,38.46153846153847
and hes got stuck in the tree,50.0
and the the dog is standing there barking up the tree,45.45454545454545
I dont know if hes barking because hes trying to get that guy down or what,52.63157894736842
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down,40.0
and in the process somehow the ladder,42.857142857142854
maybe the dog hit the ladder,33.33333333333333
but it the ladder got knocked down,57.14285714285714
so the guy couldnt get couldnt climb down the ladder,41.66666666666667
so they hadta call a fire department,28.57142857142857
and they came,33.33333333333333
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder,45.45454545454545
and theyre going to get the get the get the guy down from the tree,50.0
now the cat in the meantime is sitting up in the tree,58.333333333333336
and I dont know if hes taking a nap or just,46.15384615384615
but he doesnt really care,33.33333333333333
hes not bothering him,60.0
the little girl probably was musta been riding her tricycle because its sitting there,42.857142857142854
but she is now trying to coax the cat down,30.0
theres a bird there in the tree,50.0
and hes just kinda singing away and probably is oblivious to everything else thats going on,38.88888888888889
thats pretty much it,40.0
the girls got pigtails and all of that,50.0
so maybe shes a tomboy or something,37.5
I dont know,50.0
thats about it,75.0
thats it,66.66666666666666
www,0.0
okay,0.0
well Cinderella was a Cinderella was I guess,50.0
I think there was a I think that Cinderella was actually had to work for the whos the the got evil sisters,47.82608695652174
and they werent very nice to her,50.0
they made her do the laundry,50.0
obviously in the story here all the all the animals loved Cinderella because theyre all in theyre all around whenever she is,58.333333333333336
and they they found that they they like her alot because all the little animals are around when shes doing her thing,60.86956521739131
so the the the the king has a son,55.55555555555556
hes looking for a looking for a bride for his his son,69.23076923076923
I didnt say that right did I,50.0
yeah he was looking for a bride for his son,60.0
and they they were he had they were gonna have a ball,53.84615384615385
so they could all come and and see who who she,45.45454545454545
and she was looking out the window in this one picture,54.54545454545454
she was looking out the window kinda dreaming about it,60.0
but she obviously hadnt been invited to the ball,50.0
so they all went to the ball,57.14285714285714
and well the I dont remember exactly how it was that she ended up,60.0
I guess the the fairy godmother came while she was at while they were at the ball,70.58823529411765
the fairy godmother took a told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that shed take her to the ball in,45.83333333333333
and it was a a pumpkin carriage and gonna take them to the ball,46.666666666666664
and I remember this one picture there that seemed alittle weird,27.27272727272727
the horses were sitting on their hind legs with their kinda with their feet up something like youknow,55.55555555555556
they were they were standing there on four legs,55.55555555555556
it was kinda weird,50.0
and so the fairy godmother took her to the ball,40.0
and she at the ball and went in,50.0
and nobody knew this knew who it was because she was so so beautiful,57.14285714285714
nobody knew who she was,80.0
and they had the ball,40.0
and the and the prince the prince liked her,44.44444444444444
and and then the the the chimes went off in the clock big clock BigBen or whatever,41.17647058823529
and and and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before or back home before midnight,33.33333333333333
and it was after midnight,60.0
and so she got up,40.0
she ran out,66.66666666666666
and her slipper fell off,40.0
and she went on,50.0
she got home without the slipper,50.0
and then the the prince started looking for whoever it was that had the the slipper,56.25
and he was trying he was trying the slipper on on everybody in the kingdom,66.66666666666666
and finally the the the they wanted to he wanted to try it onto Cinderella,46.666666666666664
but I think they they the the the bad evil sisters didnt want her didnt want him to,50.0
but he did anyway,25.0
he,100.0
and it fit,33.33333333333333
and and the end Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after I guess,26.666666666666668
okay,0.0
well I guess first thing I do is go to the pantry,41.66666666666667
and I get out the peanut butter,42.857142857142854

and then I did that again acouple more times other days,27.27272727272727
and it seemed like things were going pretty well,33.33333333333333
and then I and then we we as I said made an appointment to go see the neurosurgeon,38.88888888888889
and we went to see the neurosurgeon,28.57142857142857
and his name was Doctor LastnameM,33.33333333333333
and he was in a building right there by the hospital,54.54545454545454
and so went to see him and youknow in his office,27.27272727272727
and he he explained to me what he thought I had,63.63636363636363
well youknow he had seen the seen the xrays and and the scans and all that,43.75
so he knew what was going on youknow,50.0
and he told me what told me what what I had,63.63636363636363
and it was a it was a,85.71428571428571
see if I can remember the word,57.14285714285714
its probably gonna get away from me,37.5
its a,100.0
its on the tip my tongue,66.66666666666666
its a,100.0
I dont know if you can you can help me with this u,71.42857142857143
its a,100.0
you cant,66.66666666666666
I see youre shaking your house,57.14285714285714
okay I have a hard time some sorta remembering what this was,50.0
its not a regular stroke,40.0
its not a regular stroke,40.0
its its a situation that Ive had probably since birth,63.63636363636363
and it the situation is that there is a a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the artery,63.63636363636363
and instead of going through the little capillaries and everything it doesnt go through the capillaries,47.05882352941176
it goes directly into a a vein,57.14285714285714
so theres no no filter there to to slow it down or youknow,35.714285714285715
and so that that con,40.0
and it I said it probably was there from birth,50.0
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure,46.666666666666664
and it it didnt blow,50.0
it just there was and it was not a very big very big spot,35.714285714285715
maybe size of a quarter that where it had bled into my brain,61.53846153846154
but it stopped bleeding,25.0
it stopped,50.0
and and everything was going okay,33.33333333333333
it stopped,50.0
and there wasnt really much damage,14.285714285714285
so so Doctor LastnameM then said,0.0
so I went home from that appointment feeling pretty good,30.0
FirstnameS I guess both felt pretty good,28.57142857142857
I continue practicing my driving and soforth,28.57142857142857
and I went went back and made an appointment to go into surgery on on May the first,33.33333333333333
that had it,66.66666666666666
Im sorry,33.33333333333333
May the sixth,66.66666666666666
that had all happened on April Fools Day on April first of two thousand fifteen,40.0
and so I went in for the surgery on on May the sixth of that year two thousand fifteen,47.368421052631575
and little did I know I wasnt gonna come home for quite awhile,33.33333333333333
I wouldnt be home for another six months,55.55555555555556
and in the meantime,50.0
excuse the the French,50.0
the the shit hit the fan,50.0
and it did big time,20.0
Im sorry did I Im I dont mean to offend you,42.857142857142854
okay so that was that was that was that was my second stoke,69.23076923076923
and didnt I then then that was that was,50.0
well okay so what happened was when I went into the hospital then to have the that surgery that that that,52.38095238095239
and again its on the tip my tongue,50.0
that I wanna say what it is,71.42857142857143
maybe Ill think of it yeah,33.33333333333333
so when I went in to have that taken care of while I when I was in the hospital then they did the surgery,58.333333333333336
and the surgery was a c success,42.857142857142854
the problem was that when I went back when when I was in recovery from that surgery I was in recovery and,68.18181818181817
Ill ignore that if you can,66.66666666666666
sorry make make sure its not,16.666666666666664
no its not,33.33333333333333
okay no,0.0
so when I,66.66666666666666
the let it ring a time or two and go itll go away,35.714285714285715
Im sorry,33.33333333333333
okay so I I while I was in recovery my a brain for whatever reason,66.66666666666666
and not in the area where the surgery was done but in another area far away from the that spot,50.0
it started bleeding,33.33333333333333
and nobody knows why it started bleeding,42.857142857142854
but it did,33.33333333333333
and eventhough FirstnameS kept trying to say,0.0
because I I I I dont remember it ofcourse,70.0
I didnt see it,60.0
my my head was very swollen,50.0
and and she could tell that,50.0
youknow they tried to say,20.0
they they they tried to say,50.0
not a stroke,33.33333333333333
a having a,66.66666666666666
I cant remember the word now,42.857142857142854
hes having a whatever it is that they said,80.0
well it happens sometimes after surgery,33.33333333333333
its no big deal,50.0
itll it it is go away,71.42857142857143
and she kept trying to tell them,28.57142857142857
well they didnt well they didnt get hold of the doctor until number of hours later,38.88888888888889
that was at one about one oclock one oclock one thirty when I came back outof surgery the first time,35.0
and at finally about ten oclock that evening they took me back into surgery,42.857142857142854
and youknow by that time theyd had done scans and soforth,33.33333333333333
and they could see that the brain was bleeding badly,50.0
infact about the blood the blood was about three quarters of my brain,46.15384615384615
it was so bad that they didnt know if I would be bu,64.28571428571429
and if I did come outof it didnt know for sure if I would ever talk walk,50.0
if Id even know anything,66.66666666666666
if Id just hafta be spending the rest my life in a care home,46.666666666666664
they didnt know,50.0
and so I didnt know if youd me to go on some more about this,52.94117647058824
Imean I can talk for a long time about this if you want me to,60.0
so you ready to go on,33.33333333333333
Im sorry I cant even hear you,44.44444444444444
yeah,0.0
yes yes,0.0
ofcourse I when I was when I was in the hospital I dont remember,73.33333333333333
youknow for about two months I dont remember anything,40.0
and I wasnt doing anything,50.0
I as far as I know I dont know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not but probably not because there wasnt anything to work with,45.714285714285715
I youknow I couldnt talk,50.0
I couldnt do anything,60.0
and interestingly in July,25.0
so that was that was that was May,75.0
in July middle of July somewhere I had another stroke,40.0
and they,50.0
I was at that point I was in the I was in a rehabilitation center a rehab hospital,72.22222222222221
and they they took me by ambulance because I I felt I could feel that something was going on,68.42105263157895
and I was afraid it was stroke,57.14285714285714
but I couldnt say it was a stroke,55.55555555555556
but I knew there was something going on,50.0
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that theres a problem,40.0
they took me to the hospital and did the scans and soforth,41.66666666666667
and sure enough Id had another Id had another stroke,25.0
while I was there in the hospital,71.42857142857143
up until that time I could not move my legs at all,50.0
my hands I had I was no I couldnt do anything with it,64.28571428571429
I youknow was just thats why they didnt know if Id ever be able to do anything again,52.38095238095239
but while I was in the hospital I started being able to move,53.84615384615385
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was Id lost my ability to focus my eyes together,38.095238095238095
so I can only see outof one eye at a time,36.36363636363637
so I was wearing an eye patch over one side,40.0
then Id wear it for a while over this side then youknow,46.15384615384615
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldnt see with both eyes,47.368421052631575
I can steer with both eyes,66.66666666666666
but Id see different different things,14.285714285714285
and so when I had the second stroke or well this third stroke in the hospital I the vision started clearing up,40.909090909090914
and I remember telling me telling FirstnameS,28.57142857142857
I said,50.0
and and I sure enough I could,42.857142857142854
and then I also told her that that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit,47.368421052631575
and youknow because when youre when youre paralyzed youre not sure whether its moving or not,47.368421052631575
you think youre moving it,66.66666666666666
but it really isnt,40.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and indeed it was moving,40.0
it was moving,66.66666666666666
so whenever happened in this second stroke was was good for me because I was able to start moving my muscle,52.38095238095239
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle,36.36363636363637
and I was able to see with both eyes together,40.0
so I was there two or three days,25.0
and they took me back to the to the rehab hospital,54.54545454545454
and at that point I was able to up until that point Id rmy primarily been doing rehab in terms of mental stuff,37.5
and at that point then I was able to start doing smpu,33.33333333333333
and youknow as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to youknow start make myself move my muscles,50.0
my arm I can move my arm,57.14285714285714
my hand still wouldnt move,33.33333333333333
we just numbed it,50.0
I couldnt do yth couldnt move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that,50.0
and so I I do remember that when at that at that point,69.23076923076923
and you you I dont know,57.14285714285714
are you saying your question was,66.66666666666666
was that the question,75.0
yeah,0.0
and so I started working really hard,14.285714285714285
I started working really hard because at that point I knew that I knew that,53.333333333333336
well actually youknow I knew it before that,50.0
that I was some at some point I was gonna get better,61.53846153846154
I just couldnt do it,50.0
but at that point when I was steblu,62.5
and if I work at it hard enough Ill be able to get better,35.714285714285715
so I I was in that rehab hospital for two rehab hospitals for awhile,50.0
and then I went to a a long term care facility,36.36363636363637
and I was there for a hundred days,50.0
and they worked with me with a speech therapist a physical therapist and a occupational therapist,43.75
and the hundred days,25.0
I couldve used more but that was the limit for becauseof Medicare,53.84615384615385
but that was that was total of six months that I was I was not able to come come home,50.0
men,0.0
so we put a put a put a lift on the back on the port,53.333333333333336
and put one put a lift going upstairs because our is we have two story house,31.25
and so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs,50.0
I hadta I Id had some more rehab along,50.0
I had rehab at home for about another six weeks of of rehab,46.15384615384615
and he was very very good rehab rehab specialist,22.22222222222222
I did some other youknow occupational and and and and occupational and physical and,14.285714285714285
whats the third kind,40.0
anyway Ill come Ill coming up with in a minute in a minute,46.15384615384615
so I did that,50.0
and but I I never did I I never did give up,50.0
I always continued to work as hard as I could,40.0
youknow I I had had a very good physical therapist to help me,38.46153846153847
and so we worked hard on that,42.857142857142854
and that took me until,60.0
and it actually and then I got when I was when I was still at,60.0
then I went to we had therapy on an outpatient basis for awhile at a rehab hospital here on outpatient basis for several months,41.66666666666667
and during that time I met a,57.14285714285714
I dont really know how to describe him,44.44444444444444
hes a hes kindof a hes hes kindof a,69.23076923076923
he does not have a hes not hes not a phd,46.15384615384615
but he is a a doctor of education or something like that,66.66666666666666
but he is very very good at working with stroke people in in in terms of in terms of cognitive ability,42.857142857142854
and and I worked with him for about almost four years,36.36363636363637
and infact Ive just got work when I quit working with him maybe in the last six months,42.10526315789473
we were went to his office went to,62.5
well he had an office,40.0
it it it it he didnt have an office there,63.63636363636363
he had a he came to a he came to a university here,61.53846153846154
and he would meet with people there at the university,50.0
and I I was still in a wheelchair at that time,63.63636363636363
and I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was when I was actually in in a walker for another another year,62.857142857142854
and then when when I went to walking with with a cane I continued working at with him,61.111111111111114
but it his his his,80.0
I witch,50.0
but he works with with the cognitive abilities,50.0
and he helped me alot youknow,33.33333333333333
infact some of the things that weve done here is reminded me of some of the stuff that hes done that he did with me,70.37037037037037
youknow ll telling stories and and and alot different tests that that Im sure youre very familiar with,30.0
but he was he was able to work with me and just pull stuff outta me and make it work,40.0
and maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was was kindof inspire me to keep going and working working working,30.434782608695656
so I did that,50.0
and I worked hard on that,50.0
and I I worked hard,40.0
when I when I actually when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me I went to the YMCA,57.14285714285714
and I got a membership in the yl and and hired at the yl a personal trainer who who didnt really know anything about strokes,46.15384615384615
but she learned,33.33333333333333
she was very good at studying and learning,37.5
the first day that she saw me and I I was so stiff that that I couldnt move,57.89473684210527
I I couldnt move any,66.66666666666666
my arm was just,50.0
I dont know if you can see it here,60.0
its youknow your arm is just like this,62.5
and it has clenched fist and everything,42.857142857142854
and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like,46.15384615384615
and it wouldnt move,40.0
she worked with me,75.0
I went twice a week to go with her,44.44444444444444
and then in addition to that,50.0
h but after a while I went started Id say,36.36363636363637
I was I was still using my walker,62.5
Id say,0.0
and Im sure people probably thought stupid dumb,11.11111111111111
heres this this old guy walking around with his youknow very very slowly,30.76923076923077
itd take me youknow itd take me,44.44444444444444
it its six six times arounds,33.33333333333333
and it would take me probably half hour to walk around that lap,38.46153846153847
but I was I was determined to do it,55.55555555555556
and I did it,50.0
I did it,66.66666666666666
and then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane,50.0
I still go very slowly,20.0
but Im doing it,60.0
so Im gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself,38.88888888888889
and Im not trying to pat pat myself on the back,41.66666666666667
I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have,46.666666666666664
and Im sorry for them,50.0
they dont,33.33333333333333
but and I think I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive,42.857142857142854
I did not lose my drive,50.0
always Ive always been kinda driven anyway,37.5
youknow Ive always been driven,50.0
but I was driven to r to improve and get better,18.181818181818183
and Im still Im still doing that,44.44444444444444
and Im getting there,40.0
and it will never come to an end,50.0
but it I will keep working at it,62.5
okay,0.0
well when I,66.66666666666666
okay I tell you about my wife,57.14285714285714
hows that,66.66666666666666
at my wife,66.66666666666666
I Id been married before,66.66666666666666
my first wife had Huntingtons disease,16.666666666666664
I dont dont know if youre familiar with it,58.333333333333336
but she had Huntingtons disease for many many years,22.22222222222222
and she passed away oh about twenty years ago,11.11111111111111
I had a I had a friend,57.14285714285714
now how do I go into this,71.42857142857143
when she passed away before she passed away,75.0
this gets complicated,33.33333333333333
okay my my wifes my wifes brother my wifes brother had moved to Texas,42.857142857142854
in the in the nineties they they moved to Texas,70.0
and in Texas she met and became very close friends with someone in in Texas there that that she didnt know,45.45454545454545
but they she met,50.0
they c youknow they worked together,50.0
and they became very very close friends,14.285714285714285
are you in for a long story,71.42857142857143
so so my sister my sister inlaw sister inlaw her name is FirstnameD okay,28.57142857142857
and so they moved to Texas,33.33333333333333
and at some point they moved back to Wichita,44.44444444444444
and he went to work for for Boeing okay,33.33333333333333
so at some point this friend of friend of hers was going through a divorce,60.0
she shed been married for almost twenty years,37.5
and and and it end didnt end up very well,27.27272727272727
so she was going through a divorce,57.14285714285714
and so FirstnameD who is my sister inlaw invited her to come to Wichita just because she needed somebody to youknow she she she needed to needed to get away from the situation that she was,44.44444444444444
and so she she moved to chi Wichita,37.5
and becauseof the friendship that my sister inlaw had with her we got to know know them,47.05882352941176
my my wife and I got to know them,44.44444444444444
but not very well because my wife had Huntings,22.22222222222222
and you dont socialize very much when you have that exist,41.66666666666667
so I really did not know her them their friend very well,41.66666666666667
but we did see them once in awhile when wed go ke go to a family gathering or go to their house because FirstnameD would be there,53.57142857142857
and her friend would be there and and soforth,33.33333333333333
and so that was that was like nineteen ninety one or something like that,50.0
well to make a long story long FirstnameDs friend then moved to get got married got got married remarried and went to went and moved to California,22.22222222222222
she was out there for about a year,50.0
and she came back to Wichita,33.33333333333333
and her and her husband he came back to Wichita,40.0

and it it didnt take very well youknow,33.33333333333333
heart transplants theyre long drawn out,42.857142857142854
and she,50.0
and finally he gave out,40.0
in the meantime my my wife with Huntingtons disease was moved to a,61.53846153846154
we had her at a nursing home,57.14285714285714
she spent five years in a nursing home,37.5
now then and her nursing home was the same town about four or five blocks away from FirstnameSs friend,21.052631578947366
I had no idea they that she lived there,55.55555555555556
youknow I had no idea that she lived in that in that town or anywhere,53.333333333333336
so so at one point my wife finally youknow she went downhill and went downhill and and and passed away in two thousand two,20.833333333333336
I called FirstnameD my sister inlaw to tell her that that FirstnameJ had passed away,46.666666666666664
and FirstnameS and and no and FirstnameD said,0.0
FirstnameC just died yesterday,0.0
and FirstnameC is FirstnameSs husband,20.0
I say,50.0
over over time I it and not right away but over time I,38.46153846153847
FirstnameS was living up there in the in in in Sedrick the town of Sedrick where the nursing home was,45.0
and at some point FirstnameS said or FirstnameD said,33.33333333333333
I said,50.0
so youknow after after after you lose a spouse its very difficult to for people to understand where youre going through when you lose a spouse,51.85185185185185
and I I went I was in this little town where FirstnameS lived,53.84615384615385
didnt really have any any didnt have any limits on fireworks,46.15384615384615
okay thats only important because my kids wanted to have re wanted to have some fireworks,35.294117647058826
and youknow oh oh my kids wanted to have some fireworks,18.181818181818183
so I said,33.33333333333333
well not my kids my grandkids,33.33333333333333
I said,50.0
so went up there went up there,0.0
and and youknow I just said,16.666666666666664
and she said,33.33333333333333
so we did,33.33333333333333
and then we started started kindof getting to know each other at that point,28.57142857142857
because like I say you dont you you if unless youve lost a spouse you dont realize what its like,60.86956521739131
and so FirstnameS I kindof had an immediate bond there because we had both lost recently lost our spouses,42.10526315789473
and both of us had spouses that add,50.0
it took years before he passed passed away and and my my wife,46.15384615384615
and so youknow we started we youknow its it was a it was a t kinda a natural bond,52.63157894736842
and so we tu,25.0
and here we are,50.0
and so FirstnameD is still FirstnameD is still FirstnameSs best friend,18.181818181818183
infact she was here just yesterday or day before,33.33333333333333
theyre still best friends,20.0
and thats what happened to me was youknow my wet,54.54545454545454
and that was fifteen years ago fifteen years ago that we got married almost fifteen,33.33333333333333
wait a minute,33.33333333333333
see lemme think,0.0
lemme think,0.0
no its over fifteen years,40.0
it was fifteen last October,40.0
okay,0.0
okay,0.0
well I is a theres a theres a little little boy,53.84615384615385
not a real little boy,20.0
hes not a little boy,33.33333333333333
hes maybe I dont know ten twelve something in there,33.33333333333333
hes out kicking the soccer ball around,50.0
hes hes wearing a ball cap,50.0
and hes wearing jeans,40.0
and hes kicking the soccer ball around,50.0
and he kicks it kicks it really hard,37.5
raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air,42.857142857142854
and then it goes to it then you see the the soccer ball travels through the air and hits a window,42.857142857142854
theres shutters on the window,50.0
its its a nice size picture not a picture window good one good size window,26.666666666666668
and theres a bushes outside the window,50.0
and it the the the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp,46.666666666666664
knocks the lamp off the off outof knocks the lamp off the table,46.15384615384615
but it knocks the lamp over,50.0
and no,50.0
so it knocks the lamp over and and comes through the window,41.66666666666667
the guy is sitting there probably watching tv or something,30.0
but he gets up picks up the soccer ball walks over to the window,50.0
and youknow the the window,40.0
I think we talked about this last time,50.0
the window is there,75.0
the the lamp where the where the where the soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore,57.89473684210527
its the lamp is gone,60.0
the curtains are are are little bit different,50.0
theres Im not sure what what Im not sure what the,50.0
yeah its theres there Im not sure what some of the something is there the,64.70588235294117
anyway though theres a lady,50.0
and but the the lamp and the chair are no longer there,33.33333333333333
and I think the Im gonna say that the the window ledge is is lower than it was,60.0
it just it looks different,40.0
but the guy he looks out the window,50.0
and I think I think he doesnt know where it came from,53.84615384615385
but I am sure hes probably going to find out,45.45454545454545
and hes probably going to make somebodys pay for the window,33.33333333333333
so the moral of that story is if youre gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesnt go through the window,50.0
the end,50.0
oh I forgot the beginning and the end last time didnt I,30.76923076923077
okay the beginning is that they the the the the the little kid,69.23076923076923
I think its a boy,60.0
is going off to school,60.0
and the mom tries to hand him a an umbrella,40.0
and he says,33.33333333333333
so he waves goodbye to the mom,42.857142857142854
hes got his backpack on,66.66666666666666
head for school,33.33333333333333
waves bye tell tells tells mom goodbye,0.0
and shes standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesnt wanna take with him,47.05882352941176
so he starts walking off to school,42.857142857142854
and theres some some raindrops coming down not alot but just a few raindrops here and there,27.77777777777778
and he looks up at the sky,57.14285714285714
and hes like,50.0
so he said,33.33333333333333
and he turns around,50.0
and he and its raining harder,33.33333333333333
and now the winds kinda blowing because the rains coming at an angle,38.46153846153847
and its its quite a bit of rain because as he as he runs hes hes splashing,68.42105263157895
so theres enough rain thats making making little splashes,27.27272727272727
and hes kinda holding his hand up over his head like asthough hes gonna be able to stop the water off his head,50.0
but he runs home,25.0
and you can tell the say the mom is a little alittle perturbed but he get because he wouldnt take the umbrella,47.82608695652174
so there there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet,23.076923076923077
and the mom just kinda looks at him like,44.44444444444444
he said,50.0
so she gives him r umbrella,33.33333333333333
and he head heads back to school,28.57142857142857
and its still raining,25.0
its still raining pretty hard,20.0
its coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was,64.28571428571429
so it must be lo blowing pretty hard at a forty five degree angle,35.714285714285715
and hes walk hes got his backpack,44.44444444444444
and hes walking off to school,57.14285714285714
and I the the moral of the story is listen to your mom,61.53846153846154
she knows best,33.33333333333333
the end,50.0
oh yeah Ive seen this one before okay,44.44444444444444
okay,0.0
so the beginning is the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree,53.84615384615385
and the little girl is upset because the cats up the tree,50.0
and she cant get her down,57.14285714285714
I think shes calling the cat to come down,50.0
but the cat wont come down,42.857142857142854
so either cat wont or cant,37.5
but it looks like the cat really doesnt care to come down,38.46153846153847
hes like,66.66666666666666
so the little girl says youknow,16.666666666666664
and shes the little girl is probably,37.5
I dont know,50.0
shes pretty young because shes still riding a tricycle,45.45454545454545
and she got pigtails and little black sandals,12.5
like I said shes riding riding that little ik tricycle,36.36363636363637
the cat wont the cat wont come down,50.0
so apparently the the the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down,37.5
and he he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there,46.15384615384615
and something happened,33.33333333333333
Im gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree ran into the ladder or something,50.0
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down,44.44444444444444
the dads stuck in the tree,50.0
and I dont know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone,46.666666666666664
maybe its maybe,33.33333333333333
I dont know,50.0
thats he musta had a cellphone,42.857142857142854
he calls the fire department,40.0
and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters,27.27272727272727
and theyre carrying their ladder,50.0
and theyre running over to get the man down outta outta the tree,42.857142857142854
meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree,50.0
I dont know if hes I dont think I dont think hes mad,50.0
I think hes just barking up the kriu,55.55555555555556
so the the firemen are on their way,62.5
theyve got their ladder,60.0
trucks sitting out and set on the setting out on the street,50.0
theres a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away,36.36363636363637
and yeah then thats thats pretty much it,30.0
its a its a its a big tree big tree,60.0
yeah both,50.0
and it is its summertime because the trees have leaves on on,58.333333333333336
yeah okay well thats thats about good,22.22222222222222
okay,0.0
www,0.0
okay,0.0
alright well at the beginning I I dont know if this is true or not,50.0
I dont know if this is really what what happened in the story,64.28571428571429
but looks like it looks like that for some reason maybe somebody took somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else,50.0
and I dont know the story behind that,55.55555555555556
but thats what it looks like,57.14285714285714
and then so she says,20.0
well when when shes gone it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend,55.00000000000001
she musta she musta been sleeping in the out in the stable with the animals I guess,58.82352941176471
she in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters,50.0
she was doing their laundry,60.0
she was doing all the work,66.66666666666666
and like I said she had become more of a slave than than anything else,53.333333333333336
so they lived in the in the shadow of of the castle,66.66666666666666
and I think she dreamt about the castle,50.0
looks like she was in the one picture it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that,70.0
thats what it looks like anyway,57.14285714285714
and so it turns out that the that the king little short fat king,42.857142857142854
I dont know why the little short why the king is always short and fat but he is,47.368421052631575
is looking for somebody to marry his his daughter,55.55555555555556
and he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom sothat the the the the girls can have their their pick of,60.71428571428571
they cant have their pick,50.0
but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball,60.0
and theyll have a chance to show off to to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him,50.0
so he sent out this invitation,50.0
and ofcourse the the the the wicked stepmother or the whatever she is the mother she ofcourse doesnt let doesnt want Cinderella to go to the ball,48.275862068965516
so the other girls go off to the ball,44.44444444444444
and Cinderella stays home,0.0
and and shes gotta tend to the animals or whatever,41.66666666666667
so the fairy godmother came along,16.666666666666664
and Im not sure how she got into the story,45.45454545454545
but she came along,50.0
the fairy godmother showed up and with a with a carriage a pumpkin,53.84615384615385
it was that the I guess fairy godmother turned the turned the turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a for the r for Cinderella to ride in,57.14285714285714
they went to the went to the ball with the two horses and and the footman and the and the driver and all that,50.0
they went to the went to the ball they went to the ball but they went to the ball,57.89473684210527
and the nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful,61.53846153846154
so she the the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the pumpkin,47.368421052631575
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is,46.15384615384615
they up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see its about a minute before midnight,61.111111111111114
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the before the the pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while its still a carriage,50.0
runs or runs and dnu,0.0
but in the way she lost her slipper,50.0
she was running down the stairs,66.66666666666666
the slipper fell off,50.0
and she didnt have time to go back and pick it up I guess,33.33333333333333
so she went on got in the carriage with youknow the carriage and went home,40.0
the the prince was heartbroken because he and and me because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the who had come to the ball,64.51612903225806
and nobody knew who she was,66.66666666666666
but he had fallen in love with her,62.5
and so he sent he sent eryb he sent his man or servants or whatever out to find this the person whose foot would fit in the slipper,42.857142857142854
and so they went to Cinderellas house,28.57142857142857
and ofcourse the the two sisters there they tried it on,45.45454545454545
and ofcourse it didnt fit,33.33333333333333
and so the Cinderella was there as a servant,44.44444444444444
and I think the I think the fairy godmother or something said made worked it out somehow that sothat the the the prince would try the slipper on Cinderellas foot,53.333333333333336
and sure enough it fit perfectly,16.666666666666664
it was perfectly obvious whose whose foot it was,66.66666666666666
and it was Cinderellas,50.0
and so everybody was happy,40.0
all the animals were happy,60.0
the the animals were l the the little rats,55.55555555555556
everyone was celebrating as the as Cinderella gets in the the the carriage with the prince,68.75
and they ride off into the distance and live happily ever after,41.66666666666667
you get you you get some you got some bread,60.0
thats the first thing I guess,42.857142857142854
get get get the bread outof the outof the outof the refrigerator because I we keep our bread in the refrigerator,52.38095238095239
so you get the bread out,50.0
then you go to the pantry,50.0
and you get out the the peanut butter,50.0
open the peanut butter,25.0
and is is this a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,40.0
I I think it is,80.0
so then I then I go back to the refrigerator and take out the take out the jelly,44.44444444444444
and open up the bread sack,33.33333333333333
and open up the peanut butter jar,28.57142857142857
and open up the open up the jar of jelly,50.0
I go to the knife drawer near the drawer where we keep the silverware,57.14285714285714
and I take out a knife and take out two pieces of bread,38.46153846153847
and I spread the peanut butter on on one of the pieces of bread,50.0
and then I take another piece of bread and spread peanut jelly on the on that one,41.17647058823529
I put them together,50.0
and I go put the the the knife in the dishwasher so it gets cleaned up,62.5
and put the jar jelly jar back in the refrigerator,30.0
and put the bread back in the refrigerator,37.5
and then I go over and put the peanut butter back in the pantry,28.57142857142857
and then I sit down and eat my peanut butter and jelly sandwich,23.076923076923077

my speech today is doing pretty good,28.57142857142857
some days not,33.33333333333333
yes I had a stroke at the school,50.0
and I was a teacher,60.0
and I had had headaches for about a week or so and still working during the day,35.294117647058826
and they said allofasudden I said,33.33333333333333
and allofasudden I I was talking to the the nurse thats at the school,60.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
and I kept I was trying I was talking,55.55555555555556
I thought what I was saying was right,62.5
and I kept saying,25.0
and she kept saying,25.0
and obviously my talking was not even all there,33.33333333333333
and I dont remember anything from that point to I was I had this tube in there,55.55555555555556
I got my brain done,40.0
I got I had a tube going,42.857142857142854
I was out,66.66666666666666
it breathes you and everything,60.0
I dont rimmbvu,50.0
I didnt even know my name,42.857142857142854
I didnt know who I was,71.42857142857143
they gave me a mirror to know who I was,60.0
and I didnt know it was me,62.5
I thought it was a picture of someone else,66.66666666666666
so yeah for that long,40.0
so I had about two weeks of not here,22.22222222222222
yes,0.0
lets see,0.0
at the beginning I had I could not walk yet,50.0
so they were helping me to stand up at the beginning not walking anywhere but able to stand up,36.84210526315789
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side,50.0
so I had one therapist that bet,28.57142857142857
this one arm was not always going,28.57142857142857
so weights trying to get that going,14.285714285714285
then I had another therapist was trying to get me to start talking,30.76923076923077
I couldnt really talk of anything,57.14285714285714
so they were showing me like yesq or noq alot,40.0
I we had to start with that,57.14285714285714
sometimes I didnt really even understand if they said,40.0
usually they would show me that,66.66666666666666
and I thought,33.33333333333333
Id so that was hard,50.0
even at the beginning I didnt even understand cups,40.0
and they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere,42.10526315789473
and they showed me how to they hadta show me how to eat again,50.0
to at the beginning I was very very scared by myself in a room,57.14285714285714
I also thought we had I I thought someone had took me like like a bad person taking me,47.368421052631575
so I was trying to run to help myself,33.33333333333333
I had those thoughts too of scared to the point where I was trying to hit people in a way because I thought they were trying to help no I thought they were bad people,51.42857142857142
so I I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run,43.75
that was even that part for me,71.42857142857143
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way,41.66666666666667
didnt my mom and dad were there,37.5
didnt know who they were,66.66666666666666
my kids were here,50.0
didnt know them,50.0
like I said they showed me a mirror,50.0
and they said,33.33333333333333
and I I thought,50.0
and it was me,75.0
so thats when it got started,71.42857142857143
then therapy started with even very small like saying my name saying yesq or noq,20.0
went from that point to we played some games for numbers like dice,53.84615384615385
we played some games that were cards like play cards in a way put sort all the cards together what colors matching,45.45454545454545
h little things,0.0
it gives me focus,50.0
and also I would lksu,40.0
if were playing a game I was okay,62.5
so we did that,50.0
then they started giving me cards,33.33333333333333
what the first one I ever saw was a baby,50.0
theres a baby card,40.0
and there was a bird,40.0
and they said,33.33333333333333
is it a bird or a baby,57.14285714285714
and it took,33.33333333333333
I didnt know,50.0
but I knew it a little bit in my brain,50.0
but not really on what they were youknow,50.0
it was happy thoughts,50.0
but I dont know I wasnt sure what that was,58.333333333333336
thats when it started,60.0
then I was able to start not walking very well,20.0
but I could stand up pivot sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself,47.05882352941176
thats when all that started during,71.42857142857143
once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning,31.818181818181817
I still do have to watch my dizzy feelings,33.33333333333333
but therapy that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better stuff like that,41.17647058823529
and other therapy was still doing the talking started at the beginning,33.33333333333333
so its that was about a year of just talking working on all those words and all that youknow,52.63157894736842
then after two years didnt have to worry about the other therapy because now Im starting to walk very well now,30.434782608695656
so only just therapy for for speech,28.57142857142857
then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years we started working on these numbers which I still not good at,46.15384615384615
I went from one to now I know one and two to one two three,33.33333333333333
Im not higher than that not very good so youknow,27.27272727272727
and one plus one not sure there yet,0.0
but so was working on numbers and trying to start reading of any kind,28.57142857142857
reading it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading,30.76923076923077
Im still not all there,33.33333333333333
now its been three years,40.0
I can I really cant read I say,55.55555555555556
sentences maybe,0.0
it depends on what were talking about,71.42857142857143
Im starting to read books from ke little kids books,27.27272727272727
now I can do some of that,71.42857142857143
writing is not as good,20.0
so I use my phone,40.0
but therapy people was showing me ke apps stuff like that,36.36363636363637
because someday if you cant write again theres other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that,45.0
so well I cant remember the first thing were talking about,41.66666666666667
sorry about that,66.66666666666666
see this is me,75.0
okay kzu,0.0
lets see,0.0
I does it have to so what,57.14285714285714
are you talking about just a story are you saying,60.0
or are you saying ke something about something like that,80.0
okay I think is is new stuff,42.857142857142854
I I think since since Im a teacher,66.66666666666666
and I was before,75.0
but now I hafta be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school right,40.0
so one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke,31.25
they have aphasia,33.33333333333333
and we when theres a new patient here I I like to help them,46.666666666666664
theyre gonna have the the same struggles most of the time that I had,50.0
and so now we we are now friends,37.5
I can help them to have her,57.14285714285714
and tips I can give them,50.0
and so now when I do that kind of stuff Im now a teacher again,37.5
so I I like that,60.0
and theyre also now my friends,28.57142857142857
I when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back,46.15384615384615
so I havent seen some of them now for years,54.54545454545454
they dont call me back,50.0
they dont understand me now,50.0
so my new friends are kinda like me,50.0
were very we talk alot which is good,50.0
but I think that we have bad days,37.5
therapy is hard some days,40.0
some days our brain mine my I would say my brain doesnt always work some days,47.05882352941176
my eyes dont always work,33.33333333333333
my foot now that were talking my foots not working right now,33.33333333333333
things like that,66.66666666666666
but my life being a teacher and a friend is is an awesome thing to me,56.25
yeah yeah,0.0
okay,0.0
I cant see us on the last one because were in the middle ourselves,66.66666666666666
so Im not sure whats under the last one,36.36363636363637
looks like theres a boy thats been hitting the ball round,53.84615384615385
probably a,50.0
I remember the name of those little guys,50.0
but theyre playing that ball,50.0
and it looks he hit the window,42.857142857142854
and it hit the window and went in,37.5
so it crashed the window,40.0
yeah,0.0
and I dont know if its his house or not,45.45454545454545
it could be someone elses house,66.66666666666666
but and he also hit the lamp also,25.0
and the guy,33.33333333333333
Im gonna move this again just a minute and Ill,33.33333333333333
so the guy is well he has the ball,44.44444444444444
but I dont know if he,57.14285714285714
yeah hes just looking,40.0
so I dont know if that kid decided to leave,36.36363636363637
or if hes gone,60.0
so that that must be there should be more story line on that one,71.42857142857143
I dont know if he he ran or if the if the guys just going,56.25
okay okay,0.0
one of the kids have,40.0
and mom said,0.0
and the kid said,25.0
and Im sure mom said,16.666666666666664
and so but he went outside,16.666666666666664
and here comes the rain going faster even maybe more raindrops,9.090909090909092
and so then he said,20.0
he went the other way home and said,25.0
and so mom gave it to him,42.857142857142854
and then he went back outside for school with the blu,36.36363636363637
yes thats a funny one,33.33333333333333
okay,0.0
it it looks like theres a cat stuck in the tree,58.333333333333336
and so dad said,0.0
and the ladder fell down,40.0
and so someone mustve called the fire people,44.44444444444444
and theyre going to get him outof the the tree and maybe even the cat,37.5
lets see,0.0
there,0.0
yeah I dont know if its really dad I guess,45.45454545454545
maybe its just someone who is helping for the cat,60.0
or if its youknow the little girls dad that did that,45.45454545454545
Im not sure,25.0
I dont see any houses around,57.14285714285714
so its hard to tell,20.0
she had her bike I guess,50.0
but and theres a dog obviously thats barking because theres a guy up there in the in the tree,50.0
so yep,0.0
okay,0.0
I dont remember her name sorry,42.857142857142854
its hard,50.0
okay,0.0
she,100.0
lets see,0.0
I dont remember where she comes from,62.5
but shes in the the house with the,66.66666666666666
its not her mom,50.0
its,100.0
I dont remember what calls that,57.14285714285714
but its not her mommomnn youknow,33.33333333333333
and but theres two other sisters,14.285714285714285
and they get to do whatever they want during the day,45.45454545454545
but the other girl hasta clean and and do all the stuff that who wants to do right,27.77777777777778
and Im sure shes but shes yeah she watches the the castle the big one,38.88888888888889
and Im sure that she watches and thinks,33.33333333333333
and then they we get a letter that says theyre gonna do a,46.666666666666664
lets see what,33.33333333333333
its not a party,50.0
theres a word but I dont have it,50.0
the ball,50.0
thats what they call it yeah,57.14285714285714
so like a party in a way,42.857142857142854
but you dance and look beautiful,16.666666666666664
and everyone could go,50.0
and I think theyre going to do that because they want the prince,50.0
I think hes a prince,50.0
and he finds he needs to find a lady,33.33333333333333
and so theres a way to do it I think,36.36363636363637
so they said,33.33333333333333
and so when they got their paper I think she even gets to go,35.714285714285715
she didnt say she couldnt go,50.0
but she had a beautiful dress in her,50.0
I say its not its not a a box,55.55555555555556
its something pretty,66.66666666666666
but I dont know what they call those things,50.0
and but she was looking at the dress,50.0
and oh Im gonna look so good,22.22222222222222
and the other girls they dont look as cute,30.0
but they they she they looked her stuff,62.5
and they wanted this and that and dress and tore her dress and everything,35.714285714285715
and so they were gonna go,28.57142857142857
and she looked she didnt have thing,37.5
and so she was sad,40.0
and the fairy,33.33333333333333
I think thats what she is,71.42857142857143
I dont remember,50.0
right now shes different than the one you watch her another way,46.15384615384615
useta be a small one,40.0
now shes a a real lady,42.857142857142854
but she was there,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
and so she takes the the rats and and the dog and everything become people,33.33333333333333
and the pumpkin they make it pretty for her to go in there,38.46153846153847
and they gave her a dress that looks beautiful,44.44444444444444
and she said,33.33333333333333
and so she may forget that part at the beginning,50.0
shes just shes so excited,28.57142857142857
she doesnt think about the time very well really laughs,36.36363636363637
and so so then,0.0
lets see,0.0
she gets in there,25.0
and Im sure that everyone says,42.857142857142854
and but the,33.33333333333333
hes not a king yet,33.33333333333333
the prince sees her and said,33.33333333333333
and so they dance and and everything,28.57142857142857
and allofasudden she does figure out the time,50.0
and she looks at that and says,42.857142857142854
and so she runs down the stairs,42.857142857142854
but one of her theyre not shoes heels,33.33333333333333
I dont know,50.0
theres theres ru,40.0
I dont know,50.0
I say shoes,33.33333333333333
so she one of them falls,50.0
and she gets home,25.0
and you could tell she was she had a good night,54.54545454545454
but shes probably also kindof sad on the fact she never gets to come back in her head youknow,35.0
but it was a beautiful night,50.0
and then shes back at home cleaning and everything else,27.27272727272727
and here comes one of the people who works for the youknow the king and guy Im sure,36.84210526315789
so they bring this guy,40.0
and he has one of the shoes and says he they want to find the pretty one,35.294117647058826
and those girls ofcourse theyre hoping they know theyre not her shoes,42.857142857142854
but they said,33.33333333333333
and ofcourse their usually have big feet or who knows,20.0
but I dont xxx that part of that story,50.0
but I remember it before,60.0
and then so allofasudden she gets to decide now,11.11111111111111
I dont know if they really the I dont think the other mom wouldve let her even try it,54.54545454545454
but Im sure someone I dont I dont one of the one of the rats figure this out or something,52.17391304347826
they they help her to to sit down and put them on,50.0
so there must be kindof thing going on to help her to do that,42.857142857142854
and then and they fit,20.0
and so she gets to come back to the castle,30.0
and they get married,25.0
and oh and the end is always the,37.5
oh whats the word,40.0
I wish I had it in my head,62.5
but its not there,25.0
youknow they always say at the end,42.857142857142854
ke alwaysq,0.0
well what is those words,60.0
I wish I remember the name,50.0
it was like it always says the end of all the stories,66.66666666666666

but Im excited about it,50.0
so and they are always together,33.33333333333333
youknow they always do,25.0
yeah,0.0
oh okay now Im going to show you theres another way to do this,37.5

so if you want peanut butter jelly right together,22.22222222222222
so the first thing you need is two bread slices,30.0
and then whats weird about it you deed,44.44444444444444
and you take some of the peanut butter,50.0
and you put it in the cup,57.14285714285714
and then you get some of the jelly,50.0
and it has to be a certain kind because my dad only says you can have this kind,44.44444444444444
I dont know its one of those things,55.55555555555556
and you put that in there,50.0
and you get a spoon,40.0
and you stir it like this,66.66666666666666
I dont know Ive done this since I was a kid,69.23076923076923
and then you take it outof the cup,37.5
and you put it on the bread together,50.0
and then you put them together like this,50.0
and the you eat it that way,57.14285714285714
although when youre a kid youre also go,60.0
dad only lets you do that part because this is his smwtu,50.0
you get part of the the from the spoon,66.66666666666666
yeah,0.0
my speech I think theyre not too bad,33.33333333333333
better than it was it was before,85.71428571428571
yeah doing very well,0.0
not a hundred percent but youknow good enough right,11.11111111111111
yes its been a little bit more than three years,40.0
yeah right about a week before my birthday,37.5
yes had my stroke,25.0
I had been having headaches,60.0
and I was I was a teacher working at a school and working,53.84615384615385
and during that day my headache was getting more worse,40.0
and I went to the nurse that day at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile,52.17391304347826
and as we were talking she looked at me funny,60.0
and she said that,50.0
and I thought I was talking fine,42.857142857142854
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that,50.0
and she knew that I was having a stroke from that,63.63636363636363
and they called five six seven eight nineoneone,12.5
and I dont remember,40.0
right after that when they,80.0
I remember being in the what do you call it in the,83.33333333333334
its not a car youknow,40.0
its not a truck,50.0
its is being in there laying down youknow,62.5
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions,44.44444444444444
but I could not think,40.0
at that point it was getting worse as it goes,60.0
and they ended up taking me,50.0
and one of the guys who does brains he found a spot,41.66666666666667
they made it a picture,60.0
they said that youre having you have a clot in your brain in the back,62.5
and its starting to blood,40.0
and it starts to take part of your what do you call it ke cells in a way that die,50.0
and so he he ended up giving me surgery at that point and fixed it pretty much yeah,38.88888888888889
so Im still here today,16.666666666666664
but the clot is still here,33.33333333333333
it hasnt left,50.0
so thats why Im taking the medicine I am,72.72727272727273
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I it happened again,53.333333333333336
they said I was taking medicine that rktdu,50.0
it most people dont have trouble with it,44.44444444444444
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think,50.0
theyre hoping that they,80.0
yeah its one of those things,50.0
yup,0.0
I think at the beginning the first thing they were helping me to stand up to be able to walk again,42.857142857142854
they were more into that at the very beginning than other ke aphasia type stuff,46.666666666666664
they wanted to make sure I was able to to walk again and because my one side of my body was starting to have trouble they said,33.33333333333333
so they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning,37.5
they started doing some little task for me,50.0
ke we played cards to see how many cards I can find looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that,42.857142857142854
but we were doing that just here and there feeling,30.0
I was also very sad very emotional feeling,25.0
didnt I couldnt even remember who I was,60.0
and so getting to work on therapy when you dont know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff,50.0
once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year,45.45454545454545
so said,0.0
so once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit we started working on therapy,47.368421052631575
and they said,33.33333333333333
and my talking I couldnt say pretty much any I couldnt say anything,46.666666666666664
they were saying like,50.0
I didnt understand what that meant,57.14285714285714
so theyd give me ke a cup,37.5
theyd take the cup and show me,37.5
and Id go yesq or noq,14.285714285714285
it took me a l even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it,50.0
if you dont want it it goes this way,60.0
took that long to figure that out,42.857142857142854
little things like that that I didnt remember,55.55555555555556
then once I was able to atleast think a little bit more we started with pictures like that bird and the and the boy and the banana,37.03703703703704
and we start that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words,44.44444444444444
and my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else,28.57142857142857
so still working on therapy myself,33.33333333333333
I have a book at home that I still do my homework everyday,46.15384615384615
so still going,0.0
its I Im the only thing I cant do right now yet is read and write,33.33333333333333
and I said but I told myself that Im going to do it,50.0
so Im not done yet when it comes to coming up youknow,46.15384615384615
Im going to read someday,33.33333333333333
and I will write,50.0
and I will have numbers at some point,50.0
so yeah,0.0
lets see,0.0
lets lets see,0.0
I oh one of my from a long time ago when I was I dont know ten fifteen right in there youknow teens in a way we had my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage,43.24324324324324
and we on the weekends you went to the cottage,60.0
and we wouldnt go every weekend,42.857142857142854
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools youknow,35.714285714285715
we would take that time,60.0
and I think that was one my favorite places to go,36.36363636363637
we could fish,66.66666666666666
we could swim,66.66666666666666
we could,100.0
and it wasnt very deep,33.33333333333333
there was alot,33.33333333333333
now it was deep in the middle,57.14285714285714
but right now Imean you could didnt really hafta swim,27.27272727272727
you could just walk around a little bit,50.0
there were frogs,33.33333333333333
there was turtles at,50.0
so Imean it was we got up in the morning,60.0
and I think we ate as fast as we could to be to go outside,40.0
and I think youre pretty much outside until its time to go to bed,33.33333333333333
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that all the fun things that we were able to do,57.14285714285714
ke my dad let me,40.0
we useta have a rowboat that had paddles,37.5
but we also had one that had the motor in the back,41.66666666666667
and it now youre you were not allowed to go fast,41.66666666666667
it was like two what do you call it ke no five fast,53.84615384615385
so it wasnt very fast,33.33333333333333
you could almost swim as fast as you can the youknow the boat,53.84615384615385
but they let me actually mow s,28.57142857142857
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that that paddle boat and stuff like that,45.0
I loved to to drive,20.0
I just thought that was really cool,42.857142857142854
Im not sure why now it was like it was such a big thing,60.0
but it was youknow,50.0
and I was by myself on the boat youknow,66.66666666666666
and I thought I was something else youknow and all that,54.54545454545454
we forgot the gas one time,33.33333333333333
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid,57.14285714285714
but I think that was,60.0
and at night we had we had ke a a place to lay down outside,40.0
and we would go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty,46.666666666666664
and I I think when I have my if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage,52.0
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads,45.45454545454545
I think about that place,60.0
I dont know why,60.0
yeah,0.0
www,0.0
theres a boy outside that was hitting the ball around and having fun Im sure,41.17647058823529
and but as he was going by he hit the ball on the window,57.14285714285714
and it broke,33.33333333333333
and it actually went in the house with it,55.55555555555556
so the that ball fell into someone elses house,44.44444444444444
and Im sure the guy,33.33333333333333
I cant see that he has a picture,55.55555555555556
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously,36.36363636363637
but it even hit the lamp and everything,37.5
and so he was looking to see youknow what happened,30.0
so hes looking for the the kid,62.5
so we dont know if he took off or if he was going oops feeling or what,50.0
we dont see him in the picture now,55.55555555555556
so at the end all we know is that the theres a guy with the ball looking for to outside to see whats happening,57.692307692307686
yeah,0.0
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened,57.14285714285714
we dont know what happens this time,50.0
okay,0.0
in the morning the the little boy are,62.5

and said,0.0
and the boy said,25.0

and so he said bye mom and went to school started walking,16.666666666666664
and here comes the rain,20.0
and it started probably even more rain as it looked,30.0
and so he ran to come home the other way,20.0
and lets see,0.0
so he went back in the house probably and said,30.0
and so she said,25.0
and so he put it on the brlu,50.0

theres a cat that was going up this tree on that bird,61.53846153846154
and I think it was up there and stuck,33.33333333333333
and so this little girl was watching and thought,22.22222222222222
and there was probably a guy walking by,37.5
and he thought,33.33333333333333
and but he got up there,16.666666666666664
and now hes stuck too it looks like,33.33333333333333
and someone saw the guy up there,28.57142857142857
and the firetruck called and said,16.666666666666664
and so they brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down,28.57142857142857
yeah,0.0
okay,0.0
alright,0.0
so lets see,0.0
she she,100.0
I think her mom mustve died because dad is finding a new a very bad lady,47.05882352941176
and now shes here stepmom in a way now right and with two girls,26.666666666666668
and they come to their really nice place,37.5
and she hasta do all the dishes and the laundry and everything,41.66666666666667
and the other girls actually they were even doing ke either singing,25.0
or they do their little mstrmntsu,33.33333333333333
theyre doing all of that during the day and having their fun,61.53846153846154
and they found out that theres going to be a a ball youknow kind of thing,52.94117647058824
and everyone can go and everything,50.0
and the so she goes to get a dress,33.33333333333333
and it was new in my head on the fact that the the birds I think and maybe see others a little friends helped her to make even bru,41.37931034482759
its one of those things that they lock,62.5
and they got outof there,20.0
it looks really pretty,25.0
but shes like,50.0
but its gonna look pretty,16.666666666666664
but then the birds said,20.0
and they maybe even some of the little mice or something whoever they are youknow were helping to put her her dress look even better,44.0
and they got it done,40.0
and shes gonna go too,28.57142857142857
and but she also cant have a ride because theyre going youknow the the mom and the two girls get to go together,36.0
so she had to find a way to to go,20.0
and and as as they were leaving they said,55.55555555555556
I want this and this that you have,62.5
and so that was they took all of her beads and everything that was pretty,60.0
and so now she doesnt have ride to get to be there,30.76923076923077
and also her dress was torn and everything,37.5
and she found the,50.0
I cant remember what her name is,62.5
shes like a fairy,60.0
I dont I dont remember what they call those little guys,46.15384615384615
but anyway youknow shes just sitting here and there,20.0
shes there to to help you,28.57142857142857
and she said,33.33333333333333
and so they get that done,33.33333333333333
and all of the little mice become youknow like guys,40.0
oh and the so as one of the I think their dog goes and youknow as one of as one of the guys that doing the driving and all that,50.0
and so that thats how she gets there,55.55555555555556
and once gets here Im sure that theyre gonna be like,42.857142857142854
and they wont be very excited about that the fact that she made it here,56.25
and she looks really good,20.0
and so then the here is the new,37.5
hes not a king yet,33.33333333333333
hes a princess,50.0
no thats a thats a guy thats a girl not a king,46.666666666666664
see I dont remember whose is whose,62.5
but youknow its one of the the the its the kings kid in a way right,56.25
and he finds her and says,33.33333333333333
and so theyre dancing and everything,42.857142857142854
and then she she looked at the clock which I now I forget to tell you,50.0
but youknow shes only allowed shes only she is only allowed to be there until midnight,38.88888888888889
and so shes kept looking at the clock,44.44444444444444
shes good at that,60.0
shes watching,66.66666666666666
and so as they were dancing and everything she thought,50.0
and so ofcourse he probably said,16.666666666666664
and she said,33.33333333333333
so shes running,50.0
and Im sure even the one of the guys who worked there even had a question,35.294117647058826
and she I think she said,50.0
and so as she went one of her shoes fall,40.0
and she gets all the way home,42.857142857142854
and ofcourse you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for youknow back,50.0
and theres the dog and everybodys sitting there,22.22222222222222
and Im sure shes thinking,42.857142857142854
and I dont know if shes even a know she ever see her him again,47.05882352941176
but at least she had a real beautiful day night youknow,27.27272727272727
and then but theres theres a guy coming back at all the houses I think youknow to see where that that shoe came from,42.30769230769231
and I think that the mom that new mom said,40.0
which they probably knew it was her at the beginning youknow because she looked way too good,52.94117647058824
and so they locked her in the like in her room or in the palace or who knows she is,55.00000000000001
I dont know,50.0
its always bad over there youknow that,28.57142857142857
shes they stuck her in there,42.857142857142854
and but here comes the one little mice that got the key to let her in to get outta there,25.0
and so when she got in there they said,33.33333333333333
and and she doesnt look good,28.57142857142857
so youknow I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point,38.46153846153847
and then there she is,40.0
she said,50.0
and so she sits down,20.0
and it fit,33.33333333333333
and so so she she made it,42.857142857142854
and so they put her youknow took her back over to the the castle,42.857142857142854
and they get a marry,40.0
and what is it called happy whatever you call it,60.0
its on my cup,75.0

thats my goal,50.0
so so alotsof,0.0
right,0.0
okay I I know I tote,50.0
see what else can I say,50.0
well youknow the one thing that has been awesome this last year was I couldnt drive after my stroke,50.0
and so it was nine months that I would hafta ask someone to help me to go somewhere,38.88888888888889
or I would have to get a jubu,37.5
and sometimes I would hafta go to Boise,37.5
and I would hafta get a jubu,42.857142857142854
and that would be fifty dollars one way,37.5
it was crazy,66.66666666666666
and my sister would help me out sometimes,50.0
and my mother inlaw would help me out and when my husband would too,50.0
but I really wanted to drive,16.666666666666664
and theres only one lady from Twin Falls that is like two hours away from me to Oregon kin s,33.33333333333333
shes the only lady that will help people that had strokes or brain ndiz,33.33333333333333
so I was on the list for three months,55.55555555555556
so when I was able to go to the class I had to do alotof mmbizu,37.5
and youknow alotof people that have strokes they can only see outof one eye,21.428571428571427
so I hadta make sure I could see just fine,30.0
I had do alotof tests,40.0
there was ke a big board,33.33333333333333
and it would have lights that would come up,55.55555555555556
and I would hafta smack them,50.0
and I had to be really fast,28.57142857142857
and when I was able to pass that then I had to go to drivers ed,37.5
and it was kinda weird,40.0
and then I hafta drive with my left hand,33.33333333333333

and then Im able they put another pedal over on my left foot,42.857142857142854
so I can drive with my left fktu,50.0
so it was kinda weird to figure that out when youve been on your right hand all the time,60.0
so it took me about two months after I was went to the class and everything,50.0
and then I had the doctor make sure that I was okay and I was able to drive,38.88888888888889
and I felt like I was ke sixteen again because I was like,61.53846153846154

and I think her mom passed away,42.857142857142854
and he wanted her to have a mom,37.5
so he married a lady that had two daughters,33.33333333333333
and he got really sick,20.0
and he died later,25.0
and I think they were tinedzu,50.0

and the king had a prince,33.33333333333333
and he wanna,33.33333333333333
so he wanted to have a ball,28.57142857142857
and he invited everyone in the kingdom,57.14285714285714
and when the stkmmu,50.0
shes like,66.66666666666666
and she had a dress that was her moms that she need,58.333333333333336
but the stepmom and her sksstzu,33.33333333333333
so she was never gonna be able to get the dress done,30.76923076923077
so the mice saw that they that skndrlrlu,50.0
so they snuck downstairs and looked at stuff that the stpsistzu,36.36363636363637
and they got a ribbon and some pearls,37.5
and then they went they were able to help with each other,41.66666666666667
and the birds make her dress ready,28.57142857142857
so when they were able to get ready for the ball the us the stepsisters and the stepmom said,42.10526315789473
and she went to her room,50.0
and allthesudden,0.0

and they were like,50.0
so they took it and ripped it,42.857142857142854
and then they went to the ball,42.857142857142854
and Cinderella went outside in the garden,28.57142857142857
and she was crying,50.0
and then her feru,25.0
and she told her what p what happened,50.0
so she made a coach outof a pmpnu,37.5
I think they she had three of the mice be horses the dog be the coachman and then the another coachman was the horse,54.166666666666664
and she was like,75.0
and shes like,50.0
so she made her a beautiful dress,42.857142857142854
and and she had glass shoes and told her that she can do all this but when it is midnight it all goes away,50.0
so she went to the ball,50.0
and she met the prince,40.0
and they dntsu,33.33333333333333
and then all it allofsuhven,40.0

and as she was running away one of her shoes came off of her,57.14285714285714
and and then she was able to get home without the prince knowing that she was looked like she was before her her fairy godmother helped her out,53.57142857142857
so the next day Cinderella was having such a good day,36.36363636363637
and then there was about another announcement that the girl that that that was dancing with the prince had a shoe,57.14285714285714
and whoever it fit that is who he was going to l l was going to marry,52.94117647058824
and the stkmmu,33.33333333333333
and she kinda looked like the girl that was dancing with him,58.333333333333336
so she put her in her room and locked her in her room,53.84615384615385
and she had her key in her pocket,50.0
when the duke came and let everyone in trying up,50.0
and why,50.0

and she put it on,60.0
and she was able to marry the prince,37.5
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
the end,50.0
okay,0.0
so so again I would take my bread and put it in the totstu,42.857142857142854
and then when it was done with the toaster I would put peanut butter on one side,47.05882352941176
and then I was,50.0
and then I would take the jelly and put it on the other side and spread it out,44.44444444444444
and then I would put them together,42.857142857142854
and then I would take a knife and cut it in half,41.66666666666667
and thats what you you would do,62.5
its pretty good,33.33333333333333
I know I struggle when I get overly tired,44.44444444444444
I Im told that people wouldnt know I have trouble unless I,57.14285714285714
my hesitation to them Im told is sounds like Im thoughtful,61.53846153846154
they dont understand it,60.0
my hesitation is because Im struggling,71.42857142857143
yes,0.0
sure,0.0
I went to bed on a Monday night after work,50.0
and just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and,35.714285714285715
about one or two in the morning I hadta go to the,41.66666666666667
and I was struggling to get the covers off,44.44444444444444
I was laying on my left side,57.14285714285714
so I trying to get the covers off with the right,45.45454545454545
and I couldnt believe how heavy the covers were,50.0
and that was my first sign something was wrong,55.55555555555556
I at first I thought because I had the two cats,54.54545454545454
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something,54.54545454545454
but they I youknow the room was dark,50.0
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might,42.857142857142854
and finally they came off,40.0
and then I tried to take some steps,25.0
the bathroom was the next room over,57.14285714285714
and I was finding that I was exhausted,62.5
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed,56.25
I dont know why I didnt think to just get back into bed,40.0
but I just laid on the floor,42.857142857142854
I laid there for about thirty minutes,28.57142857142857
my Garmin told me what was going on the timeline,60.0
and so when I got back up I still didnt feel like I could,53.333333333333336
so I did and just crawled back into bed,22.22222222222222
and then about I was awake asleep back and forth,30.0
and I was trying to figure out,42.857142857142854
somethings wrong with me,50.0
but I dont know if this is major,55.55555555555556
and I was trying to decide,33.33333333333333
its probably something wrong with my brain or my heart,50.0
and I didnt want to go to the emergency room,36.36363636363637
and thered be nothing wrong,33.33333333333333
but I called a guy from work,42.857142857142854
I used my phone,50.0
and I thought I was dialing his work number,44.44444444444444
but I got his cellphone number,33.33333333333333
so I want to leave him a voicemail message,33.33333333333333
and I was surprised to hear him answer,37.5
and thats when he told me,57.14285714285714
so I worked for a very difficult company to work for,36.36363636363637
and I didnt want to tell them yet what was going on,46.15384615384615
so I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh,50.0
but at least they would be notified I wouldnt be in that day,64.28571428571429
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so he just chuckled and said,14.285714285714285
and then I called a friend and told him what was going on,46.15384615384615
and then between two of us we decided,50.0
well my my idea,50.0
so a half hour later I called him,37.5
and I decided Im going to call my neighbor,40.0
take me to the hospital,60.0
so I did,33.33333333333333
and my neighbor next door came and got me,22.22222222222222
and we went to the hospital,50.0
I dont know why or how we went to the hospital that we did,60.0
it was a great one,60.0
weve got four hospitals to choose from,37.5
so I dont know why or remember why we went to that,53.84615384615385
but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago,35.714285714285715
and she was struggling trying to figure out where the,50.0
and at that point I couldnt read,50.0
but I saw the red lettering,33.33333333333333
and I knew that must be emergency,57.14285714285714
and so I pointed to that,50.0
and then then she didnt know what to do with me once,38.46153846153847
again she was someone with a brain injury,62.5
so she was having trouble thinking her way through this,50.0
and so here me I just had a stroke,33.33333333333333
and Im having to do the thinking,37.5
so when we pulled up under the awning there was a,63.63636363636363
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital,40.0
and I caught his eye,40.0
and he came out,50.0
and I told him,50.0
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke,63.63636363636363
and I told him,50.0
at this point I was not having trouble walking,44.44444444444444
but I was afraid I might,66.66666666666666
earlier in the day in wee hours I was having a real,50.0
but now I was okay with it,57.14285714285714
so he said,33.33333333333333
and he got a nurse,40.0
and she came out,50.0
and I told her the same thing,42.857142857142854
and then she went back and got a wheelchair,22.22222222222222
and they got me in,60.0
mhm I had alotof speech therapy,16.666666666666664
I went to two different organizations for therapy because,44.44444444444444
so I wanted more therapy than that,42.857142857142854
and so I went to both,50.0
so for maybe about I dont know six or eight months I got,35.714285714285715
each session is about an hour,50.0
I also did some physical therapy,33.33333333333333
but I didnt stick with it,57.14285714285714
and so I can still feel ke my right leg drag a little bit,35.714285714285715
and I also have trouble writing,16.666666666666664
so I have some occupational therapy I did aswell,33.33333333333333
and it it helped a little bit but not alot,30.0
but the speech therapy,25.0
I found some therapists I just connected with better than,50.0
and the one I spent the most time with I really liked her,46.15384615384615
she was very good and very positive,28.57142857142857
and as she explained it something important to me,66.66666666666666
she said in the beginning she said,57.14285714285714
then after we work together awhile Ill test you again to gauge,25.0
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that,63.63636363636363
so when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was,61.53846153846154
I felt so stupid because I couldnt do them,50.0
but if Id have known earlier that thats what they were doing it,60.0
but youknow they didnt think to tell me that,40.0
but I did games on my phone,42.857142857142854
I went to a local college that had meetings on,50.0
and so the first hour everybodys in the same room,30.0
and then the second hour were split up into groups,40.0
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into,53.84615384615385
so you go into a group with about four or five other people who,35.714285714285715
I bought books grade school books for math and reading,20.0
and I did that on my own,57.14285714285714
and I did puzzle books,40.0
and then I went back to work,28.57142857142857
I went back to work very quickly,28.57142857142857
way before I really was able to do much,33.33333333333333
but I just thought,25.0
so I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke,33.33333333333333
there was something,66.66666666666666
oh I always liked to cook,16.666666666666664
but now I really kicked it up,42.857142857142854
I found about healthy eating,40.0
and Ive always liked junk food,28.57142857142857
and I decide to eat really healthy,14.285714285714285
I felt like that would help me recover,62.5
and so I I got this,50.0
and learning to understand measurements again was difficult at,22.22222222222222
but I learned,33.33333333333333
and I still struggle with it sometimes,42.857142857142854
making conversions is not so easy for me,37.5
but but I see the ingredient list,28.57142857142857
and then youve got ke a paragraph of everythings,50.0
so Ive learned to if its the first two things you do,53.84615384615385
and then maybe the next three things youve gotta do something else,28.57142857142857
then I color those other three with another color,44.44444444444444
that kind of thing,50.0
and so then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods,16.666666666666664
and that was motivating for me,66.66666666666666
and then I also I was working near a mall,50.0
and so at lunch time I would go walk every day,36.36363636363637
well the job that I had that was so stressful,50.0
about two years ago now they laid me off,33.33333333333333
and I was happy about that,66.66666666666666
I hated that place,50.0
I loved the work,50.0
but the people were just insane,33.33333333333333
and bullying people to get things done,0.0
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over,50.0
but I was afraid to look for another job because if the next,53.84615384615385
so I was really afraid to move,28.57142857142857
and theres not many jobs around here for that kind of work,30.76923076923077
so I felt really trapped,20.0
but I was looking,50.0
but it was just youknow there really wasnt alot to pick,33.33333333333333
and well anyway the day three months or so before,20.0
so I started collecting my information that I was gonna need,41.66666666666667
and I put my notes in a notebook,50.0
and I took them out to my car,62.5
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and,50.0
I didnt keep them at my desk,62.5
I took everything outof my office except for things that belonged,54.54545454545454
I saved off programs I had written everything,62.5
and so then when the boss and the hr guy came to my office and,33.33333333333333
I tried not to look so happy about it,33.33333333333333
but I was really happy,40.0
and then I was outof work for ten months,33.33333333333333
and it was okay because I had unemployment,50.0
I had money in savings,40.0
and I was doing alright with that,57.14285714285714
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job,45.45454545454545
and now I work from home fulltime for a company thats in,46.15384615384615
and so my boss thats,33.33333333333333

and I still do the same kind of work I useta do,41.66666666666667

and theres a bird on another branch thats singing,54.54545454545454
the Cinderellas dad met the woman with the two,44.44444444444444
and then the daughters were mistreating Cinderella,28.57142857142857
they are planning to go to the ball,50.0
and they took a necklace off of Cinderella,50.0
Cinderella was locked in a room,50.0
and some mice came and with a key and got her out,33.33333333333333
and then the fairy godmother provided a horse and a driver,27.27272727272727
and Cinderella danced at the ball with the prince,44.44444444444444
and then it was almost midnight,33.33333333333333
and Cinderella hadta leave,0.0
and as she left she was going down the stairs,60.0
and she dropped her slipper,40.0
and then think it was two men came to her house with the,46.15384615384615
and it fit Cinderellas foot,20.0
then they knew it was Cinderella was the one who had danced,58.333333333333336
and then then Cinderella and the prince got,12.5
I would get two pieces of bread,42.857142857142854
and a jar of peanut butter,33.33333333333333
and a jar of,50.0
did you said just peanut butter,33.33333333333333
oh okay,0.0
and a jar of jelly,40.0

and a spoon,33.33333333333333
and a plate,33.33333333333333
and a napkin,33.33333333333333
and then I would take the knife and prdu,33.33333333333333
and then I would take the spoon and spread a jelly on the other,42.857142857142854
and then you would put those pieces of bread together and put,33.33333333333333
pretty good,0.0
yes,0.0
no,0.0
I went to bed on a Monday night,50.0
I worked all day,50.0
and I went to sleep,20.0
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back,33.33333333333333
about one oclock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to,30.76923076923077
and thats typical for me,50.0
and I had trouble getting the covers off,37.5
I was laying on my left side,57.14285714285714
I remember that because I had right side weakness,44.44444444444444
and the blankets just felt really heavy,14.285714285714285
and so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket,33.33333333333333
as it was like they were full of bricks or something,72.72727272727273
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it,53.84615384615385
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the,38.46153846153847
I was exhausted,66.66666666666666
and so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed,53.84615384615385
and I laid there for about a half an hour,50.0
and I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down,50.0
and then I got up and thought,28.57142857142857
but as soon as I stood up I realized,44.44444444444444
so I crawled back in bed,33.33333333333333
and about seven thirty or eight oclock Id decided to,9.090909090909092
I my boss was a creep,66.66666666666666
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible,50.0
and so but this guy was kindof the bosss pet,30.0
and so I thought,25.0
and when I used my cellphone,50.0
I had that guys cellphone number and desk number,22.22222222222222
but I thought sure I selected the desk number because I was,50.0
but I thought,33.33333333333333
well he answered the phone,40.0
and so it hadta be before eight oclock because I was,45.45454545454545
and I said to him,60.0
and he said,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I chose those words carefully,33.33333333333333
I didnt want them to know there was a health issue,41.66666666666667
but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why Im not,46.666666666666664
and I certainly needed to make that call,25.0
and so he took it as humorous,42.857142857142854
and I was fine with that,66.66666666666666
that was kindof why I said it the way I did,63.63636363636363
and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that,50.0
he said,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so he was real relieved to hear that,33.33333333333333
and so I felt bad when he said that,44.44444444444444
I was like,100.0
and anyway so I called either before him or,33.33333333333333
and I never call him,40.0
weve been going together for about six years,44.44444444444444
and I for me to call him is thats a big deal because,57.14285714285714
and but I called him that morning,42.857142857142854
and he picked up,50.0
and I told him I said,50.0
and he I think he suggested I go to the hospital or see a,50.0
or he might even try to help work it through and try to figure,28.57142857142857
finally I said,33.33333333333333
and if I dont then I think I said,40.0
I dont remember what I did,57.14285714285714
but there was some kind of a plan if I didnt he didnt hear,50.0
and so I think before I called him back I decided,45.45454545454545
and I didnt want to freak her out,44.44444444444444
so I didnt wanna say hospital or emergency,22.22222222222222
so I just said,25.0
and so she said,25.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so I called him and told him youknow I was gonna go to,40.0
so later he told me that he almost called an ambulance,45.45454545454545
but he hes the kind of person hes afraid to make a mistake,40.0
Im sure theres some some psychology there to to delve in,38.46153846153847
but but I told him I said,42.857142857142854
maybe initially I might be not happy with you for making that,58.333333333333336
but later I would understand that you did it outof love,45.45454545454545
so its okay,33.33333333333333
so anyway so then my neighbor came over,25.0
and I wasnt dressed yet,33.33333333333333
and so I was in my bedroom getting dressed,44.44444444444444
and I dont remember taking a long time to get dressed or,23.076923076923077
I wasnt experiencing the exhaustion anymore,42.857142857142854
and but I noticed at one point she came around the corner,41.66666666666667
and so then but I finished getting dressed,12.5
and just I kindof planned out some things to do to,36.36363636363637
if I made sure Id let the dog out and let her back in,46.666666666666664
and I grabbed my purse and my phone,37.5
and kinda made a mental note,16.666666666666664
yes Ive got my health insurance card,37.5
Ive got money,50.0
got my drivers license,25.0
Im good to go,20.0
and then we went out the door and or I went out the,46.15384615384615
she said,50.0
because shes just next door,33.33333333333333
but I think she afraid for me to walk,44.44444444444444
so she was in my driveway,66.66666666666666
and Im coming out the door,57.14285714285714
and Ive got a deadbolt and a knob lock,40.0
and I the dog is in,66.66666666666666
and Im trying to lock the door and xxx the knob,33.33333333333333
I could feel it,75.0
and its right,33.33333333333333
but Im sitting here looking with my keys,44.44444444444444
and they werent fitting,40.0
so I was having trouble,40.0
I dont carry alotof keys on my ring,44.44444444444444
but I couldnt figure out which key went into the lock,50.0
so finally I thought,25.0
and we when we went down the road I dont remember who or,57.14285714285714
but I think I went to the best possible one,40.0
and when we got there it was like four of,50.0
we call this hospital row,40.0
so my street is always the first in the city to get paved,46.15384615384615
well maybe the governors and then mine,28.57142857142857
so then she didnt understand where to go exactly,30.0
she I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didnt,38.46153846153847
and I saw the red lettering,33.33333333333333
and I couldnt read it,50.0
that was so significant to me because I remember I could not,66.66666666666666
I knew what the word was,66.66666666666666
but I couldnt say it to to save my life,36.36363636363637
but well I could say it,50.0
I just couldnt read it,50.0
and so I pointed,25.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so I wasnt reading it youknow,37.5
it was like,100.0
and so we got to the entrance,42.857142857142854
and there was ke I wanna say a canopy but not,36.36363636363637
and I caught the eye of a policeman that was sitting or,50.0
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the,53.84615384615385
and I waved at him and motioned for him to come,45.45454545454545
and he did,33.33333333333333
and I told him,50.0
and I dont know when I determined that that was a possibility,61.53846153846154
dont even remember,25.0
but but and I said,20.0
and I was walking fine,40.0
but I just never had a stroke before,37.5
so I didnt know if maybe Im walking fine now,41.66666666666667
and allofasudden I cant youknow,33.33333333333333
I didnt know,50.0
so I was afraid to walk,33.33333333333333
and so he said,25.0
and a nurse came out real fast,28.57142857142857
and she brought out,50.0
she came out first,50.0
and then I told the same thing to her,44.44444444444444
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair,37.5
I think it was just inside the door,62.5
then so she got me in the wheelchair,50.0
and we went in,50.0
and I remember looking at the people in the waiting room,45.45454545454545
it was pretty full,50.0
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of,57.14285714285714
and I almost wanted to say,16.666666666666664
but youknow just not appropriate to really say anything,11.11111111111111
I just felt bad,25.0
and so then the intake person wanted my health insurance,20.0
so I gave her that,60.0
and she asked me,50.0
and I remembered the Metformin,40.0
but I called it Glucophage,40.0
I think Glucophage is I think thats the name brand for it,53.84615384615385
but I couldnt think of Metformin,42.857142857142854
and there were alotof supplements I useta take and,22.22222222222222
but I couldnt remember the name of them for the life of me,64.28571428571429
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if,61.53846153846154
and but I just was just struggling,28.57142857142857
I couldnt remember the name of them,62.5
and I it surprised me that I couldnt remember them,63.63636363636363
and then I got put in a room right away and just waited,30.76923076923077
and that same nurse came back,16.666666666666664
and she asked me,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
but I didnt think a long time had passed,40.0
and so she was alittle irritated with that and went back and,33.33333333333333
and they were back there very quickly,28.57142857142857
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do,50.0
and they had one test where they were gonna need to put me,35.714285714285715
theyre trying to find the origin of the stroke,50.0
I think at this point they know what happened,55.55555555555556
they just cant figure out,50.0
and they never figured it out,50.0
but so they put me to sleep for that,44.44444444444444
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to,61.53846153846154
I dont like to be put under,50.0
I like to know whats going on,50.0
and then theyre gonna put this thing down my throat,41.66666666666667
and I know that there is the possibility,50.0
its so slim,33.33333333333333
but possibility that something could go wrong there,37.5
or would some permanent damage could happen,42.857142857142854
so I I was pretty freaked out about it,66.66666666666666
but I thought I I I gotta submit to this,54.54545454545454
so they did that,50.0
and and when they did either a ct scan or the mri,41.66666666666667
I dont remember which when they,71.42857142857143
Ive had those done before not on the brain though,45.45454545454545
and they told me it was really important that I that,63.63636363636363
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it,38.46153846153847
so Im not gonna flinch,28.57142857142857
and so anyway then then began nine days of in hospital stay,16.666666666666664
okay,0.0
a speech therapist told me either that day or the next,36.36363636363637
and for a moment I thought,50.0
and then she explained what it was,57.14285714285714
I was like,100.0
and so while I was in the hospital she provided alotof,54.54545454545454
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next,38.46153846153847
and it was ke really important to me,62.5
I was just super motivated,40.0
and and then when I was released it was gonna be a month,50.0
and so I contacted her again,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so she sent me alot,33.33333333333333
and she just like in the hospital she was willing to send,41.66666666666667
and I was so thankful for that,57.14285714285714
and so I just worked on it,42.857142857142854
and then and so Im not in the hospital,30.0
so I didnt give it to her to check it now,50.0
I just figured,33.33333333333333
and I got adult coloring books becauseof a high fine,20.0
and I went to a teacher supply store and got some kids,33.33333333333333
thats where I estimated my level was at at the time,66.66666666666666
and so because when I looked at higher grades like,50.0
but third or fourth it was like,42.857142857142854
and so I did that,40.0
and I got puzzle books for kids to do,22.22222222222222
and so I did those,40.0
and I always did like to cook before,37.5
but now I had a special interest in cooking healthy food,27.27272727272727
and I want it to be food that tasted good,40.0
and so I got some healthy recipes,28.57142857142857
and worked on those,50.0
and I was surprised to see that I struggled with,50.0
like a jar of garlic,60.0
half a teaspoon is one clove,50.0
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that,50.0
I was like,100.0
and so I didnt know initially that I could use one teaspoon,38.46153846153847
so I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work,41.66666666666667
and so and I learned to highlight in the cookbook,30.0
everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would,61.53846153846154
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would,57.14285714285714
and and so I did really well with the cooking,30.0
and just as time went on it was no longer a struggle,41.66666666666667
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like,54.54545454545454
I never did figure it out,66.66666666666666
but I was like,75.0
but I went to therapy,40.0
and I went to two different therapists,28.57142857142857
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I,46.15384615384615
and so I thought,25.0
so both therapists would see me twice a week,44.44444444444444
and so and there was two different locations,12.5
and so I I went to them,57.14285714285714
and it was exhausting,50.0
I went back to work at about seven eight seven weeks,27.27272727272727
and it took me eight weeks,33.33333333333333
but I took seven off,40.0
and so youknow I was leaving work to go to therapy,27.27272727272727
or I would go,50.0
no I didnt do it xxx,42.857142857142854
I would did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the,50.0
and my employer bless his heart said,28.57142857142857
and I thought,33.33333333333333
I cant I was exhausted as it was,77.77777777777779
and I was like,75.0
but I just agreed to it,50.0
I know he didnt have time to check up on me,50.0
so I said,33.33333333333333
so so then I just did all this therapy,33.33333333333333
and my there was one therapist,33.33333333333333
well first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was,50.0
and I think Id been seeing her for maybe youknow two weeks to a,53.333333333333336
and when she was there one evening she recognized me,50.0
and she called me by name,50.0
and I just politely acknowledged her,33.33333333333333
but I had no clue who she was,62.5
and now Ive learned that since my stroke theres some,58.333333333333336
now if the person has something very different about them Ill,45.45454545454545
youknow somebodys got a huge nose or a big old wart at the,30.76923076923077
just something that would make me remember them then,55.55555555555556
but just yeah its very easy for me to forget who I just,38.46153846153847
and so I remember her pointing that out at the next,54.54545454545454
she says,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so but anyway she worked with me for maybe two,36.36363636363637
and then she moved,25.0
and then so another person took her place,25.0
and wasnt real crazy about that person,37.5
but and in hindsight she probably didnt do anything,40.0
it was just I was just struggling with my confidence,60.0
and it but then I went to another therapist,44.44444444444444
and that lady was young,40.0
and she was very upbeat and very positive and encouraging,20.0
and so that was helpful to me,57.14285714285714
and so we did alotof focusing on short term memory and,18.181818181818183
I did that with her,80.0
she taught me some card tricks to do that Ive since,50.0
like five and two,0.0
I dont remember what it was,71.42857142857143
but anyway so I was practicing with my cards on my,54.54545454545454
and she didnt give me homework,42.857142857142854
neither one of them did because I worked,50.0
and they felt like,50.0
and I was actually kindof relieved because I was just I,54.54545454545454
the fatigue was just crazy,40.0
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because I,53.84615384615385
and so think I just about covered it,25.0
something important that happened to me,66.66666666666666
my grandbabies,50.0
my daughter and I we struggled alot in her teen years,45.45454545454545
and she met this guy when she was thirteen or,50.0
and youknow when I first met him Im just seeing this skinny,46.15384615384615
and Im thinking,50.0
and well anyway they eventually got married,14.285714285714285
and then but she was determined she didnt want any,45.45454545454545
she was so sure she would screw them up,66.66666666666666
and its just too hard,20.0
and so me and my husband well just youknow well just see,16.666666666666664
and they did,33.33333333333333
they did alotof traveling and everything,33.33333333333333
and and I had a s and I have a son too,33.33333333333333
but he didnt seem to have any interest in getting married or,30.76923076923077
and so I just thought,20.0
so I just worked in the church nursery and and kinda helped,25.0
and then my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida,20.0
and by this time youknow I realized through some,55.55555555555556
and I was always super protective of my kids,44.44444444444444
and I realized he was just as protective of her if not,50.0
and so I thought,25.0
and so then I dont remember how long theyd been,33.33333333333333
maybe a year or so,20.0
and she she came back to town,42.857142857142854
and a relative on his side had a baby,44.44444444444444
and she wanted to hold that baby,28.57142857142857
and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby,40.0
and she just whenever I took a picture of her with that baby,61.53846153846154
and I thought,33.33333333333333
and she told me,50.0
and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing,38.46153846153847
she lost two or three,20.0
and then when she had this one,42.857142857142854
and maybe about six months in Im in Indiana,30.0
and shes in Florida,40.0
and Im nesting,50.0
and then my house is reasonably clean anyway,25.0
but but I cleaned my whole living room once,22.22222222222222
and I just said youknow it it had been a recently,54.54545454545454
and so there wasnt alotof junk in there,11.11111111111111
but I started pulling items out and going through them,40.0
and I cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows,33.33333333333333
and just youknow every crevice I cleaned in that living room,36.36363636363637
and I asked her I said,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
but once I sltu,25.0
I dont remember exactly which room it was,55.55555555555556
it mightve been my bedroom,83.33333333333334
I dont remember,50.0
but anyway then when the baby was here he had some,45.45454545454545
I dont remember what it was,71.42857142857143
but it it was they wanted him to be in the not,66.66666666666666
intensive care,0.0
they wanted him there NICU I guess,42.857142857142854
and so he was there for a few days,44.44444444444444
but my daughter called me,40.0
and she said told me what was going on,55.55555555555556
and I was she said,60.0
but I could tell her voice,50.0
she was scared,66.66666666666666
and I wasnt really worried so much for the baby because what she,50.0
but I was really frightened for her,57.14285714285714
just her mental her emotional being wellbeing,28.57142857142857
and after that phone call I hop on the airplane,50.0
I hadta be with her,60.0
I was compelled to be with her,71.42857142857143
and I show up in that hospital,57.14285714285714
and she was just shocked to see me,37.5
ke I was the last person in the world she expected to see,46.15384615384615
and I remember thinking,25.0
and so anyway I I saw the baby,37.5
and couldnt touch him,40.0
and that was okay,50.0
but I took a couple of pictures of him,55.55555555555556
and then I came back home shortly after that,33.33333333333333
and later I learned that she thought I was coming to see the baby,42.857142857142854
and she was kinda mad because she wanted to decide when she,50.0
and she thought thats why I got on a plane like I did to try,50.0
and I just explained to her that I said,55.55555555555556
and I said,33.33333333333333
but I said,33.33333333333333
and I think she was taken back by that,55.55555555555556
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so anyway but that little guy hes so,20.0
and he as I listen to him and his language,60.0
it was really interesting,50.0
and hes almost four now,16.666666666666664
but when he was about two he he loved dinosaurs,50.0
I think he still kinda likes them,42.857142857142854
but I kinda feel like hes maybe sorta outgrown them,45.45454545454545
and hes onto other things,33.33333333333333
but I was making him videos and because I didnt feel,50.0
but this little guy he doesnt know what normal sounds like,41.66666666666667
and so I made him these goofy little videos with these little,41.66666666666667
and they would get into trouble youknow,42.857142857142854
and I had a box of toys here for him,50.0
and and so I had a dinosaur,28.57142857142857
Id wed call them saursq because thats why he called them,50.0
and I put a no a saur,57.14285714285714
and I put a saur,40.0
and it was just and so I would make sill,40.0
and I would tell him,60.0
and he thought those little stupid little videos,25.0
maybe two minutes long each,20.0
he thought those were hilarious,60.0
and he would watch them over and over and over and over again,23.076923076923077
youknow they just a hundred times youknow,28.57142857142857
and then and then his baby brother came along,22.22222222222222
and I think theres a two years difference,33.33333333333333
yeah two years,0.0
and so the baby hes just cute as he can be,50.0
and so hes right about almost two,25.0
and so much difference between the two and their personalities,30.0
and but the the first one hes super smart,30.0
hes also very manipulative youknow,16.666666666666664
and and so he he works that cuteness angle youknow,30.0
and then the second one he was alot more agreeable,30.0
and he was plenty smart,40.0
but I could tell not to the level his brother is youknow,50.0
its like he didnt get stuff quite as quickly as like,50.0
you you hadta work with him awhile,57.14285714285714
and but but then hed get it,25.0
he was fine,66.66666666666666
I think he just likes to analyze maybe more youknow and just,16.666666666666664
so the second one just super long eyelashes,12.5
so any girl would love to have and just as just as cute as,21.428571428571427
and I went to go see them last Thanksgiving I think it,33.33333333333333
it was last Christmas,50.0
I went to go see them Christmas,28.57142857142857
and I facetime with them alot,50.0
and so the older one hes thrilled to see me,27.27272727272727
and he just runs to me and youknow says granny youknow and wants,23.076923076923077
but the baby eventhough hed seen my face alot on the screen,38.46153846153847
and he ofcourse Id seen him in person too but not real often,21.428571428571427
it took him a minute,60.0
and he had to watch his older brother,25.0
ke I guess its okay to go sit near her,40.0
it was like it seemed like at some point a light,72.72727272727273
and he was like,75.0
so then had both on my lap,42.857142857142854
and they just for about an hour or two I was enjoying,41.66666666666667
it was just it was just so cool,50.0
so I yeah I always heard how much fun grandbabies are,36.36363636363637
but ohmygosh instant celebrity is so much fun,12.5
so thats the probably about the best thing thats ever,33.33333333333333

and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over,38.46153846153847

okay,0.0
theres a little boy,40.0
and mom is strongly advising him to take this umbrella,30.0

and the cat is on a tree and the branch,50.0

and the little girl it looks like she had gotten there,45.45454545454545
and theres a dog at the tree trunk,44.44444444444444

looks like its singing,50.0
and theres a ladder on the ground,50.0
possibly the ladder was used by the man,50.0

and so its probably his ladder that fell,37.5
and so hes just kinda sitting there taking all that in,33.33333333333333
and so with the firemen on the way looks like its gonna,46.15384615384615

and she fantasizes about wearing a dress to this,55.55555555555556
and so she puts it on,50.0
and her stepmother witnesses one of the epdaught,37.5
then Cinderella was talking to her fairy godmother,37.5
and this fairy godmother made a driver and a,33.33333333333333
the mice became horses,25.0
and think the dog mightve been the driver,55.55555555555556
then she gets the palace,40.0
and she dances with the prince,50.0
and the fairy godmother had given her a beautiful dress,40.0
and her hair was done nice,33.33333333333333
and she has a great time Cinderella does at the dance,36.36363636363637
and then she notices its almost midnight,28.57142857142857
and so she explains to the prince that she hasta go,45.45454545454545
and the prince is doesnt really want her to go,36.36363636363637
and so but she leaves,20.0
and in her rush down the steps she drops a glass slipper,50.0
but I should back up,60.0
there was two workers that worked in the palace,44.44444444444444

we saw slide of them talking about something probably this,60.0
and he was so she rushes down the steps and loses her,50.0
and one of those same workers that had planned this event was,50.0
and so she rushes on home not even know where she dropped it,38.46153846153847
and then then one of those the same worker,33.33333333333333
and then so he takes it to Cinderellas house,33.33333333333333
and the evil stepmother,25.0
oh back at back at the dance the stepmother and the,36.36363636363637
but she was forbidden to even go to this dance,40.0
so now shes there dancing with the prince of all things,41.66666666666667
and the anyway the the one worker that xxx had,40.0
that way theyll know who it is exactly that the prince had,61.53846153846154
and the evil stepmother she knew about the slipper who it,54.54545454545454
so she was hoping that since it was glass it would she,75.0
so she tried to trip the guy who was carrying it carefully on a,50.0
and but apparently he didnt he was able to keep,36.36363636363637
and it fits perfectly,25.0
and so then next scene is shes at the palace with,41.66666666666667

thats the last last I remember thing from last thing I remember for probably I dont know twenty twenty minutes or so,33.33333333333333
eighty four,0.0
okay,0.0
it was very that was really troubling because really troubling because didnt know where I was,58.82352941176471
and there were visitors in the hospital room in in my hospital room,38.46153846153847
and these guys were saying the the the visit,55.55555555555556
I I knew who they were knew knew these these people,63.63636363636363
but theres alots lotsof them there,28.57142857142857
I didnt know where I was,71.42857142857143
there were lotsof there were several people visiting me,33.33333333333333
and and there several of them asked,28.57142857142857
I thought was perfectly fine,40.0
and but what I didnt know was that the Id spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat in a in a coma,50.0
and and it looked like I wasnt gonna come out anytime soon,35.714285714285715
they gave me a tracheotomy,60.0
and I and so the the what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords changed my voice pretty radically where where my wife had had told me,50.0
she said she said that the said that you you you had the,69.23076923076923
so I said,33.33333333333333
so but that was that was extraordinarily troubling because I I like I said didnt know where I was,60.0
my and people I c recognize its recognize saying,44.44444444444444
and it was a really really troubling to me,55.55555555555556
really troubling,0.0
that was that was one of the first of my m first of my memories,66.66666666666666
well its what what it ended up being was that the the,83.33333333333334
in terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling,44.44444444444444
and youknow just when when when I happen to get get focus on something I didnt r particularly understand or or or approve of I get get or it it didnt show up,42.857142857142854
but it was xxx extraordinarily angry,33.33333333333333
and did never did lash did never did lash out,40.0
but just but real really angry,0.0
and and I kept it all internal,42.857142857142854
it was very very very troubling really troubling for a n for for quite a while,50.0
and and and and I dont want you to ever to relate to that,33.33333333333333
I wouldnt I wouldnt wish that in I wouldnt wouldnt wish that on anybody,66.66666666666666
the almost nine nineteen ninety was almost a what,44.44444444444444
again,0.0
thats always say,25.0
it was like just just a just a just a rerun but not near not nearly as severe,27.77777777777778
but the the eighty four incident was was was most interesting because because an engineer for my the company that I was employed by,62.5
I was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning I had a wonderful career ahead of me,47.61904761904761
was gonna go far in the organization,37.5
and and and my one of my supervisors told me,40.0
and he wasnt supposed to do this,37.5
told me told me I was I was on the highpotnn list which meant again in my I was going far,61.904761904761905
my career was laid out in front of me,66.66666666666666
there was there was nothing stopping me,57.14285714285714
and then after the eighty four incident a personality change which I find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn,35.0
which I find out twenty years later is endemic,44.44444444444444
and the and and I sound different,28.57142857142857
I was slower to comprehend things,33.33333333333333
but finally did after bit taking taking more time would comprehend things,25.0
and and and and I couldnt do my engineering job to to to suit me,31.25
and I didnt didnt tell anybody that,55.55555555555556
I didnt tell anybody that,66.66666666666666
tried I faked it,50.0
I faked it and spent my lunch hours for months I was by myself in a in a conference room relearning aspects of my job and not telling a not telling a soul because I just knew,48.64864864864865
this was before before eighty eight,50.0
nineteen eight nineteen eighty four again,0.0
actually before the American of Disabilities Act,42.857142857142854
eighty eight,0.0
and and I was on on the accident in eighty four,45.45454545454545
I was on company business,60.0
and I knew I I just knew that that mtu,50.0
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired,40.0
I knew I was,75.0
had three kids a wife and spouse just a lovely lovely lovely lovely woman there at home with the three kids,23.809523809523807
and I was the I was I was the income,80.0
and I couldnt I couldnt stand the thought of being fired,53.84615384615385
and and so like I say like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job,38.88888888888889
and it took me but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that that I was no longer on on the fast track,46.42857142857143
no no no longer,0.0
it took I wasnt it wasnt obvious at first,54.54545454545454
but I I was no longer on the fast track,50.0
and and and the biggest most difficult part of that was the was the short term memory just short term memory difficulties,31.818181818181817
and so I ended up with a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my help my short term memory,36.0
so it was it was largely the the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work,47.05882352941176
and ofcourse Im ofcourse I look on back look back look back on it a few years after that,40.0
and and I did not deserve a to be on the fast track,46.15384615384615
I it it it it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me,83.33333333333334
but it wasnt obvious to me,57.14285714285714
and that the writing everything down was was the biggest biggest assistant sis assistant assistance to me that helped helped me do my job,54.166666666666664
the basically it was being the the the,87.5
I I I call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident,30.76923076923077
thats thats how my my my life has been defined,66.66666666666666
and I its I just it that that that is that is what I call my my my defining moment the the the the defining event,73.07692307692307
because Ive struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then,46.666666666666664
and and and and Imean ke for example the the the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was outof engineering school at Purdue,33.33333333333333
had a job in Indianapolis,40.0
and so the as economic viability I I I paid rent to my folks lived in the lived in their house,52.38095238095239
and that winter my dad and I put the put an Oldmobile vl eight in a Chevrolet Vega a little small car,36.36363636363637
and it was quite an interesting interesting project,50.0
and and interestingly enough I can probably,28.57142857142857
the the the engine had a Rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties,47.05882352941176
and I could probably still today,33.33333333333333
now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven,25.0
I could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded,33.33333333333333
and but but but I ob but I could ask me what I had for supper last night,38.88888888888889
cant tell ya,50.0
so yup,0.0
short short term memory issues,0.0
but but then things from from from long ago and do do do do m something long ago I I can I can reconstruct like it was yesterday,53.57142857142857
no actually I was I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering,41.66666666666667
and and I got outof school the spring of seventy six,27.27272727272727
had a job at a company named Shwitzer,37.5
theyre in Indianapolis,50.0
and Shwitzer no Shwitzer no longer exists,14.285714285714285
but I was in engine cooling engineering at at s with Shwitzer,50.0
and so so I my my customers were well well call it for engine cooling fans for Shwitzer were Ford light truck Ford heavy truck,32.0
the Ford one of the small Ford Pats cars had a Cadillac excuseme Pontiac,28.57142857142857
and the Chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers,41.66666666666667
so I was already doing that kind of stuff as my as as a job,60.0
but then my my father found this this article on engine conversion on the Chevrolet Vega,43.75
and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and I to to to build together that winter while while while I was working the automotive industrys field,46.875
and and it it xxx its kinda how I p kinda how I gravitated,50.0
well it was it was real it was a real sleeper,63.63636363636363
meaning that the the hot car at the time was the the Datsun two forty zl,50.0
it was a real it was the first of the Datsun zl cars,61.53846153846154
and and I useta from a stoplight dust those guys off,45.45454545454545
and they couldnt they and those the the other guys the drivers of Datsuns zl cars couldnt figure out how in the hell this Vega beat the shit outof them,53.125
it was it was it was it was it was alotof fun seeing looks in their faces as it in my rearview mirror,69.56521739130434
okay,0.0

and and and it looks like all is well,44.44444444444444
well the beginning it looks like a cat a pet cat had climbed up a tree,50.0
and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree,45.45454545454545
got stuck up in the tree,66.66666666666666
a little girl who was probably her owner rode over there on her tricycle and and wants her cat down,35.0
and looks like an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is and is and is and is caught up there by this barking dog,37.142857142857146
also and now then theres also a a a bird on the other side of this tree singing away,45.0
and theres also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the the cat and the and the and the and the male the the male figure,41.66666666666667

Cinderella was her mother passed away,50.0
father remarried,0.0
and the ck theres the the wicked stepmother had brought with her two two rather mean spirited daughters,36.84210526315789
and they and and in their in their home life the Cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which I always say by the by the stepdaughters,51.724137931034484
and and so just just worked worked very worked alot,0.0
and then in the kingdom the king had a had a a a unmarried son,46.666666666666664
and one of zdvzu,25.0
and the and so Cinderella with the help of of the mice and there in the in the in the in the house they sewed up a a really lovely gown for Cinderella to go to to wear to this to wear to this dance wear wear to this ball,52.0
and and the the stepmother was intent on getting one of her her her her daughters married off and and then so would not allow Cinderella to go to the ball,41.935483870967744
her stepsisters went,33.33333333333333
and the and a a carriage which looked like a a pumpkin and then mice who ended up turned into horses,47.61904761904761
and I think that the the horse from the house ended up as the as the the driver of the of the of the pumpkin carriage,65.38461538461539
and she she she ended up going to the ball,60.0
also the the the prince danced the night away with Cinderella,45.45454545454545
and but the stipulation h from the Cinderellas lla ir fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight,45.45454545454545
so it was late,50.0
so she hurried outof there and left a glass slipper behind,27.27272727272727
and then and then after the and the after the the ball was over the the the the prince said there was only only one person interested in,50.0
it was the the gal that left the left the glass slipper behind,61.53846153846154
and and so the the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that that lady who left the glass slipper behind,48.148148148148145
and and it was the it was the one it was the it was the it was the the lady whose whose foot would fit this this small the small glass slipper,68.75
and the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper,41.66666666666667
Cinderellas foot would fit in the slipper,42.857142857142854
and so she was identified as the one that the that the prince wanted to wanted to wanted to marry,40.0
and and so the so then the the the Cinderella married the prince,38.46153846153847
and they all lived happily and they lived happily ever after,36.36363636363637
oh prefer preferably on on a wheat bread,25.0
you would use a knife and and get the spread the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread,42.857142857142854
aha but then the on the other other side of the other other other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly,33.33333333333333
and then so you take a spoon,28.57142857142857
not not knife because you you cut up you cut up the the the the jelly and the and the jar,57.14285714285714
but but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread,42.857142857142854
use that use the knife to spread out spread it out,45.45454545454545
then then put the two halves together,14.285714285714285
and you got the ultimate the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich,25.0
speech is adequate,33.33333333333333
much improved,0.0
the the halting of halting of of speech,62.5
the what what happens is that the if I,88.88888888888889
for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics,42.857142857142854
it helps immensely if I think about it for about a about,58.333333333333336
le unless Ive seen it before the the the,80.0
and it it is well Ill,50.0
I I I before before my eighty four accident I,60.0
but its much more difficult and and takes longer,11.11111111111111
and thats its like I say,57.14285714285714
been that way for thirty six years,42.857142857142854
the first one was a where I was tl boned at an,66.66666666666666
and ended up being a,60.0
I I caught the the old International Harvester,50.0
and had a shattered pelvis broken hip five broken ribs,10.0
did I did I say punctured lung,57.14285714285714
seventeen units of blood,25.0
three and a half weeks in a coma,37.5
and and I in a coma for three and a half,45.45454545454545
hospital probably probably about two and a half months,11.11111111111111
and our third child was born three days after I was moved,41.66666666666667
and the second one was February of nineteen ninety where,40.0
there was a shared,50.0
and and what I believe that I was,62.5
well I I guess I dont know how long,50.0
but I recall walking across the street starting across,44.44444444444444
and then I had the n the sensation being spun around,45.45454545454545
and then and then later like I say I I,30.0
I dont know,50.0
twenty minutes later,0.0
and and I I was I was in a great mood,63.63636363636363
I was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last,53.84615384615385
and and this one is February nineteen,28.57142857142857
and I was I was I was I was in a really great,76.92307692307693
and then I say a a brain injury because I,50.0
and I had that was that was that,75.0
it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down,36.36363636363637
finally went away,0.0
but I dont I recall maybe three four five days,18.181818181818183
something something like that,100.0
but it lasted a significant amount of time,37.5
and and the the doctors could not tell me whether the,54.54545454545454
it was extraordinary painful,50.0
and and I recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a,45.45454545454545
oh after after three or four months when when,44.44444444444444
oh okay,0.0
yeah wasnt just me being a big baby then right,36.36363636363637
and he he he chuckled,60.0
that thats kindof it it,83.33333333333334
those are the two accidents in in a in a at,72.72727272727273
West Tenth going into West Tenth and,14.285714285714285
okay,0.0
the after the first the eighty four incident,50.0
what had happened was that the eighty four laptops,55.55555555555556
and and my my boss at that time,50.0
Ill call it,33.33333333333333
I wont say leisure work play with,37.5
but but learn how to use there there at home,20.0
and ofcourse this is before the this is before the web,72.72727272727273
but I had been doing a a Nastran which is Nasa structural,58.333333333333336
and but that was all that was all on IBM,70.0
and and so here is just a a simple little,30.0
oughta be able to know how to use that,33.33333333333333
and and so they brought this my boss brought,33.33333333333333
and and in those years there was a a user manual that came,46.15384615384615
and so tried to use a a computer an a,40.0
if youve ever read if youve ever read a Microsoft,58.333333333333336
and one of one of the one one thing in,40.0
selectq,0.0
well had we never had any training in in a in,54.54545454545454
and and after several days of trying to figure out what,36.36363636363637
theres one feu,25.0
select meat,0.0
an aphasia,50.0
selectq meant what what they meant by,57.14285714285714
I just could not,50.0
there was no way,50.0
Im extraordinary troubled really troubled by that,37.5
and so so finally I called a coworker and said,20.0
and it described the tapping the cursor and moving the,40.0
thats what they meant by selectq,57.14285714285714
well hell that was never described in the manual at all,36.36363636363637
and that that that really that threw me for a loop,63.63636363636363
and so I became became very questioning as to whether,40.0
and and so so finally the the like I say the,36.36363636363637
the most most basic of terms which the the,55.55555555555556
or my no no this is DOS not Microsoft,33.33333333333333
this is before Microsoft existed,60.0
this DOS manual it did not did not comprehend,44.44444444444444
but they did not,25.0
DOS manual did not describe that anywhere,28.57142857142857
and so so the and so I went back to work and,25.0
and and finally my my after a couple years,44.44444444444444
and so wow that was that was a godsend,55.55555555555556
Imean just being able to to write write things down,20.0
so I I carry a small,50.0
dont have with me right now,42.857142857142854
but I still I carry a small ke a small notecard,36.36363636363637
because that that was that was writing when,87.5
holymackerel that was that that was a,85.71428571428571
a that that in particular,80.0
and and also I ended up as a later as a,54.54545454545454
I developed tricks where I when I meet somebody new,60.0
use their name in any kindof verbal verbal conversation with,40.0
use name use their name every time first or last name or,16.666666666666664
and and then after the after the after the,66.66666666666666
and and and that that has been a,62.5
for example I met a in our neighborhood met a,60.0
Im at Im at Im at home now,54.54545454545454
not down the farm,50.0
but met a fellow in in the in the neighborhood,60.0
and I got his name,40.0
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told,13.333333333333334
and this morning I was I saw him out for a walk and,61.53846153846154
and then ne finally the name came to xxx,22.22222222222222
so but but the the discipline on on recalling,44.44444444444444
yes yes,0.0
the I think I mentioned to you last week,55.55555555555556
y y possibly I didnt,16.666666666666664
but the time Id spent some time as a at the rehab,53.84615384615385
and because I I started oh,50.0
and it became rather troubling to me because having they just,45.45454545454545
so there was no therapy,40.0
you just youre able to survive,28.57142857142857
just a the thing youre able to just could just check,33.33333333333333
and because they just did not do therapy in those,50.0
and and over the course the next twenty years wife and I,33.33333333333333
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five,33.33333333333333
thats what theyre telling people even fifteen years ago,36.36363636363637
and so I wanted to to wanted to share that with,27.27272727272727
but it is takes a long time,42.857142857142854
and in oh,33.33333333333333
hey you dont stop recovering,33.33333333333333
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly,53.84615384615385
but you never never stop recovering,16.666666666666664
I had a in the eight the eighty eighty four,50.0
and it was just something that I accepted,62.5
and it was I could function without it,75.0
no no big deal,25.0
but to stick a pin there and I dont wouldnt,33.33333333333333
no no big deal,25.0
and then it was probably five years ago or twenty twenty,18.181818181818183
I think it was yeah,60.0
I think it was oh,60.0
twenty five years after the eighty four incident I was in the,50.0
and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five,42.857142857142854
so what Im what Im telling you actually is that the,69.23076923076923
but but still you never stop recovering,14.285714285714285
you just dont stop recovering,33.33333333333333
you dont,33.33333333333333
yes its not not rocket science,16.666666666666664
it it time time is time is the best,55.55555555555556
because you you the feeling that the feeling that,77.77777777777779
and and youll notice one day itll itll,54.54545454545454
it actually it will happen,60.0
you will experience it,75.0
actually actually no,0.0
it was it was it just Imean I was used to,63.63636363636363
but but I I dont I dont know if I got used to,46.666666666666664
but but like I say twenty five years later I just put on,23.076923076923077
and had had had none before,50.0
I I dont know when it happened,62.5
have have no idea,50.0
they will it will they will,100.0
the nerves will work again,40.0
they they will actually,75.0
they will,100.0
when when I when I when I I first,88.88888888888889
when when she and when I she and I first met,63.63636363636363
we went to we went to different highschools together,44.44444444444444
her from in near Washington Indiana in Washington,62.5
and myself from Plainfield,50.0
and it was before classes started at Purdue,50.0
August of nineteen seventy two,20.0
it was her first day on campus,57.14285714285714
my first day on campus,40.0
there was to be a a dance at the the dorm I,66.66666666666666
again again each is our first first day on campus,40.0
and and and and so I was a little bit,30.0
which I I will arrive but place a little bit early given,41.66666666666667
and so I ended up being just a little bit early for the,46.15384615384615
and and my wife and and her her her,44.44444444444444
guy girl girls girls go with with body guards,22.22222222222222
I get that,66.66666666666666
I think its a,75.0
her and her her and her wife and her and,50.0
and and FirstnameSs wife has never met a,25.0
the shes the a a true extrovert,62.5
matter of fact if you look up in Webster extrovert and it said,46.15384615384615
but anyway so so she and a girlfriend that,33.33333333333333
and and wellco I answered,20.0
and and then we I just I hung around,44.44444444444444
I I I hung around her that that that that,90.0
and thats where we started dating,42.857142857142854
and and oh its we we dated probably three,33.33333333333333
dated around about three years or so,14.285714285714285
and after about four years I figured out that wellco maybe,36.36363636363637
and I oughta get more serious about this,37.5
so it was just like I I accused her of of,72.72727272727273
thats where where we first met is she picked me up at a,71.42857142857143
a young a young boy its look like a a grade,54.54545454545454
is kicking it,66.66666666666666
and he he it ends up going through a house window,54.54545454545454
a gentleman on a couch there in the window sitting,50.0
and then he he he gets the ball stands by the broken,50.0
in the beginning this this mother it appears is had,60.0
and he he says,50.0
he says no and says,20.0
and then then leaves,0.0
and then in the middle it starts raining on him,50.0
and then rains heavier on him,33.33333333333333
and then and then he goes back home just,11.11111111111111
and then the last the end of the story was he learned his,53.84615384615385
the way this started was that the it looks like that,72.72727272727273
that the dog is barking at a dog is barking at this guy,61.53846153846154
and on the on the on a tree limb theres a cat,61.53846153846154
and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree,54.54545454545454
the a little girls cat climbed up the tree and got stuck,41.66666666666667
they they they a male a man,71.42857142857143
theres also a a firetruck and a fire engine,40.0
but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder,37.5
and it looks like the d the the ladder is being used by,61.53846153846154
and and the and a songbird is over on a a,54.54545454545454
okay done,0.0
Cinderella was a a daughter of a a subject of,70.0
she her mother had passed her mother passed away,55.55555555555556
and her father remarried,25.0
and the stepmother had two two daughters who,25.0
and as they after they were married the,75.0
and so so Cinderella spent her time working cleaning,11.11111111111111
and and in that in the kingdom there was,55.55555555555556
an advisor to the king suggested a a a ball be held,58.333333333333336
so the word was put out about the ball coming up,54.54545454545454
Cinderella was real happy about the about the ball,55.55555555555556
and so the the the the farm animals,50.0
and and then at the last minute the stepmother,33.33333333333333
and and the and then also the the the,44.44444444444444
and so so the stepdaughters went to the ball,33.33333333333333
and but in the meantime while before before,50.0
and so it it made for her a just a a lovely gown,53.84615384615385
and they then turned a a pumpkin into a coach pulled,45.45454545454545
and so and so she ended up going to the ball,36.36363636363637
and the prince was acquainted with the,57.14285714285714
ended up spending the night dancing with Cinderella,37.5

and and then after the ball the the prince,44.44444444444444
but nobody could nobody knew who Cinderella was and could,60.0
and so he he put his advisor out to the task of of,61.53846153846154
and came to Cinderellas house,20.0
the the slipper did not fit the the stepsisters,55.55555555555556
and then but but turned out it did it did,40.0
and so so they end up being that that,55.55555555555556

I can be confused a couple of times,62.5
sometimes I get the wrong words,33.33333333333333
it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say,64.28571428571429
sometimes its like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that Im trying to say,38.095238095238095
I do have problems on sometimes on the relationship between words,54.54545454545454
ke I know that Im wanna talk about a female relative,41.66666666666667
and I might say the wrong one,42.857142857142854
ke I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother,42.857142857142854
stuff like that,66.66666666666666
but I do have problems with numbers too,37.5
I know if Im talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number even how many times she hasta repell,43.58974358974359
so and just like that I I said repealq insteadof repeatq,36.36363636363637
that thats some of the things that I have problems with,66.66666666666666
but otherthan that Imean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow slowly I usually can get through it,45.83333333333333
I dont know about it actually,57.14285714285714
I was sposta be having a physical therapy at home,50.0
and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kindof crazy she said,46.666666666666664
I wasnt making sense,40.0
and later that morning the physical therapist came,25.0
and he had all all the he had all the equipment,63.63636363636363
and he took my he took my vitals,50.0
and he said that I should go to the emergency room,54.54545454545454
and thats thats that I remember,50.0
I didnt remember,50.0
so my brother and my wife took me to the emergency room,41.66666666666667
and luckily at the hospital that I went to has a good stroke thing,35.714285714285715
so they took me right in there,28.57142857142857
they took a even in the emergency room they had a ck,50.0
so so thats about what I remember,50.0
well when I when they took me back to the hospital room there I saw like five different doctors,42.10526315789473
and they all did the same type of stuff,44.44444444444444
so I could probably youknow do the the what a doctor would see to check about a about a stroke,55.00000000000001
but I remember I had some memory loss,37.5
ke by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit,38.46153846153847
and although Ive know my brothers wife for youknow thirty five forty years I could not remember her name,40.0
ke one I said,25.0
youknow stuff like that,50.0
but it by the time I was discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the knowing that I did have some ha,53.84615384615385
I didnt know at the time that it was aphasia,63.63636363636363
but I I knew the symptoms that I o o o protest,41.66666666666667
but that thats all I remember,57.14285714285714
well with the I didnt have any physical problems with the streak,53.84615384615385
so when I did get well at the hospital they brought a speech therapist,50.0
they didnt know how long I would be at the hospital,66.66666666666666
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged,60.0
so I had hoped I I knew I had problem speeching p,41.66666666666667
so I had asked if I could forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well,56.25
I I was walking and all that,71.42857142857143
but they said that,50.0
so I I had home speech therapy,28.57142857142857
it was very good,50.0
I I the the therapist was very good,62.5
and she was actually the one that,57.14285714285714
after they let me have I think its a Medicare type thing that you can use ten sessions,50.0
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the speech clinic at Buffalo State in New York,59.09090909090909
and alotof that was to get my memory back,33.33333333333333
alotof the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories,33.33333333333333
its hard to explain how it took,42.857142857142854
I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist,53.84615384615385
and after a couple of sessions with the neurologist he said youknow theres pretty much nothing else that he can do about it,54.166666666666664
but if I had any other problems youknow they could call me,50.0
one of the things they did they did probably one of those cognitive test,42.857142857142854
I I did them,75.0
and I did okay I guess,33.33333333333333
probably sound like the stuff that they they said that President Trump aced youknow,42.857142857142854
I had some problems with it,66.66666666666666
but I had brain damage,20.0
so I guess I had a reason,42.857142857142854
but thats about it,60.0
well probably one of the the the nicest things that I have recently was my daughter on this this Mothers Day she stopped over with the card for my wife,60.0
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant,43.75
so on father,33.33333333333333
and then on Fathers Day we went over to her house with my oh son inlaws parents,41.17647058823529
and they did a review,40.0
so they had a car,40.0
and we saw that were going to have a grandson,40.0
so that that is probably one of the youknow that period between there has been exciting for us,72.22222222222221
okay,0.0
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the window,41.66666666666667

it looks like the mother was taking the son to school,54.54545454545454
and he wanted to take or she wanted him to take an umbrella,30.76923076923077
but he did not do that,50.0
he started to walk back to school,28.57142857142857
and the rain started to come,16.666666666666664
so he ran back,25.0
and the mother was alittle angry because he had not pulled it or he had not put the umbrella with him,52.38095238095239
so he went back put the umbrella on and walked back to school,30.76923076923077
okay,0.0
well it looks like the cat was stuck in the tree,54.54545454545454
and the man had tried to get to,25.0
but he was not able to do that,37.5
so the firemen came to to help him,25.0
I dont know if theyre there to get the cat or the or get the man,38.88888888888889
and the cat,33.33333333333333
okay the story starts when a woman,42.857142857142854
so rren Cinderella goes to the ep the man or the bad stepmother,30.76923076923077
and the two children the the the stepmothers daughters were bad,45.45454545454545
well they arent bad,40.0
but they make Cinderella do all of the work around the house,50.0
and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her,46.15384615384615
and apparently they can talk with her,57.14285714285714
and then at after awhile after several years it looks like after the Cinderella got alittle older there was a a invitation to go to the ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for Cinderella,42.857142857142854
but then Cinderellas godfather,0.0
and a she turns the animals into people that work for the stage not the stage the coach,50.0
so they go to the ball where Cinderella meets the prince,45.45454545454545
but becauseof the the godmother only could do the spell until midnight everything turned back to normal where her gown was gone,50.0
and the coach were m,40.0
and the animals were back,40.0
but then there was a man that worked for the princess,45.45454545454545
at the end they they put the glass ip slipper on Cinderitta,50.0
and it fit r perfectly,20.0
and they found that that was the woman that the prince was looking for,64.28571428571429
and they went happy they went happy to the to the end,50.0
and thats about it,60.0
oh okay,0.0
I would open up the bag of the bread,66.66666666666666
put a piece of of slice of bread,50.0
I would push,66.66666666666666
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around,36.36363636363637
and then put the second top of the slice of bread,36.36363636363637
and I guess thats it,50.0
its pretty good,33.33333333333333
I have problems sometimes especially with numbers still,25.0
and sometimes I dont know if its because I dont hear the the the what Im saying correctly,61.904761904761905
its something like if I was to say,75.0
I might say my incomeq taxedq or my incomeq xa or Texas,33.33333333333333
youknow stuff like that where I I kinda think twice of what the the real or the the word that I was trying to say,56.00000000000001
something like that,100.0
but other than that Im thinking I can talk pretty good as long as people give me time and slow down youknow because normally people speak faster than I can,41.935483870967744
so usually if Im in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I I have some kind of problem speaking,44.0
so they understand,33.33333333333333
so it it its pretty good,50.0
Imean ke I Ive gone to a bunch of doctors,54.54545454545454
and youknow they might repeat something for me or youknow ask what I had really said stuff like that youknow if I say it wrong,52.0
but otherthan that Im feeling okay speaking,37.5
oh I I I dont really too much about it,45.45454545454545
I knew that I had been having physical therapy because Id had had a hip replacement the other hip replacement,47.61904761904761
so that morning my wife ders or she said that she understood or she knew that I was having some kind of problems speaking,45.83333333333333
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that,58.333333333333336
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular session,46.666666666666664
and he also noticed that I was speaking differently,44.44444444444444
and he took my vitals and stuff like that,44.44444444444444
and he said that I should go to the emergency room,54.54545454545454
and after that were only maybe three miles from the hospital,45.45454545454545
so my brother came over and took my wife and him over there,30.76923076923077
and they sat there while I went through the emergency room and stuff like that,46.666666666666664
so it it took about maybe three or four hours to have youknow go through,20.0
they did some task,50.0
and I think they have a good stroke thing,33.33333333333333
so they actually in the emergency room they had a ct scan were I could do,50.0
and then they they found where I had a room,50.0
youknow and they they had found that I had had the stroke through the ct ct scan,58.82352941176471
and then by the time I I went up to the room probably three or four other doctors came from youknow the the hospital doctor neurologist,38.46153846153847
they actually had a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to stop the blood or anything,35.294117647058826
but it looks like after it it the clot burst I was okay,61.53846153846154
and there was no xxx more bleeding,28.57142857142857
so that thats about what I remember,75.0
and I I know when I saw the doctors at the room they all had the they have the same type of test that they do to see if it was really a stroke and what kind of damage it mightve been,58.139534883720934
and I knew that I had some memory loss,44.44444444444444
I recognized my brother and my wife,42.857142857142854
but my brothers wife came later because she was a nurse,45.45454545454545
and eventhough I know her for thirty five forty years I couldnt remember her name,37.5
so I I did have some small or what do you call it short memory loss,50.0
but that thats about it,66.66666666666666
well at the hospital I I stayed there for three days,45.45454545454545
and they did alot tests,20.0
they did mris echocardiograms to make sure youknow I didnt have it,30.76923076923077
they did things measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything,35.294117647058826
they did ke the last day that I was there they brought a speech therapist there because they didnt know how long I would be at the hospital,58.620689655172406
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my my speech xxx affected,42.10526315789473
and it turned out that youknow the next day they s distarged,50.0
and I never saw her again,33.33333333333333
and becauseof my my medical insurance when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before they could start my speech therapy,48.148148148148145
so I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house,41.37931034482759
and that that was about it,83.33333333333334
Im trying to think,40.0
I I know last session I think I talked about my daughter being pregnant nowadays,46.666666666666664
but if I was to think younger maybe a good time a thing that I liked was in my when I was twenty I was in the airforce,60.71428571428571
and I was stationed in Italy in the Alps,55.55555555555556
it was a radio station on top of a a mountain actually,58.333333333333336
so having never learned how to play or how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn how to play or how to ski because our our sight was on the top of the mountain,42.10526315789473
and they had a ski slopes there,28.57142857142857
so I had a good time in Germany,37.5
and the guy was a very old German guy that gave several of us skiing lesson,37.5
and after that because our our location where I would work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didnt xxx,46.875
so I got to be pretty good at ski playing ski,27.27272727272727
I keep on saying playq playingq skiq,28.57142857142857
skiing is skiing,33.33333333333333
its not playing ski,25.0
and that that was a good time,57.14285714285714
yeah,0.0
yeah Imean it it it was a very small village where we lived when we were at when we were off the sight,69.56521739130434
so there was alotof places to ski,14.285714285714285
and it was only like forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg,30.76923076923077
so we wed ski in alot a places around the Alps,50.0

and after that two firemen came to bring him a t a ladder to probably take both the father and the cat outof the tree,32.0
no I I think I I have them as as good as Ill be able to remember,47.05882352941176

but after several years it turns out that Cinderella has has made hasta do all of the work to take care of the the the family there,51.85185185185185
after awhile Cinderella starts to be friends with little critters,30.0
after awhile there comes an announcement that theres gonna be a ball at the princes princes castle,52.63157894736842
all the women the stepmother and the stepsisters were all dressed up for the ball,53.333333333333336
but Cinderella was not invited,20.0

and she saw a godfather,40.0
and she had she made up a beautiful gown for Cinderella,45.45454545454545

and none of the other woman at the house would fit with the the slipper until they found Cindereed,52.63157894736842

most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well,50.0
but it seems like when I get in a situation where Im in a hurry is more when my speech or my I lose some of the the words that I want,63.63636363636363
and I found that the going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know Im hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it,49.152542372881356
so thats what I do for youknow my help,60.0
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache,50.0
I normally in the morning go out get the paper have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work,40.0
and I went out and got the paper,37.5
I still had a splitting headache,33.33333333333333
I took a couple of aspirin came in and had a bowl of cereal for breakfast,43.75
and while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper,50.0
and I opened it up,60.0
and I could not read what was on the newspaper,60.0
I couldnt see a whole paragraph,42.857142857142854
and blocks of characters were missing altogether,28.57142857142857
so thats the first thing,33.33333333333333
so I just I set the paper aside and said,30.0
and got dressed and went to work,0.0
I droving,50.0
and what I was seeing on the highway again on the dashboard of the car I couldnt see all of the f s instrumentation on the dash,57.14285714285714
but I was able to drive fine and go to work,18.181818181818183
no problem at all there,20.0
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office,46.666666666666664
and I couldnt remember my login,42.857142857142854
didnt know how to log in,42.857142857142854
and I still had the headache,33.33333333333333
I talked to my boss and and told her what was going on,53.84615384615385
she said,50.0
remember I took probably a half hour forty five minutes and still couldnt,21.428571428571427
so I said,33.33333333333333
I came home took acouple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day,27.77777777777778
that was on a Thursday,80.0
on Friday morning I got up,50.0
and I exercise on Friday Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning,38.88888888888889
so I went to exercise class,16.666666666666664
and I exercised,33.33333333333333
but when I was with the group I was talking,70.0
and what I was saying wasnt making sense to me,54.54545454545454
wasnt making sense to any of my friends,55.55555555555556
youknow they the words were correct,50.0
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words,50.0
they didnt fit whiff,40.0
and so I said,25.0
so I came back home and had breakfast when I got back from exercise,28.57142857142857
and then I normally would go to work,25.0
but I couldnt go to work,28.57142857142857
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to see my doctor,30.76923076923077
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a ar heart l the colo heart doctor,40.0
and she talked me instead to go to the emergency room,36.36363636363637
went to the emergency room,40.0
and they discovered that Id had a stroke,44.44444444444444
and so they put me in the hospital,50.0
and I was there three days,33.33333333333333
they were trying basically my heart was outof rhythm and was beating too fast and lotsof different things,27.77777777777778
so they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized,26.666666666666668
and then three more days basically discovering that Id had a stroke and aphasia,20.0
and then I was went home after the trying to think what day of the week it was,50.0
Wednesday Wednesday I went home,20.0
and Thursday I drove back to the drove then because I could drive,46.15384615384615
I could everything do everything I needed to do except talk,54.54545454545454
so I went to make a appointment with the speech therapy at that point,42.857142857142854
and thats where it started,50.0
well it started out with something simple because basically I could look at at anything and know what it was,65.0
but I couldnt pull the words out,50.0
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example,50.0
looking around the room,50.0
looking at each object in the room,57.14285714285714
naming it,50.0
trying to find the the word and say the word out loud,33.33333333333333
youknow so thats where it first started,50.0
and it built from there,40.0
youknow just and some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago youknow like with the pictures,40.0
youknow look at the picture,40.0
name the picture,33.33333333333333
and over time that gradually got better and better,22.22222222222222
but thats where I think the start with the therapy was,58.333333333333336
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out,41.66666666666667
and I found when writing I taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldnt spell properly anymore,31.57894736842105
and youknow that was something I had to work at,50.0
so I found that with my keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil,57.89473684210527
and with a notebood,50.0
it it has a spellchecker and a ell,50.0
not Im not sure what youd call it necessarily,36.36363636363637
a checker,50.0
but it starts out youknow if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work,43.47826086956522
so that sometimes helped alot aswell writing,14.285714285714285
so Ive done alotof that,50.0
but its mainly working with seeing what seeing the words and then saying it out loud,37.5
thats done more I think better than anything else,50.0
and I worked hard at it for a long time,50.0
and then I took got kindof afterwards Ive kinda gotten alittle slow about it,33.33333333333333
or not slow but just havent done it as diligently as I used to,26.666666666666668
but for the first months after the stroke I was I worked hard at it,60.0
trying to pull those pictures back,16.666666666666664
and I found that you its its like learning in school again grade school,50.0
you look at a word,60.0
and you learn that word,40.0
and and oh thats that word,28.57142857142857
and it comes back and stays back,14.285714285714285
but with aphasia it doesnt stay there,37.5
its its more like having an electronic dictionary that is occasionally gets scrambled,53.84615384615385
youknow its like,33.33333333333333
youknow that type of thing,40.0
so,0.0

I think when my grandson was born,57.14285714285714

so thats pretty much the story,28.57142857142857
alright,0.0
Cinderella,0.0
well originally apparently her mother died,16.666666666666664
and her and her family were comfortably welloff,37.5
and that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters aswell that moved in with her,41.17647058823529
and they were not very friendly with her,50.0
and over time her father must be outof the picture for some reason because she the change of the Cinderella and the family changed dramatically,52.0
and she became more of a slave than a a sister and the girl and the mother,47.05882352941176
and things got worse and worse as she got older,20.0
and one point in time she got acquainted,37.5
or how do I say it,66.66666666666666
she learned to live with the animals in the home in the family or in the house and outside the home aswell,50.0
and they became her friends instead of her stepsisters,44.44444444444444
and that developed over time,40.0
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his the princess,50.0
so he they planned on a ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the the kingdom,55.55555555555556
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave not take sepmother,13.333333333333334
and Cinderella had a gown somewhere I think,25.0
from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but a trunk someplace,52.38095238095239
and she got it out,60.0
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters,36.36363636363637
and they ended up tearing it up,57.14285714285714
and she didnt have anything,50.0
and then the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to redo her dress,29.411764705882355
her stairy,50.0
there we go,33.33333333333333
I got a word,50.0
fairy godmother stepped in aswell,20.0
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into horses,42.857142857142854
and anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball,33.33333333333333
and stepmother the the prince fell in love with Cinderella,40.0
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening,46.15384615384615
and they Cinderella hadta hadta leave at midnight,25.0
and as she was leaving she left her one slipper got left behind,53.84615384615385
and they couldnt find her,50.0
they had to looked all over for Cinderella or for the girl,33.33333333333333
and they couldnt find her until they finally came to her home,53.84615384615385
and her stepmothers couldnt stepsisters couldnt fit the slipper,36.36363636363637
but Cinderella could,33.33333333333333
so thats where they ended it,71.42857142857143
oh thats easy,25.0
get two pieces of bread,20.0
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife,30.76923076923077
put the peanut butter on one side of the bread,40.0
jelly on the other,50.0
put them together,33.33333333333333
you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,25.0
well its doing fairly well except when I get in a hurry and try to describe something for someone,47.368421052631575
thats where I have more problem with speech than anything I think,53.84615384615385
is s describing something for somebody else to know what Im trying to talk about,56.25
especially FirstnameP my wife,25.0
seems like youknow Im think,33.33333333333333
and then youknow get the details,16.666666666666664
and then sometimes the details dont dont work well,27.27272727272727
so,0.0
all I remember about the stroke is the fact I woke up one morning with a splitting headache,55.55555555555556
and it was so bad that,50.0
I think its probably the worst headache I ever had,40.0
took a couple aspirin and went to outside and picked up the mail my not the mail but my newspaper,35.0
went back to have breakfast,0.0
and as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast I tried to read,46.666666666666664
and I could not make read the paper properly,33.33333333333333
the blocks of words were just that,57.14285714285714
they were blocks,66.66666666666666
and some of it they werent all together,55.55555555555556
it was like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words not the whole words,52.38095238095239
so I left the newspaper that morning and didnt read it and finished getting ready and went to work,25.0
and drove to work,0.0
and on the way to work I noticed that on the dashboard of the car again parts of that was I could see parts of the dashboard,55.55555555555556
and parts of it I couldnt see,50.0
I couldnt see all the words all that,66.66666666666666
but I was able to drive properly,28.57142857142857
and drove to work,0.0
got to work,0.0
and when I tried to got to work I tried to log into my computer,33.33333333333333
and I didnt know how,50.0
I think thats probably the best thing I can say about that,53.84615384615385
I didnt know how to log in,50.0
I didnt know my username,50.0
I didnt know my password,50.0
anything,100.0
and I just had a total blank with that,44.44444444444444
so I worked at it for a while and couldnt couldnt do anything,53.333333333333336
so I finally went to my boss and said,33.33333333333333
hey Ive got a problem,50.0
and I was asked,50.0
so I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again,35.0
and I couldnt make it,50.0
so I finally said,25.0
so I went home and went to bed,25.0
when I got home I took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and spent most of the day in bed,36.36363636363637
and I I slept,50.0
and then when I got up in the afternoon I was able to read,50.0
I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that,52.38095238095239
but it still was problems,40.0
and I do Sudokus the puzzle,33.33333333333333
and I did that on the computer and was able to do it,46.15384615384615
it took much much longer than normally to do it the puzzle,33.33333333333333
but I was able to complete that,42.857142857142854
and then had a normal evening and went to bed early,18.181818181818183
got up the next day and went to exercise class with a group that we meet at early in the mornings on Monday Wednesday and Friday,38.46153846153847
and this was a Friday morning that,57.14285714285714
Id gone to work on Thursday,28.57142857142857
couldnt work,33.33333333333333
so then Friday when I got up I went exercise with the group,46.15384615384615
and with the group we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up,29.166666666666668
and while were walking we talk and visit with eachother,40.0
and when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didnt make sense as far as the the words that I was speaking,57.14285714285714
the words were correct,50.0
but they were not making sense as complete words,33.33333333333333
so I said knew there was something wrong,37.5
my friends knew there was something wrong,42.857142857142854
so I when I got through the exercise class,55.55555555555556
we spent an hour exercising together,33.33333333333333
I went home and had breakfast,16.666666666666664
and I told FirstnameP,25.0
I said,50.0
that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor,54.54545454545454
and she decided that ratherthan that wed take me to the emergency room,50.0
and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that Id had a stroke,41.17647058823529
and so I spent the next three days,25.0
well there was a problem with my heart,50.0
my heart was beating too fast and outof rhythm,22.22222222222222
and so they spent most of the time from the next two or three days correcting that issue,33.33333333333333
and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia,47.05882352941176
and theyd discovered that Id had a stroke and had aphasia,30.76923076923077
so thats pretty much where I am,50.0
well I tried to,25.0
no I I really didnt youknow,42.857142857142854
I just thought I had a headache youknow,37.5
and talking with FirstnameP later she said on on the Wednesday the day before I woke up with a headache she said,54.54545454545454
ke Wednesday night late Id l mentioned that I had a headache then,21.428571428571427
so I dont remember that at all that part of it,66.66666666666666
but its,50.0
so,0.0
yes,0.0
yes I do,33.33333333333333
yeah yeah,0.0
well I think the best thing that happened was I got a great therapist,42.857142857142854
and she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction,40.0
its finding what needed to be done,42.857142857142854
and then working with me to get that,37.5
but basically I went therapy three times a week for several months,25.0
and then dropped down to a couple times a week and we til finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us were youknow Id already done all of them,50.0
and reached a point where they couldnt go any further with it,46.15384615384615
so yeah,0.0
but starting Ive got a squirrel running across my patio,45.45454545454545
nevermind,0.0
let go of that one,40.0
but part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures with the that we saw with all the drawings of different things,61.53846153846154
I had the same thing sitting in a go in the room,50.0
sit in here,33.33333333333333
look around,0.0
and name each object I see in that room and say it out loud,42.857142857142854
youknow Id tell I can figure,28.57142857142857
youknow sometimes youknow you know all these words,37.5
you know all these items,60.0
but you dont aim not able to pull those words out,33.33333333333333
and the same thing driving down the street,37.5

and its something that Ive kept along with all the as long as Ive had a aphasia now,65.0
its youknow when I look at something Ill say the name of that item just to keep keep it going,45.0
and so thats one of the things I do all the time,46.15384615384615
I I dont even think about it alotof the times,54.54545454545454
its just something automatic to do,33.33333333333333
okay,0.0
the boy was out playing in the yard kicking a soccer ball,50.0

Im not sure who this person is whether its his father or neighbor,50.0
and then the adult was watching outof the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broken his window,31.818181818181817
well at this point we dont see his face,50.0
and from I would say hes upset about it,60.0
but Im not sure how much,28.57142857142857
you cant see the expression on the face,55.55555555555556

and the cat was out in the yard,62.5

Cinderella,0.0
story started out when she was a small young girl,50.0

and as they grew it looked like more and more she was acted as a servant rather than a child or a girl in the family as part of the family,51.61290322580645
she was more of a servant,66.66666666666666
and so they grew up that way,42.857142857142854
and then over time she got to know the animals in the home,38.46153846153847
horse and the dog and the mice,28.57142857142857
and had more of a friends with those than with the other two people,50.0
and then as she grew the family or the king in that ighbor neighborhood city whatever had a son that was grown same time,41.66666666666667
and he decided the son needed to meet a girl his age and possibly,28.57142857142857
dont know what the situation was there,50.0
but anyway he decided to create a ball to bring all of the eligible girls in the kingdom and and meet them and decide who might be his girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it,39.02439024390244

and somehow she got her godmother found out about it and helped her get another dress and changed and set the animals up as a coach and horses and took her to the ball,41.17647058823529
and while she was at the ball she met the princess,63.63636363636363

she she was running out,60.0
she lost her one of her slippers as they were leaving,63.63636363636363
it was too late,50.0

and went I came in my ri,42.857142857142854
I live by I live myself,66.66666666666666
then I,50.0
well wait a minute,25.0
I feel Im gonna,50.0
no okay I,33.33333333333333
anyway I went in to lie down,28.57142857142857
and there was something,50.0
and I I think I must have put a phone on and called one of my daughters,52.94117647058824
I have two daughters,25.0
and I was lying there and then allofasudden they came in with a daughter of one of them,50.0
and they said,33.33333333333333
they came outside with the with the peep s,55.55555555555556
I said,50.0
and because Im lying there and,42.857142857142854
and finally I said,25.0
so I went just they just took me like I was to gsu,46.15384615384615
and when I arrived,50.0
because I have been there many times for other things,50.0
and when I went there they put me immediately into the hbskulu,50.0
and to they thought that Id had a stroke which I guess thats what they accomplished,50.0
and so they were they gave me a nice room by myself,58.333333333333336
and I I guess I just sortof didnt say much,36.36363636363637
and I was there for two two weeks,37.5
and they had many people coming in h wdnksu,22.22222222222222
what Im trying to think,50.0
pilu,0.0
some of them I knew and some I did not,60.0
and so the and and they walked me alot,33.33333333333333
they told me to they helped me walking,62.5
and and I was doing things like that,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I I didnt,40.0
and then I I said,40.0
ksdu,0.0
so thats what they did of two weeks,55.55555555555556
and thats when they did alotof what applications right in there,33.33333333333333
and what was going to happen,33.33333333333333
and so thats the way it is,50.0
and and fortunately nothing else came a great bfrntsu,22.22222222222222
but but it was I assume it was something in my,72.72727272727273
what what alotof people that I talk here in this group of people I will say,56.25
and theyve told me about many have told me about it,66.66666666666666
so I I feel the same,50.0
and I I have walked for years I have have the every morning at six oclock get the NewYorkTimes to me at the door,58.333333333333336
and so then they continue do that now,25.0

well I went back to school,33.33333333333333
I was a teacher twenty five years,42.857142857142854
two in Pennsylvania and twenty three in Baltimore,25.0
I went back to school to become a counselor an elementary school counselor,30.76923076923077
and that day I went to,50.0
Tuesdays we have the the team the team,50.0
and I have I figured,60.0
no,0.0
I everything was in order,80.0
and everything was in their place,66.66666666666666
and I went to a meeting Monday as,50.0
and I came home and I thought,28.57142857142857
well I know what was on CreaturesGreatandSmall,57.14285714285714
so I I had,50.0
you press a button and it zooms back,37.5
and I recorded it,50.0
and so I watched it,40.0
and I says,33.33333333333333
by that time I settled down,66.66666666666666
and I says,33.33333333333333
and I I slept,50.0
and I got up this morning and I took a shower,45.45454545454545
and I got partially dressed because I couldnt find my slacks,50.0
and so I came down and I turned the,44.44444444444444
what is it called,75.0
I want some spritz in my hair,57.14285714285714
and so I turned it on and I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee,37.5
and when I got the milk out and poured it in when I closed the door I says,55.55555555555556
and with that,66.66666666666666
I fell on the floor,60.0
and this side,33.33333333333333
and I thought,33.33333333333333
and I kept I kept thinking my hand,37.5
I flopped it down,75.0
and so I was in the kitchen,57.14285714285714
and by the time,50.0
I thought,50.0
I went out and I thought,50.0
and by the time I got to the television I have a halfway to go yet,43.75
and FirstnameT was the principal and she came,37.5
and in the meantime my telephone rang three four times,30.0
and I could not get it,50.0
and if I woulda,50.0
because I didnt know it might affected my speech,60.0
and I was youknow it,60.0
anyhow she said,33.33333333333333
and I thought,33.33333333333333
and she called the police and the ambulance,37.5
and they came back,25.0
and he broke the door down,50.0
well not the broke it,40.0
he like,50.0
it sounds like theyre gonna,57.14285714285714
slit,0.0
but on this one he hadta it needed repaired,44.44444444444444
so and thats,25.0
I was in FranklinSquare hospital,60.0
and at that time December seventh ninety nineteen ninety three they didnt have anything to do,29.411764705882355
they they put me in a room and they said,60.0
I was hungry the next day and the next day,40.0
and they kept saying,25.0
and he she anyhow they finally got me to eat,40.0
but my sister and brother came down,28.57142857142857
and I I says,50.0
I couldnt believe that they came for me,66.66666666666666
because I didnt think I youknow,57.14285714285714
well I went to Sinai because they did not have a program for people with strokes,50.0
so I went to Sinai,40.0
you know where Sinai is,60.0
and they have a really good program,28.57142857142857
and and boy they didnt mess around,37.5
and I liked it there,40.0
and but the speech pathologist was a man,37.5
and he said that he is after awhile he said he was going to leave,53.333333333333336
he and his wife and I think they had two children,36.36363636363637
he was going to Texas,60.0
and he brought me,50.0
and he said,33.33333333333333
and I did that,50.0
and then I was there I didnt get outof Sinai until I think the fourth of January,44.44444444444444
well I was there until the twentieth I think,55.55555555555556
and then I went to Sinai,33.33333333333333
so and then I had FirstnameJ was my caretaker because I live by myself,50.0
and and she was okay very good Imean but she gets tired too youknow of doing the same thing,26.31578947368421
and and then she while I was in Sinai I got a woman came,50.0
and she was you were making sure that anything she was recruiting people with strokes or brain damage because of a car accident,52.17391304347826
and he,50.0
and maybe Im not quite sure whether she told me or my sister FirstnameM,33.33333333333333
but so the Return program I started in May the beginning of May,38.46153846153847
and I had FirstnameS,25.0
and she only she worked all around the clock,44.44444444444444
she couldnt take ke a half day,50.0
and so I got FirstnameC,20.0
and she could work half days,33.33333333333333
and but I got,25.0
and I kept thinking,25.0
and anyhow Im wavering,40.0
that is not the reason you asked the question,55.55555555555556
well the FirstnameJ said,25.0
and I slept for around the clock,57.14285714285714
and I got up and the headache was gone,44.44444444444444
but FirstnameSu is a good friend of mine,50.0
and she called the doctor,40.0
and the doctor said,25.0
and he did,33.33333333333333
and when I saw it it was the the bleeder,70.0
and I he said Doctor FirstnameLastnameD said,28.57142857142857
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I had I Im a well a school teacher,45.45454545454545
and ten questions were a second grader,28.57142857142857
and I couldnt answer seven of them,50.0
and now when I went back to that I answered three,45.45454545454545
and I thought,33.33333333333333
so I kept on going to the Return program,44.44444444444444
and May June July and the beginning of August FirstnameC was in the hospital,35.714285714285715
she fell down a flight of steps,57.14285714285714
and she was pregnant,50.0
and she was so upset youknow,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
because they hafta call somebody to youknow take care of me,45.45454545454545
and I says,33.33333333333333
and when I was sitting there I thought,50.0
I couldnt get up,60.0
I couldnt get up,60.0
and I called FirstnameR the next door neighbor,25.0
she came over,66.66666666666666
and she says,33.33333333333333
she pulled me up,75.0
and she says,33.33333333333333
youknow she didnt,25.0
ke call FirstnameSu,0.0
and I called her and I was back in the hospital,54.54545454545454
and because when I had the stroke they gave me Ecotrin three times a day,46.666666666666664
when I had that c my second stroke they said,50.0
and I thought,33.33333333333333
and I say that to myself but they decided that it would be good to a Coumadin,64.70588235294117
and I got very depressed when at,42.857142857142854
I was not depressed the first stroke,42.857142857142854
it hit me the third stroke,50.0
I thought,50.0
youknow I never know whats gonna happen,33.33333333333333
and I just really depressed,20.0
sothat they got to take Zoloft,33.33333333333333
and I took it and I thought,42.857142857142854
and so when I left the hospital I I ate my cereal every morning and I had diarrhea every day,45.0
and after I thought,50.0
and he said,33.33333333333333
so I got to take Crestor,16.666666666666664
no Crestor is that,75.0
Effexor,0.0
and Ive been on that ever since because Ive tried to take it off,62.5
and you hafta do it by half a month and then,45.45454545454545
and by the time I get finished everything bothers me I get really upset,50.0
and I started to cry,20.0
and youknow I think its better to be on the Effexor,45.45454545454545
well one of the things Ive never been outof the Pittsburgh,50.0
Ive been to Pittsburgh at that time when I was about fourteen,69.23076923076923
I went to Pittsburgh once,40.0
my mother and sister FirstnameK the older one,25.0
and but it when I was about fourteen in the summer,54.54545454545454
FirstnameMi is my good friend in high school and and her aunt were going to NewYork because of their aunt,45.0
there is a problem with her,66.66666666666666
and I think that shes becoming senile or whatever but somebody hasta see what youknow is going on,47.368421052631575
and so I kept asking my mother and asking her,30.0
and she kept saying,25.0
and I says,33.33333333333333
and youknow she decided,25.0
so we went to NewYork,40.0
and Ive forgotten the name of the town,55.55555555555556
it starts with a gl,60.0
a little town,33.33333333333333
and and anyhow we went to see her,25.0
and one of the things that happened,42.857142857142854
oh the she was upset with FirstnameMi and I,55.55555555555556
we both had periods,50.0
and our the aunt told us youknow how roll it up and all that,57.14285714285714
and we rolled it up and we went off to ConeyIsland,54.54545454545454
and we got back everything would be fine,50.0
and the aunt was mad,40.0
mad as heck,66.66666666666666
what happened was he,75.0
and the dog knew,25.0
and he,50.0
it was all over the house,66.66666666666666
and she cleaned it up instead of waiting until we cleaned it up,61.53846153846154
and she was upset,50.0
and I rightly so,25.0
but we didnt know that the dog would do that,54.54545454545454
but and then at the the thing that,50.0
we went to not a Broadway play but RadioCityHall,33.33333333333333
and we saw EricMarie,25.0
starts with an rl,50.0
is it could you spell that,83.33333333333334
no,0.0
its long longer,33.33333333333333
but he wrote the book and they made it into a play movie,46.15384615384615
and we got to see that,33.33333333333333
and it was and then I love to travel on trains,36.36363636363637
and we went to that way and then we come back,36.36363636363637
and that was the most exciting thing,42.857142857142854
Im sorry the last one is,42.857142857142854
no I I just wanted it you repeat the last one,45.45454545454545
and no,50.0
the little boy or no middle ten years old,22.22222222222222
and kicking the ball,25.0
and he thinks,33.33333333333333
and,0.0
and I Im not quite sure,28.57142857142857
the mother tells him,50.0
and he looks and he goes,33.33333333333333
and its raining,33.33333333333333
well the,50.0
and apparently,0.0
and,0.0
and and then I guess somebody called the,37.5
maybe his wife or whatever called the fire trucks sothat,40.0
because I think the little dog,50.0
well out west they have a storms,28.57142857142857
and I think in Texas a couple months ago,33.33333333333333
and and the little girl was on the shore,44.44444444444444
and no more,33.33333333333333
it swept in and he,60.0
and the rescuers came,25.0
and and he she,50.0
oh yeah,0.0
the names I cant remember,50.0
well Cinderella is working for them,50.0
and them is I think the mother and the two little girls at the beginning,46.666666666666664
and then they grow up and shes still working Cinderella,36.36363636363637
and so there is,25.0
Cinderella is all the animals sortof alike,42.857142857142854
and except the one that,60.0
she has it in her hand hand at,62.5
I dont know what kind of animal it is,60.0
but that but only the one that is growling youknow,40.0
but otherwise and then they look she he,37.5
no here I go again,20.0
Cinderella looks out and sees the the castle,37.5
and and she in her mirror she sees a a picture a picture,53.84615384615385
and she I dont know how she gets out but she a wears it,60.0
and they says they say,40.0
anyhow she the prince invites her to dance,37.5
and the,50.0
anyhow its midnight,33.33333333333333
I think that it would be,83.33333333333334
going back there was a godfairy,33.33333333333333
and and so when the prince she looks at the clock and realizes its just youknow a couple minutes before twelve,38.095238095238095
and she hurries up to run,33.33333333333333
and she drops her her shoe fell off,50.0
and they came the,50.0
I dont know what his name was but he has the shoes that he hasta fit,52.94117647058824
and it doesnt fit on the two women,44.44444444444444
but on Cinderella it fits,40.0
and they the prince and she get married and live happily ever after,30.76923076923077
well first of all you get the bread out,55.55555555555556
put it on a saucer,60.0
and then you unscrew the the peanut butter jar,44.44444444444444
and I have a a,60.0
well its good for strokes,40.0
and so I did that,40.0
and I spooned it out,60.0
not spoon it out,50.0
I cut s,33.33333333333333
and I spread my bread with peanut butter,37.5
and then I I put jelly on the other side,40.0
and I put,33.33333333333333
and and then it it wouldnt go,37.5
so I shook it,50.0
and it came out all way so I hadta slice it,45.45454545454545
and then I smeared it,40.0
I I did that last night,50.0

and FirstnameT is my husband,40.0
he was saying to me,80.0
and it was the night time,50.0
and when we got back to my house I didnt feel well,46.15384615384615

it depends on what Im talking about,75.0
if its pretty typical,50.0
telling a story,33.33333333333333
Ill put it that way,40.0
if I told you something about what happened it becomes I I,75.0
and people will say,25.0
ke even my mom will be like,57.14285714285714
so you know what I mean,50.0
my words,50.0
yes yes,0.0
mhm,0.0
and it alotof times I cant come up with the words either,46.15384615384615
but what Ive learned quickly to do is how to define what the word is which then becomes part of telling a story in order to point out what the word is,48.484848484848484
you mean ke once Id been in the hospital,30.0
I I can,100.0
well yeah I I can before they took me,66.66666666666666
okay,0.0
basically what happened like two or three months in advance I couldnt I couldnt organize,41.17647058823529
I was running a business at a church bookstore,55.55555555555556
and it was close to Christmas so theres more stuff,45.45454545454545
and trying to figure out even how to,25.0
and at one point when I realized,42.857142857142854
and I couldnt figure out how to do it,50.0
and things looked a different size,16.666666666666664
so I couldnt tell what fit,42.857142857142854
and it turns out I also,50.0
I remember specifically too,25.0
Id ordered fifteen hundred dollars worth of books,22.22222222222222
Christmas time,0.0
and then so Ive got the receipt,37.5
and I couldnt get anything put together,37.5
ke I didnt know where to,42.857142857142854
Im pretty focused,25.0
couldnt figure that out,60.0
and then I saw another receipt because I got ordered like seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books,38.88888888888889
and I remember looking at it going,42.857142857142854
and then I just was like,50.0
and in addition to that I was going to school,50.0
so youknow all together,25.0
well at school I was Id been in digital arts classes,41.66666666666667
so I was in a Flash class where making movement,50.0
and it was the same kind of thing where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things,56.00000000000001
but our final project,25.0
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing that wed done right before that it took I put it in like seven or eight different programs,36.36363636363637
so now I look back,20.0
so to,0.0
mhm,0.0
and then the day that I went into the hospital it was the first part of January,52.94117647058824
and I was at work,60.0
and and things had been being weird,42.857142857142854
and a girl was there,40.0
and its like I was like I was,87.5
Im like,66.66666666666666
my mom picks me up,60.0
well actually drive,0.0
and I took a rest during that time,50.0
but I found out later that I wasnt even speaking well,41.66666666666667
that then I go to the emergency room,50.0
it took them eight or nine hours to see me,30.0
yeah,0.0
and I didnt know that until later that,55.55555555555556
they were just like,75.0
because they were nice,75.0
I remember that part,50.0
and then I did get unconscious,33.33333333333333
my mom tells me that they put me,62.5
and so I I still dont have I dont even go like,35.714285714285715
nothing like that,100.0
and the way they discovered I had encephalitis and this unusual one herpes encephalitis,28.57142857142857
the neurologist was saying,50.0
and,0.0
so they gave me the medicine right away instead of waiting for the test results three or four days later,30.0
and thats when I see its kindof,50.0
thats what even the neurologist has said,50.0
so thats my story,40.0
so they say,33.33333333333333
mhm,0.0
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year,33.33333333333333
and youknow it was tough to figure out how to walk,36.36363636363637
its not that it was where I couldnt walk,70.0
its that I couldnt,80.0
I couldnt both ke if there was a radio or a tv on I couldnt pay attention to what you,54.54545454545454
I couldnt figure out how to cook,50.0
youknow things like that are still complicate,42.857142857142854
no theyre complex but theyre not as complicated,20.0
Ive just learned how to,50.0
and,0.0
you mean ke ke learning words again,14.285714285714285
well I definitely,33.33333333333333
I wrote alot,33.33333333333333
Imean I wrote pages and pages and pages,12.5
just in general I wrote a letter to PimaCollege because of something that had happened the semester before,61.111111111111114
and I took three or four months to write it,20.0
I didnt want anyone to help me,50.0
so and that was cool that Im Im,50.0
youknow I look back Im ke really glad I was the person that I was to not give up,45.0
and so I also went to exercise,14.285714285714285
mom took me to her exercise class,42.857142857142854
and they knew my mom well so I didnt feel uncomfortable not being able to do much,27.77777777777778
little things like that,50.0
I did lots of little things,33.33333333333333
okay now like what,25.0
oh okay,0.0
Im like,66.66666666666666
yeah Ill tell you a recent one because that might be alittle more difficult,42.857142857142854
I can tell you the past because Ive told alotof stories from the past,60.0
so so Im doing it deliberately for the current,50.0
and its sad,33.33333333333333
my grandson just passed away a week ago,37.5
hes twenty,33.33333333333333
and he passed away from cancer,33.33333333333333
and he was sick for a year and a half,50.0
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer,40.0
so he was sick before,60.0
now lets see how I can,50.0
I shouldnt try to think,33.33333333333333
okay,0.0
so what happened is when he graduated from highschool he lived outside of Tucson close to Phoenix,47.05882352941176
and and so he was going to join the Marines,30.0
but I said,33.33333333333333
because it had been tough in his family life,66.66666666666666
so I found a way to get him to move in with me,46.15384615384615
we didnt have alotof money to make it happen,30.0
so I found a way to get him here,33.33333333333333
and after hed been here a few months kept saying,36.36363636363637
they finally found out what it was,71.42857142857143
so it was just a tough approach,42.857142857142854
and so they his parents finally moved him back in,40.0
and its just been a tough path,42.857142857142854
Ive learned how not to talk much,37.5
so I havent been able to participate in us in language at all just in touchyfeely stuff,38.88888888888889
but Ive stayed up there when he was in the hospital,58.333333333333336
well a week before he passed away my man and I went up there for a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool,46.875
we got to spend time there,16.666666666666664

well my wife says sometimes when I get alittle upset I talk too loud,28.57142857142857
but,0.0
so youknow,0.0
yes it was in March of two thousand and seven I guess three years ago,33.33333333333333
I was at the breakfast table,66.66666666666666
and,0.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I called my wife,40.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
so they immediately took me to the RestinGeneral Hospital enrolled me and and,38.46153846153847
Im thinking about the tia,66.66666666666666
I went in to have hip joint replacement surgery,22.22222222222222
and I was a healthy,60.0
I just had,33.33333333333333
so I went to have that replaced,28.57142857142857
and the following the surgery went fine,28.57142857142857
following morning they got me up for the first time to to walk,38.46153846153847
and when I got up I collapsed suddenly,50.0
and they did the usual mris and the cat,33.33333333333333
and they would ask me the battery of questions,55.55555555555556
and I had difficulties knowing when I was born what year I was born etcetera,46.666666666666664
I had,50.0
never did,0.0
smack by the time I,60.0
I could listen to the news and understand what I was hearing,58.333333333333336
but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do,53.333333333333336
so I tried to cope with it by asking my wife,45.45454545454545
and I started trying to work one line at a time in in one column,33.33333333333333
that was difficult,66.66666666666666
but when I felt I could repeat that and say it then I would try to get,47.05882352941176
and it was difficult,50.0
but,0.0
and after several days I got to where I could maybe read and comprehend a short paragraph,41.17647058823529
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was,45.83333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
so I got downstairs sat down at my computer and I hadta call my wife,40.0
she showed me,66.66666666666666
and it came up,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
and I got something in front of me,62.5
I said,50.0
and said,0.0
but it took me awhile to get that,37.5
and I had jumbled,50.0
and I even saved it because it was very jumbled,50.0
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after it was very jumbled,57.89473684210527
and so thats when I heard about the StrokeComebackCenter from the traveling nurse that came by to attend me,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
and I said,33.33333333333333
and so I I came here and was starting on a once a week schedule,40.0
and I felt it was a very good experience because I started making progress,42.857142857142854
and what I l Ive always said about with FirstnameM and the center as a general is they seem to have a very good way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge but not over not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it,47.05882352941176
so if it was,75.0
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and,40.0
and this sorta,33.33333333333333
so it was a,75.0
and then she she said FirstnameM said,42.857142857142854
so I I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students,50.0
and after,50.0
I decided I would start to write a maybe a little journal of my experiences from the day as I recalled it from the day I had my first stroke and and to the recovery period,50.0
and I ended up doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester,47.61904761904761
and I ended up labelling it as Firstnames aphasia journal,40.0
and I would write a a little section each week,50.0
and then she would kindof react respond back to me,40.0
but I would I would build on it and finally ended that up,53.84615384615385
and she turned it in as her as her theme her project for the for the me for the semester,75.0
and hadta give a presentation on on this interaction,44.44444444444444
so all that all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this,64.28571428571429
but I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again,33.33333333333333
and thats when xxx sent me in and dgmostu,50.0
but they went ahead and sent me to JohnHopkins StrokeRehabilitationCenter,30.0
and I became a patient there subject and worked with them,36.36363636363637
and they diagnosed that I had had a previously undisclosed flap on my heart,50.0
but that is probably why I caught the clot,55.55555555555556
and xxx,0.0
but thats yeah I participated in that,50.0
and part of my therapy building along was after going through writing my weekly Firstnames journal I met with a couple of retired army officers who contacted me that said they were the US DepartmentofAgriculture was wanting to write a a history of nutrition research that had been performed by the military after the DepartmentofAgriculture became involved,47.368421052631575
and they said,33.33333333333333
I said,50.0
and he said,33.33333333333333
and so I started another project to still working on it writing a history of nutrition research performed by the military from the seventeen thirties to the present day,41.37931034482759
youknow and I I I and Im youknow Im still working at that,53.333333333333336
and I continue to come here to the Center once or twice a a week and because I have a buddy,42.857142857142854
name is FirstnameK,33.33333333333333
and she was had had a stroke not too long before I did,46.15384615384615
and we were here in the first class together,44.44444444444444
and shes shes about forty I think,33.33333333333333
but we kindof were buddies,40.0
so it,50.0
I would think its,75.0
okay,0.0
,0.0
surely,0.0
I will use one that I actually used in my penpal stories,50.0
one of the things that came was I I was a farm boy growing up in Missouri,58.82352941176471
and I had a grandmother which I thought very much of,45.45454545454545
and she had was a single lady by this time,60.0
her husband had passed away,60.0
my grandfather passed away,50.0
but I was out getting starting in college or no,50.0
and dad decided that I should maybe buy a or Id decided I wanted to buy a a Hereford heifer to start a a,36.0
I had my Fourh FFA activities,33.33333333333333
I told my grandma about it,66.66666666666666
and she said,33.33333333333333
to keep the weeds down out on her place,44.44444444444444
so I went together and dad and I,25.0
and we purchased two heifers Susie and Stella,12.5
well I took Susie,25.0
and we stayed on at my dads place,50.0
and Stella was at my my my grandmas place,55.55555555555556
the but on one occasion we brought them back home in the winter time,42.857142857142854
we bring them all back to the to the to the barn to where the youknow to get them off the pastures were already gone up and to give them hay,58.06451612903226
well I was going out one day down to bring try to get the cattle to come up including Susie and Stella to get them up to the barn,27.586206896551722
and they were running around,40.0
and I got aggravated xxx I decided Id throw a rock at one of them to get them to go back,36.36363636363637
well I ended up,50.0
and I picked up this boulder and gave it a heave,45.45454545454545
unfortunately it ran headlong,25.0
knocked the thing flat on its,50.0
so I was scared as the dickens,57.14285714285714
I ran up to dad,60.0
dad came down the barn immediately and got his old dull pocket knife out,28.57142857142857
thought maybe hed be able to figured it was probably dying but atleast wanted to preserve the meat to let it bleed it out,36.0
well the,50.0
Stella blared and belted,0.0
and so it wasnt dead it was just knocked out,45.45454545454545
so that taught me a lesson not to be throwing rocks and,33.33333333333333
Stella became fine xxx,0.0
but that I used that as part of a short story about a little writing a,56.25
well this young boy is playing soccer,28.57142857142857
and hes just kicked the ball up in the air and uhoh,46.15384615384615
it just hit the window in the house and I guess broke in the window,46.666666666666664
it not only went th,20.0
and then dad is picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window and figured out trying to find out where did that come from,42.30769230769231
sure,0.0
well the sighs,33.33333333333333
lets see,0.0
the young boy is with a mother,57.14285714285714
mothers got an umbrella,25.0
hes seemingly reaching for the umbrella,57.14285714285714
the next panel looks like mothers trying to encourage the boy to take the umbrella and go outside,22.22222222222222
but the boy apparently decided to go outside without the umbrella,27.27272727272727
and now its raining,25.0
and now its starting to pour down rain,25.0
and hes running back to the house,50.0
and now his his heads all wet,42.857142857142854
and his mother looks sortof upset,16.666666666666664
and he goes back outside but now hes using the hes wearing the umbrella,43.75
well I think we had a problem where occurred where a cat decided to crawl up into the tree and go out on small limb on the outside,46.42857142857143
it looks like the yeah young girl got upset and had called her dad probably to maybe try to get the cat down,26.08695652173913
shed been,50.0
dad had apparently gotten a ladder and had started up the tree and got up there but for some reason it looks like the ladder has fallen down,42.857142857142854
the dog is now upset and barking,28.57142857142857
dads stuck in the tree,40.0
and the cats still there,20.0
well there seems to be a bird chirping for one unknown reason but enough that somebody decided to call the fire department,31.818181818181817
and the fire department with two men are carrying a ladder apparently there to try to rescue to get the man down and possibly get the cat outof the tree,26.666666666666668
think that found all of the characters that were in the,72.72727272727273

story is about Cinderella who was a younger sister of with two older sisters I believe,50.0
and she seemed to be the prettier of the three,50.0
and her mother was a little bit of a domineering lady,45.45454545454545
and they were all excited becau,33.33333333333333
well the the older sisters were getting themselves well dressed and,36.36363636363637
well at first it was sure whether younger sister Cinderella was gonna get to go to her nu,36.84210526315789
but there were some animals around,50.0
and,0.0
but anyhow they all finally got dressed mother and the three daughters,25.0
and they went to,50.0
and there was a handsome prince probably with the the son of the whoever was a main character or the,55.00000000000001
and there was a number,40.0
and apparently Cinderella may have got to dance with one of the young men,35.714285714285715
but somewhere in the process she lost a slipper,44.44444444444444
after the ball when theyd all gotten home I think she must have noticed that she was missing her slipper,66.66666666666666
and much to her surprise PrinceCharming came riding up to the house in his carriage and was looking for who does the slipper belong to which one of the ladies,53.333333333333336
and probably they must have tried it on,62.5
and the two older sisters their slipper was too small to fit on the feet of them,41.17647058823529
so he then PrinceCharming tried it on Cinderella,37.5
and it ips the shoe fit perfectly on the slipper s,36.36363636363637
and so Cinderella then got to go back with PrinceCharming and go back to another ball or something,22.22222222222222
that seems to be what,60.0
theres animals in this watching the process but I dont know how they were exactly were involved in the story,54.54545454545454
