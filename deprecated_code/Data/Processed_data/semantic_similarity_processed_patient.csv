what I was doing that day,0.380359947681427
before,1.0
I was outside working in the garden,0.3222764730453491
and it was hot,0.3006184697151184
it was in the beginning of June,0.334128737449646
and it was three years ago when it was in the nineties,0.28409239649772644
but I love to work in the garden,0.3067101836204529
and I was working in the garden,0.3149945139884949
and allofasudden it was getting youknow I was getting a little not dizzy but I just wasnt feeling right,0.31367990374565125
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
so I cleaned up,0.446513295173645
I had a shower,0.3611021041870117
and I went shopping,0.3208438754081726
I was looking for curtains,0.30881357192993164
and it was getting later because I always like to get home by three oclock to watch my program,0.23616133630275726
so on my way home I was passing another store i which had curtains,0.24278171360492706
so I thought,0.6273478269577026
so I went in there,0.3300580680370331
and as Im walking around all of sudden Im like the,0.2234266847372055
nothing hurt,0.6653732061386108
nothing hurt,0.6653732061386108
but it was just getting weird,0.45204079151153564
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
so I thought,0.6273478269577026
so I thought I better go home,0.4438442289829254
Im driving and Im by myself,0.227354496717453
so I went home got ea cooled down and I had a something to eat,0.21917825937271118
and then I sat and my story came on,0.2509201467037201
and I dont remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything,0.2785223424434662
but allofasudden my son who lives with me hes calling me,0.25394582748413086
and he comes home about five oclock,0.2526535987854004
and,1.0
and he says,0.3578353226184845
he says,0.5041618347167969
he says its,0.3349221646785736
I says,0.5166024565696716
and he says,0.3578353226184845
he says,0.5041618347167969
so between that time when the story was about to start and five oclock I was out,0.26256805658340454
but I could talk,0.4866427183151245
I could walk,0.4825097322463989
I could nothing nothing bothered me,0.5338298082351685
but I got in the kitchen and I stood there,0.27076348662376404
and I said to him,0.3349546492099762
so I took a a few more steps and I says,0.23403288424015045
he says,0.5041618347167969
we were making lambchops on the grill,0.28643694519996643
and I had them marinated,0.3429543375968933
and I says,0.32063889503479004
so he he told me,0.4342419505119324
and I says,0.32063889503479004
I didnt even know where they were,0.37753233313560486
he says,0.5041618347167969
and I didnt even know what a refrigerator was,0.26013052463531494
and then I started to get not scared but I thought,0.37193360924720764
but I didnt know anything that was going on,0.3381330072879791
in my mind I did but I couldnt get them out,0.31967616081237793
so he looked at me and he says,0.2677897810935974
I says,0.5166024565696716
so I have a daughter who lives in Vernon,0.23154525458812714
and I said to him I says,0.316324919462204
and he looked,0.41608482599258423
I said,0.5259465575218201
so I couldnt get her name out,0.29237690567970276
so he called her,0.3505063056945801
he realized what I was trying to get,0.34180620312690735
so I got her on,0.3452286124229431
and I told her,0.31630465388298035
I says,0.5166024565696716
so she says,0.44929757714271545
I says,0.5166024565696716
so then allofasudden her name came,0.3466506600379944
because its going through my mind,0.3788585960865021
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and I started to cry,0.28036195039749146
so she says,0.44929757714271545
then she got her other phone and she called the doctor,0.3094002604484558
and the doctor said,0.36860817670822144
so they took me up to the hospital,0.2895519733428955
she called her husband who worked down this end,0.28607508540153503
and he came and my son took me to the emergency room,0.23687750101089478
and I was there for oh I guess about oh twelve hours thirteen hours,0.21226175129413605
and they didnt know what was wrong with me,0.2778322100639343
because every question they asked me I said right off correct,0.3458567261695862
everything,0.9999999403953552
and count backwards,0.5542042255401611
went right back,0.5581571459770203
and we were youknow talking and I was walking around,0.28409716486930847
and I hadta go to the bathroom,0.2952100932598114
and I knew where the bathroom was laughs in the hospital,0.26059457659721375
and I went there,0.3519880771636963
and we came out and we were talking and talking,0.3534379303455353
and the one doctor said,0.3463541269302368
so meantime I didnt realize that I didnt know the names of my all my other family,0.28153523802757263
so they they just kept me there,0.4987935423851013
and allofasudden one doctor says,0.3434330224990845
it was on a weekend which is a bad time,0.27471140027046204
Februa Fridays,1.0
and he says,0.3578353226184845
now when somebody doesnt feel sick and thinks theyre doing everything theyre not gonna say,0.2905154526233673
especially on a weekend laughs,0.2944483458995819
so we went home,0.40386688709259033
so my my son inlaw took me home to her,0.28866639733314514
and I was there for the weekend,0.30280351638793945
and they had gone away for the weekend,0.30609655380249023
not the the whole weekend just over overnight that one night,0.42697325348854065
because originally I was sposta babysit for them anyway,0.31317657232284546
so just by luck my daughter said to her husband,0.26741141080856323
so because I had,0.5187164545059204
so the father came up,0.31748199462890625
and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart,0.28476375341415405
I cried,0.628555417060852
and I just wouldnt stop crying,0.35203421115875244
and then allofasudden Id sleep,0.31723690032958984
Id sleep for hours,0.2832600772380829
and I didnt realize it,0.34549185633659363
and then we went the weekend we went to the doctors and,0.3358236849308014
and I said,0.32917967438697815
I says,0.5166024565696716
so I ra I went home,0.3322514593601227
I was,0.5414456129074097
and about a week later they my doctors sent a neurologist to me,0.24280290305614471
and when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me he says,0.2666587829589844
he says,0.5041618347167969
so thats how I knew I had a stroke,0.3017614781856537
it was really really weird,0.5096591711044312
but I I forgot so many things,0.4869753122329712
ke in the morning every morning after I got my breakfast ready I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper,0.2452336549758911
and,1.0
I looked at it and I couldnt get the words,0.2523605525493622
I u I knew what they were but I could not say any of those words,0.32990431785583496
and I what I did get to read I didnt understand,0.345427006483078
so I tried for a couple of days and like,0.25156331062316895
after a couple more days Im sitting there and I thought,0.2725881338119507
I started reading it,0.4226720631122589
now I read a paper,0.3408869206905365
and it didnt take me long but I worked hard at it,0.26056450605392456
and every morning when I got up after I youknow into the bathroom and everything Id go back in bed and Id lay there,0.22142918407917023
and Id think of my daughters family,0.2412203699350357
theres four people in the family,0.31184956431388855
theres two boys her husband and herself,0.28321510553359985
I knew her name but I couldnt get his name out and the two boys,0.22173944115638733
and I would just close my eyes and visualize it,0.3124774694442749
and gradually allofasudden Id see their names,0.27929648756980896
and gradually it would come,0.45431196689605713
then I went with my oldest son with his family,0.27376043796539307
it was tiring,0.47960364818573
and I did that at night too when I went to bed before I went to sleep,0.2868210971355438
I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother were in all that,0.27339890599250793
and it was a long time but it it worked,0.3712313771247864
it really really worked,0.5742913484573364
and I said to my daughter one day I says,0.25268638134002686
I says,0.5166024565696716
and I says,0.32063889503479004
she says,0.5345509648323059
I says,0.5166024565696716
I says,0.5166024565696716
she says,0.5345509648323059
but it all came,0.452989786863327
its just now I I have trouble every once in awhile to get my words out,0.30191054940223694
and that and when I write,0.4116797149181366
its getting better,0.5101381540298462
sometimes when I write,0.48458433151245117
and allofasudden I look at it and I thought,0.31854504346847534
and the first time I saw that was when I made my first when I was going to the store,0.2910487949848175
my little shopping thing,0.49931880831718445
I needed mayonnaise,0.43367037177085876
so laughs Im writing and writing,0.29370805621147156
I get to the store and I came to that word,0.2947314977645874
I couldnt figure out what it was,0.3248242139816284
the,0.9999997019767761
and I couldnt remember what it was,0.3140595555305481
and by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back,0.25768405199050903
then I knew what it was,0.42058950662612915
it would come,0.5542999505996704
Id forget it again but then in it but thats the way it goes,0.33173221349716187
I know everything but I still hafta I forget alotof things,0.38989731669425964
but everybody says,0.521769642829895
youknow and its fine because I I laugh about it,0.3027462661266327
because when Im with my friends and out I see people having trouble,0.30286991596221924
they cant remember,0.41396355628967285
and theres nothing wrong with them,0.3720303475856781
so I think,0.6691157817840576
but I have had so much pleasure here and learning,0.3977144956588745
and so many people,0.4948306083679199
I says,0.5166024565696716
and I says,0.32063889503479004
I said,0.5259465575218201
and I said,0.32917967438697815
but I says,0.4721947908401489
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and I says,0.32063889503479004
yes it has really helped,0.3594515919685364
still helps yeah,0.4038654863834381
it is,0.6004485487937927
for each one,0.5674294233322144
alright the story is about a boy playing soccer,0.2644062042236328
and he breaks a window in a house,0.32738643884658813
and then,0.7074459791183472
and the soccer ball coming through the window to hit him,0.29860347509384155
and then he gets up and hes looking out the window holding the soccer ball,0.2603135406970978
and thats about what he has for the whole story,0.30634745955467224
but it more or less is a lesson for him that you dont do that kind of ball playing so close to buildings to houses,0.26064473390579224
and,1.0
well theres one thing that I have been always happy about what happened to me,0.36102545261383057
ke the fortunate stroke that I had that wasnt too bad was it was in nineteen seventy five I had cancer,0.23665595054626465
and I had a s okay masectomy,0.22807714343070984
and I came through it very well,0.3409692943096161
and there was alot that was in there,0.3453018367290497
but I got it through finally,0.41985994577407837
so thats what about thirty some odd years already,0.3276587426662445
and Im very proud of that,0.24541333317756653
and I was the first one in the family to have cancer,0.31383076310157776
and then allofasudden other members of my family,0.3694307506084442
immediate youknow my living home family,0.32139718532562256
they have come down with it,0.41098150610923767
and theyre gone,0.3382498621940613
and I have always been very thankful that I came through the way I did,0.3286227285861969
and the doctors were amazed because it was so fast that I I healed and everything,0.32199183106422424
I didnt go home the way alotof people who have masectomies,0.23979076743125916
and at that time it was about five years later when they started to come out with the,0.29208874702453613
how do you call it,0.4807278513908386
they made,0.5771604776382446

comeon brain move,0.5252556800842285
oh I am really stuck,0.40274813771247864

and it was very very strong,0.44121044874191284
the current was very very strong,0.4512641131877899
and she apparently couldnt get her out herself out,0.3369590640068054
and somebody must have seen her or knew that she was having a problem,0.3009645938873291
and they called the emergency group,0.4389602243900299

this is how Im reading it,0.3116515278816223
and his new wife had two girls,0.29313263297080994
and so it made three girls in the family now,0.28094860911369324
they werent very nice,0.3335478901863098
they didnt like Cinderella,0.3363030254840851

and the other two they would go to parties and and be with friends and everything,0.3995668888092041
and then allofasudden one day the mother got a letter and from the the princes its not a house the palace,0.33605384826660156
and they were invited to go to the ball that he was having,0.3082718849182129
and they told her that she couldnt go to that ball,0.29146289825439453
so they were getting all dressed up and everything,0.39808571338653564
and first she thought she was gonna go,0.2431630790233612
and then they said no that the she couldnt go,0.29395022988319397
so they got all dressed and ready to go,0.3375321924686432
and then,0.7074459791183472
and these little mice were friends of hers,0.34909868240356445
I think they were mice,0.4234369695186615

she got all dressed,0.393677294254303
she went to the ball,0.3188563287258148
and the prince saw her and liked her very much,0.3206547796726227
she was she looked beautiful and everything,0.38436099886894226
and the she knows she knew that if she didnt get back by noon twelve oclock eryth,0.20372989773750305
so allofasudden the clock rang for twelve,0.26863014698028564
and she realized shes gotta run,0.22450478374958038
and as she was running down the steps she lost her one shoe,0.2565184235572815
and it was the good the pretty shoe that she had on,0.293237566947937
and she got home,0.3414025902748108
and then allofasudden the prince was trying to find somebody who fits that shoe,0.2847791910171509
and they came to her house,0.37973976135253906
and the two stepsisters they thought,0.44679519534111023
so they tried and they tried so hard to squeeze their feet into this little shoe,0.3279058337211609
and it didnt work,0.32270345091819763
and it turned out that Cinderella was the last one left to try it,0.2719213366508484
and they teased her and everything you know that its no use of doing it,0.3056023418903351
but she did and it fit perfect,0.3460511863231659
and it end up that they fell in love,0.2820757031440735

oh ttu,0.9999998807907104
okay,0.9999999403953552
its fine,0.5224534273147583
its much better than I was,0.32005587220191956
youknow I can speak,0.38930216431617737
before I did not,0.477647066116333
no,0.9999999403953552
no not for two or three years,0.3012152910232544
I have a good speech therapist,0.3395024836063385
her name is JeanieLastname,0.3825424611568451
my first stroke,0.4029308557510376
Ive had two strokes didnt one on each side,0.22250491380691528
the first stroke,0.527527391910553
when did you have that one,0.46369197964668274
on in ninety four I think wait wait no two thousand four,0.26172107458114624
and I forgot family friends husband everybody,0.39081090688705444
I could I couldnt remember anybody,0.4754909574985504
I didnt know how to drive,0.3486802279949188
I started hitting cars because I thought I didnt know where I was going,0.33831587433815
I didnt even know how to start a car,0.2969281077384949
and maybe like three years then I was able to start driving,0.28299304842948914
and then my speech got better,0.3244735300540924
I still have I have some difficulties still with with numbers youknow,0.3846828043460846
but I can speak alot better than I useta be than I was,0.30317825078964233
well probably in the last year its gotten much better when I started at the aphasia,0.2601015567779541
before I was very youknow unsure not confident,0.3346432149410248
but youknow when I speak to people everybody talks to me I talk to them,0.3662521243095398
and you get a nice rapport with them and you feel better,0.34873253107070923
oh I speak English,0.3194170296192169
I useta speak Spanish,0.4273049533367157
no,0.9999999403953552
when I had my my first stroke I forgot all the Spanish because I needed to concentrate on the English,0.26235467195510864
so it just went,0.5129138231277466
I do a little Spanish now but its,0.29198020696640015
youknow I do try but sometimes it just doesnt come out proper,0.3596959710121155
if Im upset or something I start youknow the words dont come out,0.24233713746070862
I just get more flustered,0.41848835349082947
what else,0.6731131076812744
I think the saddest day was probably when my father passed away,0.2791421413421631
and that day I had gotten a raise from my job,0.23165263235569
and I was so depressed,0.3570229709148407
six months later I had my stroke,0.2944068908691406
and nobody really knows what happened,0.4494147300720215
because now Im heavy,0.3063594698905945
before I was very slim,0.31260010600090027
and before I was youknow I was very happy,0.2911028563976288
I was I would always be with my dad and my mom but theyre divorced,0.2737566828727722
but he was youknow the light of my life,0.2588035762310028
and so when he passed away I just couldnt take,0.30464622378349304
it it was just too much for me,0.3968693017959595
and then I had my first stroke,0.3220628499984741
and I then I would start thinking youknow,0.37166741490364075
now I cant because hes not here,0.3183048963546753
and I couldnt continue working,0.3402961790561676
youknow because what I useta I useta work at a legal office,0.2793646454811096
and I useta hafta read land leases or sell sites,0.21098290383815765
and,1.0
and I just couldnt read them especially when I had my first stroke,0.2983109652996063
I like I said I couldnt even read,0.39109835028648376
I still have trouble reading,0.46964508295059204
so it was just it was probably the worst times of my life,0.3146526515483856
the happiest time is probably when my husband bought me a dog a service dog,0.2505612075328827
and he is the light of my life,0.2990283966064453
he is great,0.36681050062179565
I love him,0.5588327646255493
he takes care of me and I take care of him,0.23641641438007355
hes a big GermanShepherd,0.31207209825515747

and the,0.7914137840270996
they were both youknow,0.39219793677330017
not really doing anything,0.6721738576889038
a fire,0.5771216154098511
oh no not a fire escape,0.2758917808532715
you just need,0.7031767964363098
just thats just too much information,0.4360623359680176
I didnt get that,0.3889905512332916
looks like flooding,0.5023334622383118
and someone is trying to grab,0.3071148097515106
was she wasnt she like she had a pumpkin,0.29381611943244934

www,1.0000001192092896
okay,0.9999999403953552
I think there was a stepmother and two sisters,0.30535632371902466
and I cant recall if there was also a third sister,0.1988220512866974
but the one that that were m,0.40816473960876465
they didnt look good,0.4037792980670929
the two girls,0.4357309341430664
however I dont know if it was a maid or a sister or a stepsister because they dont look the same,0.243068128824234
she was much prettier,0.36070987582206726
and she went,0.40431874990463257
and she hadta clean up everything for them,0.3842273950576782
take youknow handle the the trash the garbage the the the the animals,0.41237327456474304
and one day I think she was kindof down,0.3014689087867737
and she wanted to go to a ball,0.304801881313324
loandbehold though the step the stepmother and the two sisters were going to the ball,0.3674107789993286
and she was just youknow she wanted to youknow do something,0.3085407018661499
she was bored,0.45136675238609314
and so she was able to get a a dress,0.2796998918056488
and she also got,0.3490093946456909
there was a woman an older woman,0.3322460353374481
she she,0.9999998211860657
and sothat she can look like the belle of the ball,0.2481396645307541
and then she got it was not a pumpkin its just just it looks like a pumpkin,0.30260711908340454
and she went alone,0.37193870544433594
and when she went there she met a beautiful young man,0.302013099193573
they danced and danced and danced until twelve oclock,0.34435850381851196
twelve oclock youve got to come home,0.2552315890789032
so as she was she wanted to speak with the guy but she was running late,0.27865585684776306
she hadta hurry up,0.4089476466178894
so as she was running to the coach her shoe fell off,0.21860907971858978
and then he he wanted to find where that shoe was sothat she,0.33675462007522583
so there was a guy there that was showing all of the shoes to the sisters and the maid,0.2777504622936249
and they did not fit until she tried it,0.3372804820537567
and then,0.7074459791183472
and then they,0.6266072392463684
and that was happily ever after,0.3714641332626343
thats as much as I can remember,0.29732418060302734
okay,0.9999999403953552

anyways the horses are outof outof the barn by the time I said anything,0.19623102247714996
and I took the mris,0.32654672861099243
and youknow I went through speech therapy and youknow,0.2475925087928772
theres two other types of,0.3854708671569824
Im trying to think,0.3438336253166199
but those lasted a very short time,0.38840100169181824
but speech therapy youknow lasted like three or four months,0.23713332414627075
and finally my therapist said youknow,0.2611652612686157
and and youknow I was released,0.23797541856765747
and and pretty much youknow she was right,0.2930075526237488

I in my therapy youknow I I told,0.32535409927368164
and she tried to help me with with that,0.35159310698509216
and the only way I could I could really function I could I could I could use the cue cards,0.36236312985420227
or I could have written on paper youknow like like canned speech,0.26448091864585876
but I I I was not able to really talk youknow like one on one like youre you and I are doing right now,0.31517523527145386
youknow,1.0
just the best way I can describe things if if I was a thirty five rpm record youknow I was trying to talk to a seventy eight rpm record youknow,0.20659640431404114
I just couldnt get on the save,0.28840816020965576
and it its not quite so bad youknow individually but when I talk to a a bunch of people in a a noisy room and just youknow noise from all directions I just wanna be outof the outof the scene,0.21736201643943787
very much like downstairs,0.45304611325263977
its getting bigger,0.4816562831401825
well I have had many things happen but Ill tell you one that that involves my stroke xxx,0.29006558656692505
and my fiscal year ended October first youknow for my selling and stuff,0.1913316696882248
and anyways I said,0.3253490924835205
well May June July s,0.38236382603645325
I had like five months to go,0.2629462778568268
and I was I was I I had done all of my categories,0.2710035741329193
so I I I won a trip to CaroSprings,0.3083290755748749
and and I had a stroke,0.33370545506477356
and anyways my my wife,0.37051865458488464
but I took my oldest son,0.27194124460220337
and,1.0
and thats another thing,0.4391942620277405
I never useta cry,0.5557639002799988
but youknow its just something that they say that that added benefit or a loss whatever that came along with the stroke,0.3180669844150543
yeah its crazy yeah,0.42590582370758057
I can hear AmazingGrace at a funeral and,0.20423921942710876
dont ask me why,0.46193957328796387
because youknow Id be able to be cracking a joke for me or something during youknow youknow the playing of AmazingGrace,0.20298931002616882
but youknow it youknow its just very very awkward,0.3822321593761444
well it it happens too too often,0.4944911003112793
and youknow watching a tv show youknow,0.2544727623462677
it might be something stupid like the Bachelorette,0.3336920142173767
if I come in and my wifes watching a show and youknow if they have a little n snmlu,0.22640590369701385
and I dont like the show anyways but I just youknow I cant get over it youknow,0.2977118194103241
its its its really its very dumb,0.45115113258361816
well a a bunch of my female friends said,0.24274449050426483
whatever,0.9999998807907104
yup,1.0
so now you know,0.5960099697113037
alright,0.9999998807907104
alright,0.9999998807907104
well this comes right home to roost because I played soccer for for Umass,0.2682608664035797
and the first picture shows a a young guy playing soccer,0.3062728941440582
he kicks the ball,0.3730510473251343
and he must be too close to the house because he put the ball right through the window,0.3063599765300751
and as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed,0.26203399896621704
and he knocked the window,0.34174785017967224
so he did considerable damage I guess,0.35086631774902344
and the last picture shows the homeowner youknow holding the soccer ball and looking out the at the guy,0.27348607778549194
so I can only imagine what happened on the if the fifth picture if there was one,0.2867901027202606
well I guess it shows a woman and probably her son,0.28329670429229736
and he wants to go outside I guess,0.2947235107421875
and she says,0.37827277183532715
and hes he didnt wanna take it,0.23239479959011078
and she offered it to him twice I guess,0.30241310596466064
and he still didnt take it,0.29960405826568604
he goes outside,0.4023071527481079
and the third picture shows him getting drenched,0.2905910611152649
and the the fourth picture shows him getting drenched even worse youknow,0.25396159291267395
so he comes back inside soaking wet,0.360843688249588
and the mother says,0.42574840784072876
and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he shoulda had in the first place,0.28908294439315796
alright,0.9999998807907104
well evidently the cat climbed the tree,0.3324049413204193
and as cats are prone to do it couldnt get down from the tree,0.21950076520442963
and a homeowner or somebody youknow a male tried to get up the tree and he couldnt get the cat down either,0.22607234120368958
the girls crying for her cat,0.3126014769077301
oh the reason the guy cant get down is because his ladder fell down,0.19673587381839752
so hes stuck in the tree,0.22007349133491516
and the dog youknow bark,0.27252352237701416
so I guess we know why the cat is up in the tree,0.2413337230682373
and anyways way to the right it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy,0.2928420603275299
this this is this wanted,0.6159315705299377
yeah,1.0
well my son watched Cinderella quite often,0.25813594460487366
he he watches,0.5798007845878601
and I I mean over and over again not once or twice I mean,0.31367549300193787
forty fifty times yeah,0.44454675912857056
I know most of them yeah,0.30457890033721924
well I I watched so many movies with him Cinderella might might involve some other story too but,0.3131115436553955
it wont take long,0.32369324564933777
oh yeah,0.8460387587547302
www,1.0000001192092896
Im gonna give you my version and its gonna be very short,0.16899047791957855
I think she has two sisters maybe,0.315881609916687
and shes the least favorite of of of of the the three eventhough shes the youknow the knockout of the three,0.3117736876010895
her mothers even worse,0.48579245805740356
youknow I I compare her with the evil godmother,0.25527283549308777
anyways dont laugh,0.5274753570556641
anyways she wanted to go to the ball,0.3263790011405945
and she couldnt go to the ball,0.2546457052230835
but somehow she got it to go to the ball,0.3324403762817383
and anyways at at the ball there was a prince there,0.27746421098709106
and I think he had a slipper,0.28791314363479614
and he tried the slipper on the every every girl there,0.30993425846099854
and as luck would have it Cinderella youknow fit into the shoe,0.21138261258602142
and anyways I hope Im telling it right,0.3320954442024231
so I think youknow theyre happy ever after,0.3521497845649719
the end,0.6397038102149963
www,1.0000001192092896
thats pretty easy,0.42498716711997986
I would take the bread outof the icebox,0.2656609117984772
and I use only Arnolds whole grain breads because thats healthier for my son,0.2334371656179428
I can I can tell you this because Ive been making lunches for like six months now,0.28112083673477173
and every Tuesday he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.23962315917015076
but anyways I get him a whole piece of two pieces of whole grain bread,0.2761773467063904
lay them on the the,0.434927761554718
and on one I put the grape jelly,0.24725863337516785
he loves grape,0.3991226255893707
and then I put Skippy smooth spread on the other side,0.24727560579776764
and I,0.4510398507118225
and I cut him four pieces,0.28044092655181885
and then I have little bags that I youknow put it in,0.2945908010005951
and then I I close the the sandwich in the bag,0.29718801379203796
and Im ready to go,0.25175604224205017
yup,1.0
my speech is as Ive just said its probably youknow,0.21955086290836334
if if if the goal like in a range of one to ten with ten being youknow prior to my stroke it probably ranges from like a a three or four to a seven,0.22933505475521088
and depending on youknow how much sleep I had and youknow what I did the day before and youknow how I feel and youknow it can it can it can vary like I say youknow on the high side like of like a seven or youknow down as low as a three or four,0.19550812244415283
oh yeah,0.8460387587547302
my stroke occurred on a Sunday April third I think it was,0.19188915193080902
April third or April fourth in the afternoon,0.298928827047348
I was taking my son FirstnameK for a ride in the truck,0.20298931002616882
and sometime during the ride about youknow an hour ride I didnt I just didnt feel very good,0.21774208545684814
and when I say I I didnt feel good I didnt I didnt feel up to snuff,0.3189469873905182
and I I knew something was wrong but I was hoping it was just temporary,0.3509204089641571
so not to alarm my wife I didnt say anything to my wife the rest of Sunday,0.2133607715368271
and youknow that night I went to bed early,0.2514816224575043
and next mornings Monday,0.40346911549568176
I went to work youknow like normal,0.30208703875541687
and driving to work because my right side was affected,0.3491275906562805
I had a left side stroke so my right side was affected,0.28608736395835876
I kept drifting off the side of the road,0.30404964089393616
I got on the MassPike from Springfield to NewYork state,0.2202417403459549
and I kept going over the rumble strip,0.2969868779182434
and then I didnt I I knew I couldnt talk to anybody because they it like I I I knew it but just had something wrong with my speech and youknow my verbal thing,0.33363664150238037
so I I picked up some corn seed that I sold these two farmers,0.27967754006385803
and I got the corn seed on my truck,0.226232647895813
forty bags,0.5111687183380127
and then I came back,0.3963381052017212
and then I got off in Westfield,0.26344096660614014
and I drove down to Simsbury Connecticut,0.23594513535499573
and the same thing happened down there,0.404061883687973
I was going,0.4423221945762634
at that point I I figured somethings really youknow drastically wrong,0.37272101640701294
so I I went home,0.4381374716758728
and about two oclock I was home,0.23253847658634186
and I was sitting in the sunroom,0.2943173050880432
and the phone rang,0.37779927253723145
and I I was sitting like here,0.3518107533454895

and its delicious,0.5321770310401917
yep,1.0
mhm,0.0
I think it couldve been extended with the expansion of the words more than just twenty on the object and twenty subject its subject,0.28428685665130615
after awhile that gets a lil,0.28203248977661133
yeah atleast to me it did,0.37021011114120483
to others probably not,0.5703136920928955
knowing the depth of the group that you have,0.40477320551872253
but to me it got really p after awhile I got tireding,0.3220875561237335
bltu,0.0
so I like a small expansion with with xxx words wouldve been nice,0.23857372999191284
I dont know if you could do that with the group or with the coming group,0.28156542778015137
it would it be pkblu,0.5878701210021973
well it depends on probably where the person is,0.35790425539016724
where the where the person sits in that that group,0.443391352891922
if they if they reach a certain mark then Id Id then I said say,0.2993070185184479
if they dont they stay on the same words,0.2964172661304474
and they keep going through it youknow,0.341656357049942
and I doubt that that some of the people would would be able to take that kind of expansion,0.36888033151626587
it wouldve been putting an awful lot of pressure on them,0.23905611038208008
so that was good,0.42584699392318726
but it got a little boring towards the end,0.3512396812438965
I think it more severe at the beginning than it is now,0.2987837791442871
but yeah when you say,0.44627273082733154
it was true,0.4539843797683716
I would agree that that I dont fit into that group along that that line,0.3354388475418091
so,0.9999999403953552
oh yeah it definitely helped me,0.37092918157577515
I can speak now alot more fluent than I could at the beginning,0.25147098302841187
mhm,0.0
beginning middle and the end ohboy,0.5215680599212646
well here was little Johnny is off kicking the ball,0.25640609860420227
and he likes to kick the ball,0.2776830494403839
his father is a soccer player and so he gets a kick outof it,0.21375752985477448
and he gets his he sees the ball out there,0.2931172549724579
and he says,0.3578353226184845
he runs up and he whacks the ball,0.28954535722732544
he whacked it good too,0.3915310800075531
but unfortunately theres a window,0.39187610149383545

and they lived happy kvu,0.397480309009552
mhm,0.0
tell me how,0.529309093952179
well I havent done that lately,0.3764065206050873
but it is really the best thing going,0.43463200330734253
the what you do is you get the peanut butter and and and and jelly all together,0.30209627747535706
and you hafta kindof look at it and say,0.23621104657649994
okay Ive got myself a loaf of bread,0.2459913194179535
and Ive got a a firm and a and a a lighter loaf,0.30545490980148315
and Ill choose the firm though because the peanut butter is gonna be sticky and when you spread it,0.22809205949306488
especially with one hand left hand,0.47635501623153687
thats gonna tear the bread,0.23387247323989868
and so the lighter loaf cant do or youll end up with with your bread all ripped up,0.21845674514770508
so you take the thicker loaf and slice it down,0.2998674809932709
and slice it into two slices each about inch,0.2841687798500061
and took those and lay them down,0.36910557746887207
and take the peanut butter first,0.3299470543861389
and bread,0.601116955280304
and the bread wont tear,0.2310188114643097
that bread stays the same,0.41385841369628906
then you take the the the tlu,0.5186183452606201
oh its good tasting jelly,0.29710260033607483
so you dip,0.5303279757499695
and you spread,0.45303308963775635
and it is on top of the peanut butter because I guess because if you put that on first the jelly and then the peanut butter it would splatter all over,0.265300452709198
so you spread the peanut butter,0.3633807599544525
so you got a loaf s,0.29670727252960205
and you take your bare piece of bread thats thats thats thats thats not used,0.3096361458301544
and you pick it up and put that on top of the whole thing,0.2772592008113861
and itll press it down just enough that itll start the jelly falling of the edges,0.29254698753356934
and then you pick it up,0.3676702678203583
and you chomp it down,0.3557502329349518

and they were having they were having artwork there youknow,0.3896627128124237
and I talked and when I went in when I went in there alot of the e one of the women I actually knew her,0.22882860898971558
and t she she actually ran for a representative,0.2545073330402374
xxx she lost last year,0.2820022702217102
and she also writes books,0.3930830657482147
and Ive seen her talking about this,0.3036491870880127
she wrote a book about this this man that was in Worldwartwo,0.29753240942955017
and he he was caught in the baton s,0.24500973522663116
when somebody when they die,0.529463529586792
a march,0.5100870728492737
did I can I say that right,0.42587214708328247
and that man when I was young when I was eighteen he he would he he he he talked to me,0.368694931268692
and he said who he who his name was and everything like that,0.33082687854766846
and he told me that he was always in love with my art,0.24944734573364258
in Worldwar this is in Worldwartwo,0.4577018916606903
and but and he was he was his name was FirstnameP,0.40113770961761475
and he wasnt he was about as tall as I was,0.2567017674446106
and my aunt,0.3686181306838989
and he asked her to marry him,0.37065988779067993
and she said that no she wouldnt do it because she liked taller men,0.27992722392082214
but he would tell me about this,0.399620920419693
but this woman that I was talking Sunday that she tried to be a she tried to to run for as a representative,0.2701040208339691
and she and she lost,0.4242035746574402
she useta she useta be a writer for a representative in in Massachusetts,0.2763909697532654
when she was young she useta did,0.4424045979976654
this and anyway,0.45594799518585205
so I know I knew her,0.4989202916622162
so I talk to alot of these people,0.28158342838287354
and I was doing very well except I got to a word,0.2673617899417877
and I told them,0.33939826488494873
and she said nobody had any idea there was wrong with me talking until that until that time,0.29687854647636414
and so they were getting youknow it was it was eight it was six oclock,0.28148937225341797
they were all ready to everybody was all all done,0.4073626697063446
and I bought I bought the book,0.2870766222476959
and I was outside talking to this other man,0.3167974650859833
and he was probably our age,0.2874455153942108
I was Imean I was his age,0.3158262372016907
and he was he was h he was slender,0.37930068373680115
and he said that he had migraine headaches every two or three days,0.27289026975631714
and he said that he had extremely bad magrnu,0.33516478538513184
and he youknow and but he said,0.3230312764644623
Imean we shook hands and everything,0.3618220388889313
and he talked quite about what his problems that he has,0.3328534662723541
and he told me how he has he s he suffered from that,0.2659379541873932
and I had read recently that there were some new drugs that might help out people that have that,0.38488802313804626
and he said that he he saw a doctor,0.33056581020355225
and the doctor told him that it they gave him some of his drugs,0.2934654653072357
and it didnt do him any good whats what not xxx,0.29433631896972656
so that was so that was that,0.5119381546974182
so I so I guess my little bit of story is is I said this quite a bit before anybody knew there was anything wrong with me youknow,0.27621278166770935
I guess the and I my feeling is is that I dont think Im doing much better,0.28946253657341003
people will say boy Firstname sounds hes alot better,0.19933702051639557
and but Im afraid that Im not getting much better,0.31885284185409546
thats thats one of my,0.340842068195343
I think Im probably a little bit better than I was,0.3370008170604706
but I still dont think Im really really well,0.40223607420921326
youknow and Im always surprised when people tell me,0.27929696440696716
youknow because to me it sounds horrible to me,0.3848087191581726
this is how I feel about it,0.40768295526504517
is that because I I think that I was very good at at speaking,0.327646404504776
and I knew I knew so many different things,0.37239986658096313
and I was witty and things like that,0.31473851203918457
and so Im not h Im not depressed or anything like that,0.29166167974472046
and Im hoping Im going to do better,0.286984384059906
its just that I dont think Im doing that,0.3365000784397125
youknow okay,0.8054630756378174
actually I dont think Ive had any problems,0.3555203974246979
I think that I remember everything wonderfully,0.5582753419876099
and as a matter of fact I wanted to tell you about about,0.29777950048446655
I was with FirstnameG,0.3655826151371002
and I was driving,0.34511369466781616
I was driving a van,0.2895980477333069
and we were going at the HomeDepot,0.3246091604232788
youknow and for year for a long time I could not say HomeDepot,0.25228583812713623
so I I admit that Im alot of the words Im doing alot better than I than I was,0.24979938566684723
ke it took me maybe a month before I could say BaldwinHillRoad which is where I youknow where I live,0.2284514605998993
and I actually I was probably since I was like one year old I lived in the same in the same house,0.26962488889694214
so I actually knew knew how to say it,0.4340883791446686
so when I was with it was like our it was our it was eight sixteen two thousand thirteen August,0.24298395216464996
and I was driving,0.34511369466781616
it was about nine oclock at night,0.25600266456604004
and we had just left HomeDepot to buy,0.2956150770187378
I was actually she had an apartment in her in her,0.30528146028518677
the this lady who had lived there for twenty four years had died recently,0.27920660376548767
and we were fixing up her apartment,0.27842798829078674
and one of the things was that her the the bath had an old steel tub,0.2552904486656189
and we just bought a,0.3374941349029541
and Im good at finding deals,0.22414615750312805
and I found a nice a nice new tug,0.2703034579753876
and we were just bought it in my van,0.22680899500846863
and and so then we were gonna have a supper we were gonna go suppering now,0.24407456815242767
so I was on route I was on BostonRoad,0.29372042417526245
and I was driving,0.34511369466781616
and this is about nine oclock at night,0.23505337536334991
and she said,0.38078364729881287
she said,0.5303276181221008
and apparently what happened is that I had paralyzed,0.3759593963623047
I was i,0.5006795525550842
and on the she said that one of my eyes youknow I my I couldnt see on this side,0.21999923884868622
its like this whole whole side,0.4627265930175781
and I was driving,0.34511369466781616
I managed to get the van on the side of the road,0.2678645849227905
and it was right where we were going to the restaurant,0.334373414516449
and and then I would just hold onto the steel,0.3261682093143463
and and I was so I was really lucky that FirstnameG was with me youknow,0.28054097294807434
and and the other thing that was that worked out well is that there were there were there were doctors,0.399005651473999
and there were there was two nurses and a doctor that just happened to be driving their cars,0.30493420362472534
and they saw it what happened,0.3717402517795563
and everybody got out,0.4012104868888855
and they all got me we opened up the door,0.27212241291999817
and they got me down on the ground,0.3194342255592346
and and they called up,0.42042601108551025
what do you got that say it right,0.46020254492759705
it starts with the truck,0.3416106700897217
its its its not the right term for for the truck but they took her to and they took it to Baystate,0.31095772981643677
and while it when I was there,0.37578681111335754
and during this time I started losing the color,0.3309178650379181
I could I could still see my vision but it was like black and white,0.3159942328929901
we got to we got to Baystate and their emergency,0.3378143012523651
is it emergency,0.4375273883342743
well anyway y it it all came back to me,0.30594494938850403
the color all came back,0.3837144374847412
Imean I was on a diu,0.28098171949386597
what do you call it,0.5139119029045105
they carry people,0.5644145011901855
dizu,0.0
dizu,0.0
I was on that,0.3521689772605896
and they were taking me in on upstairs,0.2707561254501343
I think I probably took I dont know if I xrays or something like that,0.3761857748031616
or maybe it was like couldve been an mri or something perhaps,0.294369101524353
and then then I finally made,0.4703536033630371
it was almost like one oclock in the morning,0.2916835844516754
I was in youknow there was like a nurse a young nurse,0.2583655118942261
and FirstnameG was here,0.4156566858291626
and I wanted to I knew everything was happening,0.36085957288742065
youknow I was saying to myself,0.35223957896232605
I said,0.5259465575218201
and so I wanted to so then I wanted to I kept on trying to talk to FirstnameG about what was happening,0.3356858789920807
and I couldnt say anything,0.33996570110321045
and I said,0.32917967438697815
so they think that theres probably something alot worse than me,0.3831794559955597
because I think I understood everything that was happening during during this whole thing that was happening,0.4299716353416443
and so thats thats pretty good,0.3905754089355469
okay well I was I was at I was at Baystate,0.26927900314331055
and I was there for ke I think it was eight days,0.23536819219589233
and then it was very not very far away,0.3654065430164337
we went to Mercy,0.2841588854789734
and I was there for ten days,0.2616865336894989
and then I I was talking I was there they tried to seem,0.34024274349212646
they I said to her,0.38065674901008606
and I could do everything,0.4264041781425476
I had no trouble,0.409116268157959
youknow they they started off youknow trying to move my youknow youknow how I can move and stuff like that,0.28937575221061707
and and they actually after like two days they said,0.3530457317829132
so I was actually talking I talked to this this this woman that was the speech therapist,0.3509134352207184
and I talked with her for for like nine nine days I think,0.24795910716056824
and then the last day last day I was there I think the ninth day I think I they they had this group of people,0.2863885164260864
they had they had,0.652798056602478
that you would you would this one this one woman had I think you probably you probably knew her because she was from Umass,0.3841952085494995
and she was going at that time,0.32415151596069336
shes still going atleast almost a year,0.3081437945365906
she was going to be youknow helping at Umass,0.21950550377368927
so we had this group of people that suffered from from from speaking well,0.31401994824409485
and I listened to youknow I listened to what she was saying,0.30919408798217773
actually the whole group of e of people,0.36278635263442993
and apparently they do that every,0.47348248958587646
I dont know if they come every month or something,0.3417530655860901
and they they talk to people about that,0.47003984451293945
so and then and then after ten days I was there,0.3272770941257477
we c decided that we went to in Amherst,0.25916633009910583
and it was like rust,0.32261988520622253
and youknow what happened is that the speech therapist would come,0.3047773540019989
and she was there for like fifteen minutes,0.28309425711631775
and shed do the same kind of testing that youve been doing,0.295137494802475
and is is like the same thing,0.3666573762893677
and youknow it was like I had seen it,0.28191787004470825
and and the next day another speech therapist,0.3565194010734558
I think there was only a couple a couple of people,0.31077292561531067
and she started the whole thing all over again,0.3799484670162201
right,0.9999998211860657
and she wasnt here that long,0.2959370017051697
and then the next day this other person came again,0.37355682253837585
and we were doing the same thing,0.36402153968811035
but none of them,0.4109252095222473
it was only very short period of time youknow maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving,0.26200243830680847
and so I think FirstnameG and I we actually we actually went for a walk youknow because where she was isnt really that far away,0.28599756956100464
so in the center of town we went to dinner,0.24007238447666168
and we were talking,0.3961760401725769
and she was saying,0.391090989112854
oh the other thing is the speech therapist had been there for like thirteen years in the same place,0.26122236251831055
and she was and she was shes getting a new job,0.2875880002975464
she was gonna lose she was gonna leave,0.264950156211853
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks,0.29461437463760376
and now its getting youknow its the middle its the beginning,0.3881968855857849
so I when would it was I just had I had a birthday there that week,0.35036367177963257
and we were thinking that maybe we would stay,0.38609981536865234
and I was gonna stay with FirstnameP and FirstnameYs house,0.23261527717113495
I was gonna stay there,0.28201761841773987
because I think what happened is that we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse,0.2908935546875
the nurse,0.49776268005371094
and the thing is that that this,0.5175119638442993
and this is what,0.41173169016838074
they wanted to to youknow if I wanted to go to the to have my my bath and stuff like that,0.3196854591369629
they wanted to take me,0.46051284670829773
all of the people that worked there,0.4332902729511261
they youknow and when I was in in I was in Mercy all of the they let me do it all by myself,0.21328769624233246
and some of the nurses would let me do it at four oclock in the morning,0.2161308079957962
I could I could go all by myself,0.3590700030326843
I could I could they had like a room,0.4044761061668396
I could I could take all my clothes off,0.36845317482948303
I would Id take a nice bath,0.29142168164253235
Id put everything back,0.34734490513801575
and then I would even I I would like with my razor I would I would youknow I would I would,0.41274428367614746
what would you call that,0.5221471190452576
not my beard but I would cut my beard and things like that,0.3341270387172699
and I didnt have any problems when I was at Mercy,0.21383658051490784
no problems whatsoever,0.6083861589431763
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the NewYorkTimes,0.3092274069786072
thats basically the only thing I hadta try to read,0.3505156636238098
and I would say if I read something like one section of the NewYorkTimes it would probably take me maybe it would take me an hour just to read one one,0.29498547315597534
and then Id only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read youknow,0.2465500384569168
ofcourse if it was maybe if it was an newspaper that was easier to read I might do better,0.300232470035553
but it was still the NewYorkTimes and the i editorials and things like that,0.36140361428260803
I was having a hard time understanding it,0.3703317642211914
but I had an ideara,0.3862000107765198
so so so FirstnameG and I were going we were we were at we were having supper,0.3407633304595947
and she and and she said,0.4420294165611267
what she should do,0.4790746569633484
I said,0.5259465575218201
so then she tried to find people in in that area that would they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist,0.29795512557029724
and this one woman came,0.362762987613678
and I really I really I thought she was quite good,0.436311274766922
but youknow what happened,0.49014610052108765
I think they found one in Athol,0.29160305857658386
and then I started to drive too,0.3439094126224518
and if I could drive then you see you you couldnt have a person that would come to my house,0.35148122906684875
right,0.9999998211860657
so so what happened,0.6249243021011353
I really liked this woman the speech therapist,0.35467198491096497
but I hadta give her,0.42635470628738403
and she had all of the she had all of this she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could I could probably learn with this,0.31499776244163513
how do you say the right term,0.35302111506462097
we I started doing that,0.46579498052597046
youknow she would do things like writing a picture,0.3175661563873291
thered be pictures or something like that,0.37950798869132996
and wed be like,0.3030381202697754
youknow and the clock would be wed be on like a twelve,0.20341329276561737
and itd be on six,0.22195187211036682
and itd be on three,0.2447277456521988
it would be on youknow it would be on eight or something,0.2984703779220581
and I would hafta write write it down which one it was,0.2612006664276123
so that was how I started doing with the with the speech therapist,0.3005746304988861
but then I couldnt youknow I I couldnt drive,0.3852803111076355
youknow Id we we cant let her keep on coming,0.25065183639526367
and and she knew I could drive,0.31896457076072693
and its and Im gonna still Im gonna go Im going three times a week to see FirstnameE,0.1763520985841751
and,1.0
yeah okay so thats basically it,0.41400668025016785
okay,0.9999999403953552
oh,0.9999998807907104
and you remember you started you youknow you were starting to do some of the work with me,0.29894116520881653
and you had like pictures,0.37904849648475647
and I hadta ke try to say what the words were and stuff like that,0.2655147910118103
yeah I remember that,0.4944995641708374
I was remembering that,0.4465361535549164
and I was and I remembered that I was having a hard time to say what the words were,0.2883104681968689
and youknow and you in the beginning it was pretty easy,0.2659227252006531
and then ofcourse the words got more difficult,0.36194097995758057
and so Imean that was alot of the work that you did,0.2983611226081848
and I think the reason why you were involved that you were involved with that is that we were worried that we couldnt even find a speech therapist,0.31478816270828247
and I think thats how FirstnameY found you youknow,0.3118259906768799
and then we finally then we then we did find someone to go down to Athol,0.36490827798843384
so and then you were also telling telling me that because I had recently had that problem having trouble with with the what had happened in that part that my then I needed I needed everybody to ke to become,0.3216184377670288
what do you what did I hafta say what it,0.431743860244751
my my brain was was still needed to be get better,0.2993912398815155
I hadta get better before I could I could come over here to have to have you help,0.4041885733604431
so we waited,0.5352763533592224
we hadta wait,0.7024102807044983
so do I wanna tell,0.5234953761100769
you said you wanted another story,0.415748655796051
this is just a story about how I met you,0.32443833351135254
how I met you,0.4272436499595642
I thought that was pretty I thought that was pretty I thought that was very important that this was gonna help me,0.35354968905448914
okay,0.9999999403953552
yup,1.0
well this is a this is a boy,0.4088100790977478
and hes hes kicking a,0.27287474274635315
and I know what kind of like,0.3728671967983246
its a ball,0.4525374174118042
its a sklu,0.6520427465438843
and she,0.5627676844596863
and ofcourse what happened here is he he he kicked the the ball,0.29812750220298767
and he hit the a window,0.2980380952358246
maybe its his neighbor,0.34000420570373535
and or maybe it was his father,0.2970910668373108
I can call it his father,0.30624571442604065
his father is in the living room,0.3250393867492676
and hes sitting there,0.3385174572467804
and he actually kicked the ball,0.35196182131767273
and it went it went on the other side,0.3131351172924042
and it fruu,0.5415343046188354
and it actually hit I guess it hit the lamp the lamp too next to his perhaps to his father or a r a neighbor,0.22742700576782227
or maybe it was like a young man,0.29942017793655396
I dont know who it is thats here,0.3059917390346527
and youknow the problem over here is is that he he looks like hes standing up,0.24591439962387085
and this this fourth one is hard to tell exactly what this is,0.33774521946907043
whether,1.0000001192092896
this looks like this could be this could be,0.4788858890533447
whether this is like a a ball or whether this is his brain that got knocked outof it,0.27182111144065857
I dont know,0.538106381893158
this looks like its opened here,0.36534926295280457
I dont know what this is,0.39312663674354553
this doesnt this isnt very,0.38797351717948914
its hard to tell very much of this otherthan theres somebody standing up,0.2823237478733063
I dont know what that person is holding is holding onto,0.2736509144306183
if its sposta be that it could be this,0.45355165004730225
I dont know what it is,0.4011434018611908
okay,0.9999999403953552
thats all I can say,0.3307279944419861
mhm,0.0
okay,0.9999999403953552
I guess he wanted the,0.3929097056388855
this thats what the,0.49272674322128296
youknow I I,0.7467339038848877
the umbrella,0.6160403490066528
okay the umbrella,0.3727039098739624
finally I got to say umbrella,0.3035629689693451
the little boy wanted the umbrella,0.36261695623397827
and his mother had it,0.4047350585460663
the mother doesnt look very happy,0.29353904724121094
she doesnt actually its hard to tell anything about how she looks,0.3035011887550354
she changes over here,0.41062429547309875
so or he either that or he tried to grab it from her,0.2928350269794464
Im not sure,0.3635326027870178
because it looked like something happened,0.5488885641098022
the second he looks like well hes going to leave,0.2551693618297577
and shes gonna she still has the umbrella,0.2057971954345703
so heres the the little boy,0.3288939893245697
hes actually getting wet,0.3320985436439514
hes walking,0.3393159806728363
and hes getting wet,0.2741810083389282
and now hes really getting wet because its probably really coming out alot,0.3084700107574463
you can see right here,0.5443027019500732
its like this in pltu,0.39358457922935486
well hes a pool s,0.27750158309936523
pool s,0.5359686613082886
hes on this this pools on his shoes and stuff like that,0.2558930516242981
so hes back in his house,0.2683873474597931
and hes all covered with water,0.30678805708885193
and his mother she doesnt look like this was a great decision on her part,0.24457019567489624
she doesnt look happy,0.340781033039093
its hard to tell really but its kindof like the cartoon is,0.29367417097091675
its hard to tell what she really looks,0.33424174785614014
so I guess that she decided shell let him use the umbrella,0.2884176969528198
and its still really raining,0.4872357249259949
but he atleast hes dry with the umbrella,0.24539001286029816
yeah,1.0
well this is pretty funny,0.413705438375473
well this is a little girl who has a cat,0.3062751293182373
and the cat is up the tree,0.3017908036708832
and I dont know if she was driving,0.2627936601638794
she had her ci she was on a tricycle,0.276712030172348
so and heres a little the dog is up to is at the tree too,0.23584239184856415
and hes barking,0.3195672631263733
maybe thats what caused the the cat was afraid or something and went up there,0.2520888149738312
either that or theyre afraid of the sun,0.31381645798683167
Ive always said that as a joke,0.2748323678970337
so so heres the ladder,0.35407936573028564
now what it looks like the the maybe the ladder was up there,0.3152126669883728
and it fell over,0.3455508053302765
and so now the this is funny because now the this man maybe its maybe its her her father,0.299811989068985
because hes hes up there too,0.30453938245773315
hes hes lost,0.31635451316833496
he cant get down,0.29609453678131104
and so what happened over here,0.40737631916999817
a firemans over here,0.47858089208602905
and hes gonna perhaps hes gonna save both the his,0.18038474023342133
and then theres a a bird up here who probably enjoys this whole thing,0.31287434697151184
its not gonna run,0.26706045866012573
now Im xxx,0.3075006604194641
looks like its some looks like somebody draw a picture of a dog on here,0.2958347797393799
yeah not years and years ago,0.2740565538406372
nah I dont remember it,0.38109666109085083
sure,0.9999998807907104
www,1.0000001192092896
well the first page is its on the lefthand side,0.310112327337265
it looks like maybe its could be it could be their mother and their two daughters,0.30547797679901123
and they had like a little they had a little cat,0.3626634478569031
and the little cat,0.4015892446041107
they all look kindof like nervous to me,0.4094071388244629
they they didnt look like they were the little girl was the two little girls they look like they were dangerous people,0.3438446819782257
and the cat looked like it was somebody that,0.329216331243515
the the cat was like a funny looking cat too,0.2733008563518524
and on this side there was a like a little girl,0.3235223889350891
and she was very nice looking,0.32354313135147095
and Im not sure who this guys sposta be,0.2660859227180481
hes hes a man,0.33002912998199463
and hes got like a beard,0.23428338766098022
not a beard but what would you call that,0.4032362103462219
mustache,1.0000001192092896
and he seems like a nice person,0.3200581669807434
and he was inviting them to come into their house,0.3399823307991028
I dont know exactly what I could say about this whole thing,0.4329785108566284
if I was a little girl I bet you I could remember all the details on this alot better than I could right,0.29456472396850586
so so then I think what you you get to see this this castle from the distance,0.366940438747406
and I think theres this young young woman,0.33251428604125977
and she looks like she works there,0.37762489914894104
she probably works at the at the somebodys house,0.32906943559646606
and she probably hadta like her job was to ke clean,0.2563668489456177
and she was she was trying to help out,0.3148135244846344
she probably wasnt rich,0.3011206388473511
but I think they were looking,0.466943621635437
the the major part of the story I think Im gonna Im gonna Im gonna continue with this is that they were looking for a for a young for a young a young man handsome man who was gonna get married,0.17907847464084625
and they were and he was he was probably in the in the,0.3908281624317169
what do you call that place again,0.43208596110343933
I said it right but now Ive forgotten what to call it,0.35506683588027954
the castle,0.6482049226760864
they were gonna have like a dance there with music,0.27143192291259766
and and they had this glass shoe that they found the right one that would fit,0.36521250009536743
that would be his that would be his his wife,0.3920074701309204
so alotof people came to the to the castle,0.3074818551540375
and they had the they were dancing,0.44734448194503784
and and I think this this young woman who was very good looking she was like she hadta work there,0.3228332996368408
maybe it was her maybe it was the mother or something,0.33839789032936096
but she had her two daughters older daughters werent very attractive,0.2919239103794098
and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would somebody this handsome man was gonna marry her,0.2930506765842438
so so she was so mainly I think they went,0.3881664276123047
Im not calling it a dance,0.2718183994293213
I know Im sorry,0.4518071115016937
and Im trying to think who the who the who this this am this sweet lady whos like,0.25329864025115967
shes a magical person,0.3442242443561554
and shes gonna like,0.22590677440166473
so this this poor this u poor girl she needed to have a beautiful dress,0.3216368556022644
but I dont think she had anything,0.39605164527893066
but this,0.7422826290130615
what did they call it,0.4738624691963196
this this that woman that could make things happen,0.5203108787536621
I dont know what you call her,0.3962995111942291
but she wound up going to the going to the dance in this beautiful dress,0.3085593581199646
and and what had happened is that she was gonna at at the head of of twelve she hadta run back home again because she would all of that that magical dress and everything was gonna be was all gonna be gone,0.20485983788967133
and shes gonna have her her clothes that she just worked down in the in the cellar or in the floor or wherever she worked,0.22202034294605255
to go back to work,0.4613305330276489
so she was trying to run away from this beautiful man that wanted to marry her,0.28808823227882385
and she lost this the glass the glass shoe,0.3071480393409729
so she managed to make it,0.3849439024925232
youknow she ran away,0.320607990026474
she lost she lost that that that the magical shoe that she was wearing,0.3642607033252716
and so they what they did is they they hadta find all the all the different women that perhaps would wanna marry him,0.35735049843788147
if they had they hadta fit the right glass shoe,0.3248755931854248
and I think they kindof they had it they had that they had the that they had the shoe,0.4195041060447693
and they hadta decide,0.5373417735099792
everyone was gonna come and try to put it on,0.2398708462715149
and the only one that could put it on was the young woman that didnt have any money was poor,0.28033390641212463
and she put it on,0.30429378151893616
and then they decided that she was the one that was gonna that hes gonna gonna marry her,0.24425548315048218
I dont know,0.538106381893158
thats kindof like,0.48336148262023926
how would I would do it,0.5135425925254822
well the first thing I would have is a knife,0.29972127079963684
and I would have a a a plate,0.3762362003326416
and I would have some bread,0.4147367477416992
and depends on what it is,0.3115442097187042
if if the bread was never uh if it was it was whole youd hafta take a knife,0.2345353215932846
and youd hafta make two sights,0.20593459904193878
I dont know what youd call it,0.39001256227493286
when you when you have bread and you cut it into two pieces what do you call that,0.33942297101020813
anyway I have the this,0.4573332965373993
what Im gonna do is Im gonna have Im gonna open up the the,0.1949532926082611
see Im forgetting what the names of things are,0.2654947340488434
and then the peanuts,0.4377935528755188
and the and the the other one starts with an,0.4832485616207123
its kindof white,0.4291764497756958
and it looks like,0.4360806345939636
it starts with an fl,0.25720998644828796
and what you do is you put them together in the bread,0.299001544713974
and then you could cut it in the half or something like that,0.33758148550987244
and that would be your sandwich,0.36175215244293213
but I cant think of what you call that funny name,0.28685998916625977
that white thing that taste is probably tastes really good with the peanuts,0.37379008531570435
Im sorry,0.4229740798473358
yeah I was trying Im trying to think of what you,0.27947506308555603
slights,1.0
is that Im close to it,0.28859326243400574
the slight,0.7098417282104492
yeah,1.0
closer,0.9999998211860657
not exactly but slice slice,0.469655841588974
two thousand and one,0.5180706977844238
yeah,1.0
I was at work,0.30719873309135437
I was at work,0.30719873309135437
and people came down,0.37991201877593994
one of the women came down,0.34906429052352905
and she said she was talking that her husband called the telephone called him,0.31098082661628723
and one of the planes too,0.38536080718040466
one plane hit,0.46435248851776123
it was probably,0.5509053468704224
what was it,0.4844164252281189
it was eight fifty nine in the morning I think,0.277936726808548
and at first they thought it was like a small airplane,0.2921361029148102
and it hit the it it hit the Twintowers,0.37086135149002075
but then they realized it was really it was north and,0.4053971469402313
I think it was north and south,0.27754759788513184
is that the different towers,0.42661434412002563
and they thought that it really was a much bigger airplane,0.3855125606060028
and anyway her husband said that he had heard that maybe theyre,0.30622392892837524
this is later on that there was they were like,0.33660876750946045
all around the country the other buildings were gonna get hit,0.2699543237686157
and but basically we saw that there was really the the pntnu,0.41026124358177185
and the other plane,0.5493395328521729
and then this is this was a number of I think there were four four planes,0.28331470489501953
the other one people that were were riding got up and tried to like talk they got it to hit the ground,0.2871185839176178
and lemme think what else happened,0.3229964077472687
I think there was four planes,0.3223951458930969
and okay yeah,0.40339088439941406
so there were two there were there were there were there were two of the Twintowers,0.46037590503692627
two h two different planes hit that,0.3327305316925049
and and then the Pentagon hit,0.3864523470401764
and then the other plane they actually got it down,0.3990294933319092
and and the plane never hit anything,0.36066359281539917
it it hit the ground,0.42717650532722473
okay,0.9999999403953552
yeah,1.0
yeah,1.0
but it was funny because they thought that it was gonna that it was gonna,0.347085177898407
the her husband thought that it was gonna happen to alot more than that,0.263771653175354
where they where they got their information,0.463066965341568
they they they claimed that they could hear,0.5697128772735596
I dont know what they did but they claimed that it might go everywhere around the country,0.35387957096099854
but nothing yet we never ofcourse we realized that never happened,0.5274480581283569
yeah okay,0.8172538876533508
sure,0.9999998807907104
no this is a story,0.4001866281032562
like me to tell a story,0.31623464822769165
okay the boy hit a ball,0.2512604892253876
and he hit the the window,0.34587112069129944
and in the back actually it was his it was his house,0.3474200367927551
and inside the house it couldve been an an older man got hit by the ball,0.20723313093185425
it hit the the window on the outside,0.38807934522628784
and on the inside it went through the window,0.3743947744369507
and it hit the person that was sitting,0.34316885471343994
and and look like the person got up,0.3292417526245117
and he l hold the held the the ball,0.31499290466308594
and he was out looking at a big hole in the in the window,0.26535725593566895
and he was trying to see who actually hit him,0.2798742949962616
I dont know thats,0.3739173710346222
this is funny,0.4747687876224518
Im gonna call this a heavy carousel,0.20269933342933655
because if I took a little Ill if I if I spend more time Ill say what it is,0.27989041805267334
anyway itll come up to me,0.3507606089115143
I know what it is,0.4692920744419098
Ive been practicing,0.3808760643005371
where you were doing on the,0.35070621967315674
I was I was,0.5414456129074097
umbrella,1.0000001192092896
okay umbrella,0.5632932782173157
thats why I called it a heavy carousel,0.25464367866516113
I thought that was kindof funny,0.4321196377277374
I meant that I meant that to be funny,0.4275745451450348
okay so anyway Ive been talking about this and I havent really been looking at this,0.30496442317962646
sorry,0.9999999403953552
I dont know what this means,0.4432084560394287
is it its either the little boy was going to going to use that,0.31831419467926025
or either that or his,0.516014039516449
I guess,0.784920871257782
is he heading is he is he in the beginning of it is the little boy talking to his mother that he wanted to to use this,0.27155977487564087
or he either that either that or he wanted it,0.455727756023407
and she said,0.38078364729881287
Im Im not sure exactly how this is,0.3029504716396332
so the little the little boy is still looking at his mother,0.3057769238948822
and shes holding the the heavy parasol,0.37012654542922974
and anyway hes out the house,0.27619221806526184
and its raining already,0.5238297581672668
and now its really heavy rain,0.35107943415641785
and so he came back,0.35547953844070435
hes back to his house,0.30791527032852173
and hes covered with water,0.3081617057323456
and the rain was heavy,0.39263737201690674
and his mother didnt look like shes very happy,0.24971146881580353
and it doesnt say exactly what happened to the juslu,0.31608903408050537
but he has it now,0.44701749086380005
and hes back hes outside again,0.2978942394256592
and hes not get his hes not get hes not get his hes not hes not gonna on his head hes not gonna get hit by it,0.20085860788822174
and he so hell be drier,0.30526426434516907
I wasnt sure how how that worked with the mother whether she really wanted him to use it or she wanted to keep it,0.29562559723854065
Im not sure,0.3635326027870178
okay,0.9999999403953552
okay,0.9999999403953552
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
okay this is kindof a fun story,0.34666064381599426
this is like the so ke theres a theres like a little girl,0.2967756390571594
and she liked liked the the cat,0.31418377161026
theres also a dog,0.3198871612548828
now the dog could belong belong to to the the their family perhaps,0.37077078223228455
or it could be somebody elses neighbor,0.40088343620300293
and they had a dog,0.3374779224395752
and the dog actually skedu,0.457685649394989
and the dog,0.45585551857948303
and it was on the up there pretty high,0.28534996509552
so his,0.5156211256980896
and the little girl probably was driving,0.3658980131149292
I dont know what you call that it starts with a kl,0.2857946455478668
its like a,0.4373486340045929
anyways she she still she really liked the cat,0.403920441865921
so somebody,0.7333898544311523
it was either,0.48537859320640564
theres also a theres also a bird up here,0.3162004351615906
but I dont think that that that has anything involved with the cat,0.3382999897003174
I dont think the cat is afraid of the of the of the the the bird,0.28023281693458557
so you would think that the little girl if she was strong if she was older she could help lift up the ladder and put the father back on,0.26158955693244934
but she cant,0.378255695104599
and I dont know,0.36134567856788635
she doesnt look like shes involved that that she has a small a telephone,0.26492011547088623
and she could call up nineoneone or something sothat the fire people could come and put the ladder up and get his,0.27563151717185974
and then and she also shes not gonna they like w birds so theyll theyll they wont try to hurt the the bird either,0.23367281258106232
and they probably will get the,0.4252327084541321
ofcourse the thing that would be kindof fun,0.41031011939048767
if they were more interested in getting the cat theyd leave the father up there,0.27316588163375854
I dont know,0.538106381893158
thats my little story,0.36087119579315186
oh yeah I knew that was,0.3492487072944641
I I saw,0.5802710056304932
I saw it,0.43180516362190247
I saw it,0.43180516362190247
sure,0.9999998807907104
okay,0.9999999403953552
www,1.0000001192092896
my version,0.4115886986255646
well the first page these there are little girls,0.32445773482322693
and theres a h theres a mother,0.3246326148509979
and they had like a little a cat,0.3405015766620636
and the cat,0.4205080270767212
so those so and then on the second page I dont know if its her husband,0.22948363423347473
and theres like and theres another girl,0.34496670961380005
its possible that they that the mother had had three girls,0.3872373104095459
and the two of them were kindof her pals,0.292883038520813
and maybe they were twins,0.3548964560031891
Im not sure,0.3635326027870178
but they werent very attractive,0.3927123248577118
and the and the cat looked like it was alotof trouble too,0.26520493626594543
it had a kindof it was almost like their mother,0.3448246419429779
their mother didnt look like she was alotof fun either,0.22667436301708221
and maybe perhaps it was her husband,0.34945085644721985
and they had like a dog,0.3265950083732605
and the dog looked like a nice dog,0.3109573721885681
and little blonde girl was she was she was nice too,0.3219990134239197
and the husband perhaps it was the husband,0.3652207851409912
he seems like a nice person also,0.34098660945892334
and the mother and her two little twin girls and that little and the cat are just trouble,0.3357509970664978
so so whats happening,0.5005434155464172
theyre we can see that this happened in a much later period of time,0.2793178856372833
and the the the the three little girls got older,0.38842296600341797
and two of them werent very attractive,0.31301477551460266
and the mother was perhaps its her mother she much preferred the the two the two twin sisters that werent very attractive,0.3046678304672241
and so they actually if I remember correctly the they useta let the little the little the pretty little girl hadta do crappy work,0.3400258719921112
and she wasnt treated she much preferred the the twins if they were twins,0.2541595995426178
so and I think the mother the young the young girl the at one time she was a blonde,0.28128868341445923
I think her hair is u,0.28790047764778137
she was looking at a beautiful dress,0.2920135259628296
and she also looked out the window,0.33707812428474426
and she saw this beautiful place where the,0.35707902908325195
I hafta say how you call that right,0.33799296617507935
it starts with a cl,0.28952914476394653
its probably the head of the,0.492289274930954
if if there was like there was a town,0.3202981948852539
he is either something like the y the mayor or he was a important person,0.26813724637031555
he had like a young he had this this young man that perhaps was gonna be the king or something,0.28152015805244446
Im not sure exactly how you say it,0.40297389030456543
and its like,0.4870399832725525
Im having a really hard time calling what the name of that place was,0.2781541645526886
starts with a cl,0.3362582325935364
castle,1.0000001192092896
the castle,0.6482049226760864
they saw the castle,0.3814302086830139
okay,0.9999999403953552
so so were were setting up here,0.3890303075313568
we see the the young the the attractive young girl,0.37457576394081116
shes our nice she had youknow she had shes older,0.26904234290122986
she saw iz this very attractive dress,0.2698294222354889
and she looked out the window,0.34215185046195984
and she saw the castle,0.33823665976524353
and this would be a nice,0.3525942265987396
thats the area,0.41620558500289917
so then the mother got a letter claiming that there was gonna be a a big dance or a big area where people,0.24811556935310364
I dont think hes the king or whatever he is were all gonna take a look at this,0.19466514885425568
its gonna be around,0.22615161538124084
it must be its a important area because people were going to theyre gonna dance with this young man,0.248991921544075
theyre gonna have music,0.2622220814228058
theyre gonna have food perhaps,0.2842312753200531
it seems like a great time,0.42304837703704834
but the main reason was is that all those all those young girls all around the country they would decide which one the the kings young son was gonna marry,0.29096412658691406
hes gonna marry one of those women,0.19445335865020752
and so I also I if I remember correctly the the their the pretty girl couldnt really go to couldnt go to this this this this interesting plriu,0.32103607058525085
lemme see what you call it right,0.3815172016620636
so theres a rr magic grandmother,0.2846021354198456
and she decides that that the little that the young woman this young woman could could wear nice clothes,0.3590828776359558
she could wear nice clothes too,0.38649675250053406
youknow theres a beautiful white gown,0.26817721128463745
and she would go,0.3330810070037842
and she danced with the she danced with the young man who was gonna be the king in the future,0.25876548886299133
and they seem like this is the one,0.38134104013442993
and she had this there was a glassed,0.3249601125717163
and alotof different people tried to put that on,0.3035544157028198
and only one had the right the right feet that that would be able to wear the glass shoes,0.33585256338119507
and so the so they the young man was ofcourse quite happy,0.32838642597198486
and but the problem was is that things are gonna change at at twelve,0.23117458820343018
theres a midnight time,0.36911991238594055
and I think all of that,0.38913336396217346
I dont know if this story says it rr was correctly that that they were all in this beautiful place,0.2789214253425598
this this not a wagon,0.46977490186691284
Im not saying the right term of what this thing is,0.29267045855522156
but at twelve this thing that everybodys riding on turns into,0.3027184307575226
you cant ride in it nicely,0.2607918977737427
its,1.0
Im having a hard time when I was doing this,0.30836543440818787
I it starts with a,0.3324756622314453
that orange thing,0.5839489102363586
it starts with a pl,0.30819636583328247
and we were doing this when we were together,0.3869873881340027
I couldnt say it right,0.39963066577911377

its been its been awhile,0.5160800218582153
I hadnt been thinking about for up until recently a couple of days ago,0.21150125563144684
and I started thinking about everything else together,0.3997102379798889
now youknow the saying stuff again,0.346404492855072
and alotof it was coming back perfectly fine,0.287132203578949
and then some of the some of them Ive added,0.32832685112953186
Ive added that I really couldnt I wouldnt be able to do correctly,0.3360491394996643
but I think Ive done a little bit better,0.3960481584072113
like somethings planting youknow,0.4422317147254944
it has planting in the ground or something like that,0.36566078662872314
yeah,1.0
I dont know if theres anything else youd like me to say,0.3457483649253845
yeah,1.0
yes,0.9999998807907104
okay,0.9999999403953552
yeah,1.0
a young man is kicking a ball,0.3500543236732483
and hes really not looking where hes going to do it,0.3033815324306488
and it comes over to a neighbors window,0.3126218318939209
and the and the ball goes right through the window,0.4338243007659912
and the its hard to tell whether thats its an old its an older its a,0.27835613489151
it could be a elder a young a old an older man not an older man thats sitting in the sofa,0.23459939658641815
and the the ball just knocked over the lamp,0.3657541573047638
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp,0.32369115948677063
and and probably probably could hit the the third this third person here,0.37471306324005127
theyre sitting here,0.43393778800964355
so the the man stands up,0.3442012667655945
and hes picking up the ball,0.27074316143989563
and hes looking out the window to see who who probably threw it,0.24589037895202637
yeah,1.0
well this is an umbrella,0.3540489673614502
remember I couldnt even say umbrella,0.35637545585632324
so the mother mother is holding the umbrella,0.3474498391151428
and the little boy is is looking,0.33422601222991943
and she probably saying saying goodbye,0.4090195596218109
and she thinks,0.42730921506881714
he said,0.5283018350601196
but then hes out,0.3711124062538147
and hes,0.3284872770309448
you can see its even its even getting worse over here,0.3564496338367462
and he hes back,0.33227694034576416
comes so he runs back to his house,0.2845635712146759
and the mothers there,0.5289719700813293
and shes saying,0.313529908657074
theyre both looking,0.4436117708683014
hes soaking wet,0.3273141384124756
and the mothers looking at him,0.35163378715515137
and shes gonna probably give him the umbrella,0.2080729603767395
and hes going back,0.29834994673728943
I dont know where hes going,0.3085744082927704
hes probably going to school,0.3184381127357483
and he has an umbrella,0.2904178500175476
and now hes going back to school,0.2903195023536682
yup,1.0
and,1.0
yup,1.0
well the little girls looking at the at the,0.36370742321014404
theres a tree here,0.3814495801925659
and now this thing probably was start I think this was started that the dog was running after a cow,0.30804044008255005
and the cat ran up the tree into a a a,0.3075619041919708
how do I say this,0.47730326652526855
oh a breach,0.33977487683296204
Im doing two with and Im not saying it right,0.2474757581949234
anyway its the its part of the its part of the tree,0.4614187479019165
so this is where the cat eventually got up was up here,0.2791711688041687
so the little girl couldve been couldve been actually seeing the the dog a chasing the cat,0.29411762952804565
and but anyway she she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down,0.2734314501285553
she was probably riding a ic tricycle,0.29331716895103455
so the probably her father put the ladder up on the limb limb the limb and went up there,0.27102547883987427
and the and the ladder fell,0.46068891882896423
so the its pretty high up,0.3273533880710602
and the cats up there,0.3559294641017914
and the the man is way up high,0.3079606592655182
and he doesnt have a ladder,0.23422391712665558
and his and by the looks of it his actually his daughters more interested in the cat than than her father,0.2852228879928589
or thats or its a man perhaps,0.32456350326538086
and theres a bird on the in the tree also but I dont think theyre involved in,0.22234134376049042
yeah and I dont think theyre afraid the cat or anything like that,0.285950630903244
so the firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going to first take the the father down,0.3096747100353241
and then theyre gonna get the cat,0.24595679342746735
and the little girl will be happy,0.3108808100223541
and the the dog,0.5099004507064819
who knows whats gonna happen to the dog,0.23339258134365082
its gonna probably chase after her the cat again and find another tree,0.23170717060565948
I dont know,0.538106381893158
Cinderella,1.0
oh yes,0.7815017700195312
yup,1.0

okay,0.9999999403953552
on,1.0
and theyre not very attractive,0.4181019067764282
and theres a theres another girl whos a blonde and quite attractive,0.29097458720207214
same age,0.5778011083602905
but she hasta do things to ke do all the work,0.2708517014980316
and the I think that the the mother,0.4476342797279358
and Im not sure whether that the mother the attractive one is part is shes shes part of the family or one of a younger a younger woman,0.2515501379966736
well with with the with this mother,0.508695125579834
Im not sure how that works out,0.30979758501052856
theres a handsome man too,0.35323235392570496
Im not sure that thats her husband,0.2940121293067932
and youknow and maybe youknow thats the reason why he has those two the two the other two woman that arent very attractive,0.25626230239868164
so hes the the young the young lady is looking looking over the over the window out into the city and sees the the ss castle which Im sure that who whos probably the king of the of that area lives at the regular city,0.26281529664993286
and the the the people live in a regular in the the house regular house with the mother and the and the other the other three young women,0.4470422565937042
and two of them,0.4697997272014618

and itd be nice if he might if everybody in the city that are they get a letter,0.2606010437011719

and theyll they could actually meet the this young man coming up,0.3231671154499054
so the the young the young girl the blonde lady is like down in the has her own room,0.2532469630241394
or maybe it could be in the basement or something,0.3334403932094574
and shes looking at at a at the different ah the,0.2518521547317505
what do you call that,0.5146316289901733
the dress the dress is not apparently its not perfectly beautiful in the,0.35649439692497253
and the other the other,0.7202598452568054
so theyre going when theyre going to the party,0.3880164325237274

and shes shes going,0.313387393951416
and theyre not,0.44569307565689087
I think part of that Im missing whats happened,0.26917898654937744
well anyway what what happens is that the the the young the young girl talks to the magical grand grandmother,0.31499239802360535
I know Im not using it correctly,0.3560289740562439
and she she has a magical,0.3759552240371704
I cant think what did I call it,0.4039933383464813
anyway it turns her into a beautiful white dress,0.31062769889831543
and she also has the her shoes are made outof glass,0.2164008766412735
and shes dancing with a young with a handsome man,0.32336458563804626
and they seem like theyre getting along,0.3889896869659424
and ofcourse the the women the other the other children theyre probably adults now arent really that happy about the fact that she has a beautiful gown and and shes dancing and obviously the young gentleman prefers her,0.29523125290870667
and they also know that that that all of that the beautiful dress and everything like that that was given by the this magical grandmother,0.40397152304649353
I know Im not using this right,0.3499215841293335
knows that at twelve oclock everything will will change,0.2918437421321869
and shell hafta like shes gonna hafta run away,0.1533176302909851
so right she realizes that its almost twelve that e that evening,0.3446110785007477
and shes running away down the stairs,0.29402264952659607
and she lost the glass shoe,0.27250251173973083
and and all of the she had a castle,0.3509620428085327
not a castle,0.4302626848220825
well she,0.5883417725563049
Im having a difficult saying how this this young woman was riding,0.2931872606277466
but anyway at at o at twelve oclock everything goes back to its original what it was,0.19898511469364166
and so shes gone,0.285237580537796
shes back at the house,0.2765395939350128
and the king found this beautiful glass shoe,0.34196025133132935

and the everybodys really pleased about it,0.41708695888519287
and they realized that the the king,0.539451539516449
I guess hes a prince,0.31152066588401794

I just I just walked in the door and I knew that,0.32406508922576904
its not gonna be me,0.2533162832260132
okay,0.9999999403953552
well I think in the beginning there was the little girl,0.3223332166671753
she she really loved her cat,0.48704540729522705
and the cat went up the tree,0.29420006275177
no its not,0.4703775644302368
so she tried to get it down,0.3720720112323761
so then I think that was probably her father,0.4198533594608307
so shed say she said to the girl said to her father,0.2752735912799835
so the the the father took a ladder,0.35577109456062317
and he went up the tree,0.2939915060997009
and maybe this is why the cat went up there though,0.27094271779060364
I I guess the dog the dog caught the the cat up up up the tree,0.2731733024120331
so anyway the the ladder fell down,0.31705528497695923
and the the father was caught up there,0.3596537113189697
so and ofcourse years ago she would hafta go home and call and call up the fire the firemen to come but now she probably has a smartphone and she could call up the firemen,0.23863814771175385
and theyre gonna come back,0.2855002284049988
and theyre gonna get not only are they gonna get the her father,0.24666792154312134
theyre also theyre gonna get the cat,0.24834203720092773
and I think that theres a nice bird up here,0.2996489703655243
and the bird the the bird is is is just looking up there,0.3222651481628418
and its kindof like singing about,0.3794460892677307
I dont know what its gonna be singing about but shes gonna be happy about it,0.23709404468536377
I dont know,0.538106381893158
something like that,0.7015981674194336
I tried to start in the in the beginning and you could see it progress,0.3146919012069702
mhm,0.0
sure,0.9999998807907104
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
yup and,0.43262362480163574
www,1.0000001192092896
Im not good at telling this story,0.2641926109790802
in the beginning I guess it was like an old town probably in Europe,0.2431757003068924
and there were there was a mother with little girls,0.3659869134426117
and the and then there was a blonde girl who when she was young I dont know what she was doing but she useta help she was helping,0.2645055651664734
she didnt really do great work,0.3568717837333679
Imean she wasnt she wasnt part of the family,0.2316846251487732
and I think that the the mother with the the two girls,0.3861243724822998
and they had black hair,0.37726688385009766
and they werent very attractive and when they were young,0.3807119131088257
and the little girl when she was,0.3714498281478882
I think they were probably nine or ten,0.33413222432136536
and the little blonde girl looked she looked basically the same,0.33749863505363464
when she got older she still was very attractive but she did she was doing she was just doing work down in youknow down in,0.28490790724754333
she was doing work like washing clothes and and cleaning the house and things like that,0.36976802349090576
so anyway I Im not sure whether thats the king or the mayor or something thats gonna,0.24515528976917267
theyre sending a letter to everyone that they were gonna have a dance or,0.26967358589172363
I guess there was a castle in the background,0.2919047474861145
and they were invited to go to see the her son her her son who,0.27026093006134033
and Im not ofcourse when I even when I was young I dont remember this story youknow to be honest with you,0.2719675302505493
but I think that the the the young man wanted to get married,0.3260076344013214
whether he was I dont know if he was going to be the king in the future or whether he was just an important person young important person or something,0.26882678270339966
so they they they invited probably,0.583682656288147
I dont know if the people were probably had more money or something like that,0.3232148587703705
but the mother she was kindof an evil person,0.34728696942329407
and I think that the older those two little girls now that theyre older theyre I dont think that theyre theyre theyre not,0.3368690609931946
youknow theyre not wonderful people either I dont think,0.33805668354034424
so the the little the blonde the blonde girl she was looking at beautiful a dress,0.27673667669296265
no thats not a dress,0.3436100482940674
if Im saying now xxx term dress,0.23149694502353668
is that a dress,0.415263295173645
I guess its a dress,0.30234402418136597
pictures of it and stuff like that,0.3800000548362732
and she was thinking about she has the three mice and the the cat and the and the and the horse,0.3686601519584656
that was part of her jobs down in the youknow maybe its in a barn or something like that,0.22999268770217896
and so I think what got things alot better is that the fairy godmother helped her out when she went to the dance,0.2613486647605896
and so the there was a pumpkin turned into this,0.3051656484603882
so the the fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a,0.3137616813182831
I dont know what I could call that,0.41951921582221985
and the and the the the horse the I think maybe the three the three mice became theyre gonna carry this rri carriage,0.28831300139427185
xxx its a carriage,0.3401256203651428
they they they went to they went to the dance,0.44489991664886475
and she looked gorgeous,0.3608313202857971
she had she had a beautiful dress and she was a blonde and everything,0.3145654499530792
and she danced with the the prince,0.4191187620162964
and but what would happen at at at the at noon at the not noon at at twelve oclock the everything was gonna go was gonna return,0.21222910284996033
so the the three mice are gonna turn are gonna turn into theyre gonna theyre gonna go back to like mices,0.2226460874080658
and the the the other horse or something like that was,0.4029214084148407
theyre all gonna go back to the to the barn or something like that,0.2757447063922882
so she says,0.44929757714271545
she runs away,0.40434926748275757
and she had like a glass slipper,0.2866304814815521
and she and she was running away because it was gonna be right at at at,0.23271842300891876
I keep on saying noontime but its like twelve oclock,0.2320769876241684
she so so anyway the the king and his a,0.3438641428947449
it it it was actually one of his his like his like lieutenant or something like that went all around the city or the large town,0.2806013226509094
and she,0.5627676844596863
and the the prince was hoping if she,0.3408852219581604
so she,0.6509170532226562
and she actually found the the the blonde this,0.40474459528923035
I dont know if she was a maid or something,0.26775237917900085
she was doing that kind of work,0.34923794865608215
and she had a glass shoe that matches with the one that the the king or the re mayor something,0.30283474922180176
and they said,0.4319881200790405
and all the other women would try to put on the glass slipper,0.2923821806907654
and ofcourse youknow it would it wouldnt fit,0.31597378849983215
and especially the this evil mother and and her two daughters were not happy about it at all,0.3044615387916565
so then at the end she had the glass slipper,0.2772913873195648
and at the end you could see that the prince and that the blonde woman are gonna get married,0.22294265031814575
I was trying to do it,0.366033136844635
sure,0.9999998807907104
I think its its August,0.2606966197490692
and it was a Friday,0.2877822816371918
it was about eight fifty eight eight fifty nine,0.47692564129829407
it was almost nine oclock,0.3206241726875305
I was driving on the BostonRoad,0.3100651204586029
I was driving a nineteen ninety three Ford van,0.2440287321805954
we had just gone to a HomeDepot,0.3521977663040161
and and she brought,0.5077072381973267
a bathroom s,0.41000866889953613
a bathroom s,0.41000866889953613
it was made outof fiberglass,0.24171161651611328
and then I showed her a thirty foot long ladder that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less,0.25417178869247437
and then I started driving,0.3972534239292145
like I said on BostonRoad,0.3387782573699951
and I was going to Yuno,0.2677308917045593
and FirstnameG looked at me and she said,0.2635171413421631
and I wasnt going very fast anyway,0.27660179138183594
so I managed to ke not hit anything,0.2920120358467102
and I managed to turn right,0.37952762842178345
and I pulled off of the side of the road,0.3136691749095917
and I put on the brakes,0.2739812433719635
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that,0.29704177379608154
I was holding on to the wheel,0.27164986729621887
and then and that was that was,0.49310383200645447
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor,0.2509750723838806
and they all could see something was happening,0.40563973784446716
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground,0.2880755662918091
and then somebody somebody with a smartphone called up an ambulance,0.29378238320350647
and they said,0.4319881200790405
and after that I it took me a long time before I could say Bay BayState or something like that,0.2731010317802429
and youknow I was saying to myself I said,0.2997834384441376
and then I tried to say something to FirstnameG,0.3892059624195099
and then I couldnt say anything,0.3446131646633148
and then I couldnt say the right words,0.3046518564224243
Imean I knew what I could say but I couldnt say it,0.4380559027194977
and thats when I realized that that I probably had a stroke,0.37080416083335876
I think thats,0.428203821182251
have I said said that before,0.3981430232524872
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
uhhuh,0.0
uhhuh,0.0
well in the beginning theres a little girl,0.31405001878738403
and theres a cat,0.29719078540802
and I think that the little girl loves the cat,0.3193625807762146
its a good friend,0.36308375000953674
I dont know if its male or female,0.26397114992141724
and shed like she wanted to get have the the cat off of a tree,0.25058263540267944
its up on the on the trntu,0.4695264995098114
I cant say,0.42931753396987915
brntsu,0.0
brntszu,0.0
brntsu,0.0
okay so she asked her father if he could use a ladder and to go up to the tree and get the cat,0.2237331122159958
and then a ladder fell down,0.3425154387950897
maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get away to this far away as possible,0.26301029324531555
either that or the the dog wished the father hadnt fallen down the ladder,0.2927913963794708
so then theres a bird,0.3358433246612549
I dont know how what the the the bird is involved,0.26616281270980835
its gonna its its making a song perhaps,0.2559618651866913
and theres another ladder thats involved with the firemen,0.3469236493110657
and theyre trying to lift up the theyre gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his,0.24417367577552795
if the if the cat was more important ofcourse the the firemen would get the cat first and then the r the and then then then get the the father down,0.33665043115615845
is there anything else,0.47078192234039307
yup,1.0
yeah youknow I I,0.691851019859314
that thing about the grand that about the the grandmother,0.4593113660812378
Ive forgotten what I should call the right term to call the grandmother,0.2916417121887207
yeah yeah,1.0
oh I cant look at it,0.2665943503379822
okay,0.9999999403953552
www,1.0000001192092896
okay the version,0.31303170323371887
okay,0.9999999403953552
in the very beginning theres a mother,0.3510136008262634
there are two two daughters,0.44091320037841797
and Im not sure,0.28443679213523865
theres another woman young girl,0.38097822666168213
and shes a blonde,0.2754923105239868
and she has blue eyes,0.3223085105419159
and the the two the two daughters have dark hair,0.36551690101623535
and theyre young then,0.4143144190311432
and then then this continues in the future,0.47234559059143066
time is going on,0.3645195960998535
and the the girls are much older,0.3737713694572449
and the two two daughters are not very attractive,0.3693479895591736
and the blonde lady has her hairs now kindof light brown but her you can still see her blue eyes,0.2656364142894745
and shes,0.353868305683136
in the beginning I have no idea why that young the blonde girl is there,0.26328977942466736
whether shes an shes like,0.2902887463569641
something happened to their family and theyre just taking you theyre gonna live,0.31085270643234253
so anyway Im not sure about that,0.3903660178184509
so so anyway shes like her friends are all other mice,0.31713971495628357
and the cat seems kindof evil to me,0.29644325375556946
the cats alittle evil,0.37229815125465393
theres a horse theres a horse there,0.37476980686187744
there all these little there are three or four mice,0.3906223177909851
and the they realize that theres that theyre going to theres a theres a king,0.3511693775653839
and he has a son,0.3205549120903015
and they they n theyd like to have a dance because they would like to marry the the son whos probably a prince,0.28967198729515076
and so they invite everybody in the town,0.3142006993293762
I think,0.7252988815307617
or just people that have alotof money and youknow the,0.3025047481060028
so theres a litter,0.370177298784256
and they could they could go to a prawn,0.3803688883781433
not a prawn,0.4236757159233093
Im not using the right xxx,0.24562466144561768
a dance,0.6122758388519287
its gonna be a dance or something like that,0.2617151141166687
and the the on the brown haired the light brown haired blonde woman is like shes very excited too,0.25202563405036926
she could probably go herself,0.4332754909992218
and she had her her she has a gown,0.3716314435005188
its okay,0.37727200984954834
and theyre going to the dance that evening,0.39219245314598083
so thats gonna happen I think,0.34992334246635437
so then theres this theres this andau grand grand,0.36988022923469543
not a grand lady,0.3532833456993103
see the last time I said it I knew what her name was,0.2683343291282654
its kindof like,0.47851234674453735
and the first time I said it was a magical grandmother,0.284636914730072
but it isnt magical,0.3592087924480438
its something else,0.44672176241874695
and so anyway they said that with magic I could turn the the horse and the pumpkin,0.29529109597206116
I dont know,0.538106381893158
they didnt say anything about the pumpkin but I think I saw the movie a long time ago,0.24643155932426453
a pumpkin became a,0.4292480945587158
I dont know what they call that,0.4292454421520233
its not a truck,0.3517388701438904
anyway the the the mice are gonna be part of the on this group of people that are going to the dance,0.27731114625930786
and the horse is beautiful,0.36442840099334717

and she lost one of them one of the the glasses shoes,0.3163600564002991

and they realized that shes really gonna be a princess,0.27766647934913635
and and then,0.7399519085884094
and the other thing is is that Im confused about when she goes to the dance she has a kindof a white pink dress,0.241927370429039
but then shes at the the dance and shes got a much nicer its a gown perhaps,0.2237938493490219

and she really wanted to go,0.3687230944633484
and she was helped to go to the ball,0.28729113936424255
and she went and she met the prince,0.3354336619377136
and she was talking to him and dancing to,0.35522258281707764
everything was good,0.4403875768184662
but then it was time for her to leave,0.36002859473228455
and she was like,0.36246034502983093
and she left,0.42893174290657043
and she dropped her shoes,0.33795058727264404

and she,0.5627676844596863
and I wanna marry her,0.3123975992202759
and they found one of the,0.43937885761260986

and neither one of them could fit the shoes,0.338114857673645
the other one could fit the shoes,0.3855705261230469
and they p they lived happily in the after,0.3045346438884735
that was weird,0.40567779541015625
well Im Im supposing that my speech is getting alittle better as as time has gone by,0.20951969921588898
I think that I can especially when Im at the beginning of the day I think I can speak fairly well at certain times,0.26067066192626953
Ive been able in in in certain cases to discuss whole whole elaborate stories with with other people,0.29474496841430664
and and sometimes they dont work quite aswell,0.34587040543556213
sometimes I can I can get lost its talking to my brother or somebody like that and and just hafta give up and and and stop,0.25791749358177185
at other times I can just yack away with my my my natural bullship,0.2387123852968216
so sometimes I really feel like I can still talk myself perfectly well,0.44123008847236633
but then things foul foul get fouled and fouled up or they just start to getting snafuednv from time to time,0.30168044567108154
but periodically I can surprise people by sounding pretty normal,0.32467690110206604
it was actually very very charming,0.524681031703949
I I was I was just sitting around in my in my house,0.2970980703830719
not I wasnt feeling very well because Id been about had about ten ten ten days of not feeling particularly great,0.24652425944805145
and allofasudden every something seemed to be terribly wrong,0.3785058557987213
I said,0.5259465575218201
but first I I called the the ambulance immediately,0.34903207421302795
then I went and got myself a little valise and gathered all my things together,0.31608402729034424
and then I I I put a couple of things in my in my in my dresser like for example my wedding ring and stuff like that just to get to get them outof the outof the way,0.23759040236473083

and the the the the the emt looked at it,0.41167354583740234
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so and then I helped myself out to the place,0.36478564143180847

but I had nothing,0.5098850727081299

and and enjoying the the the the enjoying the the the amazingness of it of it as she was growing up,0.3897249102592468

I dont know,0.538106381893158
I cant I cant vouch for this one,0.28203389048576355

www,1.0000001192092896
oh I hafta look at this one first,0.2240384966135025
alright,0.9999998807907104
Cinderella is is is a stepsister of of two beastly creatures who are the the,0.2702171504497528
Cinderella is the the step stepchild of two beastly creatures who are living in this castle s,0.2338426560163498
and they treat her very badly,0.37673327326774597
and she hasta to do all kinds of terrible chores while they who do nothing at all completely are are sitting sitting around and scowling at poor Cinderella who hasta do all the shit work,0.23732203245162964
around that time,0.5881083011627197
notice the the how quickly this is gonna move,0.2793346643447876
outof that rtel point the the hideous the hideous epsis ep stepparents who are who are living in the house are are are are were br bro xxx were invited to to give a special a special feast for all of the the nasty all of these the all of these fabulous creatures that were living in this in the magical place,0.24627606570720673
now Cinderella really wouldve loved to go to to go to the to the,0.32290738821029663
Cinderella wouldve gladly come to with to be with all of the other creatures who got to be there in that wonderful place,0.2725863456726074
but she ofcourse was not allowed to come,0.3677923083305359
then her fairy godmother showed showed her a whole pile of Versace that she looked really good at,0.2496533840894699
and and and for a little bit of awhile she was allowed to go with these creatures while all kinds of of extraordinary kinds of extraordinary coachmen coachmen were riding through all of this place,0.2841205894947052
the n the prince who was necessarily unhappy with the scabrous looking women that were that were hanging around in his house decided that that that Cinderella was really much much more charming and wondrous than she had knew she had thought herself,0.28088194131851196
and so she,0.4683294892311096
but at that point the it became clear that the that the the the belle of the ball the the the the the,0.477901816368103
at that it,0.4581213593482971
try it again,0.5736497044563293
at that point it became clear that midnight was over and the magical creatures that were riding in her in her in her castle disappeared,0.28997039794921875
and then the the the horrible creatures that were living in the place looked around and said,0.38885343074798584
they they had no idea who looked so wonderful in this Versace,0.2842518389225006
when n and then at that point one of the the,0.3501145541667938
one of the the curt courtiers came out with with with creatures looking for real for some kind of for some kind of a of a a,0.32783520221710205
the the courtiers wanted to find Cinderella but they could not find her,0.343404084444046
so eventually the the two scabrous and in heinous creatures who looked looked around the the palace discovered that there that noone was available to them,0.3082837462425232
they said,0.5388923287391663
what whats that thing called,0.45416122674942017
the magical Versace that shes in,0.2915266454219818
and so they looked at her and said,0.3006729483604431
youknow that she is the one that we were all looking for,0.3095494508743286
and ofcourse the the scabrous and nasty creatures were horrified that Cinderella would wouldve been the other person that they were that they were looking for,0.34598463773727417
at that point the courtier ou brought Cinderella over,0.23260624706745148
and and she she just she was she got h massive amounts of money for the for the rest of her life because she got to stay with the prince,0.2650311589241028
is that good enough,0.49376240372657776
yes it,0.6954155564308167

jelly thats slobbed s,0.4221425950527191
and then lots of gooey peanut butter thats piled up,0.26163893938064575
and then I take the two the two and put them together and squeeze them,0.3638392388820648
and then I squeeze them together,0.4287552535533905
and then I I chop the the first of them out,0.3052774965763092
and I say,0.35546594858169556

I think I dropped my daughter,0.3925360143184662
and I I went home to SouthDeerfield,0.32892724871635437
and FirstnameP was there,0.4601311683654785
and I I we had things we were gonna do later in the day,0.23472578823566437
but allofasudden as I was driving I heard some chaos and commotion going off in the by the radio,0.24223105609416962
and I went down and and sat there and said,0.30018073320388794
and and then I went up to to FirstnameP who was getting dressed,0.29821380972862244
I said,0.5259465575218201
so I went out and we had a to the tv and and started looking at it,0.23886238038539886
once it once it started it was like you just hadta stop and look at it,0.35477790236473083
there was nsu,0.5452538728713989
and my managing editor at the Review who at that at that time was was living nearby came over too,0.21651718020439148
so the three of us just sat around and and watched,0.28585776686668396
but I think nothing else happened that day,0.47089114785194397
I think we just shut it all down and and just sat there and began to try to deal with it a little bit,0.2821599245071411
but it was an extraordinary day because that was when the the two towers fell down one after another,0.32541799545288086
and it was it was amazing to just sit there,0.30263376235961914
then one of them the the smoke would go over it and,0.3375883102416992
and Ive Ive spent I know what all that stuff is like and,0.28920960426330566
that was pretty much it,0.45956721901893616
I think we just sat there and and the three of us,0.2782919108867645
and we hadta just we had I hadta explain to her what how what happened,0.37947162985801697
that was tough,0.479749470949173
mhm,0.0
okay,0.9999999403953552
Otto was playing soccer and kicked the ball much harder than he expected,0.23661266267299652
the the ball broke the the the glass of MisterMcGregors house and kicked his and bumped his own his ball s,0.30815476179122925
at this point MisterMcGregor came out very angry and upset by the destruction of his property,0.2333441972732544
okay,0.9999999403953552
Patricia told her daughter to,0.34803733229637146
her her son,0.6834241151809692
I guess its a son,0.2617999315261841
Patricia told her son to make sure to get an umbrella today because it might very well rain,0.21908022463321686
however young Ants said,0.3114865720272064
so Ants was on his way to school when eventually he began seeing the dribble drops of the of the the rain as it proceeded,0.2428193837404251
infact the rain got very heavy,0.32977479696273804
and and he hadta return to his house where his his his,0.4478319585323334
whos she she,0.438046395778656
his when his i when his daughter,0.4328436851501465
then young Ants carried carried his carried himself with a nice umbrella to to get to school in the morning,0.24350321292877197
youre right,0.5140533447265625
yeah yeah thats it,0.4250597655773163
its true,0.5535374283790588
oh yeah this,0.5308610200881958
it was a terribly busy day here in in Woodbrook,0.22172637283802032
the cat was had had treedv itself in today in the in in the early afternoon,0.3592495322227478
and young Polly was trying very hard to to to get the cat treedv before it it tried to get even farther into the into the tree itself,0.27950969338417053
dad attempted to get the tree,0.25575608015060425
and he couldnt get out get the the he couldnt get the the the the tree,0.29846078157424927
he couldnt get the tree together for himself,0.26101869344711304
so here the there there was no point by of trying to get the ladder because dad just couldnt get it up,0.2571350932121277
and there it was,0.4008161425590515
the dog was ofcourse as dogs always do began to to bark and bark furiously which ofcourse made the cat even more perturbed,0.2479410469532013
by this time they hadta actually call a fireman to get the cat back,0.2831164598464966
and the the the thing had a a happy ending with a twittering bird,0.36870065331459045
oh yeah,0.8460387587547302
okay,0.9999999403953552
www,1.0000001192092896
once upon a time the children were astounded to see that there was a new child magically appearing from somewhere,0.30689647793769836
though where she was she she came from noone seemed to know,0.296894907951355
mother was very mom her her mother was very angry with that idea and thought well I suppose that Cinderella can simply be a servant this for her for herself and for her own two daughters,0.2790050804615021
and sure enough thats what Cinderella mostly did,0.30768001079559326
she s she mostly worked terribly,0.3158325254917145
and as she was and and the the other three daughters were ofcourse hideous and and and vicious,0.41549956798553467
and they they were of they were they they they they they really they didnt stay in the in the in they didnt sit stay in the in the,0.34428325295448303
its not the apartment,0.4573461413383484
anyway they they they had a quiet they had another spot a sortof servants quarters that they hadta hadta keep,0.3691437840461731
it was a it was a beautiful day,0.36525559425354004
there was a there was a you could see the the the kings castle look looking kindof twinkling in in everybodys eyes as as they looked besides,0.29088521003723145
but luckily there was something that that that helped Cinderella during this time,0.38362571597099304
mostly some rodents that that appeared n constantly in in in in what wouldve been I guess a very needed wouldve needed a a,0.26669153571128845
oops cant do it never mind,0.3428182303905487
lets forget that part,0.35319483280181885
and also there was a horse lying around and I think maybe a dog aswell,0.27710574865341187
at that point the two other daughters of of of their mother heard that there was going to be a special ball today presumably for the princes birthday or something like that,0.2813883423805237
and there Cinderella thought,0.4216107130050659
and she got she got the a little a little dress herself,0.336004376411438
and yet the two nasty daughters said,0.24801144003868103
shes a servant youknow,0.2692931592464447
and they are they were the hautesadj old bourgeoisiesn of the place,0.3791011571884155
so they said,0.49252068996429443
and there was just no no no point in in her being here,0.3053990602493286
fortunately for Cinderella who wouldve been no doubt weeping in for for the the misery of not being at the at the castle n Cinderella had a fairy godmothmother,0.21463081240653992
and she said,0.38078364729881287
I will get your I will get you a beautiful dress,0.36473557353019714
here comes trouble,0.5771737694740295
coach,0.9999999403953552
a magic coach that that that you can ride,0.34927135705947876
and sure enough there were also two beautiful horses that were not like the mangy old horses that Cinderella knew,0.27338263392448425
they move then to the the the beginning of the of the of the ball,0.48624545335769653
and allofasudden the the princes,0.6643420457839966
and she danced with him,0.3913169205188751
and they danced the the ball together happily for many time many hours,0.3268943130970001
however Cinderella also hadta stop because the in the in the at the at the at the croak,0.3641316592693329
no xxx,0.5163544416427612
at the at the croak,0.40791934728622437
and and so she hadta walk back from from the the the the the the she she had to walk she hadta drive back,0.33779528737068176
but allofasudden but at that point she also no longer had her beautiful gown,0.28786513209342957
at this point the the king,0.43462708592414856
this the the this the prince said to the king,0.4836297929286957
and they looked all around to try to to discover her but she they they couldnt or not readily,0.3644312024116516
eventually they came up to the to the the place where Cinderella,0.38792142271995544
no no sorry,0.659299373626709
where the the two nasty creatures that normally bat inhabited the place would would have their would have their their missing slipper,0.35963791608810425
and they tried each one,0.43226325511932373
and the these these nasty creatures were unable to to to to to fit with the were unable to to to to fit the slipper,0.38532164692878723
however Cinderella was,0.4509004056453705
and they were delighted to be able to discover her,0.3781293034553528
and they brought her back to the castle where she she eventually lived there and and married with the king,0.36051976680755615
that was sloppy work,0.3525237441062927
I shouldve done better with that really,0.4082731604576111
yes,0.9999998807907104
first I would I would get some bread,0.38810402154922485
and then I would probably get some butter and slop the bread out,0.34090763330459595
and then I would I would get some I would say probably jelly,0.3853873610496521
Id slop the the jelly in,0.23596109449863434
Id Id bring it all back,0.3159298300743103
then I will would cut the other portions of it,0.3286108076572418
then Id eat it up,0.32136523723602295
well I think that we were I was I was hoping that I would really just be able to get all of them all the time,0.34108254313468933
and I think we were close to being able to do that,0.3513539135456085
and maybe the little the little hiatus here has not has not been good because I should be thinking about this,0.3363649547100067
but somehow I I I really found that I could really do it again,0.5005399584770203
youknow Ive seen alot of that of those names and stuff so I didnt I didnt sit there thinking about it,0.23039643466472626
perhaps that wouldve been a good a good thing to do,0.347639262676239
because its really not that one doesnt know these things,0.4230699837207794
its more like just the its just like these are quick quick things that you hafta say quickly,0.3224093019962311
and and and it does just allofasudden something off something oh kindof physical xxx,0.3159295320510864
and thats it,0.4218387007713318
youknow you cant you cant really figure it out,0.35770776867866516
so so what did I think about that,0.5088601112365723
I dont know,0.538106381893158
Imean all of these games are kindof fun,0.33128175139427185
and and they they enable us I think to to see these these to see the the these pictures are moving around,0.37026914954185486
and I think from that point of view I think we can all imagine that as as as something that that is a kindof a logical set of motions,0.3060009479522705
but youknow its it seems like the the difficulties with seeing those individual names they that seemed like it was a big deal,0.3167066276073456
whereas sitting around working with the with with youknow with a couple of of of of games like,0.347017765045166
whats the name of that one again,0.3204846978187561
see I cant even tell you the names of them,0.2674802243709564
but even so I think there was we were making those things,0.4218655526638031
youknow it was it was like looking at the youknow from the from the from those,0.25636547803878784
its not my its not my day today,0.35339343547821045

somebody that they dont know before whos whos living there,0.2930430471897125

and she cant she cant be voi invited for the the rest of the the party,0.19742989540100098
so she goes over there,0.36564314365386963
and and suddenly shes been sitting around most of the time calling or talking to youknow barnyard animals which is what I guess you hafta just live with once youre if youre an orphan,0.20207050442695618
and and allofasudden they said,0.47626349329948425

nope its not working,0.3155440390110016
lets try it again,0.42890235781669617
Cinderella wanted to go to the to the the ball but she couldnt,0.2974984049797058
but now but with the,0.48550358414649963
whats the name of that fantastic creature,0.3352646827697754
with with this fantastic creature who will deliver give her this beautiful new new gown theres theres no reason to to to be worried about that because its gonna look absolutely beautiful for all time,0.25785142183303833
so there the the s,0.4023779630661011
I guess hes a king or or some such,0.2660766541957855
no hes a prince,0.31292617321014404
thats what it is,0.4360606372356415
ofcourse hes a prince,0.33039599657058716
and and allofasudden the the prince,0.6287142038345337
so but youknow when when the when its its time for the clock to to to get get,0.3187662363052368
but when the clock clock strikes then then Cinderella hasta hasta to run away before that comes,0.2745339274406433
so now theyre waiting on to see what happens,0.34468257427215576
who is this new Cinderella this strange and wondrous person that thats with us,0.30965372920036316
because weve never seen him,0.3738652467727661
so the the the prince says,0.40369081497192383
and and so they look first at the at Gonoral and then Ragen and said,0.3252471089363098
whereas suddenly when Cinderella is is shown they say,0.27882444858551025
and now she can go,0.2864457666873932
and youknow with Im assuming that assuming that they can get married immediately for all of this,0.28372204303741455
then the the the prince will be delighted with Cinderella,0.3589135706424713
and they will live happily ever after,0.36122724413871765
yes,0.9999998807907104
well that shouldnt be that difficult because Ive known been known to have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,0.265481173992157
first I get some bread,0.3694530129432678
then I get some peanut butter over here,0.37315836548805237
and then also its time to get some some,0.42241474986076355
its not butter,0.4315362572669983
its jelly,0.45314455032348633
now get the jelly out there xxx,0.29018014669418335
and then bring them back,0.5156087279319763
xxx,1.0
cut the cut them in in in half for for for daintiness,0.3204960823059082
xxx,1.0
oh,0.9999998807907104
mhm,0.0
thats an interesting question isnt it,0.3197702169418335
well it seemed it it probably presumably you could actually do this on on a on a less high tech,0.34158220887184143
but it is nice to have,0.376259446144104
and it it it has several different functions,0.4181936979293823
one is the,0.5101568698883057
what do you call that thing,0.5164972543716431
know yourself,0.7186570763587952
that the the thing we always talk to together,0.4352181553840637
the,0.9999997019767761
thats one one thing,0.516697347164154
then theres the stprwtu,0.43448570370674133
and theres the the the the the the basic media of the of the thing,0.5281074047088623
so it has alotof different uses I think,0.2888733148574829
so it I guess its its probably exactly what you need for your,0.38080132007598877
well Imean sure,0.5546138286590576
because youknow something got t got better here through the through the whole operation I think,0.31247183680534363
youknow it certainly seems thats that seems to be the case because I was really flailing there at the beginning,0.33254680037498474
and and then I flailed again when when I was trying not to look at the at the letters,0.2852657735347748
youknow just I would I would just push it,0.4868844151496887
so that and that seems to have been the second way to help help myself here,0.3728334903717041
is because then I I could get to the point where I could sortof write these things a little bit,0.34286147356033325
and and actually everyday this is getting a little better now,0.4237484931945801
Im still using the using the the whatchamacallit,0.3201744556427002
the the,0.9999993443489075
yes,0.9999998807907104
yeah the the Ipads great actually,0.3478500247001648
it works perfectly well,0.5214240550994873
and I do really like a Ipads as a as a genre,0.29080894589424133

dad would like to get the kitty back but cant get it get it,0.2919173538684845
and apparently also the ladder was no use in the in dad trying to get these things from the the child,0.2800236940383911
as if to make matters worth,0.35725200176239014
a birds twittering,0.4622463583946228

lets try to see,0.44499433040618896
a young orphan was brought to the house to live with two there where where two odious women were where two odious women were holding forth,0.30083489418029785
when they began at at the very beginning the Cinderella as her her name would would be known later was now just a a kind of a servant waiting waiting on these two women and their foul mother,0.23283006250858307
Cinderella noticed the the beautiful the beautiful,0.4322134256362915
try again,0.6580740213394165
Cinderella saw that the princes castle gleaming in the distance,0.3403083384037018
at last a party was was at last the party was,0.34581229090690613
the king had asked a party to be,0.31099480390548706
no I cant cant do this,0.4038141369819641
the king set a party,0.42321303486824036
it sent,0.44440221786499023
Ill try this again,0.3994078040122986
the king had had a had a party where the all of the the beautiful women could be could be known to the to the prince who would be who who would find himself a a find himself a r person,0.2955647110939026
where the the young prince could meet all of the other women that were around in the valley,0.36632677912712097
Cinderella would gladly have taken had had gone to that party except she was not allowed,0.3071931004524231
the two hideous women were all deck decked up looking their very best,0.28662532567977905
but Cinderella was not allowed to go,0.2891911566257477
at that point a fairy godmomother,0.3125033378601074
here the the two women who lived in in the house were were not very attractive,0.32871633768081665
and the prince was not much interested in them,0.350521445274353
but in turn in time he discovered that Cinderella was really quite charming and delightful,0.31447911262512207
and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit a bit longer,0.27922964096069336
but then came the stroke of midnight,0.35889744758605957
and she she got back her her her she got back to her her to her to her room and had a wonderful time,0.3708481788635254
the prince there would would still had not found the the the the the perfect woman that he adored,0.37212103605270386
so several people started looking around to see them and to decide which one was really Cinder was like n which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted,0.2826763391494751
one after another several of these terrible creatures proved that she could not she could not fill fit the the the she couldnt fit the the portions the the could not fit the,0.33251291513442993
lemme try it try it again,0.4391014575958252
all of the the other women in the castle were not were were too big and could not be could not be could not could not get the the the the the size of the of the of the shoe that they were trying to find,0.33571481704711914
but the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly,0.3427782356739044
at that point the the prince then was brought to the castle,0.37895476818084717
and they were married immediately and lived happily ever after,0.34344595670700073

lets see if I can do that,0.402268648147583
I think mostly what happened was that I was sitting around in a perfectly nice day,0.28716427087783813
and allofasudden everything seems screwed up,0.37836846709251404
so I called the I called the ambulance,0.30177193880081177

well Cinderella was was apparently adapted,0.39563220739364624
and so they they hadta they hadta to to work all the time and hadta to deal with the the the hideous sisters while they were they they were just having to having to to get to be her work person,0.3924439549446106
so at that point then there was a moment where the the prince wanted to meet all of the eligible women in in the in in the the the town,0.33495602011680603
and as Cinderella was thinking,0.33513545989990234
but they said,0.5177980065345764
only only the only these the terrible creatures that that were that were living in the house are the only ones that could really do this,0.4290264844894409
then there came a,0.44811201095581055
what do you call those creatures,0.4307252764701843
its a its a a magic personage,0.4697597920894623
a,1.0000001192092896
what do they call those e creatures,0.3495925962924957

she wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened,0.3077802062034607

and yet that was not to be the case,0.3932989537715912
then only and then only did Cinderella take all of her of her fancy clothes once again and sure enough was exactly the person that that they were hoping for,0.2975415289402008
then the prince went clomping back to the to the the whatever they are to all these to all of the the workers that they hafta deal with,0.35527217388153076

you would take the bread,0.4061047434806824
and split it or take it and take out two packet pieces of bread,0.2640206813812256
and then you would cover s you would take,0.37725865840911865
the first half would be of of would be peanut butter,0.26927781105041504
you would fold a half one,0.37320369482040405
you would put one ounce or one probably a case,0.35063979029655457
but anyways they you would put a y tablespoon of a peanut butter on one side,0.23263555765151978
then you would take a another half of jelly and put put pat that down into the l into,0.25283363461494446
youd peanut butter then the jelly,0.3340294063091278
then you ttu,0.7309631109237671
yes,0.9999998807907104
in one sense I found it difficult trying to remember the words,0.32557281851768494
I knew them,0.5324304103851318
I knew,0.6801437139511108
but I couldnt mem at first I could not remember,0.31511807441711426
I couldnt memorize them,0.4078032672405243
I I couldnt pull,0.4403325617313385
as we went on they didnt,0.2605293095111847
I wanna say they came came easy,0.3347609043121338
they didnt come easy,0.391376256942749
but they the more I did it the more the words came,0.35274478793144226
I was thinking about going over the words in my head,0.27138906717300415
and I found that I still retained almost seven eighty percent of what I had learned,0.27943116426467896
I hadta keep going back,0.4787505269050598
I the words I knew I hadta keep going back sometimes,0.3606609106063843
but did I feel it was helpful,0.3891507089138031
yes because I didnt realize how much I had learned Imean I or lost,0.3305055797100067
same thing,0.6272333264350891
I think that,0.6210982799530029
and I dont I know why youknow you have a time period to go over it and learn it,0.26605844497680664
I was because of moving and everything else I lost alotof time and repetition in it,0.2667922079563141
but I still kept alotof like I said I still kept alot of the words,0.26567819714546204
Im worried about losing more of the words because I dont have a booklet,0.21870183944702148
youknow I cant go back over them and over them and over them because theres nothing there in front of me,0.26035982370376587
so that makes me nervous,0.4104737341403961
but is the o program good,0.2727473974227905
yes,0.9999998807907104
especially for twits like me who who didnt have the time or energy energy the move anything,0.26225072145462036
you need to keep repeating it and repeating sothat you and then go on,0.3525694012641907
I I dont say I objected to it but I felt like if you give one through the for sixty words or eighty words,0.2596064507961273
you go through those,0.4443097710609436
I thought you should go through those say for three months,0.3080275356769562
and keep on those,0.4325066804885864
and add ten more words,0.2999532222747803
because I felt the repetition of two sets of words,0.28667423129081726
I dont know why but,0.4810278117656708
you go through the words,0.34587740898132324
ke in the end in the last even the last thirty days,0.32519203424453735
if you get through them and you feel like,0.4239412844181061
and while its not true obviously because you missed words for some reason I felt like the more that you did that the more youd catch on,0.3093937635421753
I dont know if its true or not but,0.34696704149246216

and they ended me in to do to operate on me which was like twenty hours late,0.21873560547828674
and by that time Id lost all use of my right leg,0.20859739184379578
and I remember I sortof remember going in and out,0.33315250277519226
I kept thinking,0.48500484228134155
and like to me in my head I was yelling at the nurse saying,0.2265474796295166
I didnt come out of it,0.26680129766464233
youd hafta ask my sister but atleast three or four days,0.18603995442390442
and I gather from my my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious,0.2730357050895691
and I woke up and was in a blitz blank out,0.19909869134426117

ten years youknow ten ten years right,0.3857981562614441
I had encephalitis ten years before,0.3344089090824127
and I hadta remember everything,0.4593709707260132
so its in my head,0.27990618348121643
but its how when you get it outof there so,0.35356560349464417
I had I had ke encephalitis for it was about a month,0.2379085272550583
I dont even remember anything about it,0.45000159740448
but I was in the but when I remember they got me to start up another time,0.3197150230407715
hadta remember how to remember how Ill talking about abck one two three noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff,0.2839876413345337
just remember how do you rewrite everything,0.527678370475769
just taking your time,0.5401533246040344
but its still in there,0.4644806683063507
and you cant just get it on there,0.3082573413848877
you might talk acouple times about it,0.40726837515830994
then youre talking about the decks,0.33597487211227417
and then you forgot about that one,0.40359899401664734
so its always kindof like that,0.48125961422920227
but you can still do it,0.510054886341095
so Im still writing and preposition and all that kind of stuff,0.31864088773727417
just sort of thing you can do,0.4167250692844391
just keep make sure its still doing than better than it was,0.3407908082008362
yeah oh its unbelievable yeah,0.39897477626800537
mostly hadta remember how to,0.4244425296783447
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get,0.3085215389728546
its funny how my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that,0.3081514835357666
I could go in the kitchen first,0.2669313848018646
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that,0.3360072374343872
the name,0.6037005186080933
I dont remember anything about it with my head,0.31560850143432617
I could sit there and making breakfast and stuff like that,0.34541502594947815
and shed say,0.3859912157058716
shed put toast and Id say,0.2268057018518448
but eggs,0.5968225002288818
but it takes time to get everything outof your head outta there so,0.30283617973327637
alotof its there,0.37605762481689453
but most of its just you cant get it outof my head on there,0.21943968534469604
its hard to come back around everything like that,0.40251973271369934
and also its also because when you talk to me doesnt get the same way coming back to me,0.2866184115409851
and its also kindof weird because if you talk to one person and me it kindof kills me,0.3093649446964264
but if you have another person here I can understand alot better with that,0.39427223801612854
but its depends depends on how its coming on to me yeah,0.24977797269821167
like I said I hadta remember doing abck one two three everything like that,0.38035324215888977
they took me at oh to books for the first year,0.19559484720230103
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that,0.2632450461387634
just trying to get back where it was,0.37813088297843933
I just write trying to just getting everything on there,0.43695563077926636
so its its like that,0.444268137216568
its just hard,0.46468386054039
you start getting little things starting through there,0.5208163261413574
but then I went to,0.4236074686050415
I dont know if you go to Chicago,0.3351297378540039
theres five weeks,0.33927568793296814
there we got back how to do different things around there,0.3893638253211975
how youre kindof think youre on this place I think then maybe a different one,0.3486066162586212
its like you had different places you get around there helped around,0.345548540353775
but so it does get outof there more than you can,0.35407400131225586
Imean the first time youre just going straight,0.3852076828479767
and its hard to get anything outof there,0.28528892993927
but I dont know,0.49381813406944275
is that did I tell you anything,0.41928303241729736
when I was little first time,0.4105096757411957
well it also can be that too for like I said for ten years its kindof I really hadta remember start everything,0.2885475754737854
so I did get a remember,0.3871650993824005
I did start up another time,0.37994688749313354
so it did help,0.4707706570625305
Imean my mom helped me,0.37379059195518494
and different places theyve they help everything about it,0.41210687160491943
but it is nice to get back up where you can go,0.3127681314945221
the bottom,0.6524242162704468
Imean it wasnt a real big deal because I couldnt go down,0.26866376399993896
I hadta go up,0.45188385248184204
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were,0.3473992943763733
so its been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that,0.3136942684650421
it helps alot better,0.4208323359489441
okay,0.9999999403953552
the boy was t outside with a with a soccer ball,0.26047128438949585
and he was kicking around,0.36833012104034424
and he kicked one really good,0.34925377368927
but it hit right in the middle of the window on the on the house there,0.3382532000541687
so the next one over there her,0.3606944978237152
gotta might have been sleeping and jumped out,0.27813029289245605
and the lamp broke down there too,0.30289462208747864
but you really cant tell on number four,0.2532801330089569
it looks like he is not very happy,0.3804883360862732
because he got his soccer ball,0.32616880536079407
but hes still looking out there,0.3721148371696472
and I think the the boy musta ran away,0.22957837581634521
he ran away,0.3835331201553345
so because hes still looking to see what hes doing,0.3264458477497101
okay,0.9999999403953552
looks like mom told,0.39511263370513916
and he said wellco he doesnt really want that,0.3031874895095825
so hes moving onto the next,0.2567436695098877
he says no big deal with the he doesnt the umbrella,0.21626853942871094
so he got outside,0.3830353617668152
and it rained,0.467060923576355
that was on number three,0.3801780045032501
hes over there raining on him,0.281412273645401
number four,0.7476634979248047
and its really raining him,0.41767096519470215
hes gotten water all over the place,0.27089402079582214
number five,0.7342643737792969
he finally came back,0.5080753564834595
and and he didnt look that very good,0.30433550477027893
and she didnt she told him its not very good and probably smarter that he didnt take it,0.26533839106559753
so next time hes gonna take the umbrella when it rains,0.22570094466209412
www,1.0000001192092896
it looks like her dad,0.3894999623298645
well mostly the the girl whos looking to find her cat up on top on the tree,0.22378234565258026
she wanted to get it there,0.4112452268600464
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder,0.25355207920074463
but it fell down,0.4209219217300415
so hes stuck up there the whole time,0.2855050265789032
the dogs kinda barking at him xxx,0.23233966529369354
really helping there,0.6375024318695068
but the firemen are coming over there,0.4218038320541382
theyve got another ladder,0.3297290802001953
theyre gonna help him back up,0.3112820088863373
but I dont understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree,0.22893713414669037
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat,0.2691764533519745
and the cat gets by itself anyway,0.25894618034362793
its just kindof,0.4848981499671936
yeah I dont know,0.49911198019981384
its probably about what it is I think,0.39524948596954346
so Im ready huh,0.30264225602149963
okay,0.9999999403953552
what it was she has shes not actually with the the people,0.3225860297679901
but theres two,0.38121944665908813
its not like theyre cousins or something like that,0.3454766869544983
theres two girls,0.3484342396259308
and were next by him and their mom,0.2921822667121887
theyre really bad ones and stuff like that or not very very not very hasu,0.4016325771808624
ofcourse shes not very good very good to her,0.3480795919895172
then she always hadta work outside and do all the the hard things,0.3804289698600769
and they dune,0.4410327672958374
theyve got enough money and doing whatever they could,0.4060516357421875
so they gave a time that they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the the money the,0.3328620493412018
Im trying to say something,0.32526063919067383
trying to say all the good people there,0.3958210349082947
they had to go see them,0.3813968598842621
and theres they got to play and music and stuff like that,0.3145934045314789
so she would never get to go there,0.3917785882949829
but I forget how,0.5304805040359497
somehow she got in here,0.3626934885978699
but she got to go,0.3528246283531189
say exactly,0.7047695517539978
it came that she had a very unbelievable great clothes and stuff like,0.33174988627433777
they took her sothat one one night where they got to see everyone,0.34070995450019836
and and actually it was the the guy who came to see her,0.2944295108318329
he was probably the best one there,0.38400089740753174
he was very nice and very the best thing he could,0.3149217367172241
and he really liked to see her,0.3278127908706665
but when it was done that time he,0.4403183162212372
so he,0.620046854019165
and so it was all done,0.3436061143875122
but the next day someone actually brought those to him,0.376214861869812
because it was his,0.4520951509475708
because the only ones that are big enough for him,0.38889357447624207
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that,0.32771825790405273
so it didnt work for them,0.35129907727241516
so it came to him,0.40664562582969666
they just told him,0.472593754529953
so it came on to him,0.3305014371871948
it goes to that,0.45658352971076965
Im not done yet,0.3363964855670929
the guy hes the the one guy that I saw,0.28046974539756775
the two sing with him and play and stuff like that,0.34681057929992676
thats where he was that night,0.36805281043052673
so he came back to make sure it was her,0.30147993564605713
so since its her hes taken with her,0.2649954855442047
so its going to be with her for all this all the time and stuff like that as much as it could be for him,0.3082661032676697
that tell you anything,0.5936355590820312
okay,0.9999999403953552
you should take a bread,0.4066537618637085
get some butter outof the refrigerator with a knife,0.27027517557144165
put some of those on the bread and also some of the,0.39932048320770264
theyre not peanuts exactly,0.4034973084926605
e closeby the peanuts,0.2816533148288727
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread,0.2908425033092499
so everything feels pretty good,0.5622807741165161
except for your hand probably gets all over the place,0.3568691909313202
but its a real easy one,0.37400051951408386
you can do it for about two minutes,0.2959934175014496
and thats a good one to eat if you if you you need to get something to eat,0.35223188996315
got enough,0.6289595365524292
pretty much,0.6420270204544067
something probably something to xxx,0.49749115109443665
I think you just youknow you just take the you took the butters,0.38011661171913147
the the peanuts,0.5439159274101257
thats not the same thing,0.4243607223033905
they sit in the its in the kitchen,0.3427797853946686
put on a bread,0.33282172679901123
and put it on a probably put it on a plate,0.3070205748081207
go over sit down on the on the table,0.32737740874290466
and have something to eat,0.3988376259803772
I guess thats it,0.44231948256492615
how it was,0.4422849118709564
mostly when I started,0.42890411615371704
I had a month I dont even remember anything about it,0.32543784379959106
but it was like ten days,0.3147470951080322
they finally got me in there to I finally started Imean I could actually talk or anything like that,0.3451906144618988
but I had to remember how to remember everything,0.4161451458930969
and were everything is gone back,0.3141123950481415
I mean everything about abck all that kind of stuff like that,0.43984827399253845
everybodys name,0.542659342288971
everybody the computer on there,0.42780402302742004
the the Coke sitting there,0.43932557106018066
everything,0.9999999403953552
the wrong about it,0.4372270107269287
you have nothing about it,0.5317671895027161
you hadta remember everything about it,0.5727270245552063
so we went to,0.40528616309165955
I had like thirty thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first,0.2724595367908478
and then we went to,0.40048179030418396
after that thats when we started to talk and to get in the sort of thing,0.2864309549331665
make sure Im forget something,0.36720263957977295
its ten years before,0.3934674561023712
but we did start ke abck one two three or something like that with my mom,0.25363630056381226
started to its in books,0.3381332457065582
I went there,0.4534209966659546
there is someone we got a talk over there,0.32954123616218567
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abck one two three and stuff like that,0.3414421081542969
and it took a long time,0.3276814818382263
it was about a year the start over that,0.3310967981815338
and Ive gone down,0.27127933502197266
it was Monday to Friday,0.33910396695137024
now its down Monday Wednesday Friday,0.40813541412353516
then after that theres a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks,0.26054269075393677
just try to talk alittle better and that,0.4315376877784729
because Imean at this time I could talk alittle better,0.3858063817024231
but it just hard to get back everything outof there,0.40746235847473145
so that helped different things about it for those six weeks,0.3391750156879425
and youre trying with computer,0.36519157886505127
or trying to try to write on there,0.3712403178215027
trying to do something about it get alittle better there,0.44607043266296387
and thats how they tried to,0.3824756443500519
after that they started IU,0.375934898853302
and thats when they started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that,0.3440205454826355
theres so much you couldnt remember anything about it,0.39614754915237427
but its you just take your time trying to,0.4127650260925293
me me and my mom my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that,0.31487229466438293
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things,0.4383048415184021
so it doesnt keep everything in there the whole time,0.32141605019569397
so you just gotta keep everything keep where youre getting things youre doing there and still be able to talk,0.3371082544326782
mostly taking my time,0.4159362018108368
so if I talk too much people have no idea what Im doing,0.346322238445282
and they talk to me real quick,0.35310861468315125
this is kindof weird because if one person talk,0.40560856461524963
if theres three people I can understand other people,0.34460723400115967
I can understand more of this,0.3700254559516907
but so it takes time getting around everything,0.46099209785461426
so so its just it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting alittle better,0.37960806488990784
I dont know how long I can go,0.37087371945381165
but its just it seems like Im still doing something with it,0.37191706895828247
so and it keeps going over time,0.3648211359977722
so so I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that,0.37663760781288147
and the and its my moms very helping,0.3541020154953003
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too,0.3197537958621979
they need to do something like that,0.5171722173690796
but I have my brothers too,0.41518351435661316
one of them Imean one I dont see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other,0.30019742250442505
so it just its not it as it used to be,0.3943469226360321
I knew alotof people and all that kind,0.3416498005390167
now Im kindof move down ke acouple people I knew and just take my time,0.2520911991596222
so its alot easy as how it was,0.2641403079032898
I dunno,0.6939623355865479
is that come around or,0.35818853974342346
xxx about it was like I said I had to remember everything,0.29620862007141113
Imean I wasnt really didnt get me out that bad because I said,0.31569647789001465
so you hadta restart everything to get back on there,0.40399792790412903
so you took your time and tried to get through it,0.3278299570083618
and Imean if youre going to yell at it its not gonna do anything for it,0.2500598132610321
so youre the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that,0.32586273550987244
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that,0.2893325984477997
Id be outside and doing stuff like that or youknow,0.2764812707901001
but it really doesnt bother me that much,0.46292537450790405
Imean I just take my time during the day,0.32838109135627747
ke Im Im gonna dry s,0.2252815216779709
and I might go outside and working on the a branch or something like that,0.31856995820999146
just keep going back and forth,0.41762420535087585
ke Id Id go get my aunt,0.29634174704551697
shes ninety seven,0.3424472212791443
I get her on almost every times for a week,0.27062126994132996
and maybe ke one day of the week and well see her,0.24249553680419922
but I get her on the phone every day,0.28628331422805786
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving,0.3672690987586975
and and its another way to get through to me and everybody else,0.35104671120643616
Imean alotof them cant understand what Im doing,0.29416996240615845
but alot I know they know everything about it,0.4638916850090027
so its easy about it so,0.42580628395080566
just anything youre telling me or,0.41618409752845764
I thought it was kindof totally different when I I I restarted here,0.4185735881328583
I hadta remember how to do everything,0.45674312114715576
which was it was kindof its alittle weird for every everybody too,0.3049505949020386
because Imean I knew right away my mom could ask me youknow what this was in the kitchen or something like that,0.276096373796463
yeah I knew how to make it,0.3683878481388092
I can make my breakfast and all that stuff,0.3379373550415039
she goes,0.5384528636932373
no cant remember,0.3704688847064972
like that,0.7194094657897949
I knew everything,0.5614733695983887
its all on my head like that,0.3188460171222687
Imean made my breakfast and youknow ke the eggs bacon microwave and the whatever ke things like that,0.22982856631278992
and always be there in the morning,0.37670037150382996
always my breakfast first,0.4023662805557251
people think Im weird,0.36593037843704224
but but but its just something that,0.624509334564209
it is another way I tried to keep doing what Im doing,0.30328837037086487
but it also is doing whatever I need to do,0.38083401322364807
Imean I hadta do everything like that anyway,0.5315558910369873
so it took some time on that,0.3590529263019562
and its it was a long time to do,0.29196324944496155
but you had just took your time and do whatever youre doing I think,0.3536195755004883
its I dont know how to,0.3196541666984558
youre not gonna too quick,0.3387545645236969
and you hafta do sometimes,0.3039361238479614
so you just kinda do whatever youre doing but then a little bit farther,0.4073517620563507
number one the the boy was sitting outside with a soccer ball,0.30038484930992126
and he kicked a good one there,0.32395437359809875
but it went over by the house over there went into the umbrella not the umbrella howabout the window,0.2961293160915375
went into the through inside there it look,0.377174437046051
theres a guy sitting in number third,0.25363075733184814
the soccer ball came in,0.35085269808769226
knocked out the lamp,0.3490463197231293
knocked him out too,0.4114404320716858
he was probably sleeping I think and scared him out pretty bad,0.3309345245361328
and then number four I gotta see what I can move around here,0.2581859827041626
hes over looking through the window to see who it was,0.24365302920341492
their probably probably ran away,0.38690894842147827
but hes not very happy somebody threw the soccer ball into the window there,0.24341422319412231
about it,0.6133817434310913
mom told the boy that she,0.3069390058517456
and she,0.5627676844596863
on number two,0.507996141910553
number three he went out there and it rained,0.29818999767303467
so hes walking,0.3309541940689087
and its raining more,0.5193765163421631
and hes getting his feet in there,0.2608325779438019
but he got all the way back,0.362267404794693
and shes not very happy with him,0.29577359557151794
moms very happy with him,0.32914936542510986
and he knows,0.38522905111312866
he had water all over the place,0.3534659445285797
but next time he changed and took the umbrella with him,0.28478479385375977
enough,0.9999999403953552
okay,0.9999999403953552
looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree,0.2603425681591034
which they could do anytime I think,0.4240663945674896
well I dont know,0.42683640122413635
they cant get everything but theyre they do to know to enough,0.39946818351745605
but the the girl shed like to get her cat back,0.29029420018196106
but so shes waiting there,0.3990505039691925
and her her dad decided he could go up there to help with that,0.28757810592651367
when he took the,0.4113629460334778
I know what it is,0.4692920744419098
lak lddu,0.9999998211860657
something close like that,0.5802346467971802
but he took it up the top,0.2888548970222473
and and it fell down,0.36457154154777527
so hes gonna have trouble anyway,0.29629337787628174
the cats too far away,0.32493042945861816
but hes stuck,0.32016071677207947
he cant get down,0.29609453678131104
the dogs kinda barking at him for no reason driving him nuts,0.24272245168685913
but but the firemen came in here,0.3997344970703125
theyre gonna help for him,0.2784239649772644
so theyre walking over this way,0.37898656725883484
so theyre walking,0.42488765716552734
and theyll get up here in a little bit,0.2781253159046173
theyll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him,0.31734901666641235
but the the birds happy,0.41134244203567505
theyre on the other place over there away from everyone else,0.3233906924724579
so theyre singing something like that,0.4331507682800293
but its pretty much about what it is unless theyre waiting on he gets down and the cat doesnt wanna come down,0.2280178815126419
did I get enough,0.4919074475765228
okay,0.9999999403953552
looks like for some reason they gave it seems like another cousin with them,0.3270729184150696
they gave her with her aunt,0.35226163268089294
so Im not sure why hes they send that way,0.30271005630493164
but anyway whoever gave it said thatd be nice,0.2951359450817108
well give it to you and stuff like that,0.3913130462169647
and theyll keep and and theyll make it good for you too,0.33038702607154846
but then the aunt,0.3925987780094147
she made her pretty bad,0.36259859800338745
she had to go work outside and and everything else,0.32499563694000244
and again shes certain s,0.3238896429538727
but her cousins,0.49076440930366516
they got to do whatever they wanted,0.4954749047756195
and theyre kindof a pain in the butt,0.26887816190719604
but so thats how it was for all the time,0.34147852659225464
she tried to be nice,0.3069555163383484
but they were still not very nice,0.4657905697822571
but the one time they were gonna have they were,0.35143041610717773
I guess they do for the sometime the year they get to see everybody,0.3261844515800476
so they went to see if this would be see,0.3759140372276306
their their aunt,0.5100106596946716
so theyre gonna go there to play or play or sing that night and stuff like that,0.26917126774787903
but their cousin,0.41291818022727966
but a what would you say itd be,0.3514329791069031
not a ghost or some I dont know what,0.32589611411094666
they had one they would bring on the way,0.38242053985595703
thats not normal how the people and stuff like that,0.3819396495819092
this was totally different,0.4685337543487549
how they,0.720694363117218
but they,0.7829024791717529
so she could go on that way,0.35272690653800964
so she got to go in that place,0.28928959369659424
then went to see there to that night,0.3870965838432312
got up,0.6016761064529419
she could go sing and play or was out there,0.2615004777908325
got some people,0.4968779981136322
and thats where they saw the big,0.32232460379600525
its one of the,0.5558828115463257
I think hes,0.3723539710044861
I dont know if he is the king,0.26976001262664795
or he might be just the new king coming there,0.3352670669555664
he was out there,0.39468371868133545
he was with her for a while,0.3531355559825897
but then she hadta leave,0.5253753662109375
and he is worried what happened her,0.30422118306159973
but she left,0.510261058807373
and he was worried about that,0.36777400970458984
but she did drop one of her shoes,0.2633172273635864
so he had that,0.48502928018569946
so they went back,0.46287649869918823
she was going back her place where she was just n not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff,0.28076815605163574
but her cousins,0.49076440930366516
and they put them on there,0.401658833026886
and her feet are huge,0.27745383977890015
so it wasnt gonna work on that,0.2414637953042984
but then while theyre there they did he did bring them over to her,0.3646615147590637
and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes,0.2296491265296936
so he knew what it was,0.42360442876815796
so he took her back,0.3737775385379791
and thats one of the great or the best thing you could ever do,0.32617050409317017
she went back,0.4928169846534729
shes shes like a queen now,0.2861534059047699
so best thing that came on that way,0.3856397867202759
so enough,0.8155245184898376
okay,0.9999999403953552
you I would take two the bread,0.32820260524749756
put it on on top of plate,0.2858971059322357
I got some butter,0.4323026239871979
and I really cant say what it was,0.2908668518066406
its in the,0.6342347264289856
well I took one of those out,0.28294825553894043
so you take the knife and and just lot s,0.2953081429004669
so you could flip both sides so comes in in the middle there,0.2940724492073059
Ill take the knife and go wipe it off put it in the dishes something like that,0.2433452159166336
usually get something to drink,0.45751500129699707
Coke mostly,0.49331170320510864
but go sit down on,0.3420620858669281
and just in in your hands,0.3866088390350342
and you got your got the sandwich,0.32645121216773987
and should be pretty good,0.39779946208000183
my speech,0.5185787677764893
I think its alot better than what it what it was,0.34439414739608765
and Im hoping that it gets better,0.296832799911499
actually Im hoping that it that it gets back to where it was,0.36183202266693115
yes but to be honest with you I if if if what youre asking is I think that I didnt exactly understand what had all happened youknow,0.34224459528923035
and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and alot of it,0.29076841473579407
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were were were kindof funny or werent making sense,0.2688022255897522
so I I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand,0.42077621817588806
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would remember everything,0.36254051327705383
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought,0.34509408473968506
there I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset not upset sad sad,0.3498845100402832
and then but then,0.6470662355422974
anyway sorry,0.7632090449333191
well most of the time Ive been pretty happy sorry because Im very fortunate that Im still here and have a second time to be alive and be with people that I I care about,0.265532910823822
but its just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything,0.484947144985199
I was I was home when it happened,0.38263779878616333
and I it just really hurt,0.4602234661579132
for me it was on my left side,0.24250972270965576
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down,0.32669129967689514
but right away I could tell something wasnt right,0.35351496934890747
and then I my wife realized more stuff that was going on,0.28280532360076904
and she was able to ask me es quite a few questions,0.20542925596237183
and after a few questions she could realize I wasnt making sense,0.253042995929718
so I guess thats the answer,0.3476068079471588
sure alot,0.5554842948913574
Im trying to think where to start,0.33068007230758667
from the time that I was at the,0.3339787423610687
I cant even think what its called,0.2781338095664978
where was I at,0.3383024036884308
after the stroke happened at first,0.37595775723457336
yeah icu and then the,0.3072257936000824
did it,0.6363883018493652
where I was for awhile,0.3460512161254883
yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me,0.30863672494888306
yeah rehab thats the one,0.27294036746025085
its hard for me to answer when I cant think how to say it,0.28340810537338257
rehab,1.000000238418579
and they were helping me,0.3881709575653076
and they they were very kind,0.47807610034942627
and my wife was wonderful,0.28795066475868225
and they were just telling me things that gave me it gave me alotof hope that they realized I was pretty much I was alittle weak,0.31330612301826477
but I was physically able to walk around and do alot,0.270494282245636
and that remember I told yesterday I could remember alotof like well how to play a guitar and kindof singing,0.2576351463794708
although I guess you would know how this stuff means,0.453582763671875
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was,0.28623270988464355
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something,0.3103600740432739
but that gave me alotof hope,0.3128312826156616
and then I got back home,0.37925660610198975
and Ive worked with a whole lot of things,0.26603537797927856
Ill show you one of them,0.29336392879486084
xxx,1.0
here it is,0.4959307312965393
one of these things,0.484150230884552
so not every day but for alotof days I just go back,0.31784242391586304
and I look at this,0.3014487028121948
and I started going backwards just to try to read it,0.36109432578086853
youknow dog and cat,0.36341148614883423
so theres a whole bunch of these things that they had,0.33180898427963257
and then some of those in the other room that I cant always get a hold of but I I managed to get a hold of these,0.25496867299079895
I usually I can usually get them,0.4501039981842041
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something,0.3016315996646881
and when I started playing,0.38050606846809387
is it okay if I keep blabbing for a minute,0.25111645460128784
this is actually I guess my wife can tell me I I kinda blab,0.3544003963470459
so I dont mean to be that way,0.38182544708251953
but youknow I guess she realized soon,0.422533243894577
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing,0.319791704416275
and after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with older people,0.34748730063438416
and then it made me think more about that after something I was going through,0.33781591057777405
and I really wanted to to just sing,0.42625999450683594
I I I realized that I missed that,0.5463618636131287
so we were talking about me doing that,0.4065665006637573
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened,0.28977149724960327
somehow one of them got got missed,0.35525941848754883
and so it was about a month I guess later,0.2617221772670746
yeah yeah July,0.43860000371932983
one well Im forgot to say it,0.2628468871116638
bottom line is one of them called not long before,0.28385308384895325
ohmygosh youknow we didnt tell him s,0.2929363250732422
and so I still said,0.3698805272579193
so I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs,0.2723309099674225
and I I did it,0.42664965987205505
and I was nervous,0.3270271122455597
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to to start doing it again,0.3270377218723297
and I did a whole lot of shows again,0.26532647013664246
and I think that really helped me because it it started remembering and alotof that,0.38442039489746094
so I guess thats the answer to alotof it,0.30768001079559326
yeah and I was feeling so good,0.3262404799461365
I I musta done a hundred shows at least,0.2515040636062622
she could tell you,0.462205708026886
there was a ton of them I did,0.2469295710325241
and pretty much not having any problems,0.4229446351528168
but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing,0.2856479287147522
and I was singing all not making sense,0.3240557909011841
and that just destroyed me,0.40210655331611633
Imean I just that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I I was back,0.35044369101524353
and then that happened and the next thing I knew were going to the hospital,0.33094072341918945
and I just couldnt believe it,0.3893020749092102
I just I just said,0.583648145198822
and that was that was probably the worst,0.4287392497062683
but then came back around again,0.489206463098526
so I was doing better again,0.3987939655780792
and then allofasudden Covid came in,0.33254319429397583
so since its been so many weird things in my life becauseof just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything,0.28804314136505127
and then thats come along,0.3804129958152771
and its just every were all going through that,0.4138264060020447
kindof figure out whats whats all gonna happen,0.3051905035972595
and how are people and etcetera and,0.4105425775051117
so yeah its been really really crazy,0.39034080505371094
ohmygosh so many,0.6303112506866455
I dont know where to start with that,0.3217642903327942
I I can only tell just just the one huh,0.3610326647758484
well I would talk about my wife and I getting getting getting married,0.3176571726799011
I guess thats pretty obvious that I would say that,0.42704498767852783
gosh Imean Im trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more,0.31660735607147217
I got I forgot a little what you asked me,0.4083811044692993
but this might be part of it too,0.38362058997154236
we got to go to where we useta go every year,0.31983011960983276
up to up north from us which is up by Wisconsin,0.23468130826950073
FirstnameT my wife,0.5667139291763306
youknow I wasnt able to actually I used to always be the one that kindof was the ke main ke driver,0.2289619743824005
and so ofcourse she youknow I knew that I couldnt we werent going to do that especially with our kids with me driving,0.2715258300304413
so she she did,0.5280122756958008
but going there again was a really wonderful time,0.41407638788223267
it really reminded me of alot of places,0.2647239565849304
because we we usually would go in the same places,0.357891321182251
and so that sortof is a long thinking about,0.36927640438079834
I just felt kindof,0.575112521648407
we we married there,0.503272533416748
so I guess I dont know,0.542924702167511
I dont think Im really answering what you asked me,0.3763897120952606
just like happy times of just one happy time,0.42920440435409546
yes I would I would love to,0.45339199900627136
well first of all were just friends,0.36157554388046265
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church,0.2771812379360199
and I was really interested in her,0.31348949670791626
but I took a long time,0.3362537920475006
and finally I mentioned about if we could go out,0.321297824382782
and she said yes which is wonderful,0.2440999150276184
we went out,0.43174874782562256
one of the happiest,0.4123237133026123
the that first date was just amazing,0.36189115047454834
I felt like I was this younger person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of,0.27138426899909973
and we just went out to see a movie,0.2703099548816681
and then we just talked for a long time,0.34083959460258484
and I told her good night and drove home,0.26537469029426575
and that was incredible,0.46949654817581177
and so we started going out,0.3807326555252075
and when we got married it was such a happy time,0.24824842810630798
I remember I went it didnt right away go,0.3447188436985016
before we got married that last night for,0.3042648136615753
but I did,0.5887314081192017
and I woke up,0.2652204930782318
and I was really happy,0.36504775285720825
and I was looking fairly forward to it,0.31511449813842773
felt alotof peace,0.35382574796676636
and so we had a pretty special wedding that we had done,0.3147481381893158
and the way we did it was that youknow I didnt get to see her how she was looking when she walked out,0.2536354064941406
and I was standing way back,0.34038662910461426
and I saw her coming,0.31130221486091614
sorry,0.9999999403953552
its nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda,0.3172298073768616
but I cried because she was coming orry with her dad,0.3071460425853729
and that was amazing,0.3957149386405945
and we had a fantastic wedding there,0.34350526332855225
and anyway the whole time it was happy,0.34205499291419983
I dont know why I cried sorry,0.45505592226982117
I think I might have thought of becauseof FirstnameTs FirstnameTs ke FirstnameTs ke mom who who had passed away a year and a half ago,0.19510531425476074
so I think that kinda got me,0.4794592559337616
but everything else was was really happy,0.4083192050457001
ohboy,0.0

and then probably can see behind who that probably was I would assume back there,0.35405081510543823
so thats my answer to that question,0.38185781240463257
okay,0.9999999403953552
on the first one xxx on the first one there is a person,0.33431556820869446
this is a xxx I guess,0.3409268260002136
and yes which is like sorry which is like mother,0.2892983555793762
and it looks like to me like she is telling him that he should take a,0.3158687651157379
its going to be the hard when we hadta think what thats called,0.30667844414711
to not get wet,0.3828418254852295
like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain,0.2925053834915161
stuck on what thats called,0.27963122725486755
but I know what it is,0.4735139310359955
and so she it looks like hes going like,0.333664208650589
and the though the the second one it looks like hes oh like shes,0.2678583860397339
oh I see what happened,0.42822760343551636
shes looking a little bit upset like,0.31841498613357544
and then the third one hes now outside,0.32612133026123047
and boyco guess what happened,0.42533302307128906
now its its hes getting soaked,0.2550484538078308
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house,0.31959691643714905
yes and she does look a little bit upset,0.28048455715179443
and hes looking kindof like,0.3316807746887207
and hes soaked,0.23790235817432404
and now she has the other thing I cant think of what its called around him to keep not getting wet,0.2280346304178238
thats pretty much what I have,0.40380653738975525
okay so first first Im going to look at what I see,0.26114851236343384
and then theres alot going on there in there,0.33261507749557495
okay,0.9999999403953552
there is a,0.4984162151813507
okay,0.9999999403953552
I see its a tree,0.27458786964416504
there is a man standing outside or up high with the tree,0.29428333044052124
theres a dog,0.3466758728027344

I always notice ke dogs and cats,0.285732239484787
theres a dog at the bottom under there looking up,0.2647555470466614
kindof looks like its barking,0.41498059034347534
probably saying something like,0.6460700035095215
and theres a cat just sortof hanging out,0.3094499409198761

ohno,0.0
I can point to it,0.43320685625076294
but I cant say it,0.40564820170402527
there is a thing that which the young girl could take with the with the man,0.34154635667800903
and he could he could walk down there,0.3543394207954407
cant think of what its called,0.2180500626564026
okay,0.9999999403953552
on the right see is a is a,0.3468831777572632
crud I forgot what thats called,0.2874569892883301
Ill skip that one,0.3131203055381775
at the bottom there we do see there is a acouple guys a person people who are gonna probably help him,0.23503878712654114
the which forgot what thats called too,0.31725168228149414
like a like a,0.582978367805481
I cant say it,0.4100450277328491

I I got it,0.5853015184402466
with a fire person whos gonna come and probably help him up there,0.23273539543151855
thats what Ive got,0.34725794196128845
okay,0.9999999403953552
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella,0.26257628202438354
but Cinderella starts with she was had a wonderful mom and also dad father and mother,0.2759399116039276
and they were loving and and kind,0.48178595304489136
and she was too,0.37927594780921936
and something happened which alot lot of,0.3222701847553253
and that was her her sorry her ke mother,0.3528137505054474
so her dad her father met this other woman and decided to hed like to have him and her get married,0.26358452439308167
and as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go,0.3055899143218994
but he did,0.5388272404670715
and that person had a couple a couple like sorry acouple ke daughters that she owned,0.27084505558013916
and its showing that theyre all very very mean not only to to Cinderella but even to themself,0.37314391136169434
they just theyre just very all they think about is themself,0.4513378143310547
and the the mother is just interested in trying to make alotof money when she gets married,0.2501083016395569
so they realize that Cinderella is just is a very beautiful person,0.3725373148918152
Imean shes shes very shes very pretty and beautiful,0.3257901966571808
but shes inside shes just a really sweet person who who cares about people,0.31441575288772583
so the oh I think its called stepmother,0.24890246987342834
I think thats what its called,0.30671995878219604
realizes they need to she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters,0.3126019835472107
and so Cinderellas life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that shes m,0.2818225026130676
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy at least for the most part and just doing alotof lovely things in taking care of them,0.2777440845966339
and so around that time the the prince,0.4406997859477997
let me see,0.5157024264335632
his dad,0.5432375073432922
I cant think of what thats called,0.23769795894622803
wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all,0.3191659152507782
who would be just a lovely ke a girl,0.28271329402923584
and so they have have this ke this ke ball,0.3175850212574005
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that youknow,0.2298678457736969
but they showed that the other two stepmothers,0.43668457865715027
and that their mom,0.41124027967453003
and theyre excited that they can maybe be the one thats chosen,0.32009032368659973
woo this is hard,0.32467222213745117
but the mom realizes,0.3637588620185852
so Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready,0.25304272770881653
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful,0.3085624873638153
so they made is made her beautiful thing,0.3392513394355774
but then the stepmother got where she she she couldnt go,0.32901349663734436
and so then Cinderella was really crying,0.34597647190093994
as I remember thats the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken,0.293905645608902
and youknow how could they not even let me do anything,0.3934559226036072
and then theres fairy godmother person pops outof nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what shes going to wear and where she can be driven,0.23008151352405548
she gets there,0.4633350968360901
and she can dance,0.37053459882736206
and he sees her and wants to dance with her,0.33689460158348083
and hes captivated by her,0.2684125304222107
and allofasudden Cinderella realizes ohno its by this midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back,0.2091851681470871
so Cinderella gets home,0.339800626039505
and shes still kinda happy,0.30583831667900085
which is I thought that was always amazing,0.37083253264427185
she was still she just happy and so honest about,0.3746168613433838
and she thinks thats the end that would ever be,0.34592026472091675
but she was still happy,0.4444686770439148
and so then with the prince he is like,0.3239237666130066
which I I wouldnt really blame him,0.36176443099975586
ofcourse hes gonna wanna meet her,0.21826624870300293
and goes he wants to he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her,0.2723240256309509
so he hasta go has a decree I guess that popped in decree to every single unmarried person,0.19360162317752838
hasta be figure out who that was because,0.3142719566822052
oh yeah I forgot when when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things,0.2410367876291275
I cant think what its called,0.2520466148853302
behind your foot thing,0.4031318426132202
so they know that if they can go to each person theyll find out who that was who that fits,0.326956182718277
so they go,0.5576509833335876
and at the end Cinderella its obvious that shes the the correct one,0.3112415671348572
so they get married,0.4204631447792053
and then shes happily ever after,0.3312283754348755
thats it,0.5068684816360474
my my brain is like,0.38019317388534546
okay,0.9999999403953552
take take my peanut butter,0.40586814284324646
hafta open it,0.33588725328445435
take it out,0.4760267436504364
probably get wanna get ke not just ke one but get get two,0.3360982835292816
lay them down,0.45708900690078735
grab something to go under thing,0.32490038871765137
I cant think how to call it,0.34897279739379883
under the jelly,0.3927059769630432
and go in there,0.3683982789516449
and take one and put it around the peanut butter,0.30518612265586853
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three three or four,0.28042080998420715
and thats how I would say,0.318576455116272
I dont know what to call that sorry,0.3814328610897064
well for the most part or or I guess Id hafta say most of the time I think its doing alot better than it it it had done,0.2224697768688202
and and were talking ofcourse after my stroke right,0.3390948474407196
hopefully I wouldnt have,0.4419243633747101
yeah so I think I Im doing better,0.43045321106910706
have a way I hafta ke go,0.20276255905628204
but I think Im doing better,0.4143553078174591
Ive been trying really hard to think,0.3787113130092621
and and I dont mean to keep blabbing,0.2679119408130646
Im sorry but,0.3913745880126953
Im just talking,0.4025452733039856
earlier I think it was yeah this morning I was telling somebody here my wife or my kids or something about how sometimes I feel like a person thats just not born but whatever,0.2925157845020294
what I mean is theres things Ive just forgotten all about,0.36402052640914917
we we got to eat a couple of things and I just forgot,0.28706270456314087
oh I forgot what that even is,0.3503015339374542
and so in a way thats kindof exciting,0.3316688537597656
but then you feel like,0.5149343013763428
so but yeah but overall better better hopefully,0.5066378116607666
Im hoping,0.38403889536857605
yes,0.9999998807907104
absolutely,0.9999999403953552
no I I probably feel like I blabbed too much about that last time,0.34869685769081116
so it,0.7884126305580139
I had come home,0.3910635709762573
and it wasnt very late in the day,0.2529366612434387
I think it was maybe twelve or one oclock I think,0.3178923726081848
and I had decided to look outside to see if we got any yeah any ke Im sorry any ke any Im sorry any mail,0.222229465842247
and I walked back in the house and said hi and gave them the mail I think,0.21825772523880005
and anyway I just started feeling really weird,0.4291504919528961
and I cant even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it,0.32696765661239624
but I decided I wanted to just to sit down with our with my ke bedroom,0.26578688621520996
and I did,0.3879748582839966
and right away it just started getting worse,0.4045889377593994
and it really hurt,0.4460338056087494
and for me it was youknow my left side I guess,0.24031592905521393
but it was probably other ones,0.4702804982662201
but I think I felt more here,0.4874117970466614
and something I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really very very different and strange,0.39761725068092346
and something was was kindof scary,0.35432857275009155
and she started talking with me,0.33160400390625
and realized she asked me a few questions,0.2876571714878082
and she could tell after several things shed asked me that I wasnt making enough sense,0.26125243306159973
and then I started feeling almost sick,0.35884883999824524
and she got me a thing in case I did,0.25528693199157715
and I did getting sick,0.3487147092819214
and she right away knew to get me to a a hospital,0.2835921049118042
and I think that well my wife and my kids knew they probably figured some things out because with my wifes mom had passed away about six months or something I guess it was before that,0.27242815494537354
I think thats about right,0.421108216047287
and I think last thing Im saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit,0.3170843720436096
and so I was thinking about that and praying about that,0.4047088027000427
and thats the last thing I can tell you,0.28685644268989563
we were going to the hospital,0.3627314865589142
and I was trying she was asking me alotof questions as she was driving,0.2483525574207306
and I was doing the best I could,0.31127938628196716
but I I couldnt really explain very well,0.4161171615123749
so it was a pretty whew wow pretty intense thing that happened,0.3236340880393982
that is a fantastic question,0.4440161883831024
and if you asked my that before Im not even thinking of that,0.3055219054222107
so Im just saying thats a really excellent question,0.3372357487678528
well my wife and my kids came from church,0.2490181177854538
friends had been all so wonderful,0.4073519706726074
and especially as a wife and kids they asked me alotof questions,0.2425914853811264
and part of the whole thing I dont know how to say it is theyve had to figure out what Im trying to say,0.23866192996501923
and theyve been very patient about this when I get stuck on something,0.29665952920913696
and every now and then I get a little bit upset,0.30846312642097473
but not upset like crazy scary something,0.4872472286224365
I just I just get frustrated because I know what Im trying to say but I cant think how to say it,0.38135963678359985
but anyway so theyve also also with them I should have said my sister,0.31958380341529846
my sister is always always one of my best friends,0.32180362939834595
shes a couple years younger than me,0.2498166263103485
and and her husband too,0.4482663869857788
theyve all gotten back,0.3870603144168854
and they showed me alotof photos and remembrances youknow,0.2550017535686493
things that I remember,0.5823309421539307
and snu,0.47425687313079834
I dont have it here,0.4315706193447113
but ke theyd gaven,0.3446669578552246
ke if it says ke dogq a picture of a dog,0.2089611291885376
they give me tons of those,0.3006810247898102
but my wifes is the main one,0.279782235622406
shes helped me out so much,0.2884025275707245
and like I say theyve had to guess what Im trying to say,0.2820058763027191
or ke Ill say,0.2533383369445801
and then theyre all trying to,0.43565571308135986
and then finally someone will figure,0.4363125264644623
Ill say,0.4516865015029907
that thats it,0.5605795979499817
youknow but its getting to the point where hopefully as Im getting better I hope theyll sometimes say,0.27216875553131104
youknow so thats been alotof alotof it,0.2793863117694855
and then I think also with me with me playing music my wifes realized that so much of that seems to have come back which is amazing because for a long time I didnt do music for a long time in my life,0.24598532915115356
I started again awhile back,0.49593615531921387
but stuffs back there from when I was a kid,0.30630847811698914
its just back youknow,0.3674922585487366
oh and one more thing,0.3508080542087555
we really love certain tv shows and sometimes movies,0.3475140631198883
and alotof those have have helped me too,0.329489529132843
theres certain ones that we just really like,0.4787970781326294
that I dont know it just helps me youknow with anyway,0.35387617349624634
so that helps at all,0.3484462797641754
so it was gonna get something else but I cant think what to say,0.3191325068473816
sorry Im stuck on what the name of the show is,0.1797187328338623
I guess that thats probably not very important sorry,0.42545753717422485
we I liked I watch alotof older shows,0.33216333389282227
and some of those are just great,0.4483363926410675
theyre just great,0.4525652229785919
anyway so thats what Ive got,0.37698400020599365
cool yeah there are just certain ones,0.41017696261405945
and some of the especially Im not trying to say anything whatever bad about newer shows because theres certainly some good new ones Im sure,0.2819690406322479
but some of those older ones are just just so great,0.42449548840522766
sometimes theyre so well thought out or just so funny,0.38915789127349854
the and so even when I was a kid there were certain shows that everybody remembered,0.3243618309497833
youknow its just Ill say something thats kindof probably silly,0.3011024594306946
but theyre showing with tv now the guy with the Fonzi going heyq,0.25403422117233276
youknow its just one little thats not a very deep thing,0.3343169689178467
but something like that back then that was everybody knew who that was,0.42203181982040405
anyway its the best Ive got,0.26135027408599854
sorry sorry that Im Im Im taking a second,0.2567422688007355
Im trying to decide which one I had mentioned,0.26172998547554016
my wife and thats a very very vital one,0.2986876368522644
I thought Id try to think of something else too,0.32850855588912964
and every one Im thinking of isnt much to say in there,0.21261070668697357
so and theres alot I just just just think of it,0.3602949380874634
I thought of one that would be very hard for me explain that,0.347459614276886
I just I wouldnt be able to get all in my head,0.2805382013320923
well okay,0.538446307182312
with my wife again when we got married when we were married,0.28697675466537476
I mentioned that,0.5094006061553955
but I dont think I mentioned this,0.4319547414779663
after wed been married for a couple days we went up north up to Wisconsin and no yeah,0.1636403501033783
and no yeah and then we went,0.291055828332901
sorry Wisconsin,0.45794036984443665
s what I meant to say was actually actually next to that which is like which sorry which which is Michigan,0.28917935490608215
and we went up to Michigan to stay,0.28040874004364014
ohbrother it,1.0
how could I not think of that,0.41702306270599365
I could draw a picture of it,0.2977820932865143
I could drive where to get there,0.3981192111968994
I cant think what its called,0.2520466148853302
oh Mackinaw,0.37855100631713867
and we stayed at Mackinaw,0.27204692363739014
and that was fantastic,0.4243026673793793
we had a few days,0.29030001163482666
and we stayed at a beautiful place,0.28524258732795715
and it was just so peaceful and just beautiful,0.38743695616722107
and at at that place I had mentioned which took me while to get out as kku,0.23210233449935913
well up in Mackinaw they cant have any vehicles and cars,0.21728241443634033
so you just hear this little clip clip clip clip clip of of of sorry of a horse horses going,0.22447147965431213
and we just were out there,0.4015403687953949
we had a suite I guess youd call it our third floor,0.23605190217494965
and we could open it up and look down there and just see these these horses,0.34773582220077515
and it was just so peaceful and so beautiful,0.380953848361969
and that was a wonderful time,0.3798161745071411
just being married and having a life together with each other,0.3948177099227905
and looking back at that and seeing theres alotof other all around that whole place,0.3438148498535156
but I remember that particular part of it,0.4040042757987976
and theres another one thats close to it,0.3603493571281433
I guess it was,0.47359955310821533
I forgot if its before or after,0.29278403520584106
right around there we went to a place called the Sleeping Bear Dune that this guy that I knew years ago had just told me,0.21548107266426086
and so we went there not even knowing how to how to get there because back then we didnt have ke our our interuhnet,0.32909059524536133
we had to just figure out how to get there,0.36535435914993286
but we found this place,0.4547637104988098
well you you you you go up real high,0.4296155273914337
and then when you finish you can just run down,0.38512933254241943
that was one of the neatest things,0.3653219938278198
when I went up all the way high and we could look down there it was just beyond beautiful just unbelievable,0.3129633963108063
and so when I think about that too I just I just I just get just get happy,0.4930086135864258
so thats my little stories,0.3697778284549713
www,1.0000001192092896
on number on one theres a guy a boy whatever,0.2600399851799011
and hes got a soccer,0.21093954145908356
and hes hitting the soccer,0.288542777299881
and on the second one looks like he is,0.27979305386543274
oh I see it now,0.413664311170578
hes hit it,0.30363893508911133
and you can see actually where its actually where they have it showing where exactly went,0.397960901260376
and he hit by mistake Im sure but hit one of the,0.19598695635795593
oh lets see here,0.3801127076148987
let me think what its called,0.3014901280403137
one of the houses,0.5084141492843628
and it got crashed,0.30389702320098877
and on number three,0.4871976673603058
ohboy theres the the man that probably owns the house there who was sitting down probably just trying to just relax and allofasudden probably got ohmygosh what was that scared but realized what happened,0.3270418047904968
then that just crashed and and and broke,0.4181581437587738
and so again I missed you on that but I think,0.38712942600250244
because I cant see him,0.35787683725357056
but it looks like hes probably angry,0.3761141002178192
but hes hes ke holding it,0.27001017332077026
and he can see what made it get broken,0.2816140353679657
and I think thats end of the story I think,0.283010870218277
how much time,0.5473430752754211

Ive got it okay,0.41123345494270325
I got stuck on that one thing,0.3508223295211792
okay,0.9999999403953552
there is a thing called a god crud called an called wait a minute called an an umbrella,0.2556685507297516
and there is a looks like a boy whos younger and his mom who looks like she is telling him,0.24914027750492096
Im sorry,0.4229740798473358
yeah I said it again,0.39261549711227417
so he just kindof is,0.4292946755886078
I I I dont I dont need that or I dont want it or something,0.4189160168170929
and she looks like shes alittle concerned,0.3344975709915161
and and that was on on number two,0.3851581811904907
on number three looks like hes now outside,0.25451964139938354
and its starting to rain,0.40933340787887573
and he now realizes he needs to,0.3455100655555725
and can now Im on four,0.19735285639762878
he turned around to the left to run back,0.3511478900909424
and hes realizing he really made made a a goofy mistake and shouldve listen to to his mom,0.23299933969974518
yes and number five hes ke back to see her,0.18355686962604523
he must be in the house because now I dont see all the rain coming,0.24652892351150513
but hes ke soaked,0.23532497882843018
and she looks understandably kindof upset,0.35356834530830383
dont want to say angry but kindof upset,0.37939560413360596
and so now hes going,0.3032723665237427
this is number v six,0.25091734528541565
hes going back outside,0.3407432436943054
and he now has what he should have had for the dang it for the dang it for the the umbrella,0.28054431080818176
and oh as hes going now hes not getting soaked because he is wearing having an umbrella,0.20834359526634216
thats it,0.5068684816360474
this is hard because I hafta,0.31600403785705566
okay I understand whats going on,0.343778133392334
I gotta think of all the different what theyre all called,0.26365751028060913
well okay Im just gonna put it the way I would say it,0.28639498353004456
I dont know,0.538106381893158
there is a dad,0.3334057331085205
and s oh I see what happened,0.27303043007850647
it looks like he might have tried to,0.37609192728996277
could be two two possibilities,0.4166499376296997
okay he has a very tall ke tree,0.20433691143989563
and hes hes hes up there,0.2831520438194275
and hes ke stuck,0.20021723210811615
it looks like the,0.4452386200428009
what is that called,0.4383506774902344
web,1.0
what is that thing called,0.4555148184299469
I guess thats what makes it what I have whats happened to me,0.37112554907798767
I cant think how to call a certain thing,0.3053504228591919
a thing that he normally could have stuck in front of,0.308574378490448
oh I just touched something sorry,0.4628848433494568
touch something thankyou sorry,0.5004966259002686
and that looks like that had ke fallen down,0.2997822165489197
looks like he was going up there to get a to try to help to get to get yeah to to get a a cat,0.2963756322860718
and looks like his I guess daughter is looking up at the cat,0.20802123844623566
probably shes,0.4128134846687317
ke shes concerned about the kitty,0.21912294626235962
theres a little,0.43288475275039673
its hard to explain isnt it,0.28958243131637573
theres a little thing that she could have been maybe,0.37132251262664795
what do you call those things,0.49912697076797485
as a kid you can you can get there,0.3458191752433777
and you can drive,0.43373459577560425
it could have even have fallen down the fallen down what he needs to not be stuck,0.32036092877388
Im not sure,0.3635326027870178
anyway on the other side behind him thats a dog,0.268527626991272
dogs up there woofing woof woof woof probably wants I dont know saying,0.22497324645519257
I dont know,0.538106381893158
and then on the last part here there are two responders rs people coming trying to help,0.2993018925189972
and there is a,0.42088955640792847
something else I forgot what its called,0.3158455789089203
oh what is that called,0.31116005778312683
we see that where they would use to have gotten around there,0.4088385999202728
I cant think what its called,0.2520466148853302
and the last thing on the very top of that is a a bird,0.3040992319583893
thats the best I can do right now,0.3251093029975891
the story of Cinderella,0.4161931276321411
I guess it starts off,0.41380396485328674
as at least the way I remember,0.27299779653549194
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very very good people,0.28298404812812805
and they treated her as they should very very very kind and with with alotof love,0.35220128297805786
and that would would ofcourse have been great except her her ke mother died,0.29656410217285156
and I guess alot of those ke Disney shows do that sometimes,0.2141118049621582
and so the dad was a good man,0.26292896270751953
but like alotof people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else,0.35582074522972107
and so that ends up happening,0.38157129287719727
and really messed up by marrying this other woman,0.31462860107421875
who ends up shes just so cruel and so selfish,0.272311806678772
and oh okay what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life,0.25747814774513245
and so what I mean now is that the,0.3520151376724243
what is it called,0.39310526847839355
the other woman she now has the power I guess where shes really being awful with with with Cinderella,0.2581962049007416
and I guess maybe even the her dad mightve died,0.2486415058374405
I dont remember about that,0.42004522681236267
anyway so theyre showing they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed,0.2893266975879669
she went through a really nice life which was deserving to her because she was a very very very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldnt hurt anyone,0.282609760761261
so now that the other mother is now there the other mother makes Cinderella do everything,0.3363739252090454
all the washing and everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do,0.371094286441803
and these those two sisters the k s the other,0.37980952858924866
what are those called,0.42199742794036865
those two other girls are just so mean to her and so just very ke very snotty horrible,0.29974713921546936
dont even care about Cinderella at all,0.24432992935180664
only that they can get whatever they want,0.5308322906494141
they make her do everything,0.44882914423942566
but even so she still seems to still have an amazing way to be lovely and sweet and caring,0.33345818519592285
and so I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place,0.33411169052124023
I cant think what its called,0.2520466148853302
beautiful place,0.6598954200744629
so sorry somebodys walking back here and Im Im getting this for,0.2827581763267517
okay so okay I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman,0.2552167475223541
I guess,0.784920871257782
so oh this is hard,0.3546227216720581
so the the ke,0.36706632375717163
hows that Im in track where they are,0.2406994104385376
so the so its made by decree that they should have they should have this ke yeah okay this ke this ke ball,0.2594831585884094
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta hasta come there,0.25563329458236694
and then theyll be able to c to figure out whos the best one that he should he should marry,0.2727566361427307
so then they showed in the picture if I remember right his,0.31832608580589294
and shes excited because she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will will be that they will want one of them,0.3025147020816803
so theyre all excited including Cinderella was excited,0.24615328013896942
but loandbehold I think it showed that the other mother says,0.3642635643482208
seems to me ke I remember ke the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear I think,0.24206997454166412
anyway so Cinderella part of her part of how shes just so lovely and kind even the little a little ke sorry ke nblu,0.23246198892593384
so they even do what help to try to make her what she can wear,0.37441781163215637
and I think Im what happened with that,0.3154497444629669
anyway yeah then it gets messed up,0.40442657470703125
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think thats where it shows Cinderella really for the first time really crying,0.2928429841995239
really just destroyed because its like,0.46120432019233704
Im being its like they think shes just nothing,0.3020630180835724
and she doesnt deserve any of that,0.29245471954345703
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother pops outof nowhere,0.25663161277770996
and she makes a beautiful outfit,0.31939685344696045
and then she,0.5494130849838257
ohboy the the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where,0.32351452112197876
yeah with with with its ke a pumpkin,0.27059417963027954
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in,0.22362028062343597
and the animals are made to look like theyre people,0.3253940939903259
and just the fairy godmother has told her,0.28896135091781616
so I think it showed Cinderella arrives,0.30352210998535156
and they can see that the other the other the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like,0.4053279161453247
and then the,0.6539063453674316
why this is really hard to explain this,0.44161003828048706
then the guy,0.43825483322143555
I cant think what hes even called now,0.27091288566589355
oh how embarrassing,0.41395458579063416
I cant think of the name of the guy,0.20069612562656403
the young man whos gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her,0.20854738354682922
and he is is very interested in her ofcourse,0.2988962233066559
and he seemed like a nice man like a good man,0.3351093530654907
and and she ofcourse is a absolutely very wonderful and very very good girl,0.363712340593338
and they get to dance,0.4106096029281616
and its just almost magical,0.4330160617828369
theyre just obvious those two are meant to be ke in love,0.2709287405014038
so then Cinderella leaves or sees,0.28000667691230774
so she has to suddenly run,0.3276953101158142
hes thinking,0.370665043592453
and as shes running down her slipper a grass,0.24847283959388733
and she hasta keep running,0.29589784145355225
so then I think the pictures show that shes back home,0.3219788372516632
and shes shes just happy that she got to do something,0.30441057682037354
and then they find out that,0.4574474096298218
boyco my brain,0.5940811634063721
that there was a grass,0.3980261981487274
or theyre theyre gonna find who was that woman who we actually would ofcourse have been n n n Cinderella,0.2090989649295807
and so they go to every unmarried young woman,0.30332711338996887
and none of them it doesnt fit right with any of them with the slipper grass,0.2676537036895752
I cant talk right,0.3599778115749359
with the slipper,0.45204100012779236
and it does for for Cinderella,0.3222896158695221
and so she becomes married,0.3439714312553406
and I think I missed one thing in there,0.3487568497657776
seems like the the mom ends up breaking that or something first,0.2976406514644623
I dont remember that,0.4398850202560425
but anyway they find the other one like I say,0.392223596572876
and and that fits,0.49733948707580566
thats the only one that that fits right,0.4604750871658325
and its obviously shes shes the one,0.31259554624557495
and then it shows that they get married,0.3526230454444885
and theyre happily ever after,0.35935184359550476
I think thats it,0.45399826765060425
yeah youd open up each of the each of the ke sorry each of the ke jellies,0.2263883352279663
excuseme let me let me start over again,0.40160664916038513
peanut butters,0.8162089586257935
oh wait a minute,0.2975366711616516
Im saying that backwards,0.3463970124721527
peanut butters,0.8162089586257935
oh yeah okay,0.7009463906288147
first I have to get out,0.35083460807800293
I cant think what to call it,0.3612317442893982
what I would made hot,0.339807391166687
Id take probably two of those,0.2692444920539856
and then get peanut butter,0.3922773003578186

yeah sometimes I say things backwards,0.4355446994304657
does it does it is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching,0.3221006989479065
I said some things backwards,0.4051811993122101
so if Ill say,0.4042486548423767
I think those are the main issues I have,0.3375021815299988
no I dont remember anything for about six weeks,0.2656252980232239
the first memories that I had after my stroke are were very cloudy,0.271065890789032
and they were not accurate they were not accurate,0.482144296169281
for example I I remember being in a wheelchair,0.27088385820388794
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair,0.2724497318267822
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the werteru,0.29065588116645813
and I was strapped in because I couldnt sit up on my own,0.21706610918045044
those for about two months I I I really didnt I couldnt remember I remembered remembered almost nothing,0.33531227707862854
and some of the things I had were very much incorrect,0.32788538932800293
I found out later things I thought,0.38183990120887756
and then when I first started remembering things I was oz was at that point I was moved to a rlbltenu,0.2685103416442871
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct somewhat accurate,0.39580950140953064
and that was probably month and a half or two months in,0.2870997190475464
then I I started remembering things but but it was slow coming back very slow coming back,0.3831852078437805
one thing that that I didnt know was that as I was as it was coming and waking up I guess I was getting getting around to being able to talk,0.2807636559009552
I thought I was talking,0.47445574402809143
but I found out later that I wasnt that I couldnt talk clearly,0.30822089314460754
I couldnt say anything,0.4381571114063263
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling,0.4094064235687256
and so I dont remember when I started talking because in my mind I was always talking just just fine,0.33237600326538086
and I felt like feel like you feel like maybe I was a baby tried to talk,0.32186833024024963
and I thought everybody should understand me,0.43881896138191223
but apparently infact nobody did,0.5365186929702759

the kid is out kicking the soccer ball,0.2823143005371094
yeah he kicks it pretty hard,0.383633017539978
goes up up pretty high,0.37166815996170044
and it goes pretty far,0.34823116660118103
and it goes through somebodys window,0.34896454215049744
and then it goes through it goes through the window,0.3690486252307892
and the this guy is the guy is sitting there in the in the chair as the as the as the ball comes crashing through the window and hits the lamp knocks the lamp off and scares him I guess,0.25494396686553955
and then Im not sure exactly what happens after that,0.327852725982666
but yeah theres a hole in the window then,0.27200016379356384
theres a hole in the window,0.3015803396701813
and he the guy is holding the soccer ball looking out the window,0.27344879508018494
so not sure what hes gonna do about the about the kid who kicked the soccer ball through the window,0.2031988501548767
thats about it,0.44777998328208923
now yeah,0.6475239396095276
Im not sure,0.3635326027870178
well lets see here,0.42136624455451965
yeah it hit the window with the shutters on that,0.286772757768631
theres a theres a problem here because when the when the ball comes through the window theres a lamp there,0.33098354935646057
and in in the final picture the the lamp is gone,0.32147809863090515
yeah the chair is gone the chair he was sitting in is gone,0.2352668195962906
and the guys standing there and next to the window I guess,0.3068123757839203
but the chair and the lamp are gone,0.2937220335006714
so not sure what happened there,0.5189271569252014
okay thats about it,0.3885948956012726
okay,0.9999999403953552
well the the the the little kid is going off to school,0.3186541199684143
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him,0.24848175048828125
but hes kinda waving it off saying,0.3184088468551636
so he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye,0.22535525262355804
and he gets out there going on his way to school,0.2796230614185333
and it starts raining,0.4362978935241699
and you can see hes kinda alittle worried there and worry it rains more and more,0.28776636719703674
and now its its a downpour,0.36203455924987793
and its raining pretty hard,0.39241355657577515
and hes kinda running to get outta the rain,0.20146968960762024
and he ran back home,0.3241763710975647
and he he did see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didnt want to take the umbrella,0.2049882411956787
so then he gets the umbrella to go off to school,0.27284955978393555
and hes happy going off to school with his umbrella,0.22645777463912964
okay,0.9999999403953552
well the story is that this little girls cat got up in the tree,0.25846612453460693
and the the dad went up to get the get the cat down,0.26768040657043457
and hes got stuck in the tree,0.20708289742469788
and the the dog is standing there barking up the tree,0.3618573248386383
I dont know if hes barking because hes trying to get that guy down or what,0.2671576738357544
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down,0.2486199289560318
and in the process somehow the ladder,0.4216368496417999
maybe the dog hit the ladder,0.2755059003829956
but it the ladder got knocked down,0.331243097782135
so the guy couldnt get couldnt climb down the ladder,0.2671889066696167
so they hadta call a fire department,0.32881128787994385
and they came,0.46463334560394287
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder,0.37531691789627075
and theyre going to get the get the get the guy down from the tree,0.29205968976020813
now the cat in the meantime is sitting up in the tree,0.2922242283821106
and I dont know if hes taking a nap or just,0.22650623321533203
but he doesnt really care,0.3651997148990631
hes not bothering him,0.3633240759372711
the little girl probably was musta been riding her tricycle because its sitting there,0.30866575241088867
but she is now trying to coax the cat down,0.254641056060791
theres a bird there in the tree,0.3230164349079132
and hes just kinda singing away and probably is oblivious to everything else thats going on,0.26651477813720703
thats pretty much it,0.4482649564743042
the girls got pigtails and all of that,0.32004526257514954
so maybe shes a tomboy or something,0.3255215883255005
I dont know,0.538106381893158
thats about it,0.44777998328208923
thats it,0.5068684816360474
www,1.0000001192092896
okay,0.9999999403953552
well Cinderella was a Cinderella was I guess,0.29142653942108154
I think there was a I think that Cinderella was actually had to work for the whos the the got evil sisters,0.26205530762672424
and they werent very nice to her,0.2839827239513397
they made her do the laundry,0.2860911190509796
obviously in the story here all the all the animals loved Cinderella because theyre all in theyre all around whenever she is,0.3145350217819214
and they they found that they they like her alot because all the little animals are around when shes doing her thing,0.35129234194755554
so the the the the king has a son,0.39729708433151245
hes looking for a looking for a bride for his his son,0.2723543047904968
I didnt say that right did I,0.4111476242542267
yeah he was looking for a bride for his son,0.23151838779449463
and they they were he had they were gonna have a ball,0.30961504578590393
so they could all come and and see who who she,0.363864928483963
and she was looking out the window in this one picture,0.31100577116012573
she was looking out the window kinda dreaming about it,0.2976189851760864
but she obviously hadnt been invited to the ball,0.2747826874256134
so they all went to the ball,0.34050610661506653
and well the I dont remember exactly how it was that she ended up,0.2624633312225342
I guess the the fairy godmother came while she was at while they were at the ball,0.26255786418914795
the fairy godmother took a told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that shed take her to the ball in,0.2662981152534485
and it was a a pumpkin carriage and gonna take them to the ball,0.24404604732990265
and I remember this one picture there that seemed alittle weird,0.40347403287887573
the horses were sitting on their hind legs with their kinda with their feet up something like youknow,0.269159197807312
they were they were standing there on four legs,0.3774755895137787
it was kinda weird,0.44844987988471985
and so the fairy godmother took her to the ball,0.28911131620407104
and she at the ball and went in,0.3152073621749878
and nobody knew this knew who it was because she was so so beautiful,0.3403114378452301
nobody knew who she was,0.42087721824645996
and they had the ball,0.4021984934806824
and the and the prince the prince liked her,0.4463684558868408
and and then the the the chimes went off in the clock big clock BigBen or whatever,0.3115813732147217
and and and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before or back home before midnight,0.3076779544353485
and it was after midnight,0.36750897765159607
and so she got up,0.3271358013153076
she ran out,0.3688545823097229
and her slipper fell off,0.32279902696609497
and she went on,0.3303389847278595
she got home without the slipper,0.2951090633869171
and then the the prince started looking for whoever it was that had the the slipper,0.3554549217224121
and he was trying he was trying the slipper on on everybody in the kingdom,0.2774241268634796
and finally the the the they wanted to he wanted to try it onto Cinderella,0.34734782576560974
but I think they they the the the bad evil sisters didnt want her didnt want him to,0.3066946566104889
but he did anyway,0.5279517769813538
he,0.9999998807907104
and it fit,0.4148181676864624
and and the end Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after I guess,0.26203781366348267
okay,0.9999999403953552
well I guess first thing I do is go to the pantry,0.26126956939697266
and I get out the peanut butter,0.29211464524269104
and then I go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out,0.28716975450515747
and Id get some bread outof the freezer the refrigerator because thats where we keep the bread,0.27040815353393555

and then I would I would take out two pieces of bread,0.2879345715045929
and Id spread Id spread peanut butter on one of them,0.21895445883274078
and then I would spread jelly on the other one,0.3116063177585602
and I would put the two together,0.3336760103702545
and Id have a peanut butter dnu,0.2640014886856079
and then I would put the bread away back in the refrigerator,0.30258655548095703
and Id put the peanut butter away in the pantry,0.2111273854970932
and Id put the the jelly away in the refrigerator,0.23522037267684937
and then Id sit down and eat my peanut butter sandwich with a glass of milk,0.2102111428976059
its pretty good,0.43915560841560364
but its pretty good,0.45385676622390747
understandable,0.9999999403953552
yes I do,0.6168991327285767

I didnt feel too bad,0.40071845054626465
but I knew from what people had told me what Id heard many times the one of the signs of a stroke is numbness,0.22121858596801758
infact I remember I was a fellow that I used to work with had a stroke at work,0.25766614079475403

FirstnameS shed it was about a half hour away,0.27512049674987793
so she got there after this had started that the questions,0.34142404794692993
I think I I think I theyd already taken me to to get a ct scan or whatever it was while before she got there,0.2732301652431488
so they they when when when she got there I was already had gone in to to get a scan,0.31695517897605896
and so when they had when I was done with that they took me back into the waiting back into the room where I was the treatment room whatever you call it at at their in their emergency room,0.26762914657592773
and I I remember pretty well that youknow FirstnameS was there,0.33251965045928955
and and I remembered I knew what was going on I that I was that I had a stroke,0.30217623710632324
but it felt like it was probably it wasnt getting any worse,0.36782121658325195
it was just stroke,0.44683390855789185
so I wasnt too worried about it,0.3623920977115631
but and at that time it was only still in my in my right arm,0.28742703795433044
it wadnt,1.0
I I could walk I could walk fine,0.4448516368865967
theres no no problem there,0.4925817847251892
it was in my in my arm that that was affected,0.277134507894516
didnt affect my vision or anything like that that I know of,0.30727502703666687
I was able to drive youknow to the as I said to the hospital and walk into the hospital and and and and tell them what what I thought was going on,0.25688016414642334
so yeah so they looked at me,0.3719407021999359
they they then they they I was there for awhile in the in the emergency room,0.36247435212135315
and then they took me and took took me to a youknow to the neuro c icu,0.21601565182209015

and youknow then ofcourse people came in and examined me,0.28019511699676514
and the doctor came in,0.3771567642688751
and and ofcourse FirstnameS FirstnameS was there,0.46443063020706177
and I remember the remember the room real well,0.3558606207370758
I think I was hungry by that time,0.3202875852584839
I dont know how far how much more you want me to talk to say,0.3612341284751892
I can I can go on talk for awhile if you want,0.3298649787902832
but thats that pretty much the story of the of the time as when I had the stroke,0.31723883748054504
okay,0.9999999403953552
yes I can,0.5072396993637085
my recovery from that initial stoke,0.3457706868648529
I went youknow I was in the hospital for about three or four days,0.19553667306900024
and and then I went home,0.3723292052745819
I went home,0.43457022309303284
and we called a a neurosurgeon to take a look at me and soforth,0.2507602274417877
but so but I went home,0.448811799287796
and I actually within a few days I was youknow I said,0.2416267693042755
and and and so we did,0.4230327308177948
we nice cat,0.484566330909729
so we we went out to the country,0.3387898802757263
we live in Wichita and went out to the country and on some of the country road,0.2900296747684479
and I did a little driving around,0.329494833946228
and I felt like I was pretty good youknow,0.3198360800743103
and then I did that again acouple more times other days,0.3476395905017853
and it seemed like things were going pretty well,0.3880636692047119
and then I and then we we as I said made an appointment to go see the neurosurgeon,0.24713395535945892
and we went to see the neurosurgeon,0.2794533669948578
and his name was Doctor LastnameM,0.3171464800834656
and he was in a building right there by the hospital,0.32756805419921875
and so went to see him and youknow in his office,0.24362055957317352
and he he explained to me what he thought I had,0.36316147446632385
well youknow he had seen the seen the xrays and and the scans and all that,0.30665308237075806
so he knew what was going on youknow,0.288178414106369
and he told me what told me what what I had,0.34169256687164307
and it was a it was a,0.4136926233768463
see if I can remember the word,0.33860114216804504
its probably gonna get away from me,0.2381085306406021
its a,0.6520427465438843
its on the tip my tongue,0.30917924642562866
its a,0.6520427465438843
I dont know if you can you can help me with this u,0.3742281496524811
its a,0.6520427465438843
you cant,0.5157983303070068
I see youre shaking your house,0.3564677834510803
okay I have a hard time some sorta remembering what this was,0.3415062129497528
its not a regular stroke,0.3750649392604828
its not a regular stroke,0.3750649392604828
its its a situation that Ive had probably since birth,0.2969484031200409
and it the situation is that there is a a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the artery,0.2984359860420227
and instead of going through the little capillaries and everything it doesnt go through the capillaries,0.3436531126499176
it goes directly into a a vein,0.3304310739040375
so theres no no filter there to to slow it down or youknow,0.2818426489830017
and so that that con,0.42026612162590027
and it I said it probably was there from birth,0.28775912523269653
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure,0.3280230462551117
and it it didnt blow,0.320789635181427
it just there was and it was not a very big very big spot,0.3381023705005646
maybe size of a quarter that where it had bled into my brain,0.23607489466667175
but it stopped bleeding,0.4970976710319519
it stopped,0.5835991501808167
and and everything was going okay,0.3530704081058502
it stopped,0.5835991501808167
and there wasnt really much damage,0.3171500265598297
so so Doctor LastnameM then said,0.3702091872692108
so I went home from that appointment feeling pretty good,0.3062310218811035
FirstnameS I guess both felt pretty good,0.41865113377571106
I continue practicing my driving and soforth,0.37140193581581116
and I went went back and made an appointment to go into surgery on on May the first,0.21537435054779053
that had it,0.5561666488647461
Im sorry,0.4229740798473358
May the sixth,0.3969278931617737
that had all happened on April Fools Day on April first of two thousand fifteen,0.19412004947662354
and so I went in for the surgery on on May the sixth of that year two thousand fifteen,0.2144419550895691
and little did I know I wasnt gonna come home for quite awhile,0.2470497339963913
I wouldnt be home for another six months,0.2468515783548355
and in the meantime,0.5107680559158325
excuse the the French,0.4422236680984497
the the shit hit the fan,0.3256147503852844
and it did big time,0.3442191183567047
Im sorry did I Im I dont mean to offend you,0.34234532713890076
okay so that was that was that was that was my second stoke,0.3366844952106476
and didnt I then then that was that was,0.35271143913269043
well okay so what happened was when I went into the hospital then to have the that surgery that that that,0.3378482460975647
and again its on the tip my tongue,0.29177549481391907
that I wanna say what it is,0.3810167610645294
maybe Ill think of it yeah,0.30777812004089355
so when I went in to have that taken care of while I when I was in the hospital then they did the surgery,0.28034651279449463
and the surgery was a c success,0.32229405641555786
the problem was that when I went back when when I was in recovery from that surgery I was in recovery and,0.30959856510162354
Ill ignore that if you can,0.4074966609477997
sorry make make sure its not,0.38849881291389465
no its not,0.4703775644302368
okay no,0.603988766670227
so when I,0.6072477698326111
the let it ring a time or two and go itll go away,0.23474495112895966
Im sorry,0.4229740798473358
okay so I I while I was in recovery my a brain for whatever reason,0.2734246253967285
and not in the area where the surgery was done but in another area far away from the that spot,0.3185173273086548
it started bleeding,0.4589579999446869
and nobody knows why it started bleeding,0.3180716037750244
but it did,0.6044833660125732
and eventhough FirstnameS kept trying to say,0.3504840135574341
because I I I I dont remember it ofcourse,0.4903407692909241
I didnt see it,0.4117889106273651
my my head was very swollen,0.3143732249736786
and and she could tell that,0.401865154504776
youknow they tried to say,0.36616572737693787
they they they tried to say,0.5481035709381104
not a stroke,0.45514529943466187
a having a,0.7086869478225708
I cant remember the word now,0.28647691011428833
hes having a whatever it is that they said,0.32216113805770874
well it happens sometimes after surgery,0.3844725787639618
its no big deal,0.3594435453414917
itll it it is go away,0.36647555232048035
and she kept trying to tell them,0.33400893211364746
well they didnt well they didnt get hold of the doctor until number of hours later,0.218253955245018
that was at one about one oclock one oclock one thirty when I came back outof surgery the first time,0.2694419026374817
and at finally about ten oclock that evening they took me back into surgery,0.25342899560928345
and youknow by that time theyd had done scans and soforth,0.24872450530529022
and they could see that the brain was bleeding badly,0.3543480932712555
infact about the blood the blood was about three quarters of my brain,0.2900426387786865
it was so bad that they didnt know if I would be bu,0.32918891310691833
and if I did come outof it didnt know for sure if I would ever talk walk,0.2962808609008789
if Id even know anything,0.45736604928970337
if Id just hafta be spending the rest my life in a care home,0.2117830067873001
they didnt know,0.4791892170906067
and so I didnt know if youd me to go on some more about this,0.282512366771698
Imean I can talk for a long time about this if you want me to,0.3284764885902405
so you ready to go on,0.3806689977645874
Im sorry I cant even hear you,0.3542194962501526
yeah,1.0
yes yes,0.9999999403953552
ofcourse I when I was when I was in the hospital I dont remember,0.29280516505241394
youknow for about two months I dont remember anything,0.2636811435222626
and I wasnt doing anything,0.2877521812915802
I as far as I know I dont know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not but probably not because there wasnt anything to work with,0.3160732090473175
I youknow I couldnt talk,0.4170791804790497
I couldnt do anything,0.489826500415802
and interestingly in July,0.4210227131843567
so that was that was that was May,0.4104681611061096
in July middle of July somewhere I had another stroke,0.23314419388771057
and they,0.6694130897521973
I was at that point I was in the I was in a rehabilitation center a rehab hospital,0.26068973541259766
and they they took me by ambulance because I I felt I could feel that something was going on,0.3063642680644989
and I was afraid it was stroke,0.3071884214878082
but I couldnt say it was a stroke,0.30174699425697327
but I knew there was something going on,0.3697216808795929
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that theres a problem,0.341705322265625
they took me to the hospital and did the scans and soforth,0.31142187118530273
and sure enough Id had another Id had another stroke,0.2796556055545807
while I was there in the hospital,0.33308282494544983
up until that time I could not move my legs at all,0.28179872035980225
my hands I had I was no I couldnt do anything with it,0.306176096200943
I youknow was just thats why they didnt know if Id ever be able to do anything again,0.30812859535217285
but while I was in the hospital I started being able to move,0.29318034648895264
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was Id lost my ability to focus my eyes together,0.23401369154453278
so I can only see outof one eye at a time,0.24072138965129852
so I was wearing an eye patch over one side,0.25046396255493164
then Id wear it for a while over this side then youknow,0.26668617129325867
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldnt see with both eyes,0.2849661707878113
I can steer with both eyes,0.28410041332244873
but Id see different different things,0.38749197125434875
and so when I had the second stroke or well this third stroke in the hospital I the vision started clearing up,0.2709040939807892
and I remember telling me telling FirstnameS,0.43948641419410706
I said,0.5259465575218201
and and I sure enough I could,0.415033757686615
and then I also told her that that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit,0.3062676787376404
and youknow because when youre when youre paralyzed youre not sure whether its moving or not,0.3189021646976471
you think youre moving it,0.46699440479278564
but it really isnt,0.44925880432128906
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and indeed it was moving,0.40054211020469666
it was moving,0.4481145143508911
so whenever happened in this second stroke was was good for me because I was able to start moving my muscle,0.26096510887145996
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle,0.2951709032058716
and I was able to see with both eyes together,0.2977122962474823
so I was there two or three days,0.2582758367061615
and they took me back to the to the rehab hospital,0.32072341442108154
and at that point I was able to up until that point Id rmy primarily been doing rehab in terms of mental stuff,0.22003556787967682
and at that point then I was able to start doing smpu,0.3103506863117218
and youknow as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to youknow start make myself move my muscles,0.23605820536613464
my arm I can move my arm,0.3507658541202545
my hand still wouldnt move,0.33499789237976074
we just numbed it,0.4842727780342102
I couldnt do yth couldnt move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that,0.30118414759635925
and so I I do remember that when at that at that point,0.3420407176017761
and you you I dont know,0.43773114681243896
are you saying your question was,0.3538096249103546
was that the question,0.5201802253723145
yeah,1.0
and so I started working really hard,0.4033324718475342
I started working really hard because at that point I knew that I knew that,0.37994155287742615
well actually youknow I knew it before that,0.3972230553627014
that I was some at some point I was gonna get better,0.25692957639694214
I just couldnt do it,0.48346981406211853
but at that point when I was steblu,0.36677855253219604
and if I work at it hard enough Ill be able to get better,0.28762105107307434
so I I was in that rehab hospital for two rehab hospitals for awhile,0.2606973350048065
and then I went to a a long term care facility,0.28129053115844727
and I was there for a hundred days,0.28231796622276306
and they worked with me with a speech therapist a physical therapist and a occupational therapist,0.3522879481315613
and the hundred days,0.4367152154445648
I couldve used more but that was the limit for becauseof Medicare,0.2773545980453491
but that was that was total of six months that I was I was not able to come come home,0.27365225553512573
men,0.9999999403953552
so we put a put a put a lift on the back on the port,0.29464951157569885
and put one put a lift going upstairs because our is we have two story house,0.2518796920776367
and so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs,0.2890155017375946
I hadta I Id had some more rehab along,0.2846338450908661
I had rehab at home for about another six weeks of of rehab,0.22282247245311737
and he was very very good rehab rehab specialist,0.30151042342185974
I did some other youknow occupational and and and and occupational and physical and,0.4646393954753876
whats the third kind,0.3354913592338562
anyway Ill come Ill coming up with in a minute in a minute,0.20653223991394043
so I did that,0.5234090089797974
and but I I never did I I never did give up,0.41487395763397217
I always continued to work as hard as I could,0.3461129069328308
youknow I I had had a very good physical therapist to help me,0.27771010994911194
and so we worked hard on that,0.329241007566452
and that took me until,0.3170153796672821
and it actually and then I got when I was when I was still at,0.3398612439632416
then I went to we had therapy on an outpatient basis for awhile at a rehab hospital here on outpatient basis for several months,0.2345016747713089
and during that time I met a,0.3042517304420471
I dont really know how to describe him,0.3702312111854553
hes a hes kindof a hes hes kindof a,0.3301469385623932
he does not have a hes not hes not a phd,0.28365954756736755

but he is very very good at working with stroke people in in in terms of in terms of cognitive ability,0.2942979633808136
and and I worked with him for about almost four years,0.2995977997779846
and infact Ive just got work when I quit working with him maybe in the last six months,0.24111685156822205
we were went to his office went to,0.3130638003349304

and he would meet with people there at the university,0.3201499283313751
and I I was still in a wheelchair at that time,0.26956111192703247
and I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was when I was actually in in a walker for another another year,0.268634170293808
and then when when I went to walking with with a cane I continued working at with him,0.2916591465473175
but it his his his,0.5663074254989624
I witch,0.6277300119400024
but he works with with the cognitive abilities,0.4139452278614044
and he helped me alot youknow,0.23533670604228973
infact some of the things that weve done here is reminded me of some of the stuff that hes done that he did with me,0.2704843282699585
youknow ll telling stories and and and alot different tests that that Im sure youre very familiar with,0.25437796115875244
but he was he was able to work with me and just pull stuff outta me and make it work,0.26049110293388367
and maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was was kindof inspire me to keep going and working working working,0.2795073688030243
so I did that,0.5234090089797974
and I worked hard on that,0.316457062959671
and I I worked hard,0.36636239290237427
when I when I actually when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me I went to the YMCA,0.27899283170700073
and I got a membership in the yl and and hired at the yl a personal trainer who who didnt really know anything about strokes,0.2115519642829895
but she learned,0.5309979915618896
she was very good at studying and learning,0.31340163946151733
the first day that she saw me and I I was so stiff that that I couldnt move,0.27991634607315063
I I couldnt move any,0.40022599697113037
my arm was just,0.3675349950790405
I dont know if you can see it here,0.4489046037197113
its youknow your arm is just like this,0.29855862259864807
and it has clenched fist and everything,0.3096921741962433
and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like,0.2713426649570465
and it wouldnt move,0.34503260254859924
she worked with me,0.31667014956474304
I went twice a week to go with her,0.23761992156505585
and then in addition to that,0.4887401759624481
h but after a while I went started Id say,0.2397976666688919
I was I was still using my walker,0.3016681969165802
Id say,0.43231990933418274
and Im sure people probably thought stupid dumb,0.3113649785518646
heres this this old guy walking around with his youknow very very slowly,0.264525830745697
itd take me youknow itd take me,0.3306962251663208
it its six six times arounds,0.34945279359817505
and it would take me probably half hour to walk around that lap,0.28563153743743896
but I was I was determined to do it,0.3541162312030792
and I did it,0.3847059905529022
I did it,0.5835932493209839
and then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane,0.3011110723018646
I still go very slowly,0.3952714204788208
but Im doing it,0.3870195746421814
so Im gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself,0.2352134734392166
and Im not trying to pat pat myself on the back,0.22612731158733368
I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have,0.34501370787620544
and Im sorry for them,0.25810426473617554
they dont,0.5332629680633545
but and I think I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive,0.2788294851779938
I did not lose my drive,0.3628380000591278
always Ive always been kinda driven anyway,0.3885035514831543
youknow Ive always been driven,0.30565357208251953
but I was driven to r to improve and get better,0.2933087944984436
and Im still Im still doing that,0.3173978924751282
and Im getting there,0.3221694231033325
and it will never come to an end,0.3226098418235779
but it I will keep working at it,0.3332807421684265
okay,0.9999999403953552
well when I,0.4787690341472626
okay I tell you about my wife,0.41027185320854187
hows that,0.48881223797798157
at my wife,0.34593474864959717
I Id been married before,0.29903316497802734
my first wife had Huntingtons disease,0.26452797651290894
I dont dont know if youre familiar with it,0.3400768041610718
but she had Huntingtons disease for many many years,0.3022966682910919
and she passed away oh about twenty years ago,0.23258404433727264
I had a I had a friend,0.3958856165409088
now how do I go into this,0.35536980628967285
when she passed away before she passed away,0.4222923517227173
this gets complicated,0.4965602159500122
okay my my wifes my wifes brother my wifes brother had moved to Texas,0.3015860319137573
in the in the nineties they they moved to Texas,0.35251671075820923
and in Texas she met and became very close friends with someone in in Texas there that that she didnt know,0.23955826461315155
but they she met,0.437785267829895
they c youknow they worked together,0.3141779899597168
and they became very very close friends,0.41514408588409424
are you in for a long story,0.26986682415008545
so so my sister my sister inlaw sister inlaw her name is FirstnameD okay,0.28789064288139343
and so they moved to Texas,0.32181963324546814
and at some point they moved back to Wichita,0.2947137951850891
and he went to work for for Boeing okay,0.261891633272171
so at some point this friend of friend of hers was going through a divorce,0.2513194680213928
she shed been married for almost twenty years,0.3071920573711395
and and and it end didnt end up very well,0.28144025802612305
so she was going through a divorce,0.30232560634613037
and so FirstnameD who is my sister inlaw invited her to come to Wichita just because she needed somebody to youknow she she she needed to needed to get away from the situation that she was,0.2665672302246094
and so she she moved to chi Wichita,0.2511492371559143
and becauseof the friendship that my sister inlaw had with her we got to know know them,0.2850241959095001
my my wife and I got to know them,0.318732887506485
but not very well because my wife had Huntings,0.3736925721168518
and you dont socialize very much when you have that exist,0.34792640805244446
so I really did not know her them their friend very well,0.3954678773880005
but we did see them once in awhile when wed go ke go to a family gathering or go to their house because FirstnameD would be there,0.2594220042228699
and her friend would be there and and soforth,0.39827069640159607
and so that was that was like nineteen ninety one or something like that,0.34752997756004333
well to make a long story long FirstnameDs friend then moved to get got married got got married remarried and went to went and moved to California,0.24171124398708344
she was out there for about a year,0.28545665740966797
and she came back to Wichita,0.2944810390472412
and her and her husband he came back to Wichita,0.3319590389728546
and he had his her husband had a heart transplant,0.35379889607429504
if if he you having a hard time following following this thats okay,0.3133361339569092
Ill it Ill try to bring it all together,0.3293192684650421
she,0.9999998807907104
and it it didnt take very well youknow,0.2830469608306885
heart transplants theyre long drawn out,0.2891193926334381
and she,0.5627676844596863
and finally he gave out,0.3588614761829376
in the meantime my my wife with Huntingtons disease was moved to a,0.22802597284317017
we had her at a nursing home,0.27967569231987
she spent five years in a nursing home,0.28545907139778137
now then and her nursing home was the same town about four or five blocks away from FirstnameSs friend,0.2581433057785034
I had no idea they that she lived there,0.37576377391815186
youknow I had no idea that she lived in that in that town or anywhere,0.26078200340270996
so so at one point my wife finally youknow she went downhill and went downhill and and and passed away in two thousand two,0.23150144517421722
I called FirstnameD my sister inlaw to tell her that that FirstnameJ had passed away,0.25574323534965515
and FirstnameS and and no and FirstnameD said,0.517174482345581
FirstnameC just died yesterday,0.4301351308822632
and FirstnameC is FirstnameSs husband,0.37928056716918945
I say,0.6638233065605164
over over time I it and not right away but over time I,0.3899144232273102
FirstnameS was living up there in the in in in Sedrick the town of Sedrick where the nursing home was,0.30727139115333557
and at some point FirstnameS said or FirstnameD said,0.2760502099990845
I said,0.5259465575218201
so youknow after after after you lose a spouse its very difficult to for people to understand where youre going through when you lose a spouse,0.2799740433692932
and I I went I was in this little town where FirstnameS lived,0.27801597118377686
didnt really have any any didnt have any limits on fireworks,0.32851746678352356
okay thats only important because my kids wanted to have re wanted to have some fireworks,0.3179645836353302
and youknow oh oh my kids wanted to have some fireworks,0.2505861520767212
so I said,0.48068174719810486
well not my kids my grandkids,0.3929409384727478
I said,0.5259465575218201
so went up there went up there,0.3813934028148651
and and youknow I just said,0.3049989342689514
and she said,0.38078364729881287
so we did,0.5678117275238037
and then we started started kindof getting to know each other at that point,0.3354952931404114
because like I say you dont you you if unless youve lost a spouse you dont realize what its like,0.3520529568195343
and so FirstnameS I kindof had an immediate bond there because we had both lost recently lost our spouses,0.27503132820129395
and both of us had spouses that add,0.2825187146663666
it took years before he passed passed away and and my my wife,0.25396886467933655
and so youknow we started we youknow its it was a it was a t kinda a natural bond,0.23445582389831543
and so we tu,0.3450520634651184
and here we are,0.4391193389892578
and so FirstnameD is still FirstnameD is still FirstnameSs best friend,0.3664189577102661
infact she was here just yesterday or day before,0.3448876142501831
theyre still best friends,0.4111649990081787
and thats what happened to me was youknow my wet,0.2254992574453354
and that was fifteen years ago fifteen years ago that we got married almost fifteen,0.27854177355766296
wait a minute,0.4034503698348999
see lemme think,0.4642549157142639
lemme think,0.5070626139640808
no its over fifteen years,0.33930888772010803
it was fifteen last October,0.32740047574043274
okay,0.9999999403953552
okay,0.9999999403953552
well I is a theres a theres a little little boy,0.32355260848999023
not a real little boy,0.40339717268943787
hes not a little boy,0.309065580368042
hes maybe I dont know ten twelve something in there,0.24528831243515015
hes out kicking the soccer ball around,0.2809158265590668
hes hes wearing a ball cap,0.25244247913360596
and hes wearing jeans,0.2807081341743469
and hes kicking the soccer ball around,0.28394362330436707
and he kicks it kicks it really hard,0.36932772397994995
raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air,0.23801182210445404
and then it goes to it then you see the the soccer ball travels through the air and hits a window,0.2799544930458069
theres shutters on the window,0.33795419335365295
its its a nice size picture not a picture window good one good size window,0.312417209148407
and theres a bushes outside the window,0.34495848417282104
and it the the the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp,0.3155512809753418
knocks the lamp off the off outof knocks the lamp off the table,0.31173035502433777
but it knocks the lamp over,0.32463768124580383
and no,0.5103980302810669
so it knocks the lamp over and and comes through the window,0.3135360777378082
the guy is sitting there probably watching tv or something,0.3187107443809509
but he gets up picks up the soccer ball walks over to the window,0.2457893192768097
and youknow the the window,0.3766014873981476
I think we talked about this last time,0.42647385597229004
the window is there,0.4134533405303955
the the lamp where the where the where the soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore,0.35856929421424866
its the lamp is gone,0.29575058817863464
the curtains are are are little bit different,0.40936094522476196
theres Im not sure what what Im not sure what the,0.32301390171051025
yeah its theres there Im not sure what some of the something is there the,0.2867467403411865
anyway though theres a lady,0.3347651958465576
and but the the lamp and the chair are no longer there,0.35641342401504517
and I think the Im gonna say that the the window ledge is is lower than it was,0.20704637467861176
it just it looks different,0.5566093325614929
but the guy he looks out the window,0.3216800093650818
and I think I think he doesnt know where it came from,0.290712833404541
but I am sure hes probably going to find out,0.30984970927238464
and hes probably going to make somebodys pay for the window,0.27281105518341064
so the moral of that story is if youre gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesnt go through the window,0.19081217050552368
the end,0.6397038102149963
oh I forgot the beginning and the end last time didnt I,0.2432401031255722
okay the beginning is that they the the the the the little kid,0.41812002658843994
I think its a boy,0.2943974733352661
is going off to school,0.30675843358039856
and the mom tries to hand him a an umbrella,0.2672167122364044
and he says,0.3578353226184845
so he waves goodbye to the mom,0.269170343875885
hes got his backpack on,0.23182463645935059
head for school,0.4225577116012573
waves bye tell tells tells mom goodbye,0.35114794969558716
and shes standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesnt wanna take with him,0.2365291565656662
so he starts walking off to school,0.30147573351860046
and theres some some raindrops coming down not alot but just a few raindrops here and there,0.3304554224014282
and he looks up at the sky,0.2479637861251831
and hes like,0.2971847653388977
so he said,0.4265557527542114
and he turns around,0.3773512840270996
and he and its raining harder,0.429983913898468
and now the winds kinda blowing because the rains coming at an angle,0.2911076247692108
and its its quite a bit of rain because as he as he runs hes hes splashing,0.21968668699264526
so theres enough rain thats making making little splashes,0.3564700782299042
and hes kinda holding his hand up over his head like asthough hes gonna be able to stop the water off his head,0.20425580441951752
but he runs home,0.3674919307231903
and you can tell the say the mom is a little alittle perturbed but he get because he wouldnt take the umbrella,0.2564552426338196
so there there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet,0.2789710462093353
and the mom just kinda looks at him like,0.2754848301410675
he said,0.5283018350601196
so she gives him r umbrella,0.2510271370410919
and he head heads back to school,0.36552292108535767
and its still raining,0.5150871276855469
its still raining pretty hard,0.4185560643672943
its coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was,0.2441343516111374
so it must be lo blowing pretty hard at a forty five degree angle,0.2135828733444214
and hes walk hes got his backpack,0.22174708545207977
and hes walking off to school,0.258881539106369
and I the the moral of the story is listen to your mom,0.2684311270713806
she knows best,0.4272688925266266
the end,0.6397038102149963
oh yeah Ive seen this one before okay,0.2860296666622162
okay,0.9999999403953552
so the beginning is the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree,0.29952460527420044
and the little girl is upset because the cats up the tree,0.27701136469841003
and she cant get her down,0.2541514039039612
I think shes calling the cat to come down,0.24863700568675995
but the cat wont come down,0.24810472130775452
so either cat wont or cant,0.3400619626045227
but it looks like the cat really doesnt care to come down,0.29850122332572937
hes like,0.3313570022583008
so the little girl says youknow,0.29933613538742065
and shes the little girl is probably,0.2981122136116028
I dont know,0.538106381893158
shes pretty young because shes still riding a tricycle,0.2906050980091095
and she got pigtails and little black sandals,0.31623977422714233
like I said shes riding riding that little ik tricycle,0.24939091503620148
the cat wont the cat wont come down,0.23019227385520935
so apparently the the the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down,0.26378268003463745
and he he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there,0.26449254155158997
and something happened,0.5064046382904053
Im gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree ran into the ladder or something,0.18991778790950775
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down,0.32059144973754883
the dads stuck in the tree,0.28707635402679443
and I dont know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone,0.21659664809703827
maybe its maybe,0.4911668598651886
I dont know,0.538106381893158
thats he musta had a cellphone,0.2647356390953064
he calls the fire department,0.38120341300964355
and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters,0.3835393488407135
and theyre carrying their ladder,0.3715628385543823
and theyre running over to get the man down outta outta the tree,0.23707091808319092
meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree,0.30755317211151123
I dont know if hes I dont think I dont think hes mad,0.35775208473205566
I think hes just barking up the kriu,0.29554733633995056
so the the firemen are on their way,0.36073705554008484
theyve got their ladder,0.321689248085022
trucks sitting out and set on the setting out on the street,0.35811084508895874
theres a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away,0.3019813299179077
and yeah then thats thats pretty much it,0.3470609784126282
its a its a its a big tree big tree,0.3946707248687744
yeah both,0.4540558159351349
and it is its summertime because the trees have leaves on on,0.30092036724090576
yeah okay well thats thats about good,0.3409269154071808
okay,0.9999999403953552
www,1.0000001192092896
okay,0.9999999403953552
alright well at the beginning I I dont know if this is true or not,0.273752361536026
I dont know if this is really what what happened in the story,0.3217184245586395
but looks like it looks like that for some reason maybe somebody took somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else,0.3040623068809509
and I dont know the story behind that,0.2772217094898224
but thats what it looks like,0.44553154706954956
and then so she says,0.3707376718521118
well when when shes gone it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend,0.24281460046768188
she musta she musta been sleeping in the out in the stable with the animals I guess,0.26583150029182434
she in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters,0.26838451623916626
she was doing their laundry,0.30727922916412354
she was doing all the work,0.3607185184955597
and like I said she had become more of a slave than than anything else,0.2508006691932678
so they lived in the in the shadow of of the castle,0.3553016483783722
and I think she dreamt about the castle,0.29669931530952454
looks like she was in the one picture it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that,0.26606279611587524
thats what it looks like anyway,0.43843522667884827
and so it turns out that the that the king little short fat king,0.35372158885002136
I dont know why the little short why the king is always short and fat but he is,0.24844932556152344
is looking for somebody to marry his his daughter,0.283637136220932
and he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom sothat the the the the girls can have their their pick of,0.2959500849246979
they cant have their pick,0.335126131772995
but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball,0.26186272501945496
and theyll have a chance to show off to to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him,0.2701130509376526
so he sent out this invitation,0.30466118454933167
and ofcourse the the the the wicked stepmother or the whatever she is the mother she ofcourse doesnt let doesnt want Cinderella to go to the ball,0.2514551281929016
so the other girls go off to the ball,0.2896779179573059
and Cinderella stays home,0.3335287868976593
and and shes gotta tend to the animals or whatever,0.2504199743270874
so the fairy godmother came along,0.3055567145347595
and Im not sure how she got into the story,0.21795634925365448
but she came along,0.3743681311607361
the fairy godmother showed up and with a with a carriage a pumpkin,0.319877952337265
it was that the I guess fairy godmother turned the turned the turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a for the r for Cinderella to ride in,0.24086235463619232
they went to the went to the ball with the two horses and and the footman and the and the driver and all that,0.37865549325942993
they went to the went to the ball they went to the ball but they went to the ball,0.36182138323783875
and the nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful,0.2942149043083191
so she the the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the pumpkin,0.22000333666801453
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is,0.29641246795654297
they up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see its about a minute before midnight,0.21559734642505646
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the before the the pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while its still a carriage,0.29143446683883667
runs or runs and dnu,0.4231233298778534
but in the way she lost her slipper,0.29626864194869995
she was running down the stairs,0.3400029242038727
the slipper fell off,0.37794816493988037
and she didnt have time to go back and pick it up I guess,0.2566501796245575
so she went on got in the carriage with youknow the carriage and went home,0.25046294927597046
the the prince was heartbroken because he and and me because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the who had come to the ball,0.2837059497833252
and nobody knew who she was,0.3458680510520935
but he had fallen in love with her,0.31153595447540283
and so he sent he sent eryb he sent his man or servants or whatever out to find this the person whose foot would fit in the slipper,0.22433610260486603
and so they went to Cinderellas house,0.3047165274620056
and ofcourse the the two sisters there they tried it on,0.346804141998291
and ofcourse it didnt fit,0.28826117515563965
and so the Cinderella was there as a servant,0.29407742619514465
and I think the I think the fairy godmother or something said made worked it out somehow that sothat the the the prince would try the slipper on Cinderellas foot,0.26117515563964844
and sure enough it fit perfectly,0.45429521799087524
it was perfectly obvious whose whose foot it was,0.3034314215183258
and it was Cinderellas,0.3251926302909851
and so everybody was happy,0.3575130105018616
all the animals were happy,0.40143924951553345
the the animals were l the the little rats,0.3937155306339264
everyone was celebrating as the as Cinderella gets in the the the carriage with the prince,0.35127583146095276
and they ride off into the distance and live happily ever after,0.3047020137310028
you get you you get some you got some bread,0.5321725010871887

my speech today is doing pretty good,0.34350574016571045
some days not,0.470122754573822
yes I had a stroke at the school,0.2226192057132721
and I was a teacher,0.3198920786380768
and I had had headaches for about a week or so and still working during the day,0.2822701632976532
and they said allofasudden I said,0.36781996488571167
and allofasudden I I was talking to the the nurse thats at the school,0.26201626658439636
and she said,0.38078364729881287
and I kept I was trying I was talking,0.3232935667037964
I thought what I was saying was right,0.41465914249420166
and I kept saying,0.341778039932251
and she kept saying,0.36517655849456787
and obviously my talking was not even all there,0.3962130546569824
and I dont remember anything from that point to I was I had this tube in there,0.25876498222351074
I got my brain done,0.4248006343841553
I got I had a tube going,0.3345763087272644
I was out,0.41595983505249023
it breathes you and everything,0.4871678948402405
I dont rimmbvu,0.5639047622680664
I didnt even know my name,0.3433695137500763
I didnt know who I was,0.34952524304389954
they gave me a mirror to know who I was,0.25992336869239807
and I didnt know it was me,0.29843586683273315
I thought it was a picture of someone else,0.3148115277290344
so yeah for that long,0.36923912167549133
so I had about two weeks of not here,0.2818590998649597
yes,0.9999998807907104
lets see,0.5765541791915894
at the beginning I had I could not walk yet,0.2971922755241394
so they were helping me to stand up at the beginning not walking anywhere but able to stand up,0.30803683400154114
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side,0.2857080399990082
so I had one therapist that bet,0.3437555134296417
this one arm was not always going,0.3770821988582611
so weights trying to get that going,0.43644481897354126
then I had another therapist was trying to get me to start talking,0.3177179992198944
I couldnt really talk of anything,0.3414723873138428
so they were showing me like yesq or noq alot,0.2968067228794098
I we had to start with that,0.3561226725578308
sometimes I didnt really even understand if they said,0.4184623658657074
usually they would show me that,0.4713614284992218
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
Id so that was hard,0.3176298141479492
even at the beginning I didnt even understand cups,0.2741125226020813
and they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere,0.30936288833618164
and they showed me how to they hadta show me how to eat again,0.33716467022895813
to at the beginning I was very very scared by myself in a room,0.2420576959848404
I also thought we had I I thought someone had took me like like a bad person taking me,0.333869606256485
so I was trying to run to help myself,0.35744330286979675
I had those thoughts too of scared to the point where I was trying to hit people in a way because I thought they were trying to help no I thought they were bad people,0.29712334275245667
so I I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run,0.31975746154785156
that was even that part for me,0.38714271783828735
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way,0.3125882148742676
didnt my mom and dad were there,0.2380269467830658
didnt know who they were,0.3469145596027374
my kids were here,0.3836471140384674
didnt know them,0.44967612624168396
like I said they showed me a mirror,0.2893773317337036
and they said,0.4319881200790405
and I I thought,0.4804207384586334
and it was me,0.3460506200790405
so thats when it got started,0.34259137511253357
then therapy started with even very small like saying my name saying yesq or noq,0.2956983745098114
went from that point to we played some games for numbers like dice,0.2572232186794281
we played some games that were cards like play cards in a way put sort all the cards together what colors matching,0.2893018424510956
h little things,0.48430532217025757
it gives me focus,0.3576117753982544
and also I would lksu,0.42720770835876465
if were playing a game I was okay,0.24904468655586243
so we did that,0.523968517780304
then they started giving me cards,0.37474265694618225
what the first one I ever saw was a baby,0.2971644103527069
theres a baby card,0.29249584674835205
and there was a bird,0.34193679690361023
and they said,0.4319881200790405
is it a bird or a baby,0.33296647667884827
and it took,0.34608906507492065
I didnt know,0.48587071895599365
but I knew it a little bit in my brain,0.32196536660194397
but not really on what they were youknow,0.37880581617355347
it was happy thoughts,0.4280640184879303
but I dont know I wasnt sure what that was,0.33752012252807617
thats when it started,0.38742750883102417
then I was able to start not walking very well,0.33378082513809204
but I could stand up pivot sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself,0.24555134773254395
thats when all that started during,0.3922092318534851
once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning,0.23704400658607483
I still do have to watch my dizzy feelings,0.34356406331062317
but therapy that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better stuff like that,0.3407851457595825
and other therapy was still doing the talking started at the beginning,0.36408472061157227
so its that was about a year of just talking working on all those words and all that youknow,0.2820281684398651
then after two years didnt have to worry about the other therapy because now Im starting to walk very well now,0.24672947824001312
so only just therapy for for speech,0.40006646513938904
then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years we started working on these numbers which I still not good at,0.2495419681072235
I went from one to now I know one and two to one two three,0.30619555711746216
Im not higher than that not very good so youknow,0.3175690174102783
and one plus one not sure there yet,0.3841448426246643
but so was working on numbers and trying to start reading of any kind,0.29350200295448303
reading it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading,0.24795500934123993
Im still not all there,0.3883835971355438
now its been three years,0.3708389401435852
I can I really cant read I say,0.41613519191741943
sentences maybe,0.5596064329147339
it depends on what were talking about,0.33175840973854065
Im starting to read books from ke little kids books,0.23195721209049225
now I can do some of that,0.3447384834289551
writing is not as good,0.3894931674003601
so I use my phone,0.39823028445243835
but therapy people was showing me ke apps stuff like that,0.2738495469093323
because someday if you cant write again theres other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that,0.307523250579834
so well I cant remember the first thing were talking about,0.27807605266571045
sorry about that,0.5292628407478333
see this is me,0.3952708840370178
okay kzu,0.9999999403953552
lets see,0.5765541791915894
I does it have to so what,0.44399628043174744
are you talking about just a story are you saying,0.3773317337036133
or are you saying ke something about something like that,0.3811679482460022
okay I think is is new stuff,0.33101198077201843
I I think since since Im a teacher,0.30202311277389526
and I was before,0.3615875840187073
but now I hafta be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school right,0.20976321399211884
so one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke,0.27054744958877563
they have aphasia,0.5185590982437134
and we when theres a new patient here I I like to help them,0.3165164291858673
theyre gonna have the the same struggles most of the time that I had,0.2781447768211365
and so now we we are now friends,0.41833385825157166
I can help them to have her,0.4108714163303375
and tips I can give them,0.3485477864742279
and so now when I do that kind of stuff Im now a teacher again,0.26492616534233093
so I I like that,0.5649051666259766
and theyre also now my friends,0.32877475023269653
I when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back,0.32334449887275696
so I havent seen some of them now for years,0.2691178023815155
they dont call me back,0.3613539934158325
they dont understand me now,0.41344913840293884
so my new friends are kinda like me,0.34271878004074097
were very we talk alot which is good,0.24716758728027344
but I think that we have bad days,0.43344932794570923
therapy is hard some days,0.31853222846984863
some days our brain mine my I would say my brain doesnt always work some days,0.2791331708431244
my eyes dont always work,0.34292787313461304
my foot now that were talking my foots not working right now,0.3132047951221466
things like that,0.6637841463088989
but my life being a teacher and a friend is is an awesome thing to me,0.27188023924827576
yeah yeah,1.0
okay,0.9999999403953552
I cant see us on the last one because were in the middle ourselves,0.22780224680900574
so Im not sure whats under the last one,0.23927496373653412
looks like theres a boy thats been hitting the ball round,0.26167330145835876
probably a,0.638850748538971
I remember the name of those little guys,0.295540988445282
but theyre playing that ball,0.40237754583358765
and it looks he hit the window,0.28189292550086975
and it hit the window and went in,0.2855113446712494
so it crashed the window,0.3515135645866394
yeah,1.0
and I dont know if its his house or not,0.25233742594718933
it could be someone elses house,0.43225130438804626
but and he also hit the lamp also,0.3216552138328552
and the guy,0.38034385442733765
Im gonna move this again just a minute and Ill,0.2177852839231491
so the guy is well he has the ball,0.26898613572120667
but I dont know if he,0.43307626247406006
yeah hes just looking,0.33986571431159973
so I dont know if that kid decided to leave,0.35427308082580566
or if hes gone,0.2604348957538605
so that that must be there should be more story line on that one,0.3941326439380646
I dont know if he he ran or if the if the guys just going,0.28469008207321167
okay okay,0.9999997019767761
one of the kids have,0.362568736076355
and mom said,0.3017248213291168
and the kid said,0.28138113021850586
and Im sure mom said,0.21319395303726196
and so but he went outside,0.371364563703537
and here comes the rain going faster even maybe more raindrops,0.35698819160461426
and so then he said,0.36447158455848694
he went the other way home and said,0.299277663230896
and so mom gave it to him,0.2892300486564636
and then he went back outside for school with the blu,0.2954255938529968
yes thats a funny one,0.3307832181453705
okay,0.9999999403953552
it it looks like theres a cat stuck in the tree,0.26897770166397095
and so dad said,0.3030392527580261
and the ladder fell down,0.3692081868648529
and so someone mustve called the fire people,0.2870010435581207
and theyre going to get him outof the the tree and maybe even the cat,0.26972705125808716
lets see,0.5765541791915894
there,1.0000001192092896
yeah I dont know if its really dad I guess,0.38544222712516785
maybe its just someone who is helping for the cat,0.2670573890209198
or if its youknow the little girls dad that did that,0.2695932686328888
Im not sure,0.3635326027870178
I dont see any houses around,0.29904213547706604
so its hard to tell,0.3365035951137543
she had her bike I guess,0.3591631352901459
but and theres a dog obviously thats barking because theres a guy up there in the in the tree,0.28806445002555847
so yep,0.5866681337356567
okay,0.9999999403953552
I dont remember her name sorry,0.3311663269996643
its hard,0.537883996963501
okay,0.9999999403953552
she,0.9999998807907104
lets see,0.5765541791915894
I dont remember where she comes from,0.2624499499797821
but shes in the the house with the,0.3567369878292084
its not her mom,0.33757323026657104
its,1.0
I dont remember what calls that,0.3843020498752594
but its not her mommomnn youknow,0.33794665336608887
and but theres two other sisters,0.3768497705459595
and they get to do whatever they want during the day,0.35372021794319153
but the other girl hasta clean and and do all the stuff that who wants to do right,0.29772454500198364
and Im sure shes but shes yeah she watches the the castle the big one,0.22446973621845245
and Im sure that she watches and thinks,0.2778838276863098
and then they we get a letter that says theyre gonna do a,0.2593349516391754
lets see what,0.46101629734039307
its not a party,0.4247053265571594
theres a word but I dont have it,0.3114387094974518
the ball,0.5780216455459595
thats what they call it yeah,0.38086169958114624
so like a party in a way,0.32635125517845154
but you dance and look beautiful,0.412994384765625
and everyone could go,0.39615774154663086
and I think theyre going to do that because they want the prince,0.3837472200393677
I think hes a prince,0.31262725591659546
and he finds he needs to find a lady,0.27693089842796326
and so theres a way to do it I think,0.32450634241104126
so they said,0.49252068996429443
and so when they got their paper I think she even gets to go,0.31759101152420044
she didnt say she couldnt go,0.32378560304641724
but she had a beautiful dress in her,0.32306647300720215
I say its not its not a a box,0.2880433201789856
its something pretty,0.4614792466163635
but I dont know what they call those things,0.4279755651950836
and but she was looking at the dress,0.30114203691482544
and oh Im gonna look so good,0.22513243556022644
and the other girls they dont look as cute,0.2526807487010956
but they they she they looked her stuff,0.4961177110671997
and they wanted this and that and dress and tore her dress and everything,0.38398119807243347
and so they were gonna go,0.28030818700790405
and she looked she didnt have thing,0.31820476055145264
and so she was sad,0.3047695755958557
and the fairy,0.49250972270965576
I think thats what she is,0.36388418078422546
I dont remember,0.49512580037117004
right now shes different than the one you watch her another way,0.31267428398132324
useta be a small one,0.4332657754421234
now shes a a real lady,0.3058810830116272
but she was there,0.4753941595554352
and she said,0.38078364729881287
and so she takes the the rats and and the dog and everything become people,0.3638686239719391
and the pumpkin they make it pretty for her to go in there,0.26990246772766113
and they gave her a dress that looks beautiful,0.31399375200271606
and she said,0.38078364729881287
and so she may forget that part at the beginning,0.2998157739639282
shes just shes so excited,0.35686472058296204
she doesnt think about the time very well really laughs,0.3210059404373169
and so so then,0.5728992223739624
lets see,0.5765541791915894
she gets in there,0.3453707993030548
and Im sure that everyone says,0.2839852571487427
and but the,0.6165547370910645
hes not a king yet,0.32399946451187134
the prince sees her and said,0.3224601745605469
and so they dance and and everything,0.5131704211235046
and allofasudden she does figure out the time,0.31769856810569763
and she looks at that and says,0.3065803349018097
and so she runs down the stairs,0.2880393862724304
but one of her theyre not shoes heels,0.26524150371551514
I dont know,0.538106381893158
theres theres ru,0.373808354139328
I dont know,0.538106381893158
I say shoes,0.4921704828739166
so she one of them falls,0.3202897310256958
and she gets home,0.3612389862537384
and you could tell she was she had a good night,0.29496052861213684
but shes probably also kindof sad on the fact she never gets to come back in her head youknow,0.24196414649486542
but it was a beautiful night,0.37647777795791626
and then shes back at home cleaning and everything else,0.30046796798706055
and here comes one of the people who works for the youknow the king and guy Im sure,0.2436525821685791
so they bring this guy,0.4208361804485321
and he has one of the shoes and says he they want to find the pretty one,0.2557871639728546
and those girls ofcourse theyre hoping they know theyre not her shoes,0.3452913761138916
but they said,0.5177980065345764
and ofcourse their usually have big feet or who knows,0.2990552484989166
but I dont xxx that part of that story,0.272614985704422
but I remember it before,0.5170713067054749
and then so allofasudden she gets to decide now,0.358431875705719
I dont know if they really the I dont think the other mom wouldve let her even try it,0.31943851709365845
but Im sure someone I dont I dont one of the one of the rats figure this out or something,0.242418110370636
they they help her to to sit down and put them on,0.3439176380634308
so there must be kindof thing going on to help her to do that,0.3515413999557495
and then and they fit,0.480356901884079
and so she gets to come back to the castle,0.31754741072654724
and they get married,0.3606451451778412
and oh and the end is always the,0.3237297832965851
oh whats the word,0.286500483751297
I wish I had it in my head,0.30569177865982056
but its not there,0.5105135440826416
youknow they always say at the end,0.26463741064071655
ke alwaysq,0.9999999403953552
well what is those words,0.3929383158683777
I wish I remember the name,0.3806585669517517
it was like it always says the end of all the stories,0.2979430854320526
afterq,0.0
h I dont have it,0.3577844500541687
but Im excited about it,0.3473879098892212
so and they are always together,0.49294552206993103
youknow they always do,0.47917667031288147
yeah,1.0
oh okay now Im going to show you theres another way to do this,0.28057169914245605
so Im gonna give you the real stu,0.22587701678276062
so if you want peanut butter jelly right together,0.40333014726638794
so the first thing you need is two bread slices,0.29496538639068604
and then whats weird about it you deed,0.3036395311355591
and you take some of the peanut butter,0.32662615180015564
and you put it in the cup,0.2623627185821533
and then you get some of the jelly,0.3325197398662567
and it has to be a certain kind because my dad only says you can have this kind,0.3153727948665619
I dont know its one of those things,0.28670135140419006
and you put that in there,0.38080844283103943
and you get a spoon,0.3137251138687134
and you stir it like this,0.39667966961860657
I dont know Ive done this since I was a kid,0.295061320066452
and then you take it outof the cup,0.276254802942276
and you put it on the bread together,0.3280625343322754
and then you put them together like this,0.44082558155059814
and the you eat it that way,0.3915782570838928
although when youre a kid youre also go,0.2870897054672241
dad only lets you do that part because this is his smwtu,0.292223185300827
you get part of the the from the spoon,0.33483052253723145
yeah,1.0
my speech I think theyre not too bad,0.34705469012260437
better than it was it was before,0.38160353899002075
yeah doing very well,0.44304022192955017
not a hundred percent but youknow good enough right,0.32916778326034546
yes its been a little bit more than three years,0.2686014473438263
yeah right about a week before my birthday,0.2695615291595459
yes had my stroke,0.34356269240379333
I had been having headaches,0.44615259766578674
and I was I was a teacher working at a school and working,0.2861897051334381
and during that day my headache was getting more worse,0.296978235244751
and I went to the nurse that day at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile,0.2340821474790573
and as we were talking she looked at me funny,0.22710050642490387
and she said that,0.4145136773586273
and I thought I was talking fine,0.35369253158569336
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that,0.33008477091789246
and she knew that I was having a stroke from that,0.31928905844688416
and they called five six seven eight nineoneone,0.4986644387245178
and I dont remember,0.338728666305542
right after that when they,0.554534912109375
I remember being in the what do you call it in the,0.2906256914138794
its not a car youknow,0.2692742645740509
its not a truck,0.3517388701438904
its is being in there laying down youknow,0.26120686531066895
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions,0.30040931701660156
but I could not think,0.5660677552223206
at that point it was getting worse as it goes,0.29499387741088867
and they ended up taking me,0.30991753935813904
and one of the guys who does brains he found a spot,0.24483057856559753
they made it a picture,0.40269050002098083
they said that youre having you have a clot in your brain in the back,0.294241726398468
and its starting to blood,0.4277249276638031
and it starts to take part of your what do you call it ke cells in a way that die,0.23230211436748505
and so he he ended up giving me surgery at that point and fixed it pretty much yeah,0.23910640180110931
so Im still here today,0.4028874635696411
but the clot is still here,0.40879592299461365
it hasnt left,0.2823546230792999
so thats why Im taking the medicine I am,0.24680908024311066
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I it happened again,0.39419683814048767
they said I was taking medicine that rktdu,0.3421654999256134
it most people dont have trouble with it,0.33302682638168335
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think,0.31596171855926514
theyre hoping that they,0.5344380736351013
yeah its one of those things,0.32499438524246216
yup,1.0
I think at the beginning the first thing they were helping me to stand up to be able to walk again,0.2901647388935089
they were more into that at the very beginning than other ke aphasia type stuff,0.2636353075504303
they wanted to make sure I was able to to walk again and because my one side of my body was starting to have trouble they said,0.28218597173690796
so they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning,0.31051063537597656
they started doing some little task for me,0.37138330936431885
ke we played cards to see how many cards I can find looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that,0.25597691535949707
but we were doing that just here and there feeling,0.4690925180912018
I was also very sad very emotional feeling,0.36875757575035095
didnt I couldnt even remember who I was,0.3408321142196655
and so getting to work on therapy when you dont know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff,0.2695784270763397
once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year,0.2547949552536011
so said,0.5614017844200134
so once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit we started working on therapy,0.27460891008377075
and they said,0.4319881200790405
and my talking I couldnt say pretty much any I couldnt say anything,0.32452890276908875
they were saying like,0.49348607659339905
I didnt understand what that meant,0.43741071224212646
so theyd give me ke a cup,0.22869430482387543
theyd take the cup and show me,0.23484505712985992
and Id go yesq or noq,0.25951123237609863
it took me a l even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it,0.364806592464447
if you dont want it it goes this way,0.4396621286869049
took that long to figure that out,0.35885342955589294
little things like that that I didnt remember,0.43493691086769104
then once I was able to atleast think a little bit more we started with pictures like that bird and the and the boy and the banana,0.2770756483078003
and we start that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words,0.295223593711853
and my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else,0.2128918319940567
so still working on therapy myself,0.3674512803554535
I have a book at home that I still do my homework everyday,0.28892844915390015
so still going,0.6503345370292664
its I Im the only thing I cant do right now yet is read and write,0.22926798462867737
and I said but I told myself that Im going to do it,0.31310102343559265
so Im not done yet when it comes to coming up youknow,0.26773762702941895
Im going to read someday,0.31506970524787903
and I will write,0.33949995040893555
and I will have numbers at some point,0.3163165748119354
so yeah,0.6882684230804443
lets see,0.5765541791915894
lets lets see,0.6236037015914917
I oh one of my from a long time ago when I was I dont know ten fifteen right in there youknow teens in a way we had my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage,0.18279637396335602
and we on the weekends you went to the cottage,0.29237082600593567
and we wouldnt go every weekend,0.270920991897583
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools youknow,0.2853536307811737
we would take that time,0.4853935241699219
and I think that was one my favorite places to go,0.276486337184906
we could fish,0.5113620162010193
we could swim,0.47777536511421204
we could,0.6974726915359497
and it wasnt very deep,0.28805285692214966
there was alot,0.3492506146430969
now it was deep in the middle,0.32090064883232117
but right now Imean you could didnt really hafta swim,0.3203551769256592
you could just walk around a little bit,0.4207158088684082
there were frogs,0.39722681045532227
there was turtles at,0.32807445526123047
so Imean it was we got up in the morning,0.2573549151420593
and I think we ate as fast as we could to be to go outside,0.2614279091358185
and I think youre pretty much outside until its time to go to bed,0.2633229196071625
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that all the fun things that we were able to do,0.3290828466415405
ke my dad let me,0.3737313151359558
we useta have a rowboat that had paddles,0.33004099130630493
but we also had one that had the motor in the back,0.3497411906719208
and it now youre you were not allowed to go fast,0.30732738971710205
it was like two what do you call it ke no five fast,0.23225967586040497
so it wasnt very fast,0.361728310585022
you could almost swim as fast as you can the youknow the boat,0.2502189874649048
but they let me actually mow s,0.33263877034187317
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that that paddle boat and stuff like that,0.3020680546760559
I loved to to drive,0.4044441878795624
I just thought that was really cool,0.47178930044174194
Im not sure why now it was like it was such a big thing,0.26792535185813904
but it was youknow,0.4144788980484009
and I was by myself on the boat youknow,0.21791081130504608
and I thought I was something else youknow and all that,0.33552148938179016
we forgot the gas one time,0.3277200758457184
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid,0.2583995461463928
but I think that was,0.4830901324748993
and at night we had we had ke a a place to lay down outside,0.23128211498260498
and we would go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty,0.2969546914100647
and I I think when I have my if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage,0.2820504903793335
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads,0.3289364278316498
I think about that place,0.48545950651168823
I dont know why,0.510981023311615
yeah,1.0
www,1.0000001192092896
theres a boy outside that was hitting the ball around and having fun Im sure,0.23314756155014038
and but as he was going by he hit the ball on the window,0.24470488727092743
and it broke,0.3507373332977295
and it actually went in the house with it,0.3497673273086548
so the that ball fell into someone elses house,0.29277142882347107
and Im sure the guy,0.22046512365341187
I cant see that he has a picture,0.24620972573757172
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously,0.3070058226585388
but it even hit the lamp and everything,0.36292940378189087
and so he was looking to see youknow what happened,0.27236947417259216
so hes looking for the the kid,0.25323113799095154
so we dont know if he took off or if he was going oops feeling or what,0.251514196395874
we dont see him in the picture now,0.24932432174682617
so at the end all we know is that the theres a guy with the ball looking for to outside to see whats happening,0.26127907633781433
yeah,1.0
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened,0.2905953824520111
we dont know what happens this time,0.44338279962539673
okay,0.9999999403953552
in the morning the the little boy are,0.3450729250907898
and mom had looked at the weather and said,0.2637511193752289
and said,0.5136677026748657
and the boy said,0.30375778675079346
and so mom said,0.3011833429336548
and okay,0.4199686646461487
and so he said bye mom and went to school started walking,0.21977414190769196
and here comes the rain,0.3905712068080902
and it started probably even more rain as it looked,0.3563154637813568
and so he ran to come home the other way,0.289800763130188
and lets see,0.37760376930236816
so he went back in the house probably and said,0.2890094518661499
and so she said,0.35228464007377625
and so he put it on the brlu,0.3007485270500183
done,1.0000001192092896
okay,0.9999999403953552
theres a cat that was going up this tree on that bird,0.2714426517486572
and I think it was up there and stuck,0.2872743606567383
and so this little girl was watching and thought,0.37263745069503784
and there was probably a guy walking by,0.28548598289489746
and he thought,0.4876105487346649
and but he got up there,0.3435310423374176
and now hes stuck too it looks like,0.29132527112960815
and someone saw the guy up there,0.2925718128681183
and the firetruck called and said,0.3782951533794403
and so they brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down,0.29624950885772705
yeah,1.0
okay,0.9999999403953552
alright,0.9999998807907104
so lets see,0.4961722791194916
she she,0.9999998211860657
I think her mom mustve died because dad is finding a new a very bad lady,0.21788328886032104
and now shes here stepmom in a way now right and with two girls,0.25520938634872437
and they come to their really nice place,0.41757094860076904
and she hasta do all the dishes and the laundry and everything,0.31346526741981506
and the other girls actually they were even doing ke either singing,0.3685952425003052
or they do their little mstrmntsu,0.4606058597564697
theyre doing all of that during the day and having their fun,0.3317031264305115
and they found out that theres going to be a a ball youknow kind of thing,0.2670789361000061
and everyone can go and everything,0.41439035534858704
and the so she goes to get a dress,0.2744365632534027
and it was new in my head on the fact that the the birds I think and maybe see others a little friends helped her to make even bru,0.24886782467365265
its one of those things that they lock,0.3954058289527893
and they got outof there,0.32579854130744934
it looks really pretty,0.6548937559127808
but shes like,0.3723388910293579
but its gonna look pretty,0.29783105850219727
but then the birds said,0.36375892162323
and they maybe even some of the little mice or something whoever they are youknow were helping to put her her dress look even better,0.2989744246006012
and they got it done,0.3721824884414673
and shes gonna go too,0.21359576284885406
and but she also cant have a ride because theyre going youknow the the mom and the two girls get to go together,0.22915595769882202
so she had to find a way to to go,0.3238176703453064
and and as as they were leaving they said,0.39644095301628113
I want this and this that you have,0.48034754395484924
and so that was they took all of her beads and everything that was pretty,0.3047640025615692
and so now she doesnt have ride to get to be there,0.28280800580978394
and also her dress was torn and everything,0.3304421305656433
and she found the,0.4403468370437622
I cant remember what her name is,0.2560960650444031
shes like a fairy,0.3104797601699829
I dont I dont remember what they call those little guys,0.3939012289047241
but anyway youknow shes just sitting here and there,0.35597994923591614
shes there to to help you,0.3770311176776886
and she said,0.38078364729881287
and so they get that done,0.43388473987579346
and all of the little mice become youknow like guys,0.27408793568611145
oh and the so as one of the I think their dog goes and youknow as one of as one of the guys that doing the driving and all that,0.27662280201911926
and so that thats how she gets there,0.3675706684589386
and once gets here Im sure that theyre gonna be like,0.2420465648174286
and they wont be very excited about that the fact that she made it here,0.3141012191772461
and she looks really good,0.42087528109550476
and so then the here is the new,0.38136276602745056
hes not a king yet,0.32399946451187134
hes a princess,0.34163472056388855
no thats a thats a guy thats a girl not a king,0.32960790395736694
see I dont remember whose is whose,0.25423794984817505
but youknow its one of the the the its the kings kid in a way right,0.3269333243370056
and he finds her and says,0.3612312078475952
and so theyre dancing and everything,0.4124637544155121
and then she she looked at the clock which I now I forget to tell you,0.27577096223831177
but youknow shes only allowed shes only she is only allowed to be there until midnight,0.2787351608276367
and so shes kept looking at the clock,0.22946804761886597
shes good at that,0.2942701578140259
shes watching,0.3847907781600952
and so as they were dancing and everything she thought,0.395914763212204
and so ofcourse he probably said,0.3583381175994873
and she said,0.38078364729881287
so shes running,0.3350229859352112
and Im sure even the one of the guys who worked there even had a question,0.26463693380355835
and she I think she said,0.3696769177913666
and so as she went one of her shoes fall,0.238910973072052
and she gets all the way home,0.33080291748046875
and ofcourse you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for youknow back,0.2515004873275757
and theres the dog and everybodys sitting there,0.37519562244415283
and Im sure shes thinking,0.2531002163887024
and I dont know if shes even a know she ever see her him again,0.29510676860809326
but at least she had a real beautiful day night youknow,0.25766974687576294
and then but theres theres a guy coming back at all the houses I think youknow to see where that that shoe came from,0.25691863894462585
and I think that the mom that new mom said,0.2944091558456421
which they probably knew it was her at the beginning youknow because she looked way too good,0.29585522413253784
and so they locked her in the like in her room or in the palace or who knows she is,0.24413441121578217
I dont know,0.538106381893158
its always bad over there youknow that,0.33112993836402893
shes they stuck her in there,0.2828983664512634
and but here comes the one little mice that got the key to let her in to get outta there,0.2673545181751251
and so when she got in there they said,0.30899375677108765
and and she doesnt look good,0.2832546532154083
so youknow I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point,0.2953585684299469
and then there she is,0.3778688907623291
she said,0.5303276181221008
and so she sits down,0.2897462844848633
and it fit,0.4148181676864624
and so so she she made it,0.41037002205848694
and so they put her youknow took her back over to the the castle,0.2755814790725708
and they get a marry,0.3243589699268341

so on the day that I had my stroke in the ftrununu,0.2682102620601654
and I thought I was dying really,0.4115639626979828
so I went to the the er,0.2614932060241699
and I had stones kidding,0.35019978880882263
Ill tell you I would never want anyone to ever have that,0.4074459969997406
so they gave me some pills and told me just go home,0.2907794713973999

and Im not really good with pills,0.29265883564949036
it makes me feel like Im not in my head,0.23767897486686707
so I ddu,0.42577919363975525
and I went to sleep,0.30631619691848755
and then probably around ke I think it was eight in the iviu,0.28182774782180786
and I was talking to my husband,0.2899966239929199
and I kindof felt like I was drunk,0.33212798833847046
and I thought it was probably becauseof the pills,0.3663083016872406
and he told me,0.30043673515319824
so I went back to bed,0.34759533405303955
and probably around eleven I got up to go to the bathroom,0.2662140130996704
and I fell,0.3141249418258667
I was like,0.403032511472702
and I tried to get up,0.32063543796539307
and I couldnt,0.35193902254104614
and my husband heard me,0.33025866746902466
he was in the other room,0.3327205777168274
and he helped me get up,0.28132864832878113
and he knew that smpwnu,0.4132564663887024
I couldnt say anything,0.4381571114063263
so he went ahead and called nineoneone,0.26776644587516785
and he went outside to make sure that the mlntsu,0.3303600251674652
and I was on the bed,0.26552292704582214
and I was like,0.3268147110939026
so I was trying to goes,0.3262826204299927
and I fell inside of the closet,0.29669782519340515
so when my husband came with everyone they found me in the collet,0.2694089412689209
and my hzmu,0.4961085915565491
and then I they had to take me to Boise,0.3179125487804413
so thats about almost twenty five miles to get there,0.2850666642189026
my husband could not come with be,0.3256533741950989
so I just rode with them to the hsblu,0.31463298201560974
and then I got there,0.39086878299713135
and my sister and her husband were already there,0.3574448823928833
and then my husband came later,0.3494762182235718

and then after my midizu,0.4363335967063904
or I would get another coffee,0.3459475338459015
it was really bad,0.4491024911403656
I and I think that I think that was why I had the kidney stones,0.34160375595092773
it was really bad,0.4491024911403656
I would never want anyone to ever have that,0.49603140354156494
right,0.9999998211860657
right so when I was in the hsblu,0.32881098985671997
and the guy that helped me with that he was just amazing,0.3049299418926239
youknow I had to figure out to sorry how to get up outof the chair and get to the wheelchair and then how to get outof the wheelchair and get in the bed,0.23015648126602173

and then we did alotof the walker,0.27871355414390564
and then after the hsblu,0.578819751739502
and then and then they gave me the brace,0.36474817991256714

so,0.9999999403953552
ohgoodness,0.0
well probably probably youknow I love my kzu,0.42355775833129883
they are the joy of my life,0.29651135206222534
my son,0.5353220701217651
when I met my husband,0.37951916456222534
this is a little bit too much,0.4344118535518646
but Ill tell you anyways,0.4193347990512848
when I met him he just got outof a relationship,0.2739863395690918
and me and him were defu,0.4242662191390991
and this lady said that she was prdjntu,0.31310853362083435
and my husband I,0.3854979872703552
this was new,0.46556514501571655
so its like,0.43681541085243225
and we just never left each others side,0.37665554881095886
and the lady that he was in she got,0.29584696888923645
after she had my son,0.371366411447525
because I say my son,0.3852066695690155
she got really into drugs really bad,0.37588006258010864
and so my husband and I took him when he was probably two months old,0.2573840618133545
and hes always known me as mom,0.2183629423379898
and and he lived with us,0.3568873405456543
and he didnt really see the other mom for awhile,0.2466956228017807
and when he was seven I wanted to dpu,0.3257036805152893
and it and then the girl wanna come back and make sure she was a mom,0.25721171498298645
but she really wasnt,0.39030691981315613
so we hadta go through all the to the course,0.36912524700164795
and it was alotof cheers,0.25888174772262573
and ill,0.5149317979812622
and then and then we were able to dpu,0.4559371769428253
and we had to go in front of the ddzu,0.2728354036808014
and it was even my son was so happy,0.28851714730262756
it was like the best day ever,0.3186523914337158
and sometimes hes a little butthead,0.3016557991504669
but I would never ever do it anything different ever becauseof its really good for us,0.3975762724876404
so,0.9999999403953552
okay so theres a kid again,0.298674613237381
hes playing soccer,0.32275688648223877
and it went through a neighbors window,0.3126964867115021
and its,0.7250286340713501
oh it goes through the window,0.27716994285583496
and it breaks a lamp,0.34737494587898254
and the neighbor has the ball looking outside to see whats going on,0.27409976720809937
and thats all I have,0.3735628128051758
okay,0.9999999403953552
so the mom told the son,0.23825587332248688
and he was like,0.3586866557598114
and so then the boy went outside,0.33358001708984375
it was it was raining,0.4645597040653229
and then it was really raining,0.42687004804611206
and he had to turn around and go back to home and tell his mom,0.2744201421737671
and she went ahead and gave him the nbrllu,0.30314797163009644
and then he was able to go for a walk just fine,0.2683144211769104
okay so,0.6972054243087769
okay Im gonna say there this little girl was riding her bike,0.2227519452571869
and and her dog was with her,0.3916458189487457
and they came across a cat,0.27588140964508057
and the dog was trying to get the cat,0.28230151534080505
and it was up in the tree,0.3014637231826782
and shoe,0.490939199924469
and a maybe its a neighbor saw the cat in the tree,0.27332305908203125
and he tried to put a ladder up so he could get the cat,0.24127095937728882
and the ladder fell down,0.3692081868648529
and he couldnt get the cat,0.24057763814926147
so then the fire,0.4506545066833496
a what are they called,0.34466731548309326
firefighters can see it,0.3753429651260376
so they came over to get everyone down from the tree and the cat,0.2802738547325134
I guess that would be it,0.4913569986820221
okay sounds good,0.5130696892738342
so there there was a guy that had a doctor,0.34887540340423584
and her mother was not there any more,0.3463575839996338
and he wanted her to have a new stepmom,0.27485865354537964
so he married a lady that had two girls already,0.29303181171417236
and then he died,0.3842827081680298
and the e the stepmom was not nice,0.22288089990615845
and she made Cinderella be the maid,0.25701212882995605
she would have to make sure that she did the floors and made food and make sure that everything was clean,0.31380853056907654
and the her spsstzu,0.5833209156990051
I cant remember their names,0.2920686900615692
they were not really nice to her either,0.40058523416519165
so really all Cinderella had was the nmnlzu,0.3164962828159332
they she had a r a horse a dog,0.31694722175598145
and she had mice,0.3814745545387268
and she would make clothes for the mice,0.29905885457992554
and then there was a cat that was her t her the cat was the stepmom m,0.22947782278060913
and he was not nice,0.29768770933151245
so one day when,0.48877987265586853
sorry,0.9999999403953552
so that was kindof about their house,0.37007495760917664
there was also a keen,0.34534046053886414
and he wanted him to get married,0.32070010900497437
so he did a wanted to do a ball and to invite everyone in the kingdom,0.262984961271286
so at sndlzu,0.47230201959609985
and when they got the invitation Cinderella was like,0.2819683849811554
and her xxx all your chores,0.33159029483795166

so I went back to the room and went back to bed,0.3062353730201721
and around eleven I hadta go to the bathroom,0.2699908912181854
and when I got up outof the bed I fell down,0.2402099072933197

and then I couldnt ke talk at all,0.22125309705734253
I could hear my husband saying,0.398889422416687
and I couldnt say,0.30415046215057373
and he knew something wasnt right,0.2918204069137573

and I was trying to figure it to put something on,0.30010470747947693
and I fell in the closet,0.28083160519599915
so when my husband came in the room it,0.27868571877479553
because he was like,0.433915376663208

okay I I know I tote,0.5569887161254883
see what else can I say,0.4262853264808655
well youknow the one thing that has been awesome this last year was I couldnt drive after my stroke,0.22937701642513275
and so it was nine months that I would hafta ask someone to help me to go somewhere,0.25338679552078247
or I would have to get a jubu,0.3450016975402832
and sometimes I would hafta go to Boise,0.2231789231300354
and I would hafta get a jubu,0.230455219745636
and that would be fifty dollars one way,0.35395562648773193
it was crazy,0.4132000505924225
and my sister would help me out sometimes,0.3263629674911499
and my mother inlaw would help me out and when my husband would too,0.29745209217071533
but I really wanted to drive,0.46061086654663086
and theres only one lady from Twin Falls that is like two hours away from me to Oregon kin s,0.1690661907196045
shes the only lady that will help people that had strokes or brain ndiz,0.2809433341026306
so I was on the list for three months,0.23277068138122559
so when I was able to go to the class I had to do alotof mmbizu,0.2653639614582062
and youknow alotof people that have strokes they can only see outof one eye,0.24900905787944794
so I hadta make sure I could see just fine,0.4564681947231293
I had do alotof tests,0.30202749371528625
there was ke a big board,0.25785574316978455
and it would have lights that would come up,0.39558306336402893
and I would hafta smack them,0.2442139834165573
and I had to be really fast,0.32531824707984924
and when I was able to pass that then I had to go to drivers ed,0.2879101037979126
and it was kinda weird,0.3274638056755066
and then I hafta drive with my left hand,0.2493472844362259
so I have a knob that I do on the stiriu,0.30664241313934326
and then I drive with my left foot,0.2939642369747162
so they put a oh its like a,0.28496336936950684
oh how do I say it,0.42485904693603516
they put a,0.42326587438583374
so on your pedal they put a block in front of it,0.24205511808395386
so I dont I cant have it go down,0.363889217376709
and then Im able they put another pedal over on my left foot,0.2391444593667984
so I can drive with my left fktu,0.29632943868637085
so it was kinda weird to figure that out when youve been on your right hand all the time,0.287655770778656
so it took me about two months after I was went to the class and everything,0.24056527018547058
and then I had the doctor make sure that I was okay and I was able to drive,0.2772398591041565
and I felt like I was ke sixteen again because I was like,0.2827577292919159
and the only thing they my s or my doctor doesnt want me to go on the freeways in unless is,0.21326777338981628
but I can get to everything on the back rows,0.31296318769454956
it just takes me a little bit longer,0.41185349225997925
but I can drive,0.42278310656547546
so thats really cool,0.4570118188858032
right,0.9999998211860657
so there is a little boy that was playing with his stocker,0.2858533561229706
and he wasnt paying attention,0.27038249373435974
and he he kicks it,0.3812748193740845
and it goes through a window,0.33083099126815796
and then the ball knocks over a lamp,0.31583940982818604
and theres a neighbor,0.3427167534828186
he gets the ball,0.3618488311767578
and hes looking outside the window to figure out who kicked it at his house,0.23778122663497925
right,0.9999998211860657
okay so theres they,0.41061875224113464
and his mom says,0.291908860206604
you might want to take a nbrlu,0.4513525366783142
and the little boy is like,0.32074597477912903
and he started to go to school,0.3205612003803253
and its starting to rain a little bit,0.33134204149246216
and then it really was raining,0.42687004804611206
so he went back home and told his mom,0.27267786860466003
and then he has his the mblu,0.4409855604171753
and hes able to go out to he can o now go to school because hes not getting rain on him,0.21847590804100037
okay,0.9999999403953552
Im gonna say there was a little girl that was riding on her bike,0.19371527433395386
and she had her dog with her,0.3950144052505493
and a cat was by them,0.28496962785720825
and a cat went up in the tree,0.25332486629486084
and the dog was barking,0.3783777356147766
and she couldnt get him,0.31019508838653564
so there was a nice guy that came along,0.2865131199359894
and he was trying to help them get the cat ts outof the tree,0.21820493042469025
and he put had a ladder,0.2773856818675995
and the the dog pushed it down,0.35732075572013855
so he was he was he was in the,0.43086162209510803
ohmygoodness,0.0
he was in the kriu,0.4477602541446686
and he couldnt get down,0.27862465381622314
so then a the firefighters came to help them to get the ban,0.3249495029449463
sorry,0.9999999403953552
okay okay,0.9999997019767761
so Cinderella had a dad when she was little,0.3084411025047302
and I think her mom passed away,0.28529539704322815
and he wanted her to have a mom,0.309585303068161
so he married a lady that had two daughters,0.2842260003089905
and he got really sick,0.33436718583106995
and he died later,0.3887459635734558

she had a horse and a dog and mice,0.3015763461589813
and she would make little clothes for the mice,0.311396986246109
oh and I think there was m burrs,0.20035123825073242
and she was always dedrinu,0.41144758462905884
and there would be something better for her,0.3828120529651642
and the king had a prince,0.43928104639053345
and he wanna,0.3133150041103363
so he wanted to have a ball,0.33213019371032715
and he invited everyone in the kingdom,0.3359073996543884

so she was never gonna be able to get the dress done,0.24007561802864075
so the mice saw that they that skndrlrlu,0.39473408460617065
so they snuck downstairs and looked at stuff that the stpsistzu,0.2812212407588959

and they were like,0.48767009377479553
so they took it and ripped it,0.34899580478668213
and then they went to the ball,0.39249658584594727
and Cinderella went outside in the garden,0.3386625647544861
and she was crying,0.40270546078681946
and then her feru,0.5668699145317078
and she told her what p what happened,0.30166953802108765
so she made a coach outof a pmpnu,0.2382960021495819
I think they she had three of the mice be horses the dog be the coachman and then the another coachman was the horse,0.26468220353126526
and she was like,0.36246034502983093
and shes like,0.32188287377357483
so she made her a beautiful dress,0.3424433469772339
and and she had glass shoes and told her that she can do all this but when it is midnight it all goes away,0.26202592253685
so she went to the ball,0.2958371341228485
and she met the prince,0.35325294733047485
and they dntsu,0.6694130897521973
and then all it allofsuhven,0.5145013332366943
and she was trying to get away so she didnt have everything go away,0.27786627411842346
and as she was running away one of her shoes came off of her,0.243821918964386
and and then she was able to get home without the prince knowing that she was looked like she was before her her fairy godmother helped her out,0.30482470989227295
so the next day Cinderella was having such a good day,0.24791114032268524
and then there was about another announcement that the girl that that that was dancing with the prince had a shoe,0.35457509756088257
and whoever it fit that is who he was going to l l was going to marry,0.25075849890708923
and the stkmmu,0.7914137840270996
and she kinda looked like the girl that was dancing with him,0.3079186677932739
so she put her in her room and locked her in her room,0.3275648057460785
and she had her key in her pocket,0.3168303668498993
when the duke came and let everyone in trying up,0.2629176080226898
and why,0.5230814218521118
when when the stepmom saw that she was ts coming down to try on the shoe she trip,0.2188507318496704
and he was like,0.3586866557598114
and shes like,0.32188287377357483
and she put it on,0.30429378151893616
and she was able to marry the prince,0.3270031213760376
and they live happily ever after,0.38081595301628113
the end,0.6397038102149963
okay,0.9999999403953552
so so again I would take my bread and put it in the totstu,0.2919892966747284
and then when it was done with the toaster I would put peanut butter on one side,0.2591579258441925
and then I was,0.3945731520652771
and then I would take the jelly and put it on the other side and spread it out,0.301002562046051
and then I would put them together,0.4155305325984955
and then I would take a knife and cut it in half,0.2635291814804077
and thats what you you would do,0.41443222761154175
its pretty good,0.43915560841560364
I know I struggle when I get overly tired,0.4300527274608612
I Im told that people wouldnt know I have trouble unless I,0.34729817509651184
my hesitation to them Im told is sounds like Im thoughtful,0.21134303510189056
they dont understand it,0.48057907819747925
my hesitation is because Im struggling,0.25498268008232117
yes,0.9999998807907104
sure,0.9999998807907104
I went to bed on a Monday night after work,0.23952247202396393
and just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and,0.26412433385849
about one or two in the morning I hadta go to the,0.25995317101478577
and I was struggling to get the covers off,0.2687641680240631
I was laying on my left side,0.2917696237564087
so I trying to get the covers off with the right,0.31025129556655884
and I couldnt believe how heavy the covers were,0.26031628251075745
and that was my first sign something was wrong,0.3090694844722748
I at first I thought because I had the two cats,0.2961488664150238
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something,0.32299402356147766
but they I youknow the room was dark,0.29741328954696655
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might,0.30050623416900635
and finally they came off,0.408445805311203
and then I tried to take some steps,0.3627352714538574
the bathroom was the next room over,0.35392287373542786
and I was finding that I was exhausted,0.3568560481071472
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed,0.24230092763900757
I dont know why I didnt think to just get back into bed,0.34245505928993225
but I just laid on the floor,0.31044480204582214
I laid there for about thirty minutes,0.2974845767021179
my Garmin told me what was going on the timeline,0.2217452973127365
and so when I got back up I still didnt feel like I could,0.3363201320171356
so I did and just crawled back into bed,0.3197484612464905
and then about I was awake asleep back and forth,0.29462873935699463
and I was trying to figure out,0.3059528172016144
somethings wrong with me,0.41615891456604004
but I dont know if this is major,0.33171218633651733
and I was trying to decide,0.3328694701194763
its probably something wrong with my brain or my heart,0.32157084345817566
and I didnt want to go to the emergency room,0.2696368098258972
and thered be nothing wrong,0.33619654178619385
but I called a guy from work,0.2655821442604065
I used my phone,0.3768711984157562
and I thought I was dialing his work number,0.3244355618953705
but I got his cellphone number,0.2999868392944336
so I want to leave him a voicemail message,0.33005669713020325
and I was surprised to hear him answer,0.29395607113838196
and thats when he told me,0.2741119861602783
so I worked for a very difficult company to work for,0.32972583174705505
and I didnt want to tell them yet what was going on,0.27522391080856323
so I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh,0.35447031259536743
but at least they would be notified I wouldnt be in that day,0.29127174615859985
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so he just chuckled and said,0.3227834403514862
and then I called a friend and told him what was going on,0.2565116584300995
and then between two of us we decided,0.3069811165332794
well my my idea,0.4613274931907654
so a half hour later I called him,0.25192782282829285
and I decided Im going to call my neighbor,0.26064562797546387
take me to the hospital,0.346125066280365
so I did,0.5862208604812622
and my neighbor next door came and got me,0.2590794861316681
and we went to the hospital,0.3432232141494751
I dont know why or how we went to the hospital that we did,0.2978009581565857
it was a great one,0.38612693548202515
weve got four hospitals to choose from,0.2420313060283661
so I dont know why or remember why we went to that,0.3474964499473572
but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago,0.24999435245990753
and she was struggling trying to figure out where the,0.34461623430252075
and at that point I couldnt read,0.2560536563396454
but I saw the red lettering,0.28507107496261597
and I knew that must be emergency,0.3241649866104126
and so I pointed to that,0.388198584318161
and then then she didnt know what to do with me once,0.31650686264038086
again she was someone with a brain injury,0.32357144355773926
so she was having trouble thinking her way through this,0.37763428688049316
and so here me I just had a stroke,0.33281445503234863
and Im having to do the thinking,0.2826293706893921
so when we pulled up under the awning there was a,0.28426802158355713
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital,0.28386494517326355
and I caught his eye,0.2991781234741211
and he came out,0.35014522075653076
and I told him,0.3245771527290344
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke,0.3003383278846741
and I told him,0.3245771527290344
at this point I was not having trouble walking,0.32554376125335693
but I was afraid I might,0.47495949268341064
earlier in the day in wee hours I was having a real,0.2349337488412857
but now I was okay with it,0.34058383107185364
so he said,0.4265557527542114
and he got a nurse,0.28992095589637756
and she came out,0.3525303602218628
and I told her the same thing,0.29655858874320984
and then she went back and got a wheelchair,0.31441178917884827
and they got me in,0.289348840713501
mhm I had alotof speech therapy,0.28982460498809814
I went to two different organizations for therapy because,0.298831969499588
so I wanted more therapy than that,0.39658841490745544
and so I went to both,0.32931050658226013
so for maybe about I dont know six or eight months I got,0.2607358694076538
each session is about an hour,0.28363344073295593
I also did some physical therapy,0.37631651759147644
but I didnt stick with it,0.3399796485900879
and so I can still feel ke my right leg drag a little bit,0.26558491587638855
and I also have trouble writing,0.3865552246570587
so I have some occupational therapy I did aswell,0.33447200059890747
and it it helped a little bit but not alot,0.34953439235687256
but the speech therapy,0.4388144612312317
I found some therapists I just connected with better than,0.3556842505931854
and the one I spent the most time with I really liked her,0.29909858107566833
she was very good and very positive,0.382807195186615
and as she explained it something important to me,0.34032848477363586
she said in the beginning she said,0.3273147940635681
then after we work together awhile Ill test you again to gauge,0.3179895579814911
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that,0.3789058029651642
so when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was,0.29613789916038513
I felt so stupid because I couldnt do them,0.4318736791610718
but if Id have known earlier that thats what they were doing it,0.3269626498222351
but youknow they didnt think to tell me that,0.36559373140335083
but I did games on my phone,0.29825758934020996
I went to a local college that had meetings on,0.27540674805641174
and so the first hour everybodys in the same room,0.3099152743816376
and then the second hour were split up into groups,0.3165256381034851
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into,0.26961344480514526
so you go into a group with about four or five other people who,0.25274261832237244
I bought books grade school books for math and reading,0.31625065207481384
and I did that on my own,0.317434698343277
and I did puzzle books,0.2959633767604828
and then I went back to work,0.37114623188972473
I went back to work very quickly,0.34775030612945557
way before I really was able to do much,0.35303235054016113
but I just thought,0.6546387076377869
so I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke,0.266907662153244
there was something,0.5109063386917114
oh I always liked to cook,0.3359978199005127
but now I really kicked it up,0.40995073318481445
I found about healthy eating,0.4015144407749176
and Ive always liked junk food,0.29843389987945557
and I decide to eat really healthy,0.36514878273010254
I felt like that would help me recover,0.37414872646331787
and so I I got this,0.4021477997303009
and learning to understand measurements again was difficult at,0.35383668541908264
but I learned,0.548089325428009
and I still struggle with it sometimes,0.42620179057121277
making conversions is not so easy for me,0.324729323387146
but but I see the ingredient list,0.36047884821891785
and then youve got ke a paragraph of everythings,0.23787157237529755
so Ive learned to if its the first two things you do,0.26802361011505127
and then maybe the next three things youve gotta do something else,0.2690357565879822
then I color those other three with another color,0.3909195363521576
that kind of thing,0.5073074102401733
and so then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods,0.3676244914531708
and that was motivating for me,0.349910706281662
and then I also I was working near a mall,0.2600190043449402
and so at lunch time I would go walk every day,0.2896692454814911
well the job that I had that was so stressful,0.35031813383102417
about two years ago now they laid me off,0.23208260536193848
and I was happy about that,0.3493022620677948
I hated that place,0.42250409722328186
I loved the work,0.3734309673309326
but the people were just insane,0.39611947536468506
and bullying people to get things done,0.38667428493499756
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over,0.2701418399810791
but I was afraid to look for another job because if the next,0.3123694658279419
so I was really afraid to move,0.38460469245910645
and theres not many jobs around here for that kind of work,0.34358686208724976
so I felt really trapped,0.4900679290294647
but I was looking,0.41553953289985657
but it was just youknow there really wasnt alot to pick,0.2742117643356323
and well anyway the day three months or so before,0.29623305797576904
so I started collecting my information that I was gonna need,0.2554641664028168
and I put my notes in a notebook,0.23452484607696533
and I took them out to my car,0.28951936960220337
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and,0.29838335514068604
I didnt keep them at my desk,0.26696908473968506
I took everything outof my office except for things that belonged,0.2525304853916168
I saved off programs I had written everything,0.2804085910320282
and so then when the boss and the hr guy came to my office and,0.26978686451911926
I tried not to look so happy about it,0.40090349316596985
but I was really happy,0.47054004669189453
and then I was outof work for ten months,0.22744888067245483
and it was okay because I had unemployment,0.3099593222141266
I had money in savings,0.3276463449001312
and I was doing alright with that,0.3596128225326538
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job,0.31559300422668457
and now I work from home fulltime for a company thats in,0.26703914999961853
and so my boss thats,0.2792728841304779
hes always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice,0.35310786962509155
and I still do the same kind of work I useta do,0.3077210485935211
but now its for nice people,0.33052125573158264
okay,0.9999999403953552
this boy is kicking a soccer ball,0.29563578963279724
and he kicked it right into somebodys living room window,0.3050372898578644
and it went in and knocked over the lamp,0.28944459557533264
and the man saw the damage as it happened,0.29747289419174194
he got up with the ball in his hand,0.28331199288368225
and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball,0.28968194127082825
the mom is trying to hand the son a umbrella,0.24971820414066315
but he doesnt want it,0.39586198329925537
and so she still holds onto it,0.3087933659553528
so now the boy is walking,0.30552399158477783
and its raining on him,0.3837515711784363
and the rain is getting heavier,0.3653484880924225
and he shows up in front of his mom all wet,0.20910686254501343
and hes not happy about it,0.308048278093338
and shes not happy about it either,0.3334426283836365
but now hes got the umbrella,0.25662633776664734
and hes continuing on his walk now with the umbrella,0.2453138828277588
the little girl wants her cat that climbed up in the tree,0.25642380118370056
and so the man got up the tree to retrieve the cat,0.2598648965358734
and the ladder fell out behind him,0.3248390257358551
and the dog is barking at all the excitement,0.32376453280448914
and the firemen are coming to rescue I assume the cat and the,0.3038434684276581
and theres a bird on another branch thats singing,0.2824675440788269
the Cinderellas dad met the woman with the two,0.2633337378501892
and then the daughters were mistreating Cinderella,0.3717217743396759
they are planning to go to the ball,0.34435832500457764
and they took a necklace off of Cinderella,0.2207631766796112
Cinderella was locked in a room,0.27921053767204285
and some mice came and with a key and got her out,0.30201026797294617
and then the fairy godmother provided a horse and a driver,0.345049649477005
and Cinderella danced at the ball with the prince,0.31692180037498474
and then it was almost midnight,0.3939865827560425
and Cinderella hadta leave,0.3452715277671814
and as she left she was going down the stairs,0.28265684843063354
and she dropped her slipper,0.35027793049812317
and then think it was two men came to her house with the,0.2942504286766052
and it fit Cinderellas foot,0.2790601849555969
then they knew it was Cinderella was the one who had danced,0.30394479632377625
and then then Cinderella and the prince got,0.3733653128147125
I would get two pieces of bread,0.26225870847702026
and a jar of peanut butter,0.31616926193237305
and a jar of,0.3612560033798218
did you said just peanut butter,0.3764885663986206
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
and a jar of jelly,0.30562254786491394
and a knife,0.41641178727149963
and a spoon,0.3921339213848114
and a plate,0.5062947273254395
and a napkin,0.4126211404800415
and then I would take the knife and prdu,0.34339797496795654
and then I would take the spoon and spread a jelly on the other,0.2872954308986664
and then you would put those pieces of bread together and put,0.34088823199272156
pretty good,0.7325064539909363
yes,0.9999998807907104
no,0.9999999403953552
I went to bed on a Monday night,0.24225389957427979
I worked all day,0.3538951575756073
and I went to sleep,0.30631619691848755
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back,0.31846916675567627
about one oclock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to,0.24745739996433258
and thats typical for me,0.32252365350723267
and I had trouble getting the covers off,0.3042633533477783
I was laying on my left side,0.2917696237564087
I remember that because I had right side weakness,0.4247336685657501
and the blankets just felt really heavy,0.37784668803215027
and so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket,0.29212093353271484
as it was like they were full of bricks or something,0.2669001817703247
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it,0.35367313027381897
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the,0.30541446805000305
I was exhausted,0.45798906683921814
and so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed,0.24734890460968018
and I laid there for about a half an hour,0.22620539367198944
and I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down,0.2920232117176056
and then I got up and thought,0.35817256569862366
but as soon as I stood up I realized,0.286564439535141
so I crawled back in bed,0.31030961871147156
and about seven thirty or eight oclock Id decided to,0.2337309718132019
I my boss was a creep,0.29396259784698486
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible,0.37129664421081543
and so but this guy was kindof the bosss pet,0.3034030795097351
and so I thought,0.4650960862636566
and when I used my cellphone,0.3107231557369232
I had that guys cellphone number and desk number,0.28884243965148926
but I thought sure I selected the desk number because I was,0.3197818994522095
but I thought,0.6418097019195557
well he answered the phone,0.3328649401664734
and so it hadta be before eight oclock because I was,0.3021624982357025
and I said to him,0.3349546492099762
and he said,0.37295207381248474
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I chose those words carefully,0.3757046163082123
I didnt want them to know there was a health issue,0.2755926549434662
but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why Im not,0.30701854825019836
and I certainly needed to make that call,0.40030133724212646
and so he took it as humorous,0.29582685232162476
and I was fine with that,0.3354414999485016
that was kindof why I said it the way I did,0.342933714389801
and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that,0.26964837312698364
he said,0.5283018350601196
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so he was real relieved to hear that,0.3166424036026001
and so I felt bad when he said that,0.3340071141719818
I was like,0.403032511472702
and anyway so I called either before him or,0.31990373134613037
and I never call him,0.37865233421325684
weve been going together for about six years,0.2792259156703949
and I for me to call him is thats a big deal because,0.25489717721939087
and but I called him that morning,0.36370760202407837
and he picked up,0.31731534004211426
and I told him I said,0.33509504795074463
and he I think he suggested I go to the hospital or see a,0.2502484917640686
or he might even try to help work it through and try to figure,0.3621618449687958
finally I said,0.43171408772468567
and if I dont then I think I said,0.3586706817150116
I dont remember what I did,0.4773746430873871
but there was some kind of a plan if I didnt he didnt hear,0.25184163451194763
and so I think before I called him back I decided,0.3478938341140747
and I didnt want to freak her out,0.27396488189697266
so I didnt wanna say hospital or emergency,0.27300789952278137
so I just said,0.5033215284347534
and so she said,0.35228464007377625
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so I called him and told him youknow I was gonna go to,0.2229980230331421
so later he told me that he almost called an ambulance,0.2655561566352844
but he hes the kind of person hes afraid to make a mistake,0.2645632028579712
Im sure theres some some psychology there to to delve in,0.2650406062602997
but but I told him I said,0.4328933656215668
maybe initially I might be not happy with you for making that,0.3724302649497986
but later I would understand that you did it outof love,0.35472118854522705
so its okay,0.37558016180992126
so anyway so then my neighbor came over,0.36619633436203003
and I wasnt dressed yet,0.25211426615715027
and so I was in my bedroom getting dressed,0.24831870198249817
and I dont remember taking a long time to get dressed or,0.24704162776470184
I wasnt experiencing the exhaustion anymore,0.2924879491329193
and but I noticed at one point she came around the corner,0.2847296893596649
and so then but I finished getting dressed,0.3801090717315674
and just I kindof planned out some things to do to,0.3870489299297333
if I made sure Id let the dog out and let her back in,0.2246633768081665
and I grabbed my purse and my phone,0.2887977957725525
and kinda made a mental note,0.28307950496673584
yes Ive got my health insurance card,0.25329896807670593
Ive got money,0.396641343832016
got my drivers license,0.33335545659065247
Im good to go,0.2792661190032959
and then we went out the door and or I went out the,0.2909330725669861
she said,0.5303276181221008
because shes just next door,0.34120720624923706
but I think she afraid for me to walk,0.3517431318759918
so she was in my driveway,0.26992571353912354
and Im coming out the door,0.24100519716739655
and Ive got a deadbolt and a knob lock,0.25997599959373474
and I the dog is in,0.2518008053302765
and Im trying to lock the door and xxx the knob,0.23343096673488617
I could feel it,0.5267376899719238
and its right,0.5539498329162598
but Im sitting here looking with my keys,0.2820122241973877
and they werent fitting,0.36788466572761536
so I was having trouble,0.4139986038208008
I dont carry alotof keys on my ring,0.21914592385292053
but I couldnt figure out which key went into the lock,0.25036343932151794
so finally I thought,0.5546859502792358
and we when we went down the road I dont remember who or,0.23265278339385986
but I think I went to the best possible one,0.3411908447742462
and when we got there it was like four of,0.26522913575172424
we call this hospital row,0.3170274794101715
so my street is always the first in the city to get paved,0.25170740485191345
well maybe the governors and then mine,0.3633109927177429
so then she didnt understand where to go exactly,0.34500858187675476
she I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didnt,0.31845715641975403
and I saw the red lettering,0.2667600214481354
and I couldnt read it,0.3205866515636444
that was so significant to me because I remember I could not,0.40080684423446655
I knew what the word was,0.3279365003108978
but I couldnt say it to to save my life,0.3250979781150818
but well I could say it,0.44825300574302673
I just couldnt read it,0.4412893056869507
and so I pointed,0.3671305179595947
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so I wasnt reading it youknow,0.26528045535087585
it was like,0.4181154668331146
and so we got to the entrance,0.31769147515296936
and there was ke I wanna say a canopy but not,0.22153586149215698
and I caught the eye of a policeman that was sitting or,0.26252469420433044
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the,0.2687755525112152
and I waved at him and motioned for him to come,0.2996137738227844
and he did,0.3889911472797394
and I told him,0.3245771527290344
and I dont know when I determined that that was a possibility,0.3128954768180847
dont even remember,0.4823529124259949
but but and I said,0.4399597942829132
and I was walking fine,0.30325233936309814
but I just never had a stroke before,0.41376230120658875
so I didnt know if maybe Im walking fine now,0.33626189827919006
and allofasudden I cant youknow,0.2916262149810791
I didnt know,0.48587071895599365
so I was afraid to walk,0.3398120403289795
and so he said,0.34016185998916626
and a nurse came out real fast,0.26337844133377075
and she brought out,0.3819167912006378
she came out first,0.3865286409854889
and then I told the same thing to her,0.3154235780239105
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair,0.2505621910095215
I think it was just inside the door,0.3673091530799866
then so she got me in the wheelchair,0.27738896012306213
and we went in,0.3313930630683899
and I remember looking at the people in the waiting room,0.313393771648407
it was pretty full,0.3691517412662506
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of,0.2516189515590668
and I almost wanted to say,0.34178000688552856
but youknow just not appropriate to really say anything,0.45053669810295105
I just felt bad,0.5323988795280457
and so then the intake person wanted my health insurance,0.3289884924888611
so I gave her that,0.3623773455619812
and she asked me,0.3485344648361206
and I remembered the Metformin,0.3909653425216675
but I called it Glucophage,0.37123650312423706
I think Glucophage is I think thats the name brand for it,0.27724000811576843
but I couldnt think of Metformin,0.3194332420825958
and there were alotof supplements I useta take and,0.314879834651947
but I couldnt remember the name of them for the life of me,0.26206713914871216
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if,0.34161925315856934
and but I just was just struggling,0.4378933906555176
I couldnt remember the name of them,0.26736193895339966
and I it surprised me that I couldnt remember them,0.3957643508911133
and then I got put in a room right away and just waited,0.2853153944015503
and that same nurse came back,0.3446030020713806
and she asked me,0.3485344648361206
and I said,0.32917967438697815
but I didnt think a long time had passed,0.29487064480781555
and so she was alittle irritated with that and went back and,0.35569462180137634
and they were back there very quickly,0.43283718824386597
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do,0.306991845369339
and they had one test where they were gonna need to put me,0.27095478773117065
theyre trying to find the origin of the stroke,0.3093763291835785
I think at this point they know what happened,0.422565221786499
they just cant figure out,0.36812514066696167
and they never figured it out,0.4388602077960968
but so they put me to sleep for that,0.37757372856140137
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to,0.3883173167705536
I dont like to be put under,0.26318347454071045
I like to know whats going on,0.3315250873565674
and then theyre gonna put this thing down my throat,0.2685145437717438
and I know that there is the possibility,0.3913569450378418
its so slim,0.395469069480896
but possibility that something could go wrong there,0.5073412656784058
or would some permanent damage could happen,0.4460280239582062
so I I was pretty freaked out about it,0.3760138750076294
but I thought I I I gotta submit to this,0.38008490204811096
so they did that,0.5744763016700745
and and when they did either a ct scan or the mri,0.2852998971939087
I dont remember which when they,0.3672514259815216
Ive had those done before not on the brain though,0.2997375428676605
and they told me it was really important that I that,0.3790443241596222
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it,0.3031739592552185
so Im not gonna flinch,0.28090032935142517
and so anyway then then began nine days of in hospital stay,0.2572150230407715
okay,0.9999999403953552
a speech therapist told me either that day or the next,0.25830063223838806
and for a moment I thought,0.3663056492805481
and then she explained what it was,0.37301284074783325
I was like,0.403032511472702
and so while I was in the hospital she provided alotof,0.2464049905538559
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next,0.2823578119277954
and it was ke really important to me,0.2896668314933777
I was just super motivated,0.3767756223678589
and and then when I was released it was gonna be a month,0.21926642954349518
and so I contacted her again,0.3378687798976898
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so she sent me alot,0.25274771451950073
and she just like in the hospital she was willing to send,0.2815876603126526
and I was so thankful for that,0.3255719244480133
and so I just worked on it,0.3275841772556305
and then and so Im not in the hospital,0.27867135405540466
so I didnt give it to her to check it now,0.32684212923049927
I just figured,0.6547253727912903
and I got adult coloring books becauseof a high fine,0.2609344720840454
and I went to a teacher supply store and got some kids,0.253265917301178
thats where I estimated my level was at at the time,0.24099332094192505
and so because when I looked at higher grades like,0.3185137212276459
but third or fourth it was like,0.28891175985336304
and so I did that,0.4158477485179901
and I got puzzle books for kids to do,0.2557964622974396
and so I did those,0.40336209535598755
and I always did like to cook before,0.33445578813552856
but now I had a special interest in cooking healthy food,0.29352930188179016
and I want it to be food that tasted good,0.3317180573940277
and so I got some healthy recipes,0.33940815925598145
and worked on those,0.41193845868110657
and I was surprised to see that I struggled with,0.30991697311401367
like a jar of garlic,0.3044305145740509
half a teaspoon is one clove,0.32551419734954834
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that,0.27414149045944214
I was like,0.403032511472702
and so I didnt know initially that I could use one teaspoon,0.2986259460449219
so I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work,0.326408714056015
and so and I learned to highlight in the cookbook,0.3201211988925934
everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would,0.22700916230678558
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would,0.24936994910240173
and and so I did really well with the cooking,0.3688663840293884
and just as time went on it was no longer a struggle,0.2725335955619812
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like,0.3756088614463806
I never did figure it out,0.4261930286884308
but I was like,0.42701035737991333
but I went to therapy,0.34964507818222046
and I went to two different therapists,0.3077603876590729
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I,0.2507270574569702
and so I thought,0.4650960862636566
so both therapists would see me twice a week,0.2676738500595093
and so and there was two different locations,0.3902056813240051
and so I I went to them,0.3757069706916809
and it was exhausting,0.4261505603790283
I went back to work at about seven eight seven weeks,0.2829981744289398
and it took me eight weeks,0.26174336671829224
but I took seven off,0.29823601245880127
and so youknow I was leaving work to go to therapy,0.2667370140552521
or I would go,0.38982492685317993
no I didnt do it xxx,0.35344186425209045
I would did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the,0.2838992774486542
and my employer bless his heart said,0.29112738370895386
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
I cant I was exhausted as it was,0.2793181240558624
and I was like,0.3268147110939026
but I just agreed to it,0.4684849977493286
I know he didnt have time to check up on me,0.26374828815460205
so I said,0.48068174719810486
so so then I just did all this therapy,0.44888541102409363
and my there was one therapist,0.31445011496543884
well first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was,0.3043478727340698
and I think Id been seeing her for maybe youknow two weeks to a,0.22124606370925903
and when she was there one evening she recognized me,0.3382836580276489
and she called me by name,0.256620854139328
and I just politely acknowledged her,0.3674272894859314
but I had no clue who she was,0.31743693351745605
and now Ive learned that since my stroke theres some,0.2811126708984375
now if the person has something very different about them Ill,0.3185149133205414
youknow somebodys got a huge nose or a big old wart at the,0.22137880325317383
just something that would make me remember them then,0.5102506875991821
but just yeah its very easy for me to forget who I just,0.3179396092891693
and so I remember her pointing that out at the next,0.2945043444633484
she says,0.5345509648323059
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so but anyway she worked with me for maybe two,0.2846548855304718
and then she moved,0.44745588302612305
and then so another person took her place,0.36956262588500977
and wasnt real crazy about that person,0.28986287117004395
but and in hindsight she probably didnt do anything,0.32535016536712646
it was just I was just struggling with my confidence,0.3472349941730499
and it but then I went to another therapist,0.36358579993247986
and that lady was young,0.3604203462600708
and she was very upbeat and very positive and encouraging,0.40780991315841675
and so that was helpful to me,0.3412929177284241
and so we did alotof focusing on short term memory and,0.24557289481163025
I did that with her,0.37158432602882385
she taught me some card tricks to do that Ive since,0.2618464529514313
like five and two,0.4933944344520569
I dont remember what it was,0.36534032225608826
but anyway so I was practicing with my cards on my,0.29034844040870667
and she didnt give me homework,0.2677119970321655
neither one of them did because I worked,0.336232990026474
and they felt like,0.44093674421310425
and I was actually kindof relieved because I was just I,0.4108721613883972
the fatigue was just crazy,0.3287939429283142
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because I,0.41792377829551697
and so think I just about covered it,0.4067992866039276
something important that happened to me,0.4765652120113373
my grandbabies,0.6056540012359619
my daughter and I we struggled alot in her teen years,0.2219664454460144
and she met this guy when she was thirteen or,0.2543925940990448
and youknow when I first met him Im just seeing this skinny,0.2478720247745514
and Im thinking,0.3001759648323059
and well anyway they eventually got married,0.334606796503067
and then but she was determined she didnt want any,0.3005301058292389
she was so sure she would screw them up,0.3435770273208618
and its just too hard,0.3977331817150116
and so me and my husband well just youknow well just see,0.33092063665390015
and they did,0.49651017785072327
they did alotof traveling and everything,0.36314165592193604
and and I had a s and I have a son too,0.2594943344593048
but he didnt seem to have any interest in getting married or,0.2657899260520935
and so I just thought,0.49736231565475464
so I just worked in the church nursery and and kinda helped,0.2644667625427246
and then my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida,0.258104145526886
and by this time youknow I realized through some,0.31011277437210083
and I was always super protective of my kids,0.25927507877349854
and I realized he was just as protective of her if not,0.2821044921875
and so I thought,0.4650960862636566
and so then I dont remember how long theyd been,0.2908629775047302
maybe a year or so,0.3094800114631653
and she she came back to town,0.33997273445129395
and a relative on his side had a baby,0.30618077516555786
and she wanted to hold that baby,0.35257822275161743
and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby,0.2939576506614685
and she just whenever I took a picture of her with that baby,0.28658217191696167
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
and she told me,0.31570112705230713
and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing,0.2596915066242218
she lost two or three,0.3232782781124115
and then when she had this one,0.42394396662712097
and maybe about six months in Im in Indiana,0.19836312532424927
and shes in Florida,0.27591395378112793
and Im nesting,0.2941250801086426
and then my house is reasonably clean anyway,0.3202982544898987
but but I cleaned my whole living room once,0.38381659984588623
and I just said youknow it it had been a recently,0.29309314489364624
and so there wasnt alotof junk in there,0.23486775159835815
but I started pulling items out and going through them,0.36446690559387207
and I cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows,0.3321484923362732
and just youknow every crevice I cleaned in that living room,0.2939010262489319
and I asked her I said,0.32853925228118896
and she said,0.38078364729881287
and I said,0.32917967438697815
but once I sltu,0.6045454144477844
I dont remember exactly which room it was,0.29757559299468994
it mightve been my bedroom,0.29824259877204895
I dont remember,0.49512580037117004
but anyway then when the baby was here he had some,0.3686019778251648
I dont remember what it was,0.36534032225608826
but it it was they wanted him to be in the not,0.3721846044063568
intensive care,0.6760362386703491
they wanted him there NICU I guess,0.3989066183567047
and so he was there for a few days,0.2672733962535858
but my daughter called me,0.313439279794693
and she said told me what was going on,0.24355754256248474
and I was she said,0.30538806319236755
but I could tell her voice,0.380498468875885
she was scared,0.48611703515052795
and I wasnt really worried so much for the baby because what she,0.2974039912223816
but I was really frightened for her,0.3726142942905426
just her mental her emotional being wellbeing,0.4679233133792877
and after that phone call I hop on the airplane,0.23569145798683167
I hadta be with her,0.3544529676437378
I was compelled to be with her,0.3071282207965851
and I show up in that hospital,0.2904900908470154
and she was just shocked to see me,0.2991675138473511
ke I was the last person in the world she expected to see,0.23890729248523712
and I remember thinking,0.4606236219406128
and so anyway I I saw the baby,0.3040192127227783
and couldnt touch him,0.33016836643218994
and that was okay,0.3321656584739685
but I took a couple of pictures of him,0.2504015564918518
and then I came back home shortly after that,0.3614126741886139
and later I learned that she thought I was coming to see the baby,0.29478350281715393
and she was kinda mad because she wanted to decide when she,0.32801172137260437
and she thought thats why I got on a plane like I did to try,0.26004546880722046
and I just explained to her that I said,0.3496994972229004
and I said,0.32917967438697815
but I said,0.47881877422332764
and I think she was taken back by that,0.28224244713783264
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so anyway but that little guy hes so,0.3816528618335724
and he as I listen to him and his language,0.3097773790359497
it was really interesting,0.5010225176811218
and hes almost four now,0.27852538228034973
but when he was about two he he loved dinosaurs,0.3565039336681366
I think he still kinda likes them,0.4328804016113281
but I kinda feel like hes maybe sorta outgrown them,0.3568882346153259
and hes onto other things,0.2882835566997528
but I was making him videos and because I didnt feel,0.2983938455581665
but this little guy he doesnt know what normal sounds like,0.35958412289619446
and so I made him these goofy little videos with these little,0.32469314336776733
and they would get into trouble youknow,0.3157498836517334
and I had a box of toys here for him,0.22274823486804962
and and so I had a dinosaur,0.296773761510849
Id wed call them saursq because thats why he called them,0.2844192683696747
and I put a no a saur,0.3093823492527008
and I put a saur,0.3052183985710144
and it was just and so I would make sill,0.3215949535369873
and I would tell him,0.3568173348903656
and he thought those little stupid little videos,0.38306689262390137
maybe two minutes long each,0.3802909851074219
he thought those were hilarious,0.45495614409446716
and he would watch them over and over and over and over again,0.44088637828826904
youknow they just a hundred times youknow,0.35792842507362366
and then and then his baby brother came along,0.3899777829647064
and I think theres a two years difference,0.2745816111564636
yeah two years,0.32618674635887146
and so the baby hes just cute as he can be,0.22415444254875183
and so hes right about almost two,0.29833245277404785
and so much difference between the two and their personalities,0.4282713234424591
and but the the first one hes super smart,0.31504619121551514
hes also very manipulative youknow,0.26532307267189026
and and so he he works that cuteness angle youknow,0.31380459666252136
and then the second one he was alot more agreeable,0.31373482942581177
and he was plenty smart,0.28817999362945557
but I could tell not to the level his brother is youknow,0.26128116250038147
its like he didnt get stuff quite as quickly as like,0.26225367188453674
you you hadta work with him awhile,0.4246178865432739
and but but then hed get it,0.37570980191230774
he was fine,0.42286157608032227
I think he just likes to analyze maybe more youknow and just,0.34215039014816284
so the second one just super long eyelashes,0.3493635058403015
so any girl would love to have and just as just as cute as,0.3037354648113251
and I went to go see them last Thanksgiving I think it,0.30408865213394165
it was last Christmas,0.3690085709095001
I went to go see them Christmas,0.3233783543109894
and I facetime with them alot,0.34225520491600037
and so the older one hes thrilled to see me,0.24186588823795319
and he just runs to me and youknow says granny youknow and wants,0.23254290223121643
but the baby eventhough hed seen my face alot on the screen,0.22527006268501282
and he ofcourse Id seen him in person too but not real often,0.2817825675010681
it took him a minute,0.31760188937187195
and he had to watch his older brother,0.32644152641296387
ke I guess its okay to go sit near her,0.20122605562210083
it was like it seemed like at some point a light,0.3290342092514038
and he was like,0.3586866557598114
so then had both on my lap,0.2784665822982788
and they just for about an hour or two I was enjoying,0.24415834248065948
it was just it was just so cool,0.4581974744796753
so I yeah I always heard how much fun grandbabies are,0.36111924052238464
but ohmygosh instant celebrity is so much fun,0.35143372416496277
so thats the probably about the best thing thats ever,0.38835608959198
okay,0.9999999403953552
theres a boy outside,0.3156435489654541
hes kicking a soccer ball up in the air,0.2309987097978592
and the ball winds up inside of a shattering somebodys,0.3120701313018799
and the ball lands inside this mans house,0.36770468950271606
and this man is just sitting on a couch and was surprised to,0.26612553000450134
and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over,0.2936892509460449
and so the man picks up the ball and looks out the window,0.29324495792388916
okay,0.9999999403953552
theres a little boy,0.35516300797462463
and mom is strongly advising him to take this umbrella,0.2640954256057739
and he is not open to that advice,0.331959068775177
and so he leaves without it,0.38314640522003174
and he waves goodbye to his mom,0.27122560143470764
and shes still got that umbrella in hand and asking him to,0.26726314425468445
but no hes good while he he gets outside,0.30524179339408875
and its raining hes noticing,0.32591381669044495
and and not only is it raining its becoming this,0.3866230845451355
and hes walking through puddles,0.28698480129241943
and hes trying to keep his head dry with just his hands,0.27243462204933167
and he gets to the house,0.33911773562431335
and he sees his mother with this I told you so attitude,0.27492278814315796
and shes looking at him where he is drenched,0.21071891486644745
and but the next scene is hes going on his way in the,0.2541118860244751
but this time hes got the umbrella,0.28297364711761475
and its open and is keeping him dry,0.3075183629989624
okay,0.9999999403953552
this little girl has a cat,0.3606552481651306
and the cat is on a tree and the branch,0.3293221592903137
and the little girl cant reach it,0.24345310032367706
and the cat is just hanging out on that branch,0.2901430130004883
so somebody apparently called the l fire department,0.29799768328666687
and so these two firemen are coming towards the scene,0.3514145314693451
and the little girl it looks like she had gotten there,0.33182644844055176
and theres a dog at the tree trunk,0.2504480183124542
and its barking up,0.41299813985824585
theres a man up on the branch of the tree,0.2725355923175812
and the dog is probably barking at him,0.2846537232398987
and theres another tree,0.3712223172187805
theres a bird,0.3621523976325989
looks like its singing,0.3839655816555023
and theres a ladder on the ground,0.3318045735359192
possibly the ladder was used by the man,0.3106610178947449
and he looks kindof not kindof scour he,0.34212201833724976
and so its probably his ladder that fell,0.3069022297859192
and so hes just kinda sitting there taking all that in,0.3247157633304596
and so with the firemen on the way looks like its gonna,0.2574630081653595
mkay,1.0000001192092896
the evil stepmother and two stepsisters met the,0.3513103127479553
and then later as the stepsisters are older,0.3710583746433258
now theyre not little kids anymore,0.4196074604988098
theyre like teenage girls,0.3793727159500122
theyre really not nice to Cinderella and expects,0.30840003490448
and theyre preoccupied with themselves,0.4001311957836151
one especially shown powdering her nose or something,0.34759217500686646
and Cinderella notices looks out the window,0.3013024628162384
and she sees the palace,0.33976686000823975
and shes looking at that kindof fondly,0.25025948882102966
and she fantasizes about wearing a dress to this,0.3128753900527954
and so she puts it on,0.2812879979610443
and her stepmother witnesses one of the epdaught,0.4179997444152832
then Cinderella was talking to her fairy godmother,0.30830198526382446
and this fairy godmother made a driver and a,0.340746134519577
the mice became horses,0.3680800795555115
and think the dog mightve been the driver,0.2961645722389221
then she gets the palace,0.39910688996315
and she dances with the prince,0.4108833968639374
and the fairy godmother had given her a beautiful dress,0.31053826212882996
and her hair was done nice,0.25935253500938416
and she has a great time Cinderella does at the dance,0.25516679883003235
and then she notices its almost midnight,0.37542787194252014
and so she explains to the prince that she hasta go,0.2789464294910431
and the prince is doesnt really want her to go,0.25500670075416565
and so but she leaves,0.438811331987381
and in her rush down the steps she drops a glass slipper,0.24002480506896973
but I should back up,0.4378363788127899

I I know what it is,0.48164981603622437
and until someone tells me what it is I just cant say it,0.2910595238208771
I dont know why,0.510981023311615

but she was always there for me,0.3647349178791046
so it it it youknow it was okay because I I could tell her anything I wanted,0.4253624379634857
shed listen,0.5691854953765869
did whatever she could,0.5133365392684937
and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in everyday,0.30915430188179016
and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back,0.29571396112442017
and every day it was something different,0.36722230911254883

and the ball went into a glass window,0.3182866871356964
and when he when when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the on the stairs,0.2991825342178345
and so she,0.4683294892311096
and he he told him he wasnt getting it back til the lamp was fixed,0.22436276078224182
okay,0.9999999403953552
first of all the boy did not want to take an umbrellbrella,0.24973653256893158
he he she,0.9282965064048767
so she,0.6509170532226562
so she,0.6509170532226562
and he was all wet now,0.27912312746047974

and she couldnt get the cat,0.24606436491012573
she couldnt get the dog,0.2697353959083557
she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal,0.2889290452003479
okay,0.9999999403953552
when the grandmother,0.5348182320594788
and n Cinderella did all the work,0.2604888081550598
and as kids got older there were more things for Cinderella to do that that they wouldnt do,0.27902334928512573
and finally they they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala at the at the princes palace,0.2456890195608139
and they they told her she couldnt go because she she wasnt invited,0.2827823758125305
and only they went,0.4224979281425476
so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and and showed them how she could do it,0.27296701073646545
and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into into the carriage and the horse and all,0.33229947090148926
and then then Cinderella was was given a fine dress to wear,0.26490312814712524
and then when she got to the when she got to the ball the only thing the only thing when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but Cinderella,0.32134056091308594
and they danced the night away,0.38458001613616943

and it was an exact match of the other other one,0.3196551203727722
so she,0.6509170532226562

and youd had a hard time,0.27926212549209595
oh something important that happened to me,0.3693174123764038
I graduated from college in nineteen seventy one,0.33160752058029175
I graduated magnacumlaude which was with honors,0.2705932855606079
and I then went to the Marine Corp and was went through training to become a second lieutenant,0.26214486360549927
and I was a second lieutenant in Vietnam,0.27160894870758057
and luckily I made it,0.30977094173431396
I lived through it,0.3429078757762909
and now that that was pretty much my college and freshman year,0.2872770130634308
Imean I graduated college then going in the Marine Corp,0.225316122174263
I became a lieutenant because I I was gonna get draft I was gonna get drafted,0.2368907630443573
so I enlisted,0.3994230031967163

two hundred and ten numbers outof three hundred and sixty five were drafted if you,0.303433895111084
so and I aduat I got number one as a number and picked,0.2674740254878998
so I won,0.3600684106349945
but I wouldve been drafted up to two hundred and twenty,0.2506104111671448

and Id have my sandwich,0.27092984318733215
seems to be adequate,0.4380178451538086
the eighty four incident last I remember is five days before that,0.29106253385543823
lets see,0.5765541791915894
it happened on a Thursday March the eighth of eight four,0.24982593953609467
I remember we were at some friends house having supper the previous Saturday night,0.2993835508823395
and I remember nothing nothing after that until until until after outta icu and started started remembering things slowly about three days after I was moved out moved outof icu,0.24880516529083252
and the the the eight nineteen ninety,0.5834446549415588
lets see the,0.3728271722793579
I was crossing tenth street Indianapolis,0.2802508473396301
and I remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk,0.3680970072746277
crossing with the light and seeing getting up close in the quarter panel on the car going from west to east,0.2993362545967102
and then I have the sensation being spun around,0.335970938205719
thats the last last I remember thing from last thing I remember for probably I dont know twenty twenty minutes or so,0.26452943682670593
eighty four,0.856563925743103
okay,0.9999999403953552
it was very that was really troubling because really troubling because didnt know where I was,0.4110204875469208
and there were visitors in the hospital room in in my hospital room,0.3241978883743286
and these guys were saying the the the visit,0.36454856395721436
I I knew who they were knew knew these these people,0.4021671414375305
but theres alots lotsof them there,0.490314245223999
I didnt know where I was,0.34828656911849976
there were lotsof there were several people visiting me,0.4120936095714569
and and there several of them asked,0.4232538938522339
I thought was perfectly fine,0.41083747148513794
and but what I didnt know was that the Id spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat in a in a coma,0.18134288489818573
and and it looked like I wasnt gonna come out anytime soon,0.22054240107536316
they gave me a tracheotomy,0.2832270860671997
and I and so the the what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords changed my voice pretty radically where where my wife had had told me,0.2220216542482376
she said she said that the said that you you you had the,0.3528949022293091
so I said,0.48068174719810486
so but that was that was extraordinarily troubling because I I like I said didnt know where I was,0.35392722487449646
my and people I c recognize its recognize saying,0.28326424956321716
and it was a really really troubling to me,0.38721612095832825
really troubling,0.8040424585342407
that was that was one of the first of my m first of my memories,0.27919986844062805
well its what what it ended up being was that the the,0.3447059094905853
in terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling,0.27004021406173706
and youknow just when when when I happen to get get focus on something I didnt r particularly understand or or or approve of I get get or it it didnt show up,0.24713653326034546
but it was xxx extraordinarily angry,0.33708131313323975
and did never did lash did never did lash out,0.39614543318748474
but just but real really angry,0.5891994833946228
and and I kept it all internal,0.35512158274650574
it was very very very troubling really troubling for a n for for quite a while,0.3744407892227173
and and and and I dont want you to ever to relate to that,0.36456412076950073
I wouldnt I wouldnt wish that in I wouldnt wouldnt wish that on anybody,0.3534467816352844
the almost nine nineteen ninety was almost a what,0.3655076026916504
again,1.0
thats always say,0.433689683675766
it was like just just a just a just a rerun but not near not nearly as severe,0.32651519775390625
but the the eighty four incident was was was most interesting because because an engineer for my the company that I was employed by,0.28934311866760254
I was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning I had a wonderful career ahead of me,0.20215775072574615
was gonna go far in the organization,0.19299764931201935
and and and my one of my supervisors told me,0.269387423992157
and he wasnt supposed to do this,0.2716832458972931
told me told me I was I was on the highpotnn list which meant again in my I was going far,0.22220630943775177
my career was laid out in front of me,0.19394339621067047
there was there was nothing stopping me,0.40368178486824036
and then after the eighty four incident a personality change which I find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn,0.25514712929725647
which I find out twenty years later is endemic,0.2219553291797638
and the and and I sound different,0.4736403226852417
I was slower to comprehend things,0.3408108055591583
but finally did after bit taking taking more time would comprehend things,0.38080069422721863
and and and and I couldnt do my engineering job to to to suit me,0.28887939453125
and I didnt didnt tell anybody that,0.33546626567840576
I didnt tell anybody that,0.4173646569252014
tried I faked it,0.4560263156890869
I faked it and spent my lunch hours for months I was by myself in a in a conference room relearning aspects of my job and not telling a not telling a soul because I just knew,0.21258489787578583
this was before before eighty eight,0.4435829818248749
nineteen eight nineteen eighty four again,0.6969020366668701
actually before the American of Disabilities Act,0.35711669921875
eighty eight,0.8881974816322327
and and I was on on the accident in eighty four,0.2863929271697998
I was on company business,0.32796284556388855
and I knew I I just knew that that mtu,0.37436386942863464
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired,0.3352813422679901
I knew I was,0.5296528935432434
had three kids a wife and spouse just a lovely lovely lovely lovely woman there at home with the three kids,0.26343798637390137
and I was the I was I was the income,0.3300239145755768
and I couldnt I couldnt stand the thought of being fired,0.2692195177078247
and and so like I say like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job,0.34368252754211426
and it took me but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that that I was no longer on on the fast track,0.24455788731575012
no no no longer,0.7534299492835999
it took I wasnt it wasnt obvious at first,0.24099302291870117
but I I was no longer on the fast track,0.2615433931350708
and and and the biggest most difficult part of that was the was the short term memory just short term memory difficulties,0.3445601165294647
and so I ended up with a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my help my short term memory,0.2408217489719391
so it was it was largely the the aphasia and and people seeing me differently at work,0.2965283691883087
and ofcourse Im ofcourse I look on back look back look back on it a few years after that,0.2672886550426483
and and I did not deserve a to be on the fast track,0.2560805678367615
I it it it it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me,0.43770599365234375
but it wasnt obvious to me,0.34472209215164185
and that the writing everything down was was the biggest biggest assistant sis assistant assistance to me that helped helped me do my job,0.23269790410995483
the basically it was being the the the,0.5669336318969727
I I I call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident,0.25010329484939575
thats thats how my my my life has been defined,0.284100204706192
and I its I just it that that that is that is what I call my my my defining moment the the the the defining event,0.34235358238220215
because Ive struggled with the the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then,0.33405131101608276
and and and and Imean ke for example the the the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was outof engineering school at Purdue,0.2535470128059387
had a job in Indianapolis,0.2998054623603821
and so the as economic viability I I I paid rent to my folks lived in the lived in their house,0.22678828239440918
and that winter my dad and I put the put an Oldmobile vl eight in a Chevrolet Vega a little small car,0.17619897425174713
and it was quite an interesting interesting project,0.379177063703537
and and interestingly enough I can probably,0.4337339699268341
the the the engine had a Rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties,0.2630429267883301
and I could probably still today,0.46296098828315735
now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven,0.4879505932331085
I could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded,0.3570934236049652
and but but but I ob but I could ask me what I had for supper last night,0.3156363368034363
cant tell ya,0.3873276114463806
so yup,0.5866681337356567
short short term memory issues,0.43175986409187317
but but then things from from from long ago and do do do do m something long ago I I can I can reconstruct like it was yesterday,0.24022401869297028
no actually I was I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering,0.23349741101264954
and and I got outof school the spring of seventy six,0.24792928993701935
had a job at a company named Shwitzer,0.276868611574173
theyre in Indianapolis,0.3429681956768036
and Shwitzer no Shwitzer no longer exists,0.47876647114753723
but I was in engine cooling engineering at at s with Shwitzer,0.23681823909282684
and so so I my my customers were well well call it for engine cooling fans for Shwitzer were Ford light truck Ford heavy truck,0.21598273515701294
the Ford one of the small Ford Pats cars had a Cadillac excuseme Pontiac,0.25675010681152344
and the Chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers,0.259391725063324
so I was already doing that kind of stuff as my as as a job,0.2782236933708191
but then my my father found this this article on engine conversion on the Chevrolet Vega,0.2442997395992279
and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and I to to to build together that winter while while while I was working the automotive industrys field,0.3247825503349304
and and it it xxx its kinda how I p kinda how I gravitated,0.2888948917388916
well it was it was real it was a real sleeper,0.3604127764701843
meaning that the the hot car at the time was the the Datsun two forty zl,0.2716141641139984
it was a real it was the first of the Datsun zl cars,0.2459225207567215
and and I useta from a stoplight dust those guys off,0.27300313115119934
and they couldnt they and those the the other guys the drivers of Datsuns zl cars couldnt figure out how in the hell this Vega beat the shit outof them,0.21309855580329895
it was it was it was it was it was alotof fun seeing looks in their faces as it in my rearview mirror,0.251266747713089
okay,0.9999999403953552
this story is theres a a a young lad,0.333720326423645
looks like maybe maybe teenager like a sixth grader or seventh grader kicking a soccer ball,0.2375301867723465
and then and here it kick xxx puts the soccer ball through a through a a houses window,0.258655309677124
and the soccer ball comes through the houses window and and lands on a on a a on a an adult male males lap in the house,0.27281656861305237
and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the through the hole in the window and says trying to figure out whats going on,0.25601449608802795
and done,0.5043960809707642
looks like a a a a young a young boy is leaving,0.4083345830440521
and his his were gonna say it was mother says,0.21361160278320312
and he says,0.3578353226184845
and then then he he he he leaves saying goodbye and everythings,0.4055834412574768
and the mom holding the umbrella,0.3740970492362976
and the the the young lad is out and about walking around,0.32846909761428833
and it starts to rain,0.3560200035572052
then it starts to rain heavier,0.4005255103111267
and hes running,0.3121028542518616
and he gets back to his to his mom so soaking wet,0.27215656638145447
and hes not happy,0.2860034704208374
nor neither is she happy,0.35891327261924744
and then he goes out finally with a with an umbrella,0.30202415585517883
and and and it looks like all is well,0.393340140581131
well the beginning it looks like a cat a pet cat had climbed up a tree,0.24888086318969727
and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree,0.2366326004266739
got stuck up in the tree,0.2693529725074768
a little girl who was probably her owner rode over there on her tricycle and and wants her cat down,0.2320900410413742
and looks like an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is and is and is and is caught up there by this barking dog,0.2085752636194229
also and now then theres also a a a bird on the other side of this tree singing away,0.293361097574234
and theres also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the the cat and the and the and the and the male the the male figure,0.34789955615997314
theres thats thats a tree by the dog,0.28577250242233276
okay,0.9999999403953552
thankyou,1.0
Cinderella was her mother passed away,0.3347484767436981
father remarried,0.7512622475624084
and the ck theres the the wicked stepmother had brought with her two two rather mean spirited daughters,0.274464875459671
and they and and in their in their home life the Cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which I always say by the by the stepdaughters,0.3038858473300934
and and so just just worked worked very worked alot,0.34748339653015137
and then in the kingdom the king had a had a a a unmarried son,0.3429800868034363
and one of zdvzu,0.5334520936012268
and the and so Cinderella with the help of of the mice and there in the in the in the in the house they sewed up a a really lovely gown for Cinderella to go to to wear to this to wear to this dance wear wear to this ball,0.25929439067840576
and and the the stepmother was intent on getting one of her her her her daughters married off and and then so would not allow Cinderella to go to the ball,0.28152087330818176
her stepsisters went,0.5260323882102966
and the and a a carriage which looked like a a pumpkin and then mice who ended up turned into horses,0.2912350594997406
and I think that the the horse from the house ended up as the as the the driver of the of the of the pumpkin carriage,0.3556138575077057
and she she she ended up going to the ball,0.302767276763916
also the the the prince danced the night away with Cinderella,0.3803110420703888
and but the stipulation h from the Cinderellas lla ir fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight,0.19406673312187195
so it was late,0.4057624042034149
so she hurried outof there and left a glass slipper behind,0.23975202441215515
and then and then after the and the after the the ball was over the the the the prince said there was only only one person interested in,0.405577689409256
it was the the gal that left the left the glass slipper behind,0.31534653902053833
and and so the the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that that lady who left the glass slipper behind,0.2593238651752472
and and it was the it was the one it was the it was the it was the the lady whose whose foot would fit this this small the small glass slipper,0.31570279598236084
and the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper,0.31600797176361084
Cinderellas foot would fit in the slipper,0.24639122188091278
and so she was identified as the one that the that the prince wanted to wanted to wanted to marry,0.358235239982605
and and so the so then the the the Cinderella married the prince,0.39426273107528687
and they all lived happily and they lived happily ever after,0.36839497089385986
oh prefer preferably on on a wheat bread,0.28990602493286133
you would use a knife and and get the spread the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread,0.29531508684158325
aha but then the on the other other side of the other other other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly,0.3133529722690582
and then so you take a spoon,0.3381160497665405
not not knife because you you cut up you cut up the the the the jelly and the and the jar,0.30817732214927673
but but you take your spoon and and spoon out the the the grape jelly on the other piece of bread,0.2875405251979828
use that use the knife to spread out spread it out,0.3566182553768158
then then put the two halves together,0.4516640901565552
and you got the ultimate the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.29357895255088806
speech is adequate,0.4548712968826294
much improved,0.6591857075691223
the the halting of halting of of speech,0.5784448981285095
the what what happens is that the if I,0.40246233344078064
for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics,0.47567886114120483
it helps immensely if I think about it for about a about,0.35723876953125
le unless Ive seen it before the the the,0.2711678147315979
and it it is well Ill,0.32594168186187744
I I I before before my eighty four accident I,0.36613360047340393
but its much more difficult and and takes longer,0.4212176501750946
and thats its like I say,0.27615123987197876
been that way for thirty six years,0.33724501729011536
the first one was a where I was tl boned at an,0.24714112281799316
and ended up being a,0.34759753942489624
I I caught the the old International Harvester,0.2125272899866104
and had a shattered pelvis broken hip five broken ribs,0.29845213890075684
did I did I say punctured lung,0.38700804114341736
seventeen units of blood,0.3864205777645111
three and a half weeks in a coma,0.2974194884300232
and and I in a coma for three and a half,0.2952214479446411
hospital probably probably about two and a half months,0.33691009879112244
and our third child was born three days after I was moved,0.21142904460430145
and the second one was February of nineteen ninety where,0.3506111800670624
there was a shared,0.40035176277160645
and and what I believe that I was,0.3657747209072113
well I I guess I dont know how long,0.4211953282356262
but I recall walking across the street starting across,0.3357105851173401
and then I had the n the sensation being spun around,0.287546843290329
and then and then later like I say I I,0.3648180663585663
I dont know,0.538106381893158
twenty minutes later,0.5035989880561829
and and I I was I was in a great mood,0.26630720496177673
I was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last,0.25909703969955444
and and this one is February nineteen,0.3032296895980835
and I was I was I was I was in a really great,0.3289855420589447
and then I say a a brain injury because I,0.30975788831710815
and I had that was that was that,0.4443877935409546
it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down,0.32088083028793335
finally went away,0.49211522936820984
but I dont I recall maybe three four five days,0.2826891839504242
something something like that,0.7344455718994141
but it lasted a significant amount of time,0.3580707311630249
and and the the doctors could not tell me whether the,0.3815077543258667
it was extraordinary painful,0.4261612296104431
and and I recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a,0.2810991704463959
oh after after three or four months when when,0.3317602872848511
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
yeah wasnt just me being a big baby then right,0.2845621705055237
and he he he chuckled,0.5216964483261108
that thats kindof it it,0.549845814704895
those are the two accidents in in a in a at,0.3387812376022339
West Tenth going into West Tenth and,0.3010460138320923
okay,0.9999999403953552
the after the first the eighty four incident,0.49226200580596924
what had happened was that the eighty four laptops,0.30259400606155396
and and my my boss at that time,0.27704906463623047
Ill call it,0.3616635799407959
I wont say leisure work play with,0.23379482328891754
but but learn how to use there there at home,0.36218583583831787
and ofcourse this is before the this is before the web,0.3878324031829834
but I had been doing a a Nastran which is Nasa structural,0.2701635956764221
and but that was all that was all on IBM,0.3493076264858246
and and so here is just a a simple little,0.3883540630340576
oughta be able to know how to use that,0.43071940541267395
and and so they brought this my boss brought,0.3261604905128479
and and in those years there was a a user manual that came,0.29409554600715637
and so tried to use a a computer an a,0.3347347378730774
if youve ever read if youve ever read a Microsoft,0.35568633675575256
and one of one of the one one thing in,0.4721001386642456
selectq,0.0
well had we never had any training in in a in,0.31952401995658875
and and after several days of trying to figure out what,0.3023196756839752
theres one feu,0.33005595207214355
select meat,0.5444959402084351
an aphasia,0.5559823513031006
selectq meant what what they meant by,0.4612482786178589
I just could not,0.5934668779373169
there was no way,0.3910924792289734
Im extraordinary troubled really troubled by that,0.3145832419395447
and so so finally I called a coworker and said,0.3001081645488739
and it described the tapping the cursor and moving the,0.44194817543029785
thats what they meant by selectq,0.3553496301174164
well hell that was never described in the manual at all,0.2544780671596527
and that that that really that threw me for a loop,0.3819528818130493
and so I became became very questioning as to whether,0.32195839285850525
and and so so finally the the like I say the,0.3659507930278778
the most most basic of terms which the the,0.5144088268280029
or my no no this is DOS not Microsoft,0.30290788412094116
this is before Microsoft existed,0.3570508658885956
this DOS manual it did not did not comprehend,0.39482131600379944
but they did not,0.607060432434082
DOS manual did not describe that anywhere,0.352031946182251
and so so the and so I went back to work and,0.3648592531681061
and and finally my my after a couple years,0.3253104090690613
and so wow that was that was a godsend,0.27239152789115906
Imean just being able to to write write things down,0.37708598375320435
so I I carry a small,0.35622087121009827
dont have with me right now,0.31765466928482056
but I still I carry a small ke a small notecard,0.2862597405910492
because that that was that was writing when,0.5352537631988525
holymackerel that was that that was a,0.5401113033294678
a that that in particular,0.5571882724761963
and and also I ended up as a later as a,0.3104753792285919
I developed tricks where I when I meet somebody new,0.3259374499320984
use their name in any kindof verbal verbal conversation with,0.31392449140548706
use name use their name every time first or last name or,0.29985296726226807
and and then after the after the after the,0.5869519114494324
and and and that that has been a,0.4968284070491791
for example I met a in our neighborhood met a,0.23349571228027344
Im at Im at Im at home now,0.2613375186920166
not down the farm,0.3710592985153198
but met a fellow in in the in the neighborhood,0.34277379512786865
and I got his name,0.26405736804008484
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told,0.32749035954475403
and this morning I was I saw him out for a walk and,0.25055447220802307
and then ne finally the name came to xxx,0.2625786364078522
so but but the the discipline on on recalling,0.43085619807243347
yes yes,0.9999999403953552
the I think I mentioned to you last week,0.32524174451828003
y y possibly I didnt,0.3104467988014221
but the time Id spent some time as a at the rehab,0.24042364954948425
and because I I started oh,0.3343755006790161
and it became rather troubling to me because having they just,0.41418638825416565
so there was no therapy,0.3478771448135376
you just youre able to survive,0.4436053931713104
just a the thing youre able to just could just check,0.4038594365119934
and because they just did not do therapy in those,0.3868980407714844
and and over the course the next twenty years wife and I,0.3238827884197235
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five,0.2761605679988861
thats what theyre telling people even fifteen years ago,0.28860050439834595
and so I wanted to to wanted to share that with,0.4131414294242859
but it is takes a long time,0.3726418912410736
and in oh,0.35122743248939514
hey you dont stop recovering,0.33560341596603394
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly,0.28705140948295593
but you never never stop recovering,0.49594974517822266
I had a in the eight the eighty eighty four,0.3641790449619293
and it was just something that I accepted,0.4026932716369629
and it was I could function without it,0.3726690411567688
no no big deal,0.5120149254798889
but to stick a pin there and I dont wouldnt,0.27259361743927
no no big deal,0.5120149254798889
and then it was probably five years ago or twenty twenty,0.29771581292152405
I think it was yeah,0.4342080354690552
I think it was oh,0.3816167414188385
twenty five years after the eighty four incident I was in the,0.3402840793132782
and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five,0.27409011125564575
so what Im what Im telling you actually is that the,0.3241369426250458
but but still you never stop recovering,0.508655309677124
you just dont stop recovering,0.4054967761039734
you dont,0.5800926089286804
yes its not not rocket science,0.3516479730606079
it it time time is time is the best,0.41807320713996887
because you you the feeling that the feeling that,0.5492104291915894
and and youll notice one day itll itll,0.2970149517059326
it actually it will happen,0.5858051776885986
you will experience it,0.5127493143081665
actually actually no,0.6937909722328186
it was it was it just Imean I was used to,0.3644573390483856
but but I I dont I dont know if I got used to,0.3977300226688385
but but like I say twenty five years later I just put on,0.2931188941001892
and had had had none before,0.5138181447982788
I I dont know when it happened,0.4471258819103241
have have no idea,0.5153244733810425
they will it will they will,0.6338503360748291
the nerves will work again,0.3964444398880005
they they will actually,0.7067921757698059
they will,0.7168406248092651
when when I when I when I I first,0.578997790813446
when when she and when I she and I first met,0.37772074341773987
we went to we went to different highschools together,0.35882243514060974
her from in near Washington Indiana in Washington,0.38585716485977173
and myself from Plainfield,0.3733026385307312
and it was before classes started at Purdue,0.2830389738082886
August of nineteen seventy two,0.4641842246055603
it was her first day on campus,0.28454485535621643
my first day on campus,0.31184738874435425
there was to be a a dance at the the dorm I,0.2733296751976013
again again each is our first first day on campus,0.31522294878959656
and and and and so I was a little bit,0.3628840148448944
which I I will arrive but place a little bit early given,0.28880539536476135
and so I ended up being just a little bit early for the,0.29020509123802185
and and my wife and and her her her,0.5035443305969238
guy girl girls girls go with with body guards,0.33918508887290955
I get that,0.5167582035064697
I think its a,0.343772828578949
her and her her and her wife and her and,0.5831078886985779
and and FirstnameSs wife has never met a,0.2961809039115906
the shes the a a true extrovert,0.36648112535476685
matter of fact if you look up in Webster extrovert and it said,0.23398441076278687
but anyway so so she and a girlfriend that,0.4161622226238251
and and wellco I answered,0.3995160162448883
and and then we I just I hung around,0.3616407811641693
I I I hung around her that that that that,0.4405255913734436
and thats where we started dating,0.3431209325790405
and and oh its we we dated probably three,0.2680930197238922
dated around about three years or so,0.28398409485816956
and after about four years I figured out that wellco maybe,0.2985976040363312
and I oughta get more serious about this,0.38703495264053345
so it was just like I I accused her of of,0.26486721634864807
thats where where we first met is she picked me up at a,0.21470630168914795
a young a young boy its look like a a grade,0.3422224223613739
is kicking it,0.4408845901489258
and he he it ends up going through a house window,0.2954961657524109
a gentleman on a couch there in the window sitting,0.30149325728416443
and then he he he gets the ball stands by the broken,0.3119603097438812
in the beginning this this mother it appears is had,0.3771360516548157
and he he says,0.4016159772872925
he says no and says,0.3290129601955414
and then then leaves,0.5935224294662476
and then in the middle it starts raining on him,0.3376493752002716
and then rains heavier on him,0.360522598028183
and then and then he goes back home just,0.4095986485481262
and then the last the end of the story was he learned his,0.351711243391037
the way this started was that the it looks like that,0.4100518226623535
that the dog is barking at a dog is barking at this guy,0.27200397849082947
and on the on the on a tree limb theres a cat,0.27957072854042053
and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree,0.2806533873081207
the a little girls cat climbed up the tree and got stuck,0.24286000430583954
they they they a male a man,0.4453706443309784
theres also a a firetruck and a fire engine,0.3239193856716156
but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder,0.318157434463501
and it looks like the d the the ladder is being used by,0.2721463441848755
and and the and a songbird is over on a a,0.3765200674533844
okay done,0.6831990480422974
Cinderella was a a daughter of a a subject of,0.3639485836029053
she her mother had passed her mother passed away,0.4514209032058716
and her father remarried,0.4994203448295593
and the stepmother had two two daughters who,0.40496906638145447
and as they after they were married the,0.3760509788990021
and so so Cinderella spent her time working cleaning,0.306230366230011
and and in that in the kingdom there was,0.4329802095890045
an advisor to the king suggested a a a ball be held,0.28498756885528564
so the word was put out about the ball coming up,0.2558959424495697
Cinderella was real happy about the about the ball,0.28158798813819885
and so the the the the farm animals,0.4921113848686218
and and then at the last minute the stepmother,0.36565884947776794

and so it it made for her a just a a lovely gown,0.3062933683395386
and they then turned a a pumpkin into a coach pulled,0.29387083649635315

and the prince was acquainted with the,0.4468221068382263
ended up spending the night dancing with Cinderella,0.3086390197277069

and then you put the thing,0.4058917164802551
and then you go and you,0.43450912833213806
I can be confused a couple of times,0.2558518052101135
sometimes I get the wrong words,0.36538249254226685
it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say,0.3788481652736664
sometimes its like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that Im trying to say,0.2677401006221771
I do have problems on sometimes on the relationship between words,0.2934882342815399
ke I know that Im wanna talk about a female relative,0.22711287438869476
and I might say the wrong one,0.3269285559654236
ke I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother,0.28435879945755005
stuff like that,0.5925518870353699
but I do have problems with numbers too,0.3776090145111084
I know if Im talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number even how many times she hasta repell,0.23625394701957703
so and just like that I I said repealq insteadof repeatq,0.4117271304130554
that thats some of the things that I have problems with,0.4096056818962097
but otherthan that Imean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow slowly I usually can get through it,0.3611689805984497
I dont know about it actually,0.4519575536251068
I was sposta be having a physical therapy at home,0.27600011229515076
and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kindof crazy she said,0.2892759144306183
I wasnt making sense,0.28142720460891724
and later that morning the physical therapist came,0.3770075738430023
and he had all all the he had all the equipment,0.38821738958358765
and he took my he took my vitals,0.29761481285095215
and he said that I should go to the emergency room,0.28226491808891296
and thats thats that I remember,0.39354896545410156
I didnt remember,0.4623868763446808
so my brother and my wife took me to the emergency room,0.24491506814956665
and luckily at the hospital that I went to has a good stroke thing,0.24056102335453033
so they took me right in there,0.3293113708496094
they took a even in the emergency room they had a ck,0.2764934301376343
so so thats about what I remember,0.44484955072402954
well when I when they took me back to the hospital room there I saw like five different doctors,0.2812976539134979
and they all did the same type of stuff,0.32701539993286133
so I could probably youknow do the the what a doctor would see to check about a about a stroke,0.2845228910446167
but I remember I had some memory loss,0.3769376277923584
ke by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit,0.22512494027614594
and although Ive know my brothers wife for youknow thirty five forty years I could not remember her name,0.2281494140625
ke one I said,0.28520336747169495
youknow stuff like that,0.4733566641807556
but it by the time I was discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the knowing that I did have some ha,0.258012980222702
I didnt know at the time that it was aphasia,0.2556314766407013
but I I knew the symptoms that I o o o protest,0.2491266429424286
but that thats all I remember,0.44577446579933167
well with the I didnt have any physical problems with the streak,0.2976539134979248
so when I did get well at the hospital they brought a speech therapist,0.2542804479598999
they didnt know how long I would be at the hospital,0.2631729543209076
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged,0.23735348880290985
so I had hoped I I knew I had problem speeching p,0.3859337568283081
so I had asked if I could forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well,0.32630395889282227
I I was walking and all that,0.35324302315711975
but they said that,0.5442250967025757
so I I had home speech therapy,0.33728358149528503
it was very good,0.43393784761428833
I I the the therapist was very good,0.3191610872745514
and she was actually the one that,0.4516203701496124
after they let me have I think its a Medicare type thing that you can use ten sessions,0.2607889771461487
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the speech clinic at Buffalo State in New York,0.22213363647460938
and alotof that was to get my memory back,0.26130473613739014
alotof the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories,0.2792264223098755
its hard to explain how it took,0.30505573749542236
I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist,0.24999158084392548
and after a couple of sessions with the neurologist he said youknow theres pretty much nothing else that he can do about it,0.22090329229831696
but if I had any other problems youknow they could call me,0.3398953676223755
one of the things they did they did probably one of those cognitive test,0.3643655478954315
I I did them,0.6039750576019287
and I did okay I guess,0.4172295331954956
probably sound like the stuff that they they said that President Trump aced youknow,0.31015706062316895
I had some problems with it,0.37478283047676086
but I had brain damage,0.3937915861606598
so I guess I had a reason,0.4160492420196533
but thats about it,0.45694640278816223
well probably one of the the the nicest things that I have recently was my daughter on this this Mothers Day she stopped over with the card for my wife,0.243147075176239
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant,0.2961732745170593
so on father,0.39088162779808044
and then on Fathers Day we went over to her house with my oh son inlaws parents,0.1968681514263153
and they did a review,0.32688793540000916
so they had a car,0.36017903685569763
and we saw that were going to have a grandson,0.2777755558490753
so that that is probably one of the youknow that period between there has been exciting for us,0.31264039874076843
okay,0.9999999403953552
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the window,0.23798036575317383
the ball breaks the window and startles the man who grabs the grabs the ball and looks out the window to see whats going on,0.2592787742614746
okay,0.9999999403953552
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school,0.2850710153579712
and he wanted to take or she wanted him to take an umbrella,0.2863067388534546
but he did not do that,0.48565053939819336
he started to walk back to school,0.34406620264053345
and the rain started to come,0.35752153396606445
so he ran back,0.35310113430023193
and the mother was alittle angry because he had not pulled it or he had not put the umbrella with him,0.27930957078933716
so he went back put the umbrella on and walked back to school,0.26145443320274353
okay,0.9999999403953552
well it looks like the cat was stuck in the tree,0.2549462616443634
and the man had tried to get to,0.3308452367782593
but he was not able to do that,0.38720136880874634
so the firemen came to to help him,0.36654284596443176
I dont know if theyre there to get the cat or the or get the man,0.2540833652019501
and the cat,0.4205080270767212
okay the story starts when a woman,0.2992115914821625
so rren Cinderella goes to the ep the man or the bad stepmother,0.20999778807163239
and the two children the the the stepmothers daughters were bad,0.40576431155204773
well they arent bad,0.3622836172580719
but they make Cinderella do all of the work around the house,0.3092193603515625
and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her,0.2820289731025696
and apparently they can talk with her,0.3651891350746155
and then at after awhile after several years it looks like after the Cinderella got alittle older there was a a invitation to go to the ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for Cinderella,0.24405711889266968
but then Cinderellas godfather,0.4292903244495392
and a she turns the animals into people that work for the stage not the stage the coach,0.3307313621044159
so they go to the ball where Cinderella meets the prince,0.26707860827445984
but becauseof the the godmother only could do the spell until midnight everything turned back to normal where her gown was gone,0.28279367089271545
and the coach were m,0.29174014925956726
and the animals were back,0.45507004857063293
but then there was a man that worked for the princess,0.3382798433303833
at the end they they put the glass ip slipper on Cinderitta,0.25177258253097534
and it fit r perfectly,0.3482942581176758
and they found that that was the woman that the prince was looking for,0.3912908732891083
and they went happy they went happy to the to the end,0.34862077236175537
and thats about it,0.3936235010623932
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
I would open up the bag of the bread,0.2616517245769501
put a piece of of slice of bread,0.32805269956588745
I would push,0.489555686712265
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around,0.3033602237701416
and then put the second top of the slice of bread,0.33072543144226074
and I guess thats it,0.35470980405807495
its pretty good,0.43915560841560364
I have problems sometimes especially with numbers still,0.4626869261264801
and sometimes I dont know if its because I dont hear the the the what Im saying correctly,0.2709677815437317
its something like if I was to say,0.292977899312973
I might say my incomeq taxedq or my incomeq xa or Texas,0.256385862827301
youknow stuff like that where I I kinda think twice of what the the real or the the word that I was trying to say,0.2759853005409241
something like that,0.7015981674194336
but other than that Im thinking I can talk pretty good as long as people give me time and slow down youknow because normally people speak faster than I can,0.26608291268348694
so usually if Im in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I I have some kind of problem speaking,0.28581562638282776
so they understand,0.6538665294647217
so it it its pretty good,0.49357229471206665
Imean ke I Ive gone to a bunch of doctors,0.20183290541172028
and youknow they might repeat something for me or youknow ask what I had really said stuff like that youknow if I say it wrong,0.31060850620269775
but otherthan that Im feeling okay speaking,0.338243693113327
oh I I I dont really too much about it,0.42467623949050903
I knew that I had been having physical therapy because Id had had a hip replacement the other hip replacement,0.2756463885307312
so that morning my wife ders or she said that she understood or she knew that I was having some kind of problems speaking,0.2884511649608612
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that,0.3975238502025604
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular session,0.31700825691223145
and he also noticed that I was speaking differently,0.3617947995662689
and he took my vitals and stuff like that,0.29304397106170654
and he said that I should go to the emergency room,0.28226491808891296
and after that were only maybe three miles from the hospital,0.3227454423904419
so my brother came over and took my wife and him over there,0.2772587537765503
and they sat there while I went through the emergency room and stuff like that,0.30227887630462646
so it it took about maybe three or four hours to have youknow go through,0.23719100654125214
they did some task,0.4642600417137146
and I think they have a good stroke thing,0.3692127466201782
so they actually in the emergency room they had a ct scan were I could do,0.26646435260772705
and then they they found where I had a room,0.3617887794971466
youknow and they they had found that I had had the stroke through the ct ct scan,0.2549871504306793
and then by the time I I went up to the room probably three or four other doctors came from youknow the the hospital doctor neurologist,0.24241305887699127
they actually had a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to stop the blood or anything,0.3123752772808075
but it looks like after it it the clot burst I was okay,0.31486836075782776
and there was no xxx more bleeding,0.28238385915756226
so that thats about what I remember,0.44732582569122314
and I I know when I saw the doctors at the room they all had the they have the same type of test that they do to see if it was really a stroke and what kind of damage it mightve been,0.2673429250717163
and I knew that I had some memory loss,0.3219294548034668
I recognized my brother and my wife,0.30858927965164185
but my brothers wife came later because she was a nurse,0.30479371547698975
and eventhough I know her for thirty five forty years I couldnt remember her name,0.24789439141750336
so I I did have some small or what do you call it short memory loss,0.30420777201652527
but that thats about it,0.5017400979995728
well at the hospital I I stayed there for three days,0.2543664574623108
and they did alot tests,0.31919434666633606
they did mris echocardiograms to make sure youknow I didnt have it,0.32827794551849365
they did things measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything,0.2896854281425476
they did ke the last day that I was there they brought a speech therapist there because they didnt know how long I would be at the hospital,0.26511967182159424
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my my speech xxx affected,0.20610378682613373
and it turned out that youknow the next day they s distarged,0.2584674060344696
and I never saw her again,0.3554532527923584
and becauseof my my medical insurance when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before they could start my speech therapy,0.27198880910873413
so I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house,0.25517699122428894
and that that was about it,0.4657272696495056
Im trying to think,0.3438336253166199
I I know last session I think I talked about my daughter being pregnant nowadays,0.3425319194793701
but if I was to think younger maybe a good time a thing that I liked was in my when I was twenty I was in the airforce,0.2723841369152069
and I was stationed in Italy in the Alps,0.3266894519329071
it was a radio station on top of a a mountain actually,0.2924793064594269
so having never learned how to play or how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn how to play or how to ski because our our sight was on the top of the mountain,0.23609966039657593
and they had a ski slopes there,0.3135206699371338
so I had a good time in Germany,0.2783931493759155
and the guy was a very old German guy that gave several of us skiing lesson,0.1910502314567566
and after that because our our location where I would work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didnt xxx,0.2479584962129593
so I got to be pretty good at ski playing ski,0.24153809249401093
I keep on saying playq playingq skiq,0.3649083971977234
skiing is skiing,0.5582373738288879
its not playing ski,0.3106463551521301
and that that was a good time,0.41826361417770386
yeah,1.0
yeah Imean it it it was a very small village where we lived when we were at when we were off the sight,0.26395121216773987
so there was alotof places to ski,0.2636798024177551
and it was only like forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg,0.2805289626121521
so we wed ski in alot a places around the Alps,0.21663373708724976
okay,0.9999999403953552
theres a boy in the yard playing with the o soccer ball,0.2077999711036682
he kicks the ball,0.3730510473251343
and it hits the window and breaks the window,0.35693463683128357
the window gets broken and comes through into the house and knocks the the lamb,0.3290509581565857
and then the man goes over to the window to see who had broke the window,0.2804514765739441
okay,0.9999999403953552
the story starts with the mother telling the young boy that he should take a umbrella,0.3036816120147705
but the child kinda waved it off saying that I dont need the umbrella,0.27553442120552063
and he starts walking to school,0.3327640891075134
and the rain starts to fall,0.3604532480239868
it starts getting alot heavier,0.374464750289917
so he runs back to his f or not his office to his house,0.2602498531341553
and he gets all wet,0.2947885990142822
and his mother is alittle mad at him because he didnt bring the umbrella like he told him,0.22338984906673431
so and then he went got the umbrella and started to walk back to school,0.2797863781452179
okay,0.9999999403953552
I think Im pretty good,0.41068175435066223
you want me to tell you what I okay,0.5065322518348694
what Im seeing at is a cat that is on top or on top of the tree,0.17458319664001465
and the young girl wants to bring him down,0.32027506828308105
and her father tried to go up the tree to get the cat out,0.2585424780845642
and the dog is barking at the man,0.29682841897010803
and apparently the father got stuck in the tree himself with,0.31897684931755066
and after that two firemen came to bring him a t a ladder to probably take both the father and the cat outof the tree,0.253976970911026
no I I think I I have them as as good as Ill be able to remember,0.29062360525131226
okay,0.9999999403953552
okay the story starts when a man brings his maybe his youngest her,0.2707599997520447
they start when they were earlier,0.49328580498695374
but after several years it turns out that Cinderella has has made hasta do all of the work to take care of the the the family there,0.24715276062488556
after awhile Cinderella starts to be friends with little critters,0.28817856311798096
after awhile there comes an announcement that theres gonna be a ball at the princes princes castle,0.21233686804771423
all the women the stepmother and the stepsisters were all dressed up for the ball,0.35258907079696655
but Cinderella was not invited,0.31687039136886597
so she started to look around or she was reading something,0.29001301527023315
and she saw a godfather,0.34333035349845886
and she had she made up a beautiful gown for Cinderella,0.23574991524219513
and she turned the animals into a couch,0.2975162863731384
so Cinderella and the prince had a beautiful time and were dancing,0.3014228641986847
and then at the strike,0.427473783493042
and the coach turned in back into a pumpkin,0.2761843502521515
so when she was leaving from the ball she left lost her glass slipper,0.2801026403903961
after they found the glass glass slipper a man who worked for the king and the prince went around to try and to see if they could find who dropped the glass slipper,0.24268463253974915
so they look,0.604995846748352
and none of the other woman at the house would fit with the the slipper until they found Cindereed,0.3019120395183563
so they went to the castle,0.3488791584968567
and the prince and nder Cinderella got married and live happily vu,0.22430366277694702
okay,0.9999999403953552
I would get a couple slices of bread,0.2656927704811096
the way I would usually do it would be spread the peanut butter on one slice,0.2849900722503662
put a little bit of jam around it,0.2785665690898895
and then put the top slice,0.3456573784351349
and then usually cut it in half,0.3563644289970398

most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well,0.2742379307746887
but it seems like when I get in a situation where Im in a hurry is more when my speech or my I lose some of the the words that I want,0.23534181714057922
and I found that the going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know Im hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it,0.2401558756828308
so thats what I do for youknow my help,0.30669844150543213
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache,0.27517834305763245
I normally in the morning go out get the paper have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work,0.25813189148902893
and I went out and got the paper,0.2817080020904541
I still had a splitting headache,0.3658444285392761
I took a couple of aspirin came in and had a bowl of cereal for breakfast,0.21459746360778809
and while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper,0.29576051235198975
and I opened it up,0.2775479555130005
and I could not read what was on the newspaper,0.2703855633735657
I couldnt see a whole paragraph,0.2998611629009247
and blocks of characters were missing altogether,0.434357613325119
so thats the first thing,0.3721581995487213
so I just I set the paper aside and said,0.27351146936416626
and got dressed and went to work,0.3341584801673889
I droving,0.46622639894485474
and what I was seeing on the highway again on the dashboard of the car I couldnt see all of the f s instrumentation on the dash,0.2134535312652588
but I was able to drive fine and go to work,0.3073188066482544
no problem at all there,0.38801369071006775
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office,0.24529385566711426
and I couldnt remember my login,0.2854374945163727
didnt know how to log in,0.25566983222961426
and I still had the headache,0.3469036817550659
I talked to my boss and and told her what was going on,0.23031331598758698
she said,0.5303276181221008
remember I took probably a half hour forty five minutes and still couldnt,0.25095006823539734
so I said,0.48068174719810486
I came home took acouple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day,0.22780247032642365
that was on a Thursday,0.32591474056243896
on Friday morning I got up,0.32286596298217773
and I exercise on Friday Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning,0.26269108057022095
so I went to exercise class,0.31080031394958496
and I exercised,0.4050242602825165
but when I was with the group I was talking,0.31982970237731934
and what I was saying wasnt making sense to me,0.2614597976207733
wasnt making sense to any of my friends,0.23791372776031494
youknow they the words were correct,0.31590333580970764
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words,0.3830133378505707
they didnt fit whiff,0.3444039523601532
and so I said,0.3465745747089386
so I came back home and had breakfast when I got back from exercise,0.2962563633918762
and then I normally would go to work,0.3914557099342346
but I couldnt go to work,0.3529941141605377
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to see my doctor,0.2965986430644989
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a ar heart l the colo heart doctor,0.24257946014404297
and she talked me instead to go to the emergency room,0.2828587591648102
went to the emergency room,0.356266587972641
and they discovered that Id had a stroke,0.29470938444137573
and so they put me in the hospital,0.2857377827167511
and I was there three days,0.28433868288993835
they were trying basically my heart was outof rhythm and was beating too fast and lotsof different things,0.2624894976615906
so they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized,0.33011549711227417
and then three more days basically discovering that Id had a stroke and aphasia,0.2892182767391205
and then I was went home after the trying to think what day of the week it was,0.26706916093826294
Wednesday Wednesday I went home,0.3803517818450928
and Thursday I drove back to the drove then because I could drive,0.2967114746570587
I could everything do everything I needed to do except talk,0.43040668964385986
so I went to make a appointment with the speech therapy at that point,0.25281187891960144
and thats where it started,0.36173537373542786
well it started out with something simple because basically I could look at at anything and know what it was,0.31862330436706543
but I couldnt pull the words out,0.2947893440723419
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example,0.3194721043109894
looking around the room,0.46665531396865845
looking at each object in the room,0.32741275429725647
naming it,0.5797344446182251
trying to find the the word and say the word out loud,0.29156431555747986
youknow so thats where it first started,0.29354414343833923
and it built from there,0.37513652443885803
youknow just and some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago youknow like with the pictures,0.24955634772777557
youknow look at the picture,0.2763574719429016
name the picture,0.5179662108421326
and over time that gradually got better and better,0.4345860481262207
but thats where I think the start with the therapy was,0.3137427568435669
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out,0.28169238567352295
and I found when writing I taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldnt spell properly anymore,0.264123797416687
and youknow that was something I had to work at,0.2729905843734741
so I found that with my keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil,0.26686862111091614
and with a notebood,0.5859554409980774
it it has a spellchecker and a ell,0.3306247591972351
not Im not sure what youd call it necessarily,0.364767462015152
a checker,0.49986982345581055
but it starts out youknow if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work,0.2711721956729889
so that sometimes helped alot aswell writing,0.3407881557941437
so Ive done alotof that,0.35952243208885193
but its mainly working with seeing what seeing the words and then saying it out loud,0.32705220580101013
thats done more I think better than anything else,0.3956262469291687
and I worked hard at it for a long time,0.2693270146846771
and then I took got kindof afterwards Ive kinda gotten alittle slow about it,0.3020789623260498
or not slow but just havent done it as diligently as I used to,0.30196598172187805
but for the first months after the stroke I was I worked hard at it,0.2582428455352783
trying to pull those pictures back,0.3987668454647064
and I found that you its its like learning in school again grade school,0.28391146659851074
you look at a word,0.29482531547546387
and you learn that word,0.4204501211643219
and and oh thats that word,0.3351231813430786
and it comes back and stays back,0.3856697976589203
but with aphasia it doesnt stay there,0.2985588610172272
its its more like having an electronic dictionary that is occasionally gets scrambled,0.2962706983089447
youknow its like,0.35056018829345703
youknow that type of thing,0.34260013699531555
so,0.9999999403953552
happy,1.0000001192092896
I think when my grandson was born,0.2706204950809479
he was a joy to be around,0.27391865849494934
and I got to spend alotof time with him when he was little and an infant,0.23788386583328247
and watching him grow,0.385754257440567
and just that was special,0.42717185616493225
hes ten now,0.28913265466690063
and hes doesnt spend as much crime,0.19702589511871338
and hes off doing other things,0.29636889696121216
so,0.9999999403953552
www,1.0000001192092896
www,1.0000001192092896
okay,0.9999999403953552
boys out kicking a soccer ball,0.35534942150115967
kicked it,0.5025981664657593
got alittle too close,0.46194541454315186
kicked it through the window,0.3596982955932617
Im not sure whether thats his neighbor or his dad,0.229213684797287
but the window s,0.3559490144252777
and a Id say his dad saw it,0.1967383325099945
opened looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball,0.2817794382572174
okay,0.9999999403953552
in the beginning the mom sent little boy out to go to school,0.23951572179794312
she,0.9999998807907104
and he didnt want to take his umbrella,0.24022094905376434
so he said,0.4265557527542114
and he went out and he went out,0.35104063153266907
and the rain started raining,0.4610106945037842
and so he ran back to the house,0.29501116275787354
and his mom was upset with him and for going out without the umbrella,0.2536792755126953
and so he got a umbrella,0.2672880291938782
and went back out with an umbrella the next time,0.29150325059890747
alright,0.9999998807907104
well it looks like the beginning the little girl was riding her bicycle or tricycle,0.28244152665138245
and the dog or,0.39079421758651733
and the dog chased the cat up the tree,0.31158795952796936
and so she called back to her dad and said,0.2749136984348297
and he got out a ladder,0.2849518358707428
went out to climb up to get the cat down,0.27597227692604065
and the ladder fell,0.39111506938934326
and so they hadta call the fire to help him and the cat get down the tree,0.29095619916915894
so thats pretty much the story,0.3551058769226074
alright,0.9999998807907104
Cinderella,1.0
well originally apparently her mother died,0.40949177742004395
and her and her family were comfortably welloff,0.4452207386493683
and that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters aswell that moved in with her,0.3027525246143341
and they were not very friendly with her,0.3808929920196533
and over time her father must be outof the picture for some reason because she the change of the Cinderella and the family changed dramatically,0.307571142911911
and she became more of a slave than a a sister and the girl and the mother,0.3230178654193878
and things got worse and worse as she got older,0.2821650505065918
and one point in time she got acquainted,0.2921350598335266
or how do I say it,0.4003509283065796
she learned to live with the animals in the home in the family or in the house and outside the home aswell,0.3403632938861847
and they became her friends instead of her stepsisters,0.3695773482322693
and that developed over time,0.48365551233291626
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his the princess,0.392945259809494
so he they planned on a ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the the kingdom,0.25668802857398987
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave not take sepmother,0.3445674479007721
and Cinderella had a gown somewhere I think,0.24848231673240662
from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but a trunk someplace,0.2850362956523895
and she got it out,0.3405626714229584
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters,0.34301555156707764
and they ended up tearing it up,0.34854739904403687
and she didnt have anything,0.32823386788368225
and then the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to redo her dress,0.31350547075271606
her stairy,1.0
there we go,0.5435763001441956
I got a word,0.3646179437637329
fairy godmother stepped in aswell,0.2916533648967743
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into horses,0.27213138341903687
and anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball,0.3403371274471283
and stepmother the the prince fell in love with Cinderella,0.31890636682510376
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening,0.31701067090034485
and they Cinderella hadta hadta leave at midnight,0.28138890862464905
and as she was leaving she left her one slipper got left behind,0.29942381381988525
and they couldnt find her,0.3292374312877655
they had to looked all over for Cinderella or for the girl,0.2625863254070282
and they couldnt find her until they finally came to her home,0.3207911550998688
and her stepmothers couldnt stepsisters couldnt fit the slipper,0.25915491580963135
but Cinderella could,0.4548400640487671
so thats where they ended it,0.3716415464878082
oh thats easy,0.32967740297317505
get two pieces of bread,0.30398550629615784
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife,0.25806841254234314
put the peanut butter on one side of the bread,0.30594685673713684
jelly on the other,0.36729663610458374
put them together,0.5298133492469788
you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,0.3278083801269531
well its doing fairly well except when I get in a hurry and try to describe something for someone,0.2726241648197174
thats where I have more problem with speech than anything I think,0.3414511978626251
is s describing something for somebody else to know what Im trying to talk about,0.27622920274734497
especially FirstnameP my wife,0.37928080558776855
seems like youknow Im think,0.34913206100463867
and then youknow get the details,0.3206426203250885
and then sometimes the details dont dont work well,0.29934632778167725
so,0.9999999403953552
all I remember about the stroke is the fact I woke up one morning with a splitting headache,0.25927630066871643
and it was so bad that,0.36973443627357483
I think its probably the worst headache I ever had,0.34523987770080566
took a couple aspirin and went to outside and picked up the mail my not the mail but my newspaper,0.22611699998378754
went back to have breakfast,0.3643641769886017
and as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast I tried to read,0.2547466456890106
and I could not make read the paper properly,0.33759111166000366
the blocks of words were just that,0.3790264129638672
they were blocks,0.5211238265037537
and some of it they werent all together,0.35786160826683044
it was like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words not the whole words,0.28298041224479675
so I left the newspaper that morning and didnt read it and finished getting ready and went to work,0.2595963180065155
and drove to work,0.40009844303131104
and on the way to work I noticed that on the dashboard of the car again parts of that was I could see parts of the dashboard,0.2805955708026886
and parts of it I couldnt see,0.2563941180706024
I couldnt see all the words all that,0.3523772954940796
but I was able to drive properly,0.36189520359039307
and drove to work,0.40009844303131104
got to work,0.42547956109046936
and when I tried to got to work I tried to log into my computer,0.29583707451820374
and I didnt know how,0.33960187435150146
I think thats probably the best thing I can say about that,0.3691306710243225
I didnt know how to log in,0.26090118288993835
I didnt know my username,0.3632400333881378
I didnt know my password,0.375443696975708
anything,1.0
and I just had a total blank with that,0.29685452580451965
so I worked at it for a while and couldnt couldnt do anything,0.2504671514034271
so I finally went to my boss and said,0.26342788338661194
hey Ive got a problem,0.2975142300128937
and I was asked,0.3131224513053894
so I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again,0.21501216292381287
and I couldnt make it,0.3370048701763153
so I finally said,0.42227548360824585
so I went home and went to bed,0.2898787558078766
when I got home I took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and spent most of the day in bed,0.20047830045223236
and I I slept,0.39334845542907715
and then when I got up in the afternoon I was able to read,0.25480490922927856
I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that,0.27167949080467224
but it still was problems,0.49173668026924133
and I do Sudokus the puzzle,0.2729823887348175
and I did that on the computer and was able to do it,0.30041787028312683
it took much much longer than normally to do it the puzzle,0.33009159564971924
but I was able to complete that,0.3933930993080139
and then had a normal evening and went to bed early,0.3154063820838928
got up the next day and went to exercise class with a group that we meet at early in the mornings on Monday Wednesday and Friday,0.2331152856349945
and this was a Friday morning that,0.3437698483467102
Id gone to work on Thursday,0.20611105859279633
couldnt work,0.43014273047447205
so then Friday when I got up I went exercise with the group,0.2546641230583191
and with the group we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up,0.27977311611175537
and while were walking we talk and visit with eachother,0.3563137948513031
and when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didnt make sense as far as the the words that I was speaking,0.25735846161842346
the words were correct,0.4218578040599823
but they were not making sense as complete words,0.38261082768440247
so I said knew there was something wrong,0.38143447041511536
my friends knew there was something wrong,0.3739696145057678
so I when I got through the exercise class,0.3115699589252472
we spent an hour exercising together,0.2753329277038574
I went home and had breakfast,0.3174835741519928
and I told FirstnameP,0.32244279980659485
I said,0.5259465575218201
that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor,0.36591213941574097
and she decided that ratherthan that wed take me to the emergency room,0.29135000705718994
and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that Id had a stroke,0.26026615500450134
and so I spent the next three days,0.2530078887939453
well there was a problem with my heart,0.3075610101222992
my heart was beating too fast and outof rhythm,0.22284293174743652
and so they spent most of the time from the next two or three days correcting that issue,0.28743019700050354
and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia,0.35048240423202515
and theyd discovered that Id had a stroke and had aphasia,0.26950618624687195
so thats pretty much where I am,0.343186616897583
well I tried to,0.4101722538471222
no I I really didnt youknow,0.4137537479400635
I just thought I had a headache youknow,0.4056289792060852
and talking with FirstnameP later she said on on the Wednesday the day before I woke up with a headache she said,0.22167138755321503
ke Wednesday night late Id l mentioned that I had a headache then,0.22393803298473358
so I dont remember that at all that part of it,0.2946712076663971
but its,0.6135351657867432
so,0.9999999403953552
yes,0.9999998807907104
yes I do,0.6168991327285767
yeah yeah,1.0
well I think the best thing that happened was I got a great therapist,0.31346067786216736
and she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction,0.27824780344963074
its finding what needed to be done,0.3535962700843811
and then working with me to get that,0.3808043599128723
but basically I went therapy three times a week for several months,0.2839725911617279
and then dropped down to a couple times a week and we til finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us were youknow Id already done all of them,0.2325623780488968
and reached a point where they couldnt go any further with it,0.2872483432292938
so yeah,0.6882684230804443
but starting Ive got a squirrel running across my patio,0.22999078035354614
nevermind,1.0
let go of that one,0.3224625885486603
but part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures with the that we saw with all the drawings of different things,0.2981620132923126
I had the same thing sitting in a go in the room,0.2768905460834503
sit in here,0.3831985592842102
look around,0.6006121635437012
and name each object I see in that room and say it out loud,0.24067635834217072
youknow Id tell I can figure,0.33433181047439575
youknow sometimes youknow you know all these words,0.4071773290634155
you know all these items,0.5138368606567383
but you dont aim not able to pull those words out,0.32488909363746643
and the same thing driving down the street,0.4140687584877014
you look at say a mailbox,0.26262107491493225

and its something that Ive kept along with all the as long as Ive had a aphasia now,0.24204403162002563
its youknow when I look at something Ill say the name of that item just to keep keep it going,0.22654302418231964
and so thats one of the things I do all the time,0.3226865828037262
I I dont even think about it alotof the times,0.32845064997673035
its just something automatic to do,0.38273975253105164
okay,0.9999999403953552

so he l left home without the umbrella,0.25381171703338623
and as he was walking to school it started raining,0.2941919267177582

so ran back,0.40928977727890015
and his mom was upset about it,0.2603644132614136
but he got his umbrella and went back out to and went back to school carrying his umbrella,0.27966779470443726
alright,0.9999998807907104
at the beginning it looks like the little girl was out in the yard on her tricycle,0.24133482575416565
the dog was out in the yard,0.2833116352558136
and the cat was out in the yard,0.2834518253803253

and the little girl got upset then got her father to get the cat outof the tree,0.24017983675003052
he brought the ladder out climbed the ladder and in the process knocked the ladder down and got stuck in the tree,0.2903582453727722
and then they had to call the fire department to rescue the father and the cat,0.3371307849884033
so and hopefully thats where everybody got back down on the ground after the from the ladder the firemen brought,0.3238939642906189

alright,0.9999998807907104
Cinderella,1.0
story started out when she was a small young girl,0.30510902404785156
and her apparently her mother died,0.4855577051639557
and her father brought home a stepmother,0.4296136200428009
and they met e when she was young,0.2730250656604767
and met with her stepsisters aswell,0.348275363445282
and as they grew it looked like more and more she was acted as a servant rather than a child or a girl in the family as part of the family,0.2610318660736084
she was more of a servant,0.29598328471183777
and so they grew up that way,0.35297495126724243
and then over time she got to know the animals in the home,0.31272730231285095
horse and the dog and the mice,0.39594152569770813
and had more of a friends with those than with the other two people,0.37169113755226135
and then as she grew the family or the king in that ighbor neighborhood city whatever had a son that was grown same time,0.2821393609046936
and he decided the son needed to meet a girl his age and possibly,0.2685645818710327
dont know what the situation was there,0.31022435426712036
but anyway he decided to create a ball to bring all of the eligible girls in the kingdom and and meet them and decide who might be his girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it,0.24419575929641724
and so they sent that invitation out,0.36321017146110535
the stepmother saw it and planned on taking his,0.30923500657081604
Cinderella wanted to go aswell,0.2952876091003418
so she with the help of the animals made a build a a dress for her a gown and showed it to her stepmother and the daught or the sisters,0.27795958518981934
and they ended up in damaged it tore it,0.2675133943557739
so she couldnt wear it,0.3805371820926666
and somehow she got her godmother found out about it and helped her get another dress and changed and set the animals up as a coach and horses and took her to the ball,0.25862646102905273
and while she was at the ball she met the princess,0.28937429189682007

she lost her one of her slippers as they were leaving,0.273429811000824
it was too late,0.40078142285346985
so he sent people out looking for slipper to match the girl,0.23885594308376312
and eventually they found it at their home,0.3660557270050049
the stepmothers stepsisters didnt werent able to fit it,0.24481557309627533
the mother tried to break the glass slipper,0.32666927576065063
and they recovered it,0.4693557024002075
and they got got the princess or to the Cinderella,0.2730239927768707
she was able to wear it,0.3174024820327759
and she showed them also the other one that she had,0.3976273834705353
so she had those to prove that she was the person that actually had the slipper,0.36652031540870667

I I can tell you about our trip to China,0.30796608328819275
it was a land and tour sea tour trip,0.27278032898902893
we took an airplane from Singapore,0.23612798750400543
and we flew to other hotels,0.29499608278274536
the airplane flew to Tibet,0.32225140929222107
and we got to see many beautiful temples,0.30410662293434143
and the people were walking around the temple,0.4384666085243225
and it was very beautiful,0.38370898365974426
and I enjoyed going inside the temple,0.3275318443775177
they had a very big Buddha there who was made all of gold,0.2497902363538742
and it was an immense amount of gold,0.2785876989364624
the people burned oil in the temple,0.36952701210975647
and we had to inhale the smoke,0.3121715188026428
the visiting the temple was very beautiful,0.4134894907474518
we saw the people doing exercises,0.34478962421417236
or not exercises,0.5301473140716553
they were praying,0.5557734966278076
and they prayed by moving their bodies up and down,0.34235286712646484
so I enjoyed watching them,0.4641248285770416
then we walked along the street,0.3761294484138489
and we went to various vendors,0.3425185978412628
and we purchased a silver Buddha and a singing bowl,0.24249671399593353
and that was rary,0.5107845664024353
then we went to eyenother,0.44960498809814453
and it was so tall,0.3064880073070526
the height of the place was very tall fourteen thousand feet,0.3098463714122772
and I had altitude sickness,0.344838947057724
and I had to have oxygen,0.3416672945022583
and the ee doctor gave me oxygen at night and the next day,0.20736905932426453
so I was glad to leave Tibet after that time,0.2906376123428345
then I took a boat on the Yangtzi river,0.27734479308128357
and it was very beautiful,0.38370898365974426
the boat stopped at different cities along the way,0.334293931722641
and we saw many bridges that went across the river,0.30555835366249084
and I thought that it was interesting,0.4260829985141754
it looks like a young boy is practicing his kicking,0.29815664887428284
and he is kicking the soccer ball,0.29200640320777893
and the soccer ball hits a window,0.28203773498535156
and it is broken,0.3423435688018799
and he knocks over a lamp and startles the man who is sitting in the chair,0.24405410885810852
and the man in the chair gets up,0.289888858795166
and he picks up the ball,0.29499509930610657
and he looks out the window at the boy maybe wondering where the soccer ball came from,0.24706941843032837
the mother is trying to get the young boy to accept the umbrella when hes going to go out,0.24746684730052948
but the young boy says no,0.29446402192115784
he doesnt need the umbrella,0.24921250343322754
and he will do without it,0.33666545152664185
but he gets out,0.42468762397766113
and he finds that it is raining on him,0.29814401268959045
and he gets very wet and decides that that is not a good thing,0.3191761076450348
so he comes back,0.39339929819107056
and he talks to his mother,0.38715437054634094
and he is very unhappy because he is very wet,0.31524428725242615
so the mother gives him an umbrella,0.2679790258407593
and he goes back out into the rain,0.3155667781829834
but now he has the umbrella to protect him,0.29971006512641907
and he can walk in the rain just fine,0.2528459429740906
a picture of a man who went up the tree to rescue the kitty,0.23201744258403778
and in the process he got stuck up on the tree,0.245279923081398
and they had to call the fire department to get him down and to rescue him,0.3233635425567627
and the girl is crying about the kitty,0.28090518712997437
and the dog is barking,0.3724406957626343
it seems asthough the ladder fell out away from the man,0.27687615156173706
and thats how he got stuck in the tree,0.22424739599227905
the story of Cinderella begins when,0.3348761796951294
and he is introducing Cinderella to his,0.2783429026603699
they are introduced,0.44723260402679443
and the life goes on,0.3578982949256897
and the father passes away,0.4255661070346832
and the stepmother and the stepdaughters are very mean to Cinderella,0.3305779695510864
they treat her very badly and have her cleaning out the fireplaces which is how she got her name Cinderella,0.24704870581626892
and so she also has to clean out the stables,0.3351152539253235
but along this time comes a announcement from the castle,0.3354525864124298
and the manager speaks an announcement that there is going to be a great ball because they want the prince to find a consort or a wife,0.2645915448665619
so the princess so Cinderella makes her a dress,0.30789947509765625
she finds a book and makes a pretty dress with bows and sashes,0.263443261384964
and it is very pretty pink and white,0.3407741189002991
but the sepsisters,0.6426827311515808
and they hurt the dress,0.33739712834358215
they tore off the sashes and the bows,0.29225659370422363
and the stepmother looked on and allowed this to happen,0.3527383804321289
so then they went off,0.4373023509979248
and they were going to the ball,0.3811272084712982
but the princesses no the magic lady came along,0.2992638349533081
and she was a good fairy,0.2983437180519104
and she made a beautiful dress for Cinderella,0.292949378490448
and she made the pumpkin turn into a beautiful coach and the dog into a concert some kind of person to help with the coat,0.24726776778697968
and then the mice were turned into magical horses,0.34286046028137207
so then Cinderella went off to the ball,0.28567659854888916
and she had a wonderful time,0.34483587741851807
and the prince thought she was very beautiful and had nice dances with her,0.3211394250392914
and the stepmother and stepsisters were jealous,0.44045397639274597
and so they were whispering and talking,0.4570181965827942
and the princess no Cinderella went outside into the garden,0.29624834656715393
and she noticed that the time was getting close to midnight,0.3469792604446411
and she knew that she had to hurry back because everything would turn back at midnight into its natural form,0.2819005846977234
so she quick got into the carriage and went home,0.2681643068790436
and she just about made it,0.37824225425720215
and allofasudden the pumpkin returned its way,0.3314594328403473
and they the pumpkin returned to its natural form,0.35091179609298706
and the mice turned into horses,0.3536284863948822
and the and so then they man in the castle made an announcement because she left a glass slipper on the stairway when she ran away,0.24702291190624237
and they were going to try and find the person who fit the glass slipper,0.2816861569881439
so the manager person came around,0.31173980236053467
and they locked Cinderella the stepmother and stepsisters locked Cinderella in the room,0.3151227831840515
but she had the help of the mice,0.30996793508529663
and they helped slip the key out,0.3265092670917511
and she was able to come out,0.3024362325668335
and she fit the glass slipper exactly perfect,0.3020908534526825
and so then the Cinderella and the prince got together,0.3497753143310547
and they got married and lived happily ever after,0.3033663332462311
I would have two pieces of bread,0.2967602014541626

and the questions,0.6189671754837036
it just happened,0.6613262891769409
well in the well first of all Im working,0.28300899267196655
and allofasudden I had,0.3976324796676636
I couldnt open the door,0.29159846901893616
so I did,0.5862208604812622
and shaky I guess,0.3603869676589966
and I sat down,0.2849231958389282
and itll go away,0.2724498212337494
and and I couldnt speak,0.30949345231056213
and I didnt know whats going on,0.2625501751899719
and then on the ground,0.5219488739967346
and obviously something is wrong,0.4399690330028534
bumpy ride with the hospital,0.30599334836006165
and then I,0.4785293936729431
and and then its fuzzy,0.43150001764297485
but I still remember the brain is like,0.3728885352611542
after the hospital or the er,0.3038310706615448
and then outpatient I guess,0.38628536462783813
asleeping,0.0
and youknow maybe a months ago,0.25660476088523865
and the brain is,0.433144211769104
I didnt understand but I didnt notice,0.4093840718269348
and and I think a way people dont know,0.30277255177497864
and that is a sign of fragile okay,0.27652063965797424
so eight eight years Im learning still,0.2932421565055847
but I I think Im very I wanna know more,0.41002869606018066
alot,0.9999998807907104
questions with the the the doctors,0.555433988571167

and I still have not recovered,0.41617095470428467
and its May,0.43954795598983765

and like the restaurant typically Ill explain alot,0.271659791469574
and everybody understands me,0.44587987661361694
so thats refreshing youknow,0.3555806279182434
you mean years ago,0.3443683385848999
well I remember LexusOfTowson,0.5130665898323059

and on the ground now,0.44935745000839233
and the supervisor,0.6016630530357361

and I can remember the the hospital or the emergency room,0.31661519408226013
and I couldnt speak,0.31487980484962463
and I was really I dont I didnt know whats going on,0.2871161699295044
and then I blacked out,0.3951135575771332
confused,1.0000001192092896
I remember hearing mom asking alotof questions,0.3475455045700073
and Im silent,0.24621394276618958
Im Im in the hospital,0.21870458126068115

and then my work,0.44003069400787354
his his boss he comes,0.439651757478714
and I remember people came like,0.36045682430267334
and praying,0.6196501851081848
so yeah I Imean I Ive alotof things,0.4375476539134979
and it I guess repairing,0.3725143074989319
so tell me what kinds of things have you done since your stroke to try to get better,0.31525954604148865
and lots to things to do,0.4225435256958008
with and in retrospect,0.5817494988441467
youknow its xxx ke I didnt know whats going on,0.19731158018112183
and youknow whats yesq and noq,0.30897170305252075
and I said youknow I I didnt get it,0.3146132230758667
and then yesq,0.7074459791183472
and so its ke okay,0.2496681958436966
a a boy playing,0.4628852605819702
and then middle school youknow n kindergarten,0.28375282883644104
and Ive,0.3717079162597656
the garden is two years,0.2989942133426666
and Im doing exercise conversation,0.3036250174045563
I like that because I can talk,0.44644516706466675
and one to one,0.530534565448761
now,1.000000238418579
or I dont care,0.35807037353515625
alotof times I do,0.37808045744895935
and I respond,0.38979196548461914
and all of it helps healing,0.3950013220310211
understand,1.0
okay,0.9999999403953552
sure lets see,0.5079517960548401
that is complex,0.5724312663078308
and I I will I Ill tell you,0.363663911819458
FirstnameM my girl she was I think ten,0.33758100867271423
FirstnameM,0.0
and FirstnameE is eight,0.4209040105342865
and the difference is very its like,0.40453284978866577
and I was,0.36448144912719727
whats the term,0.36344999074935913
Im healing,0.3234821856021881
so FirstnameE realize,0.7962421774864197
and she my wife she is also doing that,0.3128562271595001
so there is a shift,0.3837294280529022
okay,0.9999999403953552
the opposite FirstnameE is clueless now,0.4117543399333954
and he,0.5471725463867188
and she says not knowing anything,0.40526115894317627
and so in retrospect it made sense because,0.3680418133735657
Im doing nothing,0.3711017370223999
and FirstnameE is doing something,0.4264987111091614
now I realize now like three years and I I says,0.3135555684566498
so I did whats they call it talking,0.3779241740703583
and,1.0
somebody else FirstnameE and FirstnameP that was working,0.36501145362854004
so atleast I did more,0.44129642844200134
and then I also did the restaurant with Starbucks or ic EllicottCity,0.2423308789730072
and I did more now,0.33856070041656494
so Im happy,0.4030889868736267
and Im sad because I missed it,0.27984538674354553
and I always told you youknow,0.3381306827068329
but you can,0.5754196047782898
yeah okay,0.8172538876533508
oh by the way FirstnameE is at school almost,0.19460320472717285
college,0.9999999403953552
yeah its exciting,0.3528255522251129
I I think,0.755821168422699
yeah yup,0.7180522680282593
yeah still,0.5928136706352234
and she is good,0.3275792598724365

I didnt know anything,0.48385781049728394
if infact afterwards I didnt even know my wife,0.33415260910987854

being here,0.6265963912010193
it it seems better until the first almost a first year was I said it happened me on August of a year ago,0.22137996554374695
and after having been in the hospital for two weeks then I was at home by myself,0.26845771074295044
and until I got into a group of people from people who were hlu,0.24992354214191437
so,0.9999999403953552
not weeks pntsu,0.5548027157783508
from g from August until I think it was April in this,0.21365474164485931
and then that was the end of my it was being ht,0.29371634125709534
what would it be,0.518855094909668
Apriata v I didnt hafta pay for them,0.17087362706661224
and there were two women,0.4508962333202362
if it was three s,0.25258690118789673
and either on,0.5497817993164062
and alotof language of eating,0.3803945779800415
and so then that they felt that was fidu,0.447762668132782
and then I to inch s,0.2691448926925659
youknow it was only three s,0.24545839428901672
and I loved it,0.3836117684841156
and so they peu,0.38034671545028687
and,1.0
and she felt that I was not she felt that I I because of my age I guess I think that was the reason that I should stndu,0.3504345715045929
and had I been in the country I would have been fine,0.3167882561683655
but in the city like this it it is,0.3632647395133972
my mother,0.5947120189666748
and so I arranged to have I sold it,0.3013274073600769
so within actually two weeks two ksu,0.3934290409088135
and youknow it was unhappy for me but thats the way it goes,0.2585470676422119
yeah,1.0
yes,0.9999998807907104
it it was about April April it was August,0.3321628272533417
and it was,0.4142388105392456
I I had it on Rehoboth and the each on the side,0.2721765339374542
and I had had driven because Im always driving back and there a great deal,0.2945103645324707
and and I came home in the afternoon and at which for about this period,0.29917141795158386
and went I came in my ri,0.23250508308410645
I live by I live myself,0.3571653366088867
then I,0.6682052612304688
well wait a minute,0.3280034065246582
I feel Im gonna,0.33828556537628174
no okay I,0.5168726444244385
anyway I went in to lie down,0.26780787110328674
and there was something,0.44695329666137695
and I I think I must have put a phone on and called one of my daughters,0.2236715704202652
I have two daughters,0.3704855442047119
and I was lying there and then allofasudden they came in with a daughter of one of them,0.2915011942386627
and they said,0.4319881200790405
they came outside with the with the peep s,0.2966444492340088
I said,0.5259465575218201
and because Im lying there and,0.352142333984375
and finally I said,0.35431522130966187
so I went just they just took me like I was to gsu,0.3669368028640747
and when I arrived,0.3502245247364044
because I have been there many times for other things,0.42876696586608887
and when I went there they put me immediately into the hbskulu,0.3166695535182953
and to they thought that Id had a stroke which I guess thats what they accomplished,0.31486302614212036
and so they were they gave me a nice room by myself,0.2544878125190735
and I I guess I just sortof didnt say much,0.39731815457344055
and I was there for two two weeks,0.285399466753006
and they had many people coming in h wdnksu,0.3239186704158783
what Im trying to think,0.359066367149353
pilu,0.0
some of them I knew and some I did not,0.34524020552635193
and so the and and they walked me alot,0.31199362874031067
they told me to they helped me walking,0.3660788834095001
and and I was doing things like that,0.3782016634941101
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I I didnt,0.3750498294830322
and then I I said,0.3660203814506531
ksdu,0.0
so thats what they did of two weeks,0.2762719690799713
and thats when they did alotof what applications right in there,0.31222519278526306
and what was going to happen,0.34547919034957886
and so thats the way it is,0.3542102575302124
and and fortunately nothing else came a great bfrntsu,0.35673046112060547
but but it was I assume it was something in my,0.36857613921165466
what what alotof people that I talk here in this group of people I will say,0.29764384031295776
and theyve told me about many have told me about it,0.29094696044921875
so I I feel the same,0.394893079996109
and I I have walked for years I have have the every morning at six oclock get the NewYorkTimes to me at the door,0.23039905726909637
and so then they continue do that now,0.4456041753292084
but now Im having a problem because youknow I can I Im I can part s,0.27223488688468933
have you heard of something like that,0.41709986329078674
where I hafta go back and and sometimes it stop and sometimes it doesnt,0.2720760405063629
do you understand me,0.5843141078948975
yeah,1.0
no I I I tried very difficult,0.43570616841316223
but Ive gone my daughter one daughter is in furious s,0.21180902421474457
and Ive in in January I went with her to NewYork NewYork for almost a week,0.18762855231761932
and met alotof people many people Ive known,0.23762352764606476
and so,0.5900565385818481
and we wed go out in the evening and and that that was fine but not not particularly on my own,0.27828121185302734
really,1.0000001192092896
Imean its fine when I read it or when I speak people but its difficult for me to do that speaking someone else,0.30142372846603394
and I Im I Im more just silent about doing that,0.3152560293674469
well Ive have two I had two il children,0.26466667652130127
it was youknow I it was a long time long ago since I during the war,0.26141154766082764
and and then I was married then,0.37940987944602966
and then oh I was I guess it was after it was in nineteen sixty five when I was still living with my husband and the children,0.24426917731761932
and I was starting to read I I had something to do to read,0.3100733160972595
and I guess Id we had thingy things were I I was unhappy,0.33045390248298645
and I so I my my two daughters were both going,0.2939663827419281
one was finished college and the other was in the college in Washington college,0.3767678141593933
and so I I think I I I decided that I would live by mslvu,0.38931846618652344
and it that year was pretty year,0.3328525125980377
and I have never regretted,0.41023871302604675
I I have always spread them,0.4745561182498932
Imean Ive had friends friends of men and women,0.2873789072036743
but I I really hadnt wanted to go to get desire again,0.3567757308483124
I havent,0.4879835546016693
I I feel pretty much about that for myself yes,0.3949439227581024
oh its a child thats taking a,0.27729159593582153
and shes crasho,0.353868305683136

and that,0.7311512231826782
this must be,0.5246723890304565
and helped to get it,0.36632102727890015
and,1.0
and then,0.7074459791183472
and what hes,0.31310591101646423
maybe hell jump off,0.453896164894104
he should,0.5618773102760315
feel like Im drowning,0.31796562671661377
I was in Mexico a great deal many many times,0.25812578201293945
looks like I would be down there with him,0.322521448135376
but what theyre doing or what they,0.4434552490711212
and he was holding on this to hold,0.304806113243103
what is she doing,0.4007902145385742
but the money s,0.3650531470775604

of what dear,0.3594788610935211

well she was wanting the group or certainly dealing with with some good and not so good,0.3481062650680542
and she was looking happiness for a man to take her happy forever,0.2852003574371338
and it,0.5415343046188354
other people are not theyre parents because shes doing that thats happening,0.3744634687900543
and then he she is in the end had a very in happy place,0.28213420510292053
the whole thing,0.5682157874107361
jelly sandwich,0.75754714012146

and,1.0
www,1.0000001192092896
surely,0.9999999403953552
speaking to people I think better,0.45542430877685547
many people have told me that,0.38662469387054443
but its still I I dont know why I have sometimes when when Im with a group of when Im with a group of people its very difficult for me because of my,0.2313966453075409
the ear,0.5058884024620056
so then I cant,0.4241180419921875
I tried it,0.5447619557380676
and with five,0.5730650424957275

and I couldnt I pick up,0.28687652945518494
he gave me a a I would it,0.3386843204498291
so I paid for the five hundred dollars instead of three thousand or whatever it was,0.2564040720462799
I gave it up,0.3309643864631653
and so,0.5900565385818481

oh yes,0.7815017700195312
well I went back to school,0.3136462867259979
I was a teacher twenty five years,0.29917505383491516
two in Pennsylvania and twenty three in Baltimore,0.42872169613838196
I went back to school to become a counselor an elementary school counselor,0.28701046109199524
and that day I went to,0.3182280361652374
Tuesdays we have the the team the team,0.3879240155220032
and I have I figured,0.4329490661621094
no,0.9999999403953552
I everything was in order,0.31564846634864807
and everything was in their place,0.40304696559906006
and I went to a meeting Monday as,0.24587999284267426
and I came home and I thought,0.34390178322792053
well I know what was on CreaturesGreatandSmall,0.3134864568710327
so I I had,0.5599359273910522
you press a button and it zooms back,0.3244079351425171
and I recorded it,0.30062204599380493
and so I watched it,0.38276219367980957
and I says,0.32063889503479004
by that time I settled down,0.2787975072860718
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and I I slept,0.39334845542907715
and I got up this morning and I took a shower,0.2605479657649994
and I got partially dressed because I couldnt find my slacks,0.28807932138442993
and so I came down and I turned the,0.3055034875869751
what is it called,0.39310526847839355
I want some spritz in my hair,0.2815866768360138
and so I turned it on and I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee,0.2174280881881714
and when I got the milk out and poured it in when I closed the door I says,0.23566898703575134
and with that,0.6564204692840576
I fell on the floor,0.27852994203567505
and this side,0.49719011783599854
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
and I kept I kept thinking my hand,0.34280598163604736
I flopped it down,0.4337184429168701
and so I was in the kitchen,0.27678820490837097
and by the time,0.4774719476699829
I thought,0.680924117565155
I went out and I thought,0.36120226979255676
and by the time I got to the television I have a halfway to go yet,0.23206064105033875
and FirstnameT was the principal and she came,0.39985400438308716
and in the meantime my telephone rang three four times,0.28005099296569824
and I could not get it,0.3930976986885071
and if I woulda,0.41976627707481384
because I didnt know it might affected my speech,0.3421904444694519
and I was youknow it,0.30029135942459106
anyhow she said,0.3650835454463959
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
and she called the police and the ambulance,0.4292649030685425
and they came back,0.43792420625686646
and he broke the door down,0.31665605306625366
well not the broke it,0.36312079429626465
he like,0.5499230027198792
it sounds like theyre gonna,0.31590381264686584
slit,0.9999998807907104
but on this one he hadta it needed repaired,0.3745945692062378
so and thats,0.4166957437992096
I was in FranklinSquare hospital,0.34627318382263184
and at that time December seventh ninety nineteen ninety three they didnt have anything to do,0.23941098153591156
they they put me in a room and they said,0.2827429175376892
I was hungry the next day and the next day,0.2828925549983978
and they kept saying,0.41437968611717224
and he she anyhow they finally got me to eat,0.292280375957489
but my sister and brother came down,0.3277531862258911
and I I says,0.35976994037628174
I couldnt believe that they came for me,0.3356432616710663
because I didnt think I youknow,0.44529467821121216
well I went to Sinai because they did not have a program for people with strokes,0.27158528566360474
so I went to Sinai,0.2987598180770874
you know where Sinai is,0.32252028584480286
and they have a really good program,0.4097258150577545
and and boy they didnt mess around,0.26429837942123413
and I liked it there,0.391994833946228
and but the speech pathologist was a man,0.33157581090927124
and he said that he is after awhile he said he was going to leave,0.2938075661659241
he and his wife and I think they had two children,0.3090473413467407
he was going to Texas,0.30050304532051086
and he brought me,0.34511470794677734
and he said,0.37295207381248474
and I did that,0.412866473197937
and then I was there I didnt get outof Sinai until I think the fourth of January,0.18111421167850494
well I was there until the twentieth I think,0.30293241143226624
and then I went to Sinai,0.3089616894721985
so and then I had FirstnameJ was my caretaker because I live by myself,0.2883308529853821
and and she was okay very good Imean but she gets tired too youknow of doing the same thing,0.26482224464416504
and and then she while I was in Sinai I got a woman came,0.2516370415687561
and she was you were making sure that anything she was recruiting people with strokes or brain damage because of a car accident,0.26916998624801636
and he,0.5471725463867188
and maybe Im not quite sure whether she told me or my sister FirstnameM,0.2412128448486328
but so the Return program I started in May the beginning of May,0.23643484711647034
and I had FirstnameS,0.3976324796676636
and she only she worked all around the clock,0.3313140273094177
she couldnt take ke a half day,0.21142253279685974
and so I got FirstnameC,0.3808038830757141
and she could work half days,0.3267258405685425
and but I got,0.39439114928245544
and I kept thinking,0.36945387721061707
and anyhow Im wavering,0.23542946577072144
that is not the reason you asked the question,0.41848334670066833
well the FirstnameJ said,0.43497830629348755
and I slept for around the clock,0.26115909218788147
and I got up and the headache was gone,0.25198858976364136
but FirstnameSu is a good friend of mine,0.3093516528606415
and she called the doctor,0.36624810099601746
and the doctor said,0.36860817670822144
and he did,0.3889911472797394
and when I saw it it was the the bleeder,0.29573506116867065
and I he said Doctor FirstnameLastnameD said,0.279962956905365
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I had I Im a well a school teacher,0.2573082745075226
and ten questions were a second grader,0.29486504197120667
and I couldnt answer seven of them,0.2502756118774414
and now when I went back to that I answered three,0.3105940818786621
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
so I kept on going to the Return program,0.23446956276893616
and May June July and the beginning of August FirstnameC was in the hospital,0.36420437693595886
she fell down a flight of steps,0.2519153356552124
and she was pregnant,0.40677911043167114
and she was so upset youknow,0.28162384033203125
and I said,0.32917967438697815
because they hafta call somebody to youknow take care of me,0.23802043497562408
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and when I was sitting there I thought,0.38181072473526
I couldnt get up,0.3617765009403229
I couldnt get up,0.3617765009403229
and I called FirstnameR the next door neighbor,0.2792114019393921
she came over,0.41538605093955994
and she says,0.37827277183532715
she pulled me up,0.3896472454071045
and she says,0.37827277183532715
youknow she didnt,0.36596977710723877
ke call FirstnameSu,0.47612252831459045
and I called her and I was back in the hospital,0.27850088477134705
and because when I had the stroke they gave me Ecotrin three times a day,0.278244286775589
when I had that c my second stroke they said,0.2693523168563843
and I thought,0.4620973765850067
and I say that to myself but they decided that it would be good to a Coumadin,0.36363279819488525
and I got very depressed when at,0.2990444004535675
I was not depressed the first stroke,0.33690157532691956
it hit me the third stroke,0.2772940695285797
I thought,0.680924117565155
youknow I never know whats gonna happen,0.3490755558013916
and I just really depressed,0.4914371371269226
sothat they got to take Zoloft,0.3607344329357147
and I took it and I thought,0.336367130279541
and so when I left the hospital I I ate my cereal every morning and I had diarrhea every day,0.26677897572517395
and after I thought,0.40165674686431885
and he said,0.37295207381248474
so I got to take Crestor,0.28037822246551514
no Crestor is that,0.3338800370693207
Effexor,1.0
and Ive been on that ever since because Ive tried to take it off,0.2744271755218506
and you hafta do it by half a month and then,0.20780034363269806
and by the time I get finished everything bothers me I get really upset,0.2931031286716461
and I started to cry,0.28036195039749146
and youknow I think its better to be on the Effexor,0.2481696605682373
well one of the things Ive never been outof the Pittsburgh,0.2421613335609436
Ive been to Pittsburgh at that time when I was about fourteen,0.24790692329406738
I went to Pittsburgh once,0.30630457401275635
my mother and sister FirstnameK the older one,0.3776002526283264
and but it when I was about fourteen in the summer,0.30339425802230835
FirstnameMi is my good friend in high school and and her aunt were going to NewYork because of their aunt,0.2191484421491623
there is a problem with her,0.35352450609207153
and I think that shes becoming senile or whatever but somebody hasta see what youknow is going on,0.2507403790950775
and so I kept asking my mother and asking her,0.3376998007297516
and she kept saying,0.36517655849456787
and I says,0.32063889503479004
and youknow she decided,0.3057776093482971
so we went to NewYork,0.30486175417900085
and Ive forgotten the name of the town,0.26518532633781433
it starts with a gl,0.3062456250190735
a little town,0.486907422542572
and and anyhow we went to see her,0.24747847020626068
and one of the things that happened,0.4401733875274658
oh the she was upset with FirstnameMi and I,0.2294462025165558
we both had periods,0.3954729437828064
and our the aunt told us youknow how roll it up and all that,0.23467671871185303
and we rolled it up and we went off to ConeyIsland,0.28186550736427307
and we got back everything would be fine,0.3350781500339508
and the aunt was mad,0.26656001806259155
mad as heck,0.33012834191322327
what happened was he,0.4537772536277771
and the dog knew,0.3150836229324341
and he,0.5471725463867188
it was all over the house,0.356242299079895
and she cleaned it up instead of waiting until we cleaned it up,0.29246601462364197
and she was upset,0.351048082113266
and I rightly so,0.43262115120887756
but we didnt know that the dog would do that,0.3727373480796814
but and then at the the thing that,0.45406749844551086
we went to not a Broadway play but RadioCityHall,0.2569611370563507
and we saw EricMarie,0.3323621451854706
starts with an rl,0.30801907181739807
is it could you spell that,0.4273110032081604
no,0.9999999403953552
its long longer,0.5787131190299988
but he wrote the book and they made it into a play movie,0.25080108642578125
and we got to see that,0.34897738695144653
and it was and then I love to travel on trains,0.28689470887184143
and we went to that way and then we come back,0.385861873626709
and that was the most exciting thing,0.43536657094955444
Im sorry the last one is,0.21966424584388733
no I I just wanted it you repeat the last one,0.37739449739456177
and no,0.5103980302810669
the little boy or no middle ten years old,0.22764310240745544
and kicking the ball,0.49090859293937683
and he thinks,0.40664970874786377
and,1.0
and I Im not quite sure,0.3195949196815491
the mother tells him,0.41910281777381897
and he looks and he goes,0.3316904306411743
and its raining,0.6148419976234436
well the,0.6731295585632324
and apparently,0.729010283946991
and,1.0
and and then I guess somebody called the,0.3416323661804199
maybe his wife or whatever called the fire trucks sothat,0.230754092335701
because I think the little dog,0.42088720202445984
well out west they have a storms,0.32616081833839417
and I think in Texas a couple months ago,0.2065022587776184
and and the little girl was on the shore,0.35550543665885925
and no more,0.46282604336738586
it swept in and he,0.288031667470932
and the rescuers came,0.4355238676071167
and and he she,0.5348035097122192
oh yeah,0.8460387587547302
the names I cant remember,0.27311405539512634
well Cinderella is working for them,0.3181682825088501
and them is I think the mother and the two little girls at the beginning,0.3088468909263611
and then they grow up and shes still working Cinderella,0.28830334544181824
and so there is,0.40994828939437866
Cinderella is all the animals sortof alike,0.29555895924568176
and except the one that,0.5377811193466187
she has it in her hand hand at,0.2975160777568817
I dont know what kind of animal it is,0.30706191062927246
but that but only the one that is growling youknow,0.4207724332809448
but otherwise and then they look she he,0.4553857445716858
no here I go again,0.418306440114975

well I I actually had a aortic dissection,0.33223381638526917
and I I had four surgeries,0.31196051836013794
because I dissected actually twice in that period of time,0.3609152138233185
but the last surgery I had when I woke I couldnt move,0.28958770632743835
and so they there was a time in that surgery that when they took me off the bypass machine,0.2903262674808502
so there was time when I I wasnt breathing,0.3428385257720947
so they think it that thats when it happened,0.49535658955574036
so thats what I mean youknow,0.39950883388519287
so thats what it,0.5014267563819885
it was actually a side dku,0.43243393301963806
well they think it was because of lack of oxygen to the brain,0.31539222598075867
and I couldnt I was like,0.3101980984210968
youknow that I couldnt get,0.3605474531650543
well I remember sometime in the icu that that happening,0.37535881996154785
and I I I du,0.39497002959251404
and and I think there was a friend there going youknow,0.3075467646121979
anyway so I remember that,0.5672378540039062
I was in the hospital for,0.3062902092933655
I remembered towards the end of icu,0.26894789934158325
Im sorry Im just trying to think here,0.34658077359199524
so it was eight days I was in there with the,0.27152180671691895
and then after that I I probably didnt start remembering until the the third around the third week,0.2949593663215637
towards the end of icu I started youknow understanding what was what what had going on what was going on,0.24254772067070007
well when I came out my physical therapy I I went to rehab for one,0.25484365224838257
and at my my I was physical the physical part of this it was pretty easy to come back,0.23929622769355774
within a week I was really okay youknow,0.24876242876052856
they they didnt think I needed any more physical therapy,0.37659212946891785
but my speech was a different r story,0.2541034519672394

and it was so so I was pretty severe,0.3486417531967163
and then I did,0.4106629490852356
and just determined to get back,0.40994128584861755
so I was doing alot on my own too,0.2744663953781128
and and then I stopped,0.4244529604911804
and then I went back again like in three months later,0.31127235293388367
I went back again for like three more months,0.29671916365623474
because I decided I wanted to try to see if I could do some work,0.41002559661865234
and so I went back to try to get myself organized and do that type of thing,0.2776276469230652
and the biggest thing I did was to go back,0.2625269293785095
someone gave me an opportunity to do a little bit of work with them,0.25788360834121704
and it got me back,0.3499802350997925
because I was in sales,0.31265777349472046
and it allowed me to get back out,0.34579920768737793

and then I saw another receipt because I got ordered like seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books,0.25247517228126526
and I remember looking at it going,0.3347184658050537
and then I just was like,0.38783037662506104
and in addition to that I was going to school,0.32517337799072266
so youknow all together,0.4323454201221466
well at school I was Id been in digital arts classes,0.2130117565393448
so I was in a Flash class where making movement,0.24254220724105835
and it was the same kind of thing where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things,0.30692559480667114
but our final project,0.3812217116355896
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing that wed done right before that it took I put it in like seven or eight different programs,0.24504192173480988
so now I look back,0.47182685136795044
so to,0.6440495252609253
mhm,0.0
and then the day that I went into the hospital it was the first part of January,0.2941795885562897
and I was at work,0.2893901467323303
and and things had been being weird,0.3706854581832886
and a girl was there,0.33763444423675537
and its like I was like I was,0.29137229919433594
Im like,0.3608457148075104
my mom picks me up,0.38571426272392273
well actually drive,0.5789306163787842
and I took a rest during that time,0.32711389660835266
but I found out later that I wasnt even speaking well,0.3006967604160309
that then I go to the emergency room,0.3438440263271332
it took them eight or nine hours to see me,0.2418813705444336
yeah,1.0
and I didnt know that until later that,0.31108447909355164
they were just like,0.5325095057487488
because they were nice,0.45184850692749023
I remember that part,0.46969732642173767
and then I did get unconscious,0.3641413748264313
my mom tells me that they put me,0.35398584604263306
and so I I still dont have I dont even go like,0.3748611807823181
nothing like that,0.6802881956100464
and the way they discovered I had encephalitis and this unusual one herpes encephalitis,0.3099241852760315
the neurologist was saying,0.4060696065425873
and,1.0
so they gave me the medicine right away instead of waiting for the test results three or four days later,0.25201064348220825
and thats when I see its kindof,0.2955532371997833
thats what even the neurologist has said,0.31306883692741394
so thats my story,0.34618282318115234
so they say,0.5951632857322693
mhm,0.0
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year,0.254434734582901
and youknow it was tough to figure out how to walk,0.25872600078582764
its not that it was where I couldnt walk,0.30278876423835754
its that I couldnt,0.3514450788497925
I couldnt both ke if there was a radio or a tv on I couldnt pay attention to what you,0.20950765907764435
I couldnt figure out how to cook,0.3057461977005005
youknow things like that are still complicate,0.42778077721595764
no theyre complex but theyre not as complicated,0.36988136172294617
Ive just learned how to,0.39240017533302307
and,1.0
you mean ke ke learning words again,0.3173765540122986
well I definitely,0.5618582963943481
I wrote alot,0.342930406332016
Imean I wrote pages and pages and pages,0.30303168296813965
just in general I wrote a letter to PimaCollege because of something that had happened the semester before,0.2918287217617035
and I took three or four months to write it,0.2218412160873413
I didnt want anyone to help me,0.4034332036972046
so and that was cool that Im Im,0.2555764317512512
youknow I look back Im ke really glad I was the person that I was to not give up,0.24116334319114685
and so I also went to exercise,0.3165236711502075
mom took me to her exercise class,0.2647624611854553
and they knew my mom well so I didnt feel uncomfortable not being able to do much,0.3100695312023163
little things like that,0.6350008845329285
I did lots of little things,0.3414763808250427
okay now like what,0.5447309017181396
oh okay,0.6638365983963013
Im like,0.3608457148075104
yeah Ill tell you a recent one because that might be alittle more difficult,0.31226038932800293
I can tell you the past because Ive told alotof stories from the past,0.24318988621234894
so so Im doing it deliberately for the current,0.304886132478714
and its sad,0.34648528695106506
my grandson just passed away a week ago,0.2476477473974228
hes twenty,0.33610448241233826
and he passed away from cancer,0.31800544261932373
and he was sick for a year and a half,0.26993808150291443
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer,0.3197896480560303
so he was sick before,0.3857203722000122
now lets see how I can,0.3756345212459564
I shouldnt try to think,0.4200512766838074
okay,0.9999999403953552
so what happened is when he graduated from highschool he lived outside of Tucson close to Phoenix,0.21263012290000916
and and so he was going to join the Marines,0.29160159826278687
but I said,0.47881877422332764
because it had been tough in his family life,0.3357605040073395
so I found a way to get him to move in with me,0.2757880389690399
we didnt have alotof money to make it happen,0.31867605447769165
so I found a way to get him here,0.3385104238986969
and after hed been here a few months kept saying,0.2352071851491928
they finally found out what it was,0.3821384310722351
so it was just a tough approach,0.40176141262054443
and so they his parents finally moved him back in,0.3596501052379608
and its just been a tough path,0.3346270024776459
Ive learned how not to talk much,0.34093689918518066
so I havent been able to participate in us in language at all just in touchyfeely stuff,0.23365801572799683
but Ive stayed up there when he was in the hospital,0.2699010372161865
well a week before he passed away my man and I went up there for a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool,0.22240807116031647
we got to spend time there,0.38513314723968506
and then the following,0.6105355024337769
and we went up there for a day,0.27011582255363464
we were right there when he passed along with other people and stuff,0.33157971501350403
so it was it was very sad,0.41580089926719666
and it was a good process too in the final moments,0.29864633083343506
thats my story,0.3472673296928406
oh yeah,0.8460387587547302
okay these things are pretty easy for me,0.3375372886657715

and she was able to because a fairy came along and helped her get dressed and get there,0.2724025547504425
so then she gets there whispers,0.4289848804473877
and then something happens at midnight,0.36944058537483215
so she cant get home because what she rode in becomes a pumpkin again,0.2058589607477188
and and she loses a shoe,0.28965696692466736
and then once shes home like the next day the the prince comes with the shoe,0.29131728410720825
hes looking for the person it fits,0.2794893980026245
and its not her stepsisters or her fake sisters whatever theyre called,0.27556470036506653

okay,0.9999999403953552
well my wife says sometimes when I get alittle upset I talk too loud,0.30362603068351746
but,1.0000001192092896
so youknow,0.6186281442642212
yes it was in March of two thousand and seven I guess three years ago,0.1963600367307663
I was at the breakfast table,0.28476303815841675
and,1.0
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I called my wife,0.25973331928253174
and she said,0.38078364729881287
so they immediately took me to the RestinGeneral Hospital enrolled me and and,0.269070029258728
Im thinking about the tia,0.2457200139760971
I went in to have hip joint replacement surgery,0.24347065389156342
and I was a healthy,0.3092299997806549
I just had,0.5599087476730347
so I went to have that replaced,0.3212643563747406
and the following the surgery went fine,0.3704994320869446
following morning they got me up for the first time to to walk,0.287218302488327
and when I got up I collapsed suddenly,0.33462268114089966
and they did the usual mris and the cat,0.3614841103553772
and they would ask me the battery of questions,0.2965303957462311
and I had difficulties knowing when I was born what year I was born etcetera,0.22458912432193756
I had,0.5869733095169067
never did,0.6721055507659912
smack by the time I,0.2317010760307312
I could listen to the news and understand what I was hearing,0.31221848726272583
but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do,0.3041268587112427
so I tried to cope with it by asking my wife,0.23417073488235474
and I started trying to work one line at a time in in one column,0.26549744606018066
that was difficult,0.5243542194366455
but when I felt I could repeat that and say it then I would try to get,0.3762257695198059
and it was difficult,0.41242167353630066
but,1.0000001192092896
and after several days I got to where I could maybe read and comprehend a short paragraph,0.2482725828886032
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was,0.23696310818195343
and I said,0.32917967438697815
so I got downstairs sat down at my computer and I hadta call my wife,0.2362576127052307
she showed me,0.4122180640697479
and it came up,0.32314637303352356
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and I got something in front of me,0.24004501104354858
I said,0.5259465575218201
and said,0.5136677026748657
but it took me awhile to get that,0.3574053645133972
and I had jumbled,0.32958462834358215
and I even saved it because it was very jumbled,0.34447330236434937
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after it was very jumbled,0.27269428968429565
and so thats when I heard about the StrokeComebackCenter from the traveling nurse that came by to attend me,0.24729470908641815
and she said,0.38078364729881287
and I said,0.32917967438697815
and so I I came here and was starting on a once a week schedule,0.25793176889419556
and I felt it was a very good experience because I started making progress,0.32968711853027344
and what I l Ive always said about with FirstnameM and the center as a general is they seem to have a very good way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge but not over not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it,0.26190420985221863
so if it was,0.4595448970794678
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and,0.316006600856781
and this sorta,0.43850502371788025
so it was a,0.4301050305366516
and then she she said FirstnameM said,0.38509100675582886
so I I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students,0.2130255103111267
and after,0.662024736404419
I decided I would start to write a maybe a little journal of my experiences from the day as I recalled it from the day I had my first stroke and and to the recovery period,0.23855216801166534
and I ended up doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester,0.25474438071250916
and I ended up labelling it as Firstnames aphasia journal,0.2203998863697052
and I would write a a little section each week,0.2863498628139496
and then she would kindof react respond back to me,0.340714693069458
but I would I would build on it and finally ended that up,0.3313843309879303
and she turned it in as her as her theme her project for the for the me for the semester,0.28950339555740356
and hadta give a presentation on on this interaction,0.3848811984062195
so all that all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this,0.39379286766052246
but I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again,0.22961442172527313
and thats when xxx sent me in and dgmostu,0.23789195716381073
but they went ahead and sent me to JohnHopkins StrokeRehabilitationCenter,0.30492642521858215
and I became a patient there subject and worked with them,0.31951722502708435
and they diagnosed that I had had a previously undisclosed flap on my heart,0.2737807035446167
but that is probably why I caught the clot,0.35735076665878296
and xxx,0.43780288100242615
but thats yeah I participated in that,0.2906937599182129
and part of my therapy building along was after going through writing my weekly Firstnames journal I met with a couple of retired army officers who contacted me that said they were the US DepartmentofAgriculture was wanting to write a a history of nutrition research that had been performed by the military after the DepartmentofAgriculture became involved,0.23472005128860474
and they said,0.4319881200790405
I said,0.5259465575218201
and he said,0.37295207381248474
and so I started another project to still working on it writing a history of nutrition research performed by the military from the seventeen thirties to the present day,0.2969534993171692
youknow and I I I and Im youknow Im still working at that,0.2597913146018982
and I continue to come here to the Center once or twice a a week and because I have a buddy,0.2506332993507385
name is FirstnameK,0.5883551836013794
and she was had had a stroke not too long before I did,0.2970982491970062
and we were here in the first class together,0.3640088737010956
and shes shes about forty I think,0.27273228764533997
but we kindof were buddies,0.3935428559780121
so it,0.7884126305580139
I would think its,0.3844342827796936
okay,0.9999999403953552
surely,0.9999999403953552
I will use one that I actually used in my penpal stories,0.2669917047023773
one of the things that came was I I was a farm boy growing up in Missouri,0.2234838902950287
and I had a grandmother which I thought very much of,0.3082630932331085
and she had was a single lady by this time,0.27116501331329346
her husband had passed away,0.4139525890350342
my grandfather passed away,0.3762625753879547
but I was out getting starting in college or no,0.26917263865470886
and dad decided that I should maybe buy a or Id decided I wanted to buy a a Hereford heifer to start a a,0.2421160638332367
I had my Fourh FFA activities,0.2601091265678406
I told my grandma about it,0.36809441447257996
and she said,0.38078364729881287
to keep the weeds down out on her place,0.3182448446750641
so I went together and dad and I,0.31947964429855347
and we purchased two heifers Susie and Stella,0.21289405226707458
well I took Susie,0.2392415702342987
and we stayed on at my dads place,0.23091569542884827
and Stella was at my my my grandmas place,0.24881163239479065
the but on one occasion we brought them back home in the winter time,0.340624064207077
we bring them all back to the to the to the barn to where the youknow to get them off the pastures were already gone up and to give them hay,0.3117162585258484
well I was going out one day down to bring try to get the cattle to come up including Susie and Stella to get them up to the barn,0.2287481129169464
and they were running around,0.4820983409881592
and I got aggravated xxx I decided Id throw a rock at one of them to get them to go back,0.2113887071609497
well I ended up,0.31098830699920654
and I picked up this boulder and gave it a heave,0.24737729132175446
unfortunately it ran headlong,0.397480309009552
knocked the thing flat on its,0.31160229444503784
so I was scared as the dickens,0.279541552066803
I ran up to dad,0.26810121536254883
dad came down the barn immediately and got his old dull pocket knife out,0.20896032452583313
thought maybe hed be able to figured it was probably dying but atleast wanted to preserve the meat to let it bleed it out,0.3007297217845917
well the,0.6731295585632324
Stella blared and belted,0.27236703038215637
and so it wasnt dead it was just knocked out,0.2852519750595093
so that taught me a lesson not to be throwing rocks and,0.290136456489563
Stella became fine xxx,0.25120794773101807
but that I used that as part of a short story about a little writing a,0.3317132294178009
well this young boy is playing soccer,0.29977554082870483
and hes just kicked the ball up in the air and uhoh,0.2105327993631363
it just hit the window in the house and I guess broke in the window,0.26692909002304077
it not only went th,0.3288278579711914
and then dad is picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window and figured out trying to find out where did that come from,0.2533842623233795
sure,0.9999998807907104
well the sighs,0.3795812129974365
lets see,0.5765541791915894
the young boy is with a mother,0.33271777629852295
mothers got an umbrella,0.2716462016105652
hes seemingly reaching for the umbrella,0.2760786712169647
the next panel looks like mothers trying to encourage the boy to take the umbrella and go outside,0.27798619866371155
but the boy apparently decided to go outside without the umbrella,0.3244950473308563
and now its raining,0.45428189635276794
and now its starting to pour down rain,0.28446099162101746
and hes running back to the house,0.31621766090393066
and now his his heads all wet,0.31028854846954346
and his mother looks sortof upset,0.31354567408561707
and he goes back outside but now hes using the hes wearing the umbrella,0.2500717341899872
well I think we had a problem where occurred where a cat decided to crawl up into the tree and go out on small limb on the outside,0.23398254811763763
it looks like the yeah young girl got upset and had called her dad probably to maybe try to get the cat down,0.22751016914844513
shed been,0.5973087549209595
dad had apparently gotten a ladder and had started up the tree and got up there but for some reason it looks like the ladder has fallen down,0.25622713565826416
the dog is now upset and barking,0.2704423666000366
dads stuck in the tree,0.2539216876029968
and the cats still there,0.4384519159793854
well there seems to be a bird chirping for one unknown reason but enough that somebody decided to call the fire department,0.29169702529907227
and the fire department with two men are carrying a ladder apparently there to try to rescue to get the man down and possibly get the cat outof the tree,0.25501441955566406
think that found all of the characters that were in the,0.40861353278160095
okay,0.9999999403953552
look through it,0.49158942699432373
www,1.0000001192092896
okay,0.9999999403953552
story is about Cinderella who was a younger sister of with two older sisters I believe,0.24591460824012756
and she seemed to be the prettier of the three,0.28560441732406616
and her mother was a little bit of a domineering lady,0.29862937331199646
and they were all excited becau,0.4602667987346649
well the the older sisters were getting themselves well dressed and,0.40604108572006226
well at first it was sure whether younger sister Cinderella was gonna get to go to her nu,0.17941275238990784
but there were some animals around,0.4982143044471741
and,1.0
but anyhow they all finally got dressed mother and the three daughters,0.30182307958602905
and they went to,0.42907682061195374
and there was a handsome prince probably with the the son of the whoever was a main character or the,0.3247736096382141
and there was a number,0.3934355676174164
and apparently Cinderella may have got to dance with one of the young men,0.27857595682144165
but somewhere in the process she lost a slipper,0.29739534854888916
after the ball when theyd all gotten home I think she must have noticed that she was missing her slipper,0.27327319979667664
and much to her surprise PrinceCharming came riding up to the house in his carriage and was looking for who does the slipper belong to which one of the ladies,0.26497742533683777
and probably they must have tried it on,0.38770073652267456
and the two older sisters their slipper was too small to fit on the feet of them,0.24977095425128937
so he then PrinceCharming tried it on Cinderella,0.3197922706604004
and it ips the shoe fit perfectly on the slipper s,0.25158876180648804
and so Cinderella then got to go back with PrinceCharming and go back to another ball or something,0.29366961121559143
that seems to be what,0.47169676423072815
theres animals in this watching the process but I dont know how they were exactly were involved in the story,0.2682056725025177
but thats what I remember I think of that story,0.38034409284591675

I would get out a plate,0.3308623433113098
put my bread on the plate,0.3059431314468384
and I would go to the get a knife outof the drawer,0.2319336235523224

then I would use the knife to spread the jelly on the bread,0.2934035360813141
and I would close put the other piece of bread on the join it with the others,0.28667721152305603
