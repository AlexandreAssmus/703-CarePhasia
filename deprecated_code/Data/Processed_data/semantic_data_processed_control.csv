why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal,-0.2,negative
wasting my time,0.0,neutral
I just wanna get home,0.0,neutral

just practice,0.0,neutral
practice this practice that,0.0,neutral
well in those times we we had a a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at three hundred and forty knots air speed,0.0,neutral
when directly over the air when we were directly over the end of the runway wed cut our power back,0.06666666666666667,positive
and that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees,0.0,neutral
after that the airplane is slow enough sothat we would we would have not have touched the throttle,-0.15000000000000002,negative
in other words it cut power completely,0.1,positive

well what did I do,0.0,neutral
I gave it full power which did not catch in time,0.35,positive
I pulled in the the landing gear,0.0,neutral
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone,0.0,neutral

what happened then is that I brought the airplane down,0.0,neutral
I overshot the runway,0.0,neutral
but I wouldnt I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side,0.0,neutral
and the Fl eighty four Fl has a a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left,-0.0072916666666666685,negative
you cant predict it but it will do that,0.0,neutral

it yawed,0.0,neutral
and as I say I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on,0.4,positive
well eventually it did it did come to rest,0.0,neutral
it had the it had yawed to the right sothat at full power the engine was or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in a which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people dont land wheels up,0.30892857142857144,positive
well they about panicked,0.0,neutral
well at which I followed the proper procedures,0.0,neutral
I cut all power turned everything off,0.0,neutral

Im happy to report that the airplane flew again,0.8,positive
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground,0.0,neutral
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels,0.0,neutral
and it it did fly again,0.8,positive
so did I ofcourse,0.0,neutral

one of my buddies was in back of me also alone,0.0,neutral
and hes he was his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating,0.0,neutral
