I was with initially five other people
two of them dropped out partway through the trip
be cause they they didn't consider it safe
but it was it was a fascinating trip to see
and we paddled in one case past two days of forest
and the smoke we hadta put cloths over our mouths to to
the the paddling itself was not particularly onerous
but we did paddle a lot
we paddled nine or ten hours a day
we we averaged about seventy two kilometers a day on on
covered almost fourteen hundred kilometers on the whole
and it surprisingly enough although we were on a
you can't see a half inch into the water
so we hadta find side streams that were clear in order to get

typical day I I get up fairly early in the morning about
I either go into the office to to work there
or I work from home by dialing in on my on my computer
I work on designing a database or solving problems around

excellent
when I was three years old
I have a very vivid memory of being left with my sister and having
and it was the summer of nineteen forty six
and my sister and I was I were playing
and this young gal wanted me to go to have a nap in the
and I was protesting
and I was so upset
I went into the bedroom waited a few minutes and snuck out of the
I did
well you know you're Winnipeg was a smaller city
and it was different in nineteen forty six
and I knew the way
I being in the car the kids they pick it up fast
so yes you asked for memory
there it is
okay yesterday I was at home in the morning
be cause we were entertaining some people that were coming over
we had some some of some of my children came
and with a couple of my grandchildren were two or
and then we had some guests that useta live in Winnipeg
so that was for part of the day til about two o'clock
I then walked my grandson of two and a half years of age from
I fear it was a good quite a walk for him
and he did it all
and then I stayed a little at my sister's and my daughter's
and then from there I visited my one of my sons
and then we came home
and I basically I watched the
I took my wife to to zumba class at Baycrest village
and then we watched the Gray I watched the Graycomb
that was my day
yeah
in these pictures exc
well the first one is this kid kicks the ball
and it looks like it breaks a window goes through the window
and then the man that's sitting there picks up the ball and is
one seems to have an umbrella
and she's looking to give it to her daughter
who the daughter takes it
unless she takes it
we can't tell that
starts to rain
doesn't look like the daughter takes it actually
well so up in paragraph three it's raining
kid's getting wet very wet
kid comes home looks like all wet
mother's not happy
and then the kid takes the umbrella the the umbrella
well there's a man stuck in a tree
and the dog is barking
and the girl's trying to get the cat off the tree
and she's got a little tricycle there
and there's a ladder
but now on come the fireman I guess to help him
what do you want me to tell you exc
Cinderella a young girl who lived with an a
and she did all the work around the house
she was treated very badly
and life was pretty harsh for her
so one day an invitation comes sent by the royalty that there's
and of course the prince is gonna be there
and and the the two sisters and the mother are very excited
and they plan out how they're what they're gonna wear and
Cinderella wants to go but they make fun of her you see
they say
what if she can't go to this
you're just a nothing
so they ultimately get all dressed up and go to the ball one
and Cinderella's left behind
and then along out of the blue comes this fairy godmother who
and she basically turns all her rags into wonderful clothes
and he
and her both horses suddenly emerge
and she's whisked away to the ball
and she's given a warning that she that before she sets
she says you know the fairy godmother tells her
you hafta be home by midnight or everything's gonna turn back to
lo and behold she goes to the ball
princess
but nothing woulda struck his fancy
but then he sees Cinderella
and after that it's happiness for all of them
they're just having a great time
then she suddenly realizes it's close to midnight
and she rushes down the stairs leaves a slipper behind
and she gets into the chariot and heads home
but she's lost her shoe
and she's back to where she was
and xxx comes
there she is working away still
and then there's an announcement that the prince is trying to
and he still has the shoe
and he wants looks to wants to find the match
anyways he goes around from home to home in all the kingdom
and of course it doesn't work
they ask if anybody else is there
and sure enough the they they they pretend she's not
but ultimately she she gets a crack at it and tries it on
and it's a perfect fit
and well he she ends up happily with the prince
there it is
my granddaughter of five could probably do it better exc
sure

sounds like a ten minute interview
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk
it was important to me to get into law school
that was something that happened that was very important
I have no idea why I was accepted because I don't think I met any
thirty two
I was thirty two when I started
so I guess I was thirty one when I applied
and in my year the median age was twenty two
so I was one of the oldest in the class had nothing in common
I mean they still remembered high school
who thought about high school
and they all knew each other from high school
and they were there because they didn't get into medical school or
and I was just flummoxed
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came
they were just there because
well I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the
and I was there be cause I just really cared
and so I really didn't fit in really
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real
up until then I was friendly with people but I didn't understand
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what
they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious
why would anybody say the obvious
so people said the obvious
and they were rewarded
so those were the people sought after to be in the study groups
not me
so I did almost everything alone for the entire year
and when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she
so I said
thanks but no thanks
don't bother
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didn't
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it
so that was me
so I was part of that group for some classes
at the end of the year in the subway station I met someone who
but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy
and she was in the other group
so I never saw her
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I
and that was good
once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the
and he said
please when you write your exams don't think that your mark is
and I thought
wow it is so amazing to hear something like that
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged
it was in law school that I learned that competent q was a
oh he's a competent lawyer
and that the positive term was bright q
if you weren't bright you were nobody
so because he wasn't bright the students didn't respect him
and I made the mistake of saying to someone
you know yeah okay but he's decent
he's a decent person
he has a heart
and she said
a heart
I didn't come to Oz where this one doesn't have a brain and this
I came to law school
didn't talk to her again
U of T
U of T was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada
I don't know why
and I also didn't understand that law schools had their own kind of
""
but I didn't I didn't know that
I didn't even get it un til after I left
so really it wasn't the right school for me
I really should have gone to York
but when I came to Toronto people were saying
oh U of T
it's the best school
and why would you wanna be way out at York
you're in Toronto
you wanna be downtown
so I thought
okay I wanna be downtown
so I was downtown
boy kicks the ball
flies into a glass window breaks the window and falls into the
it knocks over the lamp
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see
it looks like he's got his gun in the pocket
okay the mother tells the child to take an umbrella exc
and the child doesn't want one exc
oh the but in this in the second one the
well oh oh oh oh oh I see exc
so the mother offers the child the umbrella
the child refuses
the child says
goodbye
goes outside
it's raining
it's really raining
and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother who's not
well what's happening is that firefighters are rushing
but it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat
and then he got stuck
and then the firemen are coming to save the man
maybe the cat was chasing the bird
no I think the dog was chasing the cat
am I allowed to make it a xxx exc
the bane of feminists everywhere Cinderella's story about a
and I don't think we find out how she got to that situation but
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a
she always she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking
and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes
and she wasn't given the best food to eat
and anyway she was just treated horribly
one day the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an
Cinderella thinking she's a member of the family thinks she can
but she can't
so she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get
and then they go
after they leave she's very disappointed because she really wanted
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her
so she gives her a beautiful dress to wear lovely new shoes and
and the only rule is be back by twelve
so Cinderella went to the ball
she had a wonderful time
nobody knew who she was
everybody was saying
oh who's that woman
who's that woman
the prince danced with her the whole evening
she had a lovely time
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta
so she ran out
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper
following that the prince found the missing slipper
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper
so he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's
it didn't fit anybody
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly
and he tried it on their feet
it didn't fit any of them
and he saw Cinderella and said
why don't you try it
or possibly she said
why don't I try it
and he tried it on
and it fit
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after
and she of of course being swept off her feet agreed
that she'd just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and
but the book doesn't take you that far
it only takes you to the part where they meet and they fall in
of course

so but it was still interesting
not too many people know where Boulevard is
these days I'm the cleaner of the house and washer of the

and he accidentally we will assume kicks it through the
and man inside the
and knocks over a lamp breaking the window and and probably

and I guess he's going to get prepared to yell at the kid
kid goes off to school

the little girl's pet cat managed to get up a tree and now can't
but I've had plenty of cats come down from trees exc
I don't know what that's all about exc
the cat mighta been after a bird singing in the tree
so a guy tried to help by climbing up the tree
the dog's barking at the guy
and someone had the presence of mind to call the fire department
so somebody musta called the police
you know less than half of all fire calls are not for fires but
it's a xxx exc
well bearin g in mind that what I know is only the the
and not the xxx
yeah
so is is it better for me to just say what I think it is
I guess that's the one exc
yeah that's the one with the three sisters and a problematic
and the sisters two of the sisters were all vain and uppity
you know the one that made Cinderella do all the work in the house
and they got invited to a ball fancy ball
and so they spent a bunch of money gettin g ready for the ball
and they went and left her behind
but I don't remember how she got how she got the magic
who gave her the magic stuff exc
yeah xxx exc
www
xxx
xxx
xxx invitation
oh the invitation's for them
right exc
okay exc
I don't remember any of this exc
how she got her dress exc
I imagine young girls would remember all of that part of
so she somehow got her hands on a dress and ended up in the
and had she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight
so she wowed v everybody at the party and made her sisters
in fact I think they didn't even recognize who she was
and then when the clock started ringing she ran away even though
oh xxx
and she ran away and left behind the slipper be cause it fell off
a glass slipper xxx it was
and leaped into her carriage
and just as she got home it turned back into a pumpkin
and so the prince tried desperately to find the girl that he he
the the shoe was unusually small by the way
find me the person whose foot fits this
and so he had his lackeys go all over the kingdom fitting it on
and they finally found her
and he ends up marrying her
I can't remember what happens with the stepmother and the two girls
I think she doesn't treat them badly
I think she treats them shockingly well
and she lives happily ever after
does that sound
oh right exc
okay exc

it was still on
shockproof by the way
it said eight twenty
and the clock on the wall said five to nine
so I assumed something had happened
yes something had happened
I had two broken legs
and I was in the hospital emergency
I remained there for three and a half months and was able to
and walking down the hall I lost my balance on my crutches
and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again
and then they took me back to bed with a wheelchair
and I got into bed
and the nurse came in
and I said
am I going to the operating room
and she said
yes
and I went to the operating room was put in a body cast from under
and I had to remain in that for another eight weeks
and I finally got out of bed and learned to walk again of course
be cause you can't walk when you're in bed for that long
I came out of the hospital
my accident was October twelfth
came outta the hospital March twenty ninth
and that night I went to university to write a test
so and then I hafta really learn to walk be cause I was
and I learned to walk
and now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami Beach all
and while in the hospital they would bring ambulatory patients to
disregarding that except for going for x rays I was in this room at
but I took the approach that there's nothing when you
move on
and make the best of the situation
so the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy
yeah
well you know there's nothing
I'm not not to say
I I walk around
I have pain in my leg
but that's not gonna it's gonna be there

well one of the big one of the very important things
that was very positive experience
and I was a teenager at the time
and it was a significant change
it was quite a drastic change
and but it was interesting in the sense that it was
it was just a big a big change and a big transition
and it was you know with all these expectations and and
learning you know getting used to a whole new culture
not language because I spoke English where I came from
""
and but just getting used to whole new culture and
you know we spoke differently from how we
and and so just getting used to everyone and the culture
it wasn't well one of the one of the things
we drive on the we drove on the left in the other in
it's former British Guyana
and you know just getting used to consumerism
that was one of the big shock you know
we didn't we didn't spend money there like we we did here
my parents certainly didn't spend money and buy clothing and
""
and there was just money that was money that's so
right
it is just a dispensable commodity
and I guess it's just like everything else today
especially in the last fifteen twenty years you know
it's like everything has become dispensable
you know it's like you buy a shirt
you wear it a few times
and then you can go get another one because it's so inexpensive now
""
and but there's a premium on education
and that's where I invested my time
and I spent many years in education while while working
I just did it because I felt I could do it
and it was immensely challenging
but I struggled through it
and I was very successful
a typical day a workday
I'll describe a typical workday
I'm up at five a m
I'm just I just got useta getting up really early
and I would have a cup of coffee
and I would brush my teeth and shave and shower
and then I would put on my sweatpants and t shirt
and if it's the wintertime I'd get on my jacket and winter
and I would go around the block for a walk a couple two
especially when it's colder you kind of
and so by the time I'm I've done I would go out go out
by then I'm sweating
so that gives gives my my it revs up my whole
and that's that's great because it just jumpstarts my whole
and then I'll just undress and cool down and then get
and I don't typically have a morning breakfast
it's just something I got used to
and it works really well for me

I guess the one of the earliest memories that I have is
it was a wonderful experience because I was living in a small
and there wasn't the opportunity to partake in any sort of
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports
they had rowing
and they also had arts and handicrafts music theater which I
and so that gave us the opportunity to have a really full
and also what I really enjoyed was the fact that they
we could eat if we wanted
if we didn't feel like eating we didn't hafta eat
there was never anybody saying that you know you weren't allowed
so that was I was in my glory because I would have
and that was enough for me
also we resided in these cabins in the woods
and every morning the counselors would take us swimming before
and it was always really really chilly in the morning
and so this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water
I don't know
I can't remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to
but it was always freezing cold
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake
used to attach themselves to your leg
of course suck on your blood
and that the only way that you could get them off is was if
and then you could pull them off your your leg
and then we'd all go back get dressed and then go and have
and in the evenings of course you know we useta sit around the
everybody used to sing songs and tell stories ghost stories and
and then you know that would be the end of the day
and it was just it was glorious
I just I loved camp
and arts and crafts was really good
we they always had lots of materials and somebody who had
and there's painting and things that we useta create with wood
and then I mean I think I was only there for a week
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity
be cause the days were just so so so full
and then at the end of the week you know they'd bring in the school
I was living in Montreal at the time
go back to Montreal
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it
and I made such good good friends and people that I really
and once home I kept in contact with a lot of the people that
a lot of the the girls that I met at the camp
so that was kind of nice
and then I went to you know every year I'd go back to that same
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back
and so you would meet the same people over and over and
so it was it was nice xxx
every year it's you know looking forward to seeing FirstnameE or
and yeah those were those were some really really really
it was just so nice to be away from the city and living in the
mhm
well today today I'm here
no usually I've I retired as of last year
so at the moment I'm involved in renovating our house
we haven't done anything to the house in the last twenty five years
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by
and being elderly she wasn't able to do any of the housework or
so it was pretty run down when I bought it
and she musta been a real cat lover because there were stray
inside the house the the carpets just reeked of cat urine
the walls were crumbling
the plaster was cracked
there was water damage everywhere
I guess she'd left the windows open
and the rain had come in
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck
so anyways we did a little bit of renovations
but we haven't done much since then
and that was twenty five years ago
so anyways we hired somebody to you know put together some
and and hired a contractor
and at the moment what's happening is that the contractor and the
so they're arguing about everything
the the the the guy who designed the space you know
that's the way it hasta be
the contractor says is arguing that it can't work that way
if you're gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support
and all this kind of stuff
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera
so I've been dealing a lot with that on a daily basis at least
so many issues
so many details
you know and I can't really afford a designer
but I know I should because I'm not very good at it
but anyways so just trying to figure out you know
that's that's the major thing in my mind at the moment
okay exc
so the young young man is kickin g around a soccer ball
the soccer ball breaks a neighbor's window goes into the
the neighbor gets up out of his chair to look out the window to see
""
so it was a there's a mother and her son
and she's telling him
look it's probably gonna rain today
you better take your umbrella
and he's there
no no no I don't need my umbrella
I'm fine
I'm fine
sure enough as the mother had said it starts to rain
and he doesn't have an umbrella
he gets all wet
and he comes home
he's dripping wet
and his mother frowns at him says
look why you know you shoulda brought your umbrella
so anyways she dries him off and gives him an umbrella
and out he goes into the rain
this one exc
this man was being chased by a dog
and the only way that he could get away from the dog was by
no no no no no no no exc
there was a dog who was chasing a cat up a tree
and so this man decided that he would try and get the cat
but then he got stuck up the tree
and they hadta call the fire department to get not only him but the
we start at page one
start
okay
oh
whichever way I you prefer
doesn't matter
okay
poor Cinderella who somehow or another became an orphan and hadta
whereas the two ugly stepsisters laid around in bed did
and they berated poor Cinderella called her names and bullied her
and she was basically their their servant
there's also this prince who lived in the castle close by who
and there's poor Cinderella working away
and anyway so the prince sent out this invite to the family
and they were so pleased
and they were all excited the two ugly sisters and this ugly mean
and they were all talking about how they were gonna get dressed
and poor Cinderella says
well can I go
and the stepmother said
well no no you can't go
you know you can't go
you have nothing to wear
and then poor Cinderella thought
well yeah but yeah I do have something to wear
I could I could maybe make something
you know I'll show them that I'll have that I can have
and anyway Cinderella was surrounded by all these friends these
and it was the night of the ball
Cinderella's looking out at the castle and trying on a dress
and the ugly stepsisters learned that she was going
and they tore apa r t her apart her dress and said she was
and the two sisters and the stepmother went off and left poor
poor Cinderella was crying and weeping be cause she'd really
and all these other animals or all her friends were as despondent
then all of a sudden as she was crying all of a sudden there
and it was the fair her Cinderella's fairy godmother who
Cinderella if you really wanna go to the ball I'll give you
and she turned a pumpkin into a stagecoach
you can go off to the ball
and so off she went thanking her fairy godmother
off she went to this wonderful wonderful ball that was being held
and the king or the duke or whoever he was saw Cinderella and
ooh I wonder who that is
and the prince saw her and asked her to dance be cause he thought
but one of the the the things that the
and so she's running away from the ball
and she loses one glass slipper
anyway she runs and runs and runs and runs and hurries home gets
and anyways so the ugly stepmother and the stepsisters come home
they're all bitching about who who that beautiful young girl
and anyway so the prince had picked up that one glass slipper and
well I can find who that beautiful young girl was by finding
so he went around to all the neighboring areas
and all the young women tried to force their foot into this tiny
and then but of course the ugly sisters their big feet
but Cinderella's did
and so the young prince was happy

tiger was clawed by the lion
bad weather was caused by long airplane delays
well it was when I was a kid
and I went with a group of my friends
I think I was maybe about eight or between eight and ten
something like that
and we went down to this local creek
we lived in a small village
and it was about a mile down to the creek
and it was springtime
and we were cautioned not to go down because it was you know
not a river
it was a creek
well anyhow we boys will be boys
and we defied all odds
and we went down
and we always had hammers and nails that we bore from our
so we went down
and we found some logs and some odd boards
and we put together a raft
and we went rafting
and the water was a very free flowing
and it was fantastic
but of course we hit one point
and there was a ice floe
and the raft went sideways
and we all went into the water
so you know and at that time we wore rubber boots
but they were no help because the water was more waist
and we got soaked from the waist down
water went in the boots
and and then we finally made it to shore thank goodness
otherwise it coulda been more serious
and when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots
but we still had our socks on
and we were wet
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road
and it was like slosh slosh slish slosh o you know
and it was getting colder because when you're wet like that
and we got home
and you know unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in
where have you been
what happened
so we we got a huge reprimand you know
so but thankfully we made it home
but because the temperature was dropping our sort of jeans or
they were starting to freeze
so it was like walking walking along like a robot
but we made it home
and everything was fine
but it was sad in that we got reprimanded
but we were happy when we were doing the you know the
so we had a good time
and you know we laughed about it
and you know we were all chummy
and we walked back
we didn't we didn't think too much of it
but you know when we got home it was kind of sad
thank you
typical day I would go for a walk
I would go shopping
I would try to get involved in some local activity
we have community gardens
we have a recreation center on site where I live
so there variety of activities
if it's a very hot day I would choose to maybe go downtown to
sometimes it's kind of neat to pretend you're a tourist
and the tourists seem to be very polite you know
up in my neck of the woods where I live right now you say hi to
and they look at you kind of strange like
what do you want
whereas you know tourists they seem to be friendlier
so I'll go to Harbor Front
if I've got the funds available funds I'll go to the islands
and that's time consuming
but during the week it's the best time to go
on weekends you hafta stand in line
and it's a
you spend more time travel downtown and going across in the ferry
and
and you know there's bicycle rentals canoe rentals
there's lots to do
miles of walkways
so yeah I try to keep busy
I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities
otherwise I find you know doing the same thing it's like being a
and you have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day
so it's kind of nice to try different activities
I like the you know variety
yeah
there's no Cinderella in these exc
okay exc
looks like the boy is kicking what appears to be a soccer ball
and unfortunately it goes and breaks the window a shuttered
and in number three the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in
the man picks up the ball looks out the window glances it
can I just scan the whole story
okay exc
see the progression exc
looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy
he says
no no no no
I don't want the umbrella
it's not going to rain
and upon leaving for school with his backpack it appears that the
and then he's looks like he's on his way home or way back with
and stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down
and she doesn't look too happy
and he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again
okay there's a lot of action here exc
looks like there's a girl who's reaching up into a deciduous
there's a tricycle
perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle
there's a man up in a tree
perhaps he was climbing up the tree
and now there's a dog barking up the tree at the man
he looks very perturbed upset because he can't get down
meanwhile firefighters arrive in their truck
two firefighters are running with a ladder to probably in an
and there's oh and there's a bird chirping on
okay exc
it's a fairy tale
that's Cinderella
and it's about Cinderella and a prince
Cinderella lived with her mean say stepmother who had two
they were not too fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she
and she was made to do all the work
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person
and she lived I believe in the attic
and she would talk to the birds
okay exc
she was always working
but she would think of you know how she was made fun of by the
she was overworked
she'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the
there was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse
Cinderella was always mopping mopping cleaning you know cooking
Cinderella received a delivery
it was sealed
and the delivery went to the stepmother
stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read
Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited
but as it turned out she was not
so the stepmother denied her that
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the
they were invited to a ball
the prince was having a ball
Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the
in fact she tried on or looked at a dress that she would
she mentioned the dress
and then she looked at pictures of the dress
she was friends with all the
they decided to
so they sewed
and they spun
and they weaved and you know appliqued the bows on the dress
she didn't know this was happening
she
the birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special
she was so delighted with the dress
meanwhile the stepmother and the two sisters were prancing
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her
I believe that they may have been responsible
she cried
everybody was sad her friends the animals small creatures
the fairy godmother heard her pleas and and her sorrow
and she came and waved her magic wand and turned pumpkin into a
it's a sad story exc
into a magnificent coach for Cinderella
then she was off in the coach with the blessing of the
she arrived at the ball and was greeted at the door by two of the
there she met the prince
but the fairy godmother had br st u
in her haste when she heard the clock dong dong dong she ran off
and behind she left her glass slipper
meanwhile she raced home before the entire dream disappeared in the
and and then she made it back
the dress disappeared
the angry godmother met her
and she was very annoyed at her that she came home so late
meanwhile the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom
they tried
it wouldn't fit
however they finally came upon Cinderella
it fit
they brought her back to the castle

the wicked wicked stepmother
not all stepmothers are wicked but anyway this one was

I was very happy when my for when my daughter
and I remember being at the hospital with my wife waiting
we waited overnight
and finally and we didn't know whether the baby was gonna be
so we wanted we were surprised when the baby was
and we were I was there right at the time
and and so then there I knew it was a girl and was
I I like to spend a little time on the computer
and then often I go out to the gym and for some
do workout swim and exercise machines
then come back
and I usually have things to take care of back at the
and and I like to read get out
I like to do sports
sometimes I go I have boats
sometimes I like to go out in the boat on the weekends
and and just basically the things I I needta
and
xxx more than me
okay exc
well there's a man sitting in his living room relaxing
and outside a boy is kicking a soccer ball and accidentally or
and it goes breaks through the window breaks the window
and the man looks out and is wondering where the ball came from and
okay okay exc
so mother's saying to the boy probably that it's gonna rain
and you should take your umbrella with you to school
so he the boy basically says
no I don't need the umbrella
he goes out
and it rains
then he runs back
and his mother basically is xxx
I told you so
and gives him the mbr n l u
he leaves with the umbrella
okay
so there's a a cat for some reason a cat has
then a man tries to come to the rescue climbs up a ladder
and somehow the ladder falls down
and he needs to be rescued
so the so the fire department comes and I guess will try to
sort of yeah
mhm
yeah
mhm
I'll hold this
okay
well I guess this is the story of Cinderella
and yeah Cinderella basically lived with her father
and then Cinderella first then hadta go live with the evil
I don't remember the names but exc
oh yeah Griselda or something like that and something else
is that supposed to be taped exc
oh okay exc
basically okay so a bird came
and I all I remember is sort of that she basically was
and all the young ladies were invited to come to the ball
and Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated
she basically hadta do all the work that the other sisters didn't
so she was never
so she was always being giving job giving job
so she kept just getting more and more jobs to do
and and so so she was never able
the so the the day of the the day of the
and she never had any time to work to to
so the
yeah meanwhile the other two stepsisters were
and so they were all prepared to go to the ball
and then the on the day of I believe
and so the the birds and the mice and all the all
and they were stealing I remember they were stealing
and she was discovered that was discovered
and the stepmother basically gave her more jobs to
and somewhere in the story there's a fairy godmother
yeah so this is her still doing all of these jobs
and yeah so she's all sad and unhappy that she i s
and then her fairy godmother appears and waved
and basically the some something gets turned
and I think the mice turn into horse either
and so then then she creates a nice gown
and off she goes to the ball
but she hasta be back by midnight be cause the spell ends at
and so the sisters of course they see Cinderella there in their
and they're wondering how she and the and the
anyway midnight approaches
the bell the stroke of midnight comes
and she remembers that she's gotta leave by then
and so
oh yeah exc
in the meantime
I think that's the prince
and that's his father
and anyway he he he he only wants to dance
and anyway when as as as midnight approaches
and so she in her running out she loses her glass slipper and
but she's of course still missing her one slipper
so the next day the the prince wants to find out
and he knows that he the the lost slipper
so he announces to all of his subjects that he's
and so he he come he goes throughout the village
he eventually comes to to their their
and it's of course it's not gonna fit on the evil sisters
and he finds that it does fit Cinderella
but I think in their anger the sisters grabbed the slipper and they
but he sees that it fit her
and they live happily ever after and yada yada

and it forced us to do certain things
and it forced me to
because I was the primary caregiver for him against my
I have three other sibs

he waved his mother goodbye
he got outside
it started to rain
it was rainy
he was walking in the puddles
he finally went home drenched to his mother

the the ladder fell down
somebody called the fire department to get the guy and the cat

and I'm pretty sure I got the right story exc

I was thinking about this today
remember coming home with the report card in grade two
and I thought generally speaking I did I did pretty well
but I got a sort of mediocre to not so great mark in
and my mother in particular was kind of upset with that
and I thought that was kind of unfair
right now basically I tutor privately a bunch of students
normally that that takes place in the the evenings and
so I do tend to sleep in
usually I have breakfast around ten or ten thirty
I might read for a while and go the library just to email
and then I have what's essentially my evening meal
and then I have maybe one or two lessons with students
and that takes me to nine
and then come home might have a snack might watch television
this boy was kicking the soccer ball around
he hit a hit a neighbor's window and smashed it
the neighbor was sitting in his living room as the soccer
the neighbor looked out with the ball in his hand accusingly
the mother was just lecturing her son about the need to
the son reassured her that he didn't need one
then it started to rain
it started to rain even harder
so he came home all wet
and the next time he went out he brought an umbrella
because of two emergencies the the fire department was
this the girl's cat ended up climbing a tree and was
and in the same tree there was this man who climbed up it
and someone probably the girl brought a ladder
but for whatever reason it didn't reach either cat or the man
so the fire department hadta come with a larger one

Cinderella was an orphan girl who lived with her
at one point the handsome prince arrived in the house
and the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball with him and so
but Cinderella made a wish
she wished for a carriage
but whoever granted her the wish I don't really remember
so Cinderella and the prince went to the ball
of course Cinderella was concerned about the time
but at one point the prince had a glass slipper
and there was some sort of prophecy that it would fit
and it turns out that it fits Cinderella
so somehow they got home before the carriage turned into a
and they got married

okay so there's so many to choose from
I just hafta try and fix my memory on one
so I remember it was a day kind of like this but not so rainy
and it was my first trip to Hong Kong
and I was on a work trip
and I was tired because I'd flown all night and everything
and but I decided I was gonna go out sightseeing
and I did go out
and I went to the top of the peak in Hong Kong
and I looked around at the vista and saw the beautiful landscapes
and I remember saying
thank you Manulife
because that was the company I worked for at the time
that I wouldn't have been there had it not been for that work
so I felt a great deal of gratefulness and happiness although I
oh I'm not sure there is such a thing as a typical day
but get up in the morning and have a shower and get ready for
and then usually my husband and I have breakfast together
and we figure out who's doing what during the day
and for example this morning
one of my hobbies is I grow orchids
so this morning at the breakfast table we were surrounded by all
and it was you know a miserable dull day outside
but inside it was bright and very pretty
so after we discuss who's doing what who's doing what
I might have a study to go to
call people who are not well and see how they're doing
and prepare a meal for the evening
maybe some housework that needs to be done
and then in the evening I have a lecture to go to
so that's kind of a typical
if there is such a thing
I'm tired at the end of the day
mhm exc
okay Jimmy's outside playing with the ball kicking it around
and the ball breaks his neighbor's window
and the ball comes into the living room where the neighbor is

and her dad has tried to rescue the cat
but the ladder fell down
and the dog is barking because he doesn't know why his owner is not
