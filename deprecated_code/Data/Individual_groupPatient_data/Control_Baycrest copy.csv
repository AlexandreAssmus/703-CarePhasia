well ‡ you_know you're [//] Winnipeg was a smaller city . 57655_60685
and it was different in nineteen forty six . 60706_62826
and I knew the way . 62944_64754
I [//] &-uh being in the car the kids they pick it up fast . 65194_67994
so ‡ yes you asked for memory . 69513_70913
there it is . 70933_71563
okay ‡ yesterday I was &-uh at home in the morning . 76854_80454

&-uh and he did it all . 114810_115500
and then I stayed a little at my sister's and my daughter's . 115720_118830
and then from there &-uh I visited my [//] &+s one of my sons . 118890_122040

I took my wife to [/] &-uh to zumba class at Baycrest village . 131581_134911
and then <we watched the Gray> [//] I watched the Graycomb
that was my day . 138960_139580
yeah . 142829_143079
in these pictures ? [+ exc] 156609_157339
well ‡ the first one is this kid kicks the ball . 158805_161205
"and it looks like it breaks a window , goes through the window"
and then the man that's sitting there picks up the ball and is
one seems to have an umbrella . 178560_180430
and she's looking to give it to her daughter . 180478_182748

well ‡ there's a man stuck in a tree . 217640_219230
and the dog is barking . 219251_220591
and the girl's trying to get the cat off the tree . 220639_223079
and she's got a little tricycle there . 223130_226130
and there's a ladder . 226146_227006
but [//] &+nobod now on come the fireman <I guess> [//] to help him
what do you want me to tell you ? [+ exc] 237606_238496
Cinderella a young girl who lived with &-uh &-uh an [//] &+aw a
and &-uh she did all the work around the house . 250280_253910
she was treated very badly . 255074_256923
and life was pretty harsh for her . 257968_260368
so ‡ one day an invitation comes sent by the royalty that there's
and of_course the prince is gonna be there . 270790_273390
and [/] and the [/] the two sisters and the mother are very excited

and &-uh Cinderella's left behind . 300490_302880
and then along [//] out_of the blue comes this fairy godmother who
and she basically turns all her rags into wonderful clothes . 313600_318840
and he [
and her [//] &-uh both horses suddenly &+s emerge . 322356_328216

and after that it's happiness for all of them . 355972_359782
they're just having a great time . 359801_361311
then she suddenly realizes it's close to midnight . 362000_364240
"and she &+s rushes down the stairs , leaves &-uh a slipper behind"
and she gets into the chariot and heads home . 371420_375800

and she's back to where she was . 379680_381350
and xxx comes . 382610_383450
there she is working away still . 384334_385834

they ask if anybody else is there . 414344_415974
and sure enough the [//] they [/] they [/] they pretend she's not

sounds like a ten minute interview . 10860_12000
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk
&-um it was important to me to get into law school . 20720_24150
that was something that happened that was very important . 24930_26920
I have no idea why I was accepted because I don't think I met any
thirty two . 43310_43980
I was thirty two when I started . 45060_46160
so ‡ I guess I was thirty one when I applied . 46176_47946
and in my year the median age was twenty two . 48596_53406
"so ‡ I was one of the oldest in the class , had nothing in common"
I_mean they still remembered high_school . 64066_65867
who thought about high_school ? 67523_68613
and they all knew each_other from high_school . 69920_71830
and they were there because they didn't get into medical school or
and I was just flummoxed . 83970_85880
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came
they were just there because +//. 96740_98140
well ‡ I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the
and I was there (be)cause I just really cared . 104040_106060
and so ‡ I really didn't fit in &-um really . 107340_112220
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real
up until then I was friendly with people but I didn't understand
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what
&-like they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious .
why would anybody say the obvious ? 139881_143161
so ‡ people said the obvious . 143695_145205
and they were rewarded . 145300_146040
so ‡ those were the people sought after to be in the study groups .
not me . 150337_150957
so ‡ I did almost everything alone for the entire year . 151522_155042
and when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she
"so ‡ I said +""/. 168136_169106"
"+"" thanks but no thanks . 169505_170575"
"+"" don't bother . 170724_171134"

and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it . 176425_178585
so ‡ that was me &=laughs . 178601_179291
so ‡ I was part of that group for some classes . 181263_183613
at the end of the year &+i in the subway station I met someone who

and she was in the other group . 196055_197125
so ‡ I never saw her . 197178_198128
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I
and that was good . 206490_208510
&-like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the

&-um I guess the [//] one of the earliest memories that I have is
it was a wonderful experience because &-uh I was living in a small

&-um they had rowing . 65775_66975
"and they also had arts and handicrafts , music theater which I"
&-um and so ‡ that gave us the opportunity to have a really full

&-uh we could eat &+we if we wanted . 96290_98430
if we didn't feel like eating we didn't hafta eat . 98449_100069
there was never anybody saying that you_know you weren't allowed

and that was enough for me . 109987_110807
&-um also &-um we &-uh resided in these cabins &-uh in the woods .
and every morning the &-uh counselors would take us swimming before
and it was always really [/] really chilly in the morning . 124510_126920
and so ‡ this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water . 135700_139720
I don't know . 140210_140470
I can't remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to

used to attach themselves to your leg . 151337_154027
of_course suck on your blood . 154890_155900
and that the only way that you could get them off is [//] was if
and then you could pull them off your [/] your leg . 159422_162302
"&-um and then we'd all go back , get dressed and then go and have"

<I just> [//] I loved camp . 189303_191723
&-um and arts and crafts was really good . 192368_195368
we [//] they always had lots_of materials and &-uh somebody who had

(be)cause the days were just so [/] so [/] so full . 217588_219668

a_lot_of the [/] the girls that I met at the camp . 245826_248426
so ‡ that was kind_of nice . 248894_249744
