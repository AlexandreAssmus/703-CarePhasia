it's been a_lot better than it was „ yeah . 8167_9877
<ten years> [//] you_know ten [/] ten years „ right . 11147_13537
I had &-um encephalitis &-um ten years before . 20686_26246
and I hadta remember everything . 26931_27881
so ‡ it's in my head . 27952_29502
but it's how when you get it out_of there „ so . 29552_31322
&-um <I had> [/] &-um I had &-like &-um encephalitis for <it was> [//] about a month . 37920_46750
I don't even remember anything about it . 47283_48723
<but &-um I was in the> [//] but when I remember they got me to start up another time . 49720_55530
&-um <hadta remember> [//] how to remember how I'll talking about abc@k one two three &-um noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff . 55726_64406
just remember how do you rewrite everything . 64509_66169
&-um just taking your time . 66425_67735
but it's still in there . 67754_69774
and you can't just get it on there . 69798_71188
you might talk a_couple times about it . 71206_72746
then you're talking about <the decks [
and then you forgot about that one . 75796_76576
so ‡ it's always kind_of like that . 77066_78686
but you can still do it . 78844_80404
so ‡ I'm still writing and &-um preposition and all that kind of stuff . 80555_88135
just sort o(f) thing you can do . 88184_89004
<just keep> [//] make sure it's still doin(g) than [//] better than it was . 89200_91000
yeah ‡ oh ‡ it's unbelievable „ yeah . 96106_97546
&-um &-um mostly hadta remember how to &-um +//. 110777_115837
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get +... 116829_119949
it's funny how &-uh my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that . 121456_124816
I could go in the kitchen first . 124902_127022
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that . 127071_129651
the name +... 130193_130854
I don't remember anything about it with my head . 131000_132960
I could sit there and making &-um breakfast and stuff like that . 133033_136373
"and she'd say +""/. 136389_136809"
"+"" &-um don't know . 139609_141239"
"she'd put toast and I'd say +""/. 141493_142373"
but eggs +... 144151_145151
"+"" that's right „ okay . 145429_146459"
but it takes time to get everything out_of your head outta there „ so . 146597_148777
&-um a_lot_of it's there . 149189_150949
but most of it's just you can't get it out_of my head on there . 151809_154009
&-um it's hard to come back around everything like that . 154559_157989
and also [//] it's also because when you talk to me doesn't get the same way coming back to me . 159528_163378
&-um and it's also kind_of weird because if you talk to one person and me it kind_of kills me . 164119_170739
but if you have another person here I can understand a_lot better with that . 171322_175912
but it's depends [/] depends on how it's coming on to me yeah . 176730_179570
&-um like I said I hadta remember doin(g) abc@k one two three everything like that . 190519_196759
&-um they took me <at &-um oh> [//] to &-uh &-um books for the first year . 197456_205806
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that . 205828_210118
&-um just trying to get back where it was . 210634_212184
&-um I &+yu just write trying to &+re just getting everything on there . 212294_217834
so ‡ it's [/] &-um it's like that . 218365_221655
it's just hard . 222275_222985
you start getting little things starting through there . 223032_225322
but then I went to &-um +... 225337_226787
I don't know if you go to Chicago . 226952_229492
there's five weeks . 230093_231713
there we got back how to do different things around there . 232011_235301
how you're kind_of think you're on this place I think then maybe a different one . 235354_241874
it's like you had different places you get around there helped around . 241921_244531
but [//] &-um so ‡ it does get out_of there more than you can . 244753_248843
I_mean the first time you're just going straight . 248892_250872
and it's hard to get anything out_of there . 251460_252810
but &-um I don't know . 252898_254438
<is that> [//] did I tell you anything ? [+ exc] 254582_255672
when I was little first time ? [+ exc] 274094_276204
well ‡ it also can be that too for [//] like I said for ten years <it's kind_of> [//] I really hadta remember start everything . 289660_297050
so ‡ I did get a remember . 297589_299059
I did start up another time . 299191_300431
so ‡ it did help . 300536_301226
&-um I_mean &-uh my mom helped me . 301794_305714
and &-um different places they've [//] they help everything about it . 305938_308858
but it is nice to get back up &-um where you can go +... 308920_312090
the bottom +//. 313187_313577
I_mean it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down . 313600_317210
I hadta go up . 318010_318610
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were . 318978_321488
&-um so ‡ it's been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that . 321841_328101
it helps &-um a_lot better . 329107_330617
okay . [+ exc] 358059_358219
the boy was &+out outside <with a> [/] with a soccer ball . 358243_363433
and he was kicking around . 363448_364978
and he kicked one really good . 365896_367026
&-um but it hit right in the middle of the window <on the> [/] on the house there . 367553_371723
&-um so ‡ the next one over there her [
gotta [//] might have been &+s sleeping and jumped out [
and the lamp broke down there too . 388738_390648
&-um but you really can't tell on number four . [+ exc] 391504_395574
&-um it looks like he is not very happy . 502156_506756
(be)cause he got his &-um soccer ball . 506773_510803
&-um but he's still looking out there . 511463_514582
and I think the [/] the boy musta ran away . 514597_516967
he ran away . 517505_518184
so [//] &-uh (be)cause he's still looking to see what he's doing . 518288_520828
okay . [+ exc] 546470_546740
&-um looks like mom told [
and he said well$co he doesn't really want that . 556069_557769
so ‡ &-um he's moving onto the next . 558083_560073
he says no big deal with the [//] <he doesn't> [//] the umbrella . 561313_563953
so ‡ he got outside . 564215_564905
and it rained . 564929_565729
&-um that was on number three . [+ exc] 566649_568269
he's over there rainin(g) on him . 568292_569712
number four . [+  exc] 570054_570684
and it's really rainin(g) him . 570700_571830
he's gotten water all over the place . 571963_573383
&-um number five . [+ exc] 574850_575730
he finally came back . 575749_577049
and [/] and he didn't look that very good . 577848_580518
and <she didn't> [//] she told him it's not very good and probably smarter that he didn't take it . 580620_585760
&-um so ‡ next time he's gonna take the umbrella when it rains . 586653_590903
www . [+ exc]
&-um it looks like her dad . 618627_621767
&-um well ‡ mostly the [/] the girl who's looking to find her cat up on top on the tree . 621785_630515
she wanted to get it there . 630537_632177
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder . 632192_634742
but it fell down . 635479_636769
so ‡ he's stuck up there the whole time . 637260_638500
&-um the dog's kinda barkin(g) at him xxx . 639322_642292
really helpin(g) there . 642690_643390
but &-um the &-um firemen are coming over there . 643492_649192
they've got another ladder . 649582_651082
they're gonna help him back up [
&-um but I don't understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree . 653365_659235
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat . 659257_661627
&-um and the cat gets by itself anyway . 662981_664891
&-um it's just kind_of +... 665547_668247
yeah I don't know . [+ exc] 670285_670735
it's probably about what it is „ I think . [+ exc] 671557_673027
so ‡ I'm ready huh . [+ exc] 963300_963780
okay . [+ exc] 965351_965891
&-um what it was &-um <she has> [//] &-um she's not actually with the [/] the people . 966616_979276
but there's two &-um +... 980901_982421
it's not like they're &-um cousins or something like that . 983593_986823
there's two girls . 986843_988143
and were next by him and their mom . 988190_990730
they're really bad ones and stuff like that or <not very> [//] &-um very [//] not very haɪs@u [
(of)_course she's not <very good> [/] very good to her . 999087_1001307
&-um then she always hadta work outside and do all the [/] the hard things . 1002200_1006830
&-um and they dune [
they've got enough money and doing whatever they could . 1009248_1011978
so ‡ they gave a time that &-um they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the [/] <the money> [//] &+p the +... 1012277_1022977
I'm trying to say something . 1023000_1024230
trying to say all the good people there . [+ cir] 1024819_1026489
they had to go see them . 1026853_1028002
and &-um there's [//] &-uh they got to play and music and stuff like that . 1028179_1035858
&-um so ‡ she would never get to go there . 1036338_1039887
but &-um &+s I forget how . [+ exc] 1040291_1043452
somehow she got in here . 1043534_1044763
but &-um she got to go . 1045243_1047723
&-um say exactly &-um +... [+ exc] 1048862_1052842
it came that she had a very unbelievable great &-um clothes and stuff like +//. 1055904_1062984
they took her so_that one [/] one night where they got to see everyone . 1063160_1067420
&-um and [/] and actually it was the [/] &-um the guy who came to see her . 1068208_1077748
he was probably the best one there . 1079216_1080896
he was very nice and very [//] the best thing he could . 1080912_1084552
&-um and he really liked to see her . 1084875_1086285
but when it was done that time he [
so ‡ he [
and &-um so it was all done . 1092778_1095238
but the next day someone actually brought those to him [
because it was his [
because the only ones that are big enough for him [
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that . 1102998_1105988
so ‡ it didn't work for them . 1106070_1106920
so ‡ it came to him [
they just told him [
so ‡ it came on to him [
it goes to that . 1116576_1117346
I'm not done yet . [+ exc] 1118088_1119538
&-um &=laughs <the guy> [//] he's the [/] the one guy that I saw . 1120379_1125979
the two &-um sing with him and play and stuff like that . 1126165_1132055
that's where he was that night . 1132285_1133255
so ‡ he came back to make sure it was her . 1133335_1134735
so ‡ since it's her he's taken with her . 1135553_1137413
so ‡ it's going to be with her for <all this> [//] all the time and stuff like that &-um as much as it could be for him . 1138705_1144695
that tell you anything ? [+ exc] 1147105_1147805
okay . [+ exc] 1157967_1158217
&-um you should take a bread . 1159609_1163439
&-um get some &-um butter out_of the refrigerator with a knife . 1164869_1171689
&-um put some of those on the bread and also some of the &-um &-um +... 1172589_1179369
they're not peanuts exactly . 1181958_1183068
&+pee close_by the peanuts . [+ cir] 1183084_1186624
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread . 1187225_1189105
so ‡ everything feels pretty good . 1189673_1191763
except for your hand probably gets all over the place . 1192319_1193739
&-um but it's a real easy one . 1194447_1197657
you can do it for about two minutes . 1197778_1198718
and that's a good one to eat <if you> [/] if you you need to get something to eat . 1198772_1201352
&-um got enough ? [+ exc] 1202027_1203367
pretty much ? [+ exc] 1204070_1205550
something [//] probably something to xxx . [+ exc] 1213228_1215848
&-um I think <you just> [/] <you_know you just take the> [//] you took the butters [
the [/] the &-um peanuts +... 1226943_1233763
that's not the same thing . 1234751_1235571
<they sit in the> [//] it's in the &-um kitchen . 1236336_1246716
put on a bread [
and <put it on a> [/] probably put it on a plate . 1249529_1251149
go over <sit down on the on the table [
and &-um have something to eat . 1255474_1258884
I guess that's it . [+ exc] 1259030_1259610
how it was ? 25257_25887
&-um mostly when I started +... 30905_33235
I had a month I don't even remember anything about it . 34302_36282
but &-um it was like ten days . 36966_39436
<they finally got me in there to> [//] &-um <I finally started> [//] I_mean I could actually talk or anything like that . 39455_48165
&-um but I had to remember how to remember everything . 49097_54147
and we're [//] everything is gone back . 55540_58350
I mean everything about &-um abc@k all that kind of stuff like that . 58400_63160
everybody's name . 63579_64379
everybody [//] the computer on there . 64822_67492
the [/] the Coke sitting there . 67754_71274
everything . 71395_71915
the wrong about it . 71960_72520
you have nothing about it . 72671_73481
you hadta remember everything about it . [+ es] 73503_74473
so ‡ &-um we &-um went to +... 74523_78083
I had like thirty [/] thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first . 79587_86947
&-um and then &-um we went to +... 87031_90801
&-um after that that's when we started to talk and to &-um get in the sort of thing . [+ es] 91189_102499
make sure I'm forget something . [+ exc] 102549_103339
it's ten years before . [+ exc] 103356_104236
&-um &=laughs but we did start &-like &-um abc@k one two three or something like that with my mom . 105251_112021
<started to> [//] &-um it's in &-um &-um books . 112606_124276
I went there . 124847_125437
<there is someone> [//] we got a talk over there . 125575_127075
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abc@k one two three and stuff like that . 127698_133808
&-um and it took a long time . 134371_136601
it was about a year the start over that . 136619_138499
and I've gone down . 138702_139522
it was Monday to Friday . 139588_141198
now it's down Monday Wednesday Friday . 141243_143053
then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks . 144539_149789
just try to talk a_little better and that . 150771_152321
because I_mean at this time I could talk a_little better . 152688_154468
but it just hard to get back everything out_of there . 154555_157275
so ‡ that helped different things about it for those six weeks . 158287_162427
and you're trying with computer . 163145_164125
or <trying to> [//] try to write on there . 164143_165493
trying to do something about it get a_little better there . 165545_168165
and that's how they tried to +... 168339_169979
after that they started IU . 171000_172760
and that's when they &-um started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that . 173390_180550
&-um there's so much you couldn't remember anything about it . 180897_184047
&-um but it's [//] you just take your time trying to +//. 184961_190241
me [/] &+m me and <my mom> [/] my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that . 190400_195920
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things [
so ‡ it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time . 203582_206292
so ‡ you just gotta <keep everything> [//] keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk . 206345_214455
mostly taking my time . 216020_217820
so ‡ if I talk too much people have no idea what I'm doing . 218156_221156
and they talk to me real quick . 222577_224187
this is kind_of weird because if one person talk [
if there's three people I can understand other people . 228777_232867
I can understand more of this . 233199_234279
but [//] so ‡ it takes time &-um getting around everything . 234326_237926
so [/] &-um so ‡ <it's just> [//] it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting a_little better . 238000_244400
&-um I don't know how long I can go . 244694_247564
<but it's just> [//] it seems like I'm still doing something with it . 247579_250199
so [//] &-um and it keeps going over time . 250218_253478

<and the> [//] &-um and it's [//] my mom's very helping . 257226_262676
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too . 262700_266360
they need to do something like that . 266410_267760
but &-um I have my brothers too . 268482_270492
<one of them> [//] I_mean one I don't see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other . 270538_274828
so ‡ <it just> [//] it's not it [//] as it used to be . 274900_279140
I knew a_lot_of people and all that kind . 279155_281205
now I'm kind_of move down &-like a_couple people I knew and just take my time . 281608_286158
so ‡ it's a_lot easy as how it was . 286327_288477

so ‡ you hadta restart everything to get back on there . 325666_328546
so ‡ you took your time and tried to get through it . 328600_331690
and I_mean if you're going to yell at it it's not gonna do anything for it . 331791_334591
so ‡ you're [//] the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that . 334727_338737
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that . 339448_342098
I'd be outside and doing stuff like that or you_know . 342671_345081
but it really doesn't bother me that much . 345919_347399
I_mean I just take my time during the day . 347504_349334
&-like I'm [/] I'm gonna dry [* s
and I might go outside and working on the [//] a branch or something like that . 351267_354347
just keep going back and forth . 354400_355810
&-um &-like I'd [/] I'd go get my aunt . 356601_359541
she's ninety seven . 360281_361291
I get her on almost every times for a week . 361715_365305
and maybe &-like one day of the week and we'll see her . 365362_367182
but I get her on the phone every day . 367300_368750
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving . 368963_373663
and [/] and it's another way to get through to me and everybody else . 373678_377378
I_mean a_lot_of them can't understand what I'm doing . 377429_379319
but a_lot I know they know everything about it . 379990_382340

just anything you're telling me or +..? 407714_408984
&-um I thought it was kind_of totally different when I [/] I [/] &+re I restarted here . 417172_425282

<which was> [//] <it was kind_of> [//] it's a_little weird for every [//] everybody too . 427851_435091
because I_mean I knew right away my mom could ask me you_know what this was in the kitchen or something like that . 435180_441530

it is another way I tried to keep doing what I'm doing . 472257_476047
but it also is doing whatever I need to do . 476067_479647
I_mean I hadta do everything like that anyway . 479747_481747
so ‡ it took some time on that . 481800_483770

you're not gonna too quick . 493740_494700

and he knows . 622065_623335
he had water all over the place . 623581_624491

enough . [+ exc] 633232_633522
okay . [+ exc] 650416_650636
&-um looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree . 653285_658335

&-um well ‡ I don't know . [+ exc] 660888_662178

the dog's kinda barkin(g) at him for no reason driving him nuts . 706957_710607
but [/] &-um but the &-um firemen came in here . 711450_717360

and they'll get up here in a little bit . 722886_723876
they'll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him . 723900_726890

they're on the other place over there away from everyone else . 734100_736140

she had to go work outside and [/] and everything else . 977511_980611

how they [

she could go &-um sing and play or was out there . 1076795_1081835

it's one of the +... 1089664_1091034
I think he's &-um +... 1091171_1094061
I don't know if he is the king . 1094869_1097209
or he might be just the new king coming there . 1097547_1099637
he was out there . 1100414_1101134
he was with her for a while . 1101811_1103011

and he is worried what happened her . 1105260_1106610
but &-um she left . 1106657_1109267
and he was worried about that . 1109356_1110176
but she did drop one of her &-um shoes . 1110200_1113230
so ‡ he had that . 1113774_1114524
so ‡ they went back . 1115000_1115860
she was going back her place where she was just &+gon not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff . 1116739_1121769

and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes . 1136493_1141183
so ‡ he knew what it was . 1141200_1142720
so ‡ he took her back . 1143022_1144162

she went back . 1149175_1149545
she's [/] she's like a queen now . 1149593_1152083

my speech ? 14445_15205
I think it's a_lot better than <what it> [/] what it was . 16043_19193

actually I'm hoping <that it> [/] that it gets back to where it was . 26196_28906
yes &-um but to be honest with you I [//] if [/] if [/] if what you're asking is I think that I didn't exactly understand what had all happened you_know . 38191_54021
&-um and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and a_lot of it [
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were [/] were [/] were kind_of funny or weren't making sense . 68526_74806
so ‡ I [/] I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand . 75875_81345
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would &+r remember everything . 82713_93363
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought . 95229_98209
there [//] I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really <upset [//] not upset> [//] sad [/] sad . 101780_113240
<and then> [//] but then +... 115277_116247
anyway sorry . [+ exc] 116801_117381
well ‡ most of the time I've been pretty happy <sorry> [//] because &-um I'm very fortunate that I'm still here and have a &+s second time to be alive and be with people that I [/] I care about . 121156_150206
but it's just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything . 153735_159745
<I was> [/] I was home when it happened . 165187_167977
and &-um I [//] it just really hurt . 168043_172943
for me it was on my left side . 173294_174744
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down . 177735_180515
but right away I could tell something wasn't right . 181414_183604
and &-um then I [//] my wife realized more stuff that was going on . 184837_192807
and she was able to ask me &+ques quite a few questions . 194650_197150
and after a few questions she could realize I wasn't making sense . 197200_202340

&-um sure &-um a_lot . 224734_226834
&-um &-um I'm trying to think where to start . [+ exc] 227103_235103

did it +..? 251523_251683
where I was for awhile ? [+ exc] 252414_253544
&-um yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me &*CAR
yeah rehab that's the one . 260209_261769
it's hard for me to answer when I can't think how to say it . [+ exc] 262557_264177

and they [/] they were very kind . 269178_273468
and my wife was wonderful . 273573_274903
and they were just telling me things that gave [//] &+g &+i &+i me [//] it gave me a_lot_of hope that they realized <I was pretty much> [//] I was a_little weak . 274947_285387
but I was physically able to walk around and do a_lot . 285520_289420
and that [//] remember I told yesterday I could remember a_lot_of like well [//] &-uh &-um how to play a guitar and &-um kind_of singing . 289559_301349
although I guess you would know how this stuff means . 301752_305802
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was . 305910_312620
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something . 312769_318009
but that gave me a_lot_of hope . 318051_320181

<I usually> [//] I can usually get them . 358543_359883
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something . [+ es] 360769_367619
and when I started playing +... 370080_373110
is it okay &+i if I keep blabbing for a minute ? 374658_376548
<this is actually> [//] I guess my wife can tell me I [/] I kinda blab . 378975_384085
so ‡ &-uh I don't mean to be that way . 384205_387135
but &-um &-um you_know &+sh I guess she realized soon . 387763_397543
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing . 397587_405807
and &-um after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with &-um older people . 406584_419834
and then it made me think more about that after &+so somethin(g) I was going through . 421003_424933
and &-uh I really wanted to [/] to just sing . 426009_428449
I [/] I [/] I realized that I missed that . 428492_431072
so ‡ we were talking about me doing that . 431184_433494
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened . [+ gram] 434193_443773
&-um somehow one of them got [/] got missed . 444762_447372
and so it was about a month <I guess> [//] later . 448160_451530
&-um yeah [/] yeah July . 452413_456283
one [//] &-uh well ‡ I'm forgot to say it . [+ exc] 457867_459387
&-uh &+w bottom line is one of them called not long before . 459734_467404
oh_my_gosh you_know &+w we didn't tell him [//] [* s
"and so I still said +""/. 473004_474824"
"+"" yeah I want to try it . 474946_476246"
so ‡ I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs . 476476_484166
and I [/] I did it . 484304_485264
and I was nervous . 485625_486305
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to [/] to start doing it again . 486528_490638
and I did a whole lot of shows again . 491154_492864
and I think that really helped me (be)cause it [/] it started &+r remembering and a_lot_of that . 493841_499891
so ‡ I guess that's the answer to a_lot_of it . [+ exc] 500886_507283
yeah and I was feeling so good . 517556_520706
I [/] &+m I musta done a hundred shows at least . 520832_525142
she could tell you . 525268_525848
there was a ton of them I did . 525900_527210
and &-uh pretty much not having any problems . 528271_531531
&-um but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing . 532416_539786
and I was singing all not making sense . 539830_543180
and that just destroyed me . 543840_545370
I_mean <I just> [//] that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I [/] I was back . 546358_553338
and then that happened and the next thing I knew we're going to the hospital . 554265_556935
and I just couldn't believe it . 556970_558730
"<I just> [/] I just said +""/. 559209_561199"
"+"" oh_my_god no . 561490_562460"
and <that was> [/] that was probably the worst . 563478_565748
&-um but then came back around again . 567238_569998
so ‡ I was doing better again . 570490_572270
and then all_of_a_sudden Covid came in . 573439_575829
so ‡ since it's been so many weird things in my life because_of just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything . 577693_592173
and then that's come along . 592212_593652
and it's just every [//] we're all going through that . 594469_597669
kind_of figure out what's [/] &+h what's all gonna happen . 598598_602358
and how are people and etcetera and +... 602393_604183
so ‡ yeah it's been really really crazy . 604948_606898
oh_my_gosh so many +... [+ exc] 627716_630996
I don't know where to start with that . [+ exc] 631578_632958
I [/] I can only tell just [/] just the one „ huh ? [+ exc] 633072_634912
well ‡ I would talk about my wife and I gettin(g) [/] gettin(g) [/] gettin(g) married . 639414_643994
&-um I guess that's pretty obvious that I would say that . 645039_650629
&-um gosh I_mean I'm trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more . [+ exc] 651666_666106
&-um <I got> [//] I forgot a little what you asked me . [+ exc] 668370_677880

&-um we got to go to where we useta go every year . 681428_687658
up [//] to up north from us which is up &+b by Wisconsin . 688845_693015
&-um FirstnameT my wife +//. 694369_697259
you_know <I wasn't able to actually> [//] I used to always be the one that kind_of was the &-like main &-like &-uh driver . 698202_705832
and so of_course she [//] you_know I knew that <I couldn't> [//] we weren't going to do that especially with our kids with me driving . 707236_716686
so ‡ she [/] she did . 716770_718240
but going there again was a really wonderful time . 718336_726526
it really &-uh reminded me of a_lot of places . 727893_732013
(be)cause we [/] we usually would go in the same places . 732051_734211
and &-uh so that sort_of is a long thinking about +... 735637_738457
I just felt kind_of +... 739386_740296
we [/] we married there . 740984_742104
so ‡ I guess I don't know . [+ exc] 742151_743021

yes <I would> [/] &-uh I would &-uh love to . [+ exc] 763071_765571
&-um well ‡ first of all we're just friends . 766443_775833
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church . 775970_781190
and I was really interested in her . 782004_785594
but I took a long time . 787078_789398
&-um and finally I mentioned about if we could &+g go out . 791044_798474
and she said yes which is wonderful . 798517_800617
we went out . 801463_801933
one of the happiest +... 803001_803961
the [/] that first date was just amazing . 805168_808308
I felt like I was this younger &+g person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of +... 809533_819033
and we just went out to see a movie . 819532_821842
and then we just talked for a long time . 821877_824197
and I told her good night and drove home . 824573_827093
and that was incredible . 827134_828504
and so we started going out . 829499_831239
and when we got married it was such a happy time . 832462_834772
&-um I remember <I went> [//] &+t &+t &+t it didn't right away go +... 835732_843842
&+be before we got married that last night for [
but I did . 851570_852470
and I woke up . 852508_853948
and I was really happy . 854073_855063
and &-uh I &-uh was looking fairly forward to it . 856238_862648
felt a_lot_of peace . 863920_864910
and so &-um we had a pretty special wedding that we had done . 866211_870491
and &-um the way we did it was that you_know I didn't get to see her how she was looking when &+h she walked out . 871515_886775
and I was standing way back . 887643_889793
and I saw her coming . 889981_890871
sorry . [+ exc] 895602_895982

and &-uh we had &-uh &-uh a fantastic &-uh &+w wedding there . 917665_924045
and &-uh anyway the whole time it was happy . 925147_929577
I don't know why I cried „ sorry . 929613_930623
I think I might have thought of &+c (be)cause_of <FirstnameT's [/] FirstnameT's &-like> [/] FirstnameT's &-like &-uh mom who [/] who had passed away a year and a half ago . 930663_943003

and so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that she's [* m
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy &-um at least for the most part and just doing a_lot_of lovely things in taking care of them . [+ gram] 2418582_2435462
and so around that time the [/] &-uh &+p the prince +... 2436454_2446684
&-uh let me see . [+ exc] 2448418_2449948

I can't think of what that's called . [+ exc] 2450999_2452079
&-um wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all . 2453237_2464547
who would be &-uh just a lovely &-like a girl [
and so they have [/] have <this &-like> [/] this &-like ball . 2471445_2477835
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that &-um Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that you_know . 2479102_2488402
but they showed that the other two stepmothers [
and that their mom . [+ gram] 2494244_2496104
and they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen . 2497510_2502590

"+"" uhoh better not have with Cinderella (be)cause it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen . 2508242_2519602"
so ‡ Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready . 2520714_2524984

but then the stepmother got where she [/] she [/] she couldn't go . 2545279_2551669
and so then Cinderella was really crying . 2552773_2556293
as I remember that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken . 2557426_2565016
and you_know how could they not even let me do anything . 2565057_2569177
and then there's &+s fairy godmother person pops out_of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be &-uh driven . [+ cir] [+ gram] 2569253_2588553

and &-uh he's captivated by her . 2603069_2607559

I had come home . 114775_115885

I think it was maybe twelve or one o'clock „ I think . 120622_123792

and I can't even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it . 155907_159877
but I &-uh decided I wanted to just to sit down <with our> [//] with my &-like bedroom . 160762_172022
and I did . 173044_173694
and right away it just started getting worse . 175093_177013
and it really hurt . 178127_181207
and for me it was you_know my left side „ I guess . 181850_185960
but it was probably other ones . 186099_188179
but I think I felt more here . 188203_189533
and &-um something [//] I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really [//] very very different and strange . 190554_205704
and something was [/] was kind_of scary . 205725_209045
and &-um she started talking with me . 210011_215721
<and realized> [//] she asked me a few questions . 216785_218815
and &-um she could tell after several things she'd asked me that I wasn't making enough sense . 220290_231570
and then I started feeling almost sick . 232731_234821
and she got me a thing in case I did . 235624_237294
and I did getting sick . [+ gram] 237382_238582

<and &-uh I think that> [//] well ‡ my wife and my kids knew [//] they probably figured some things out (be)cause with [//] &-um my wife's mom had passed away &-uh about &+s six months or something I guess it was before that . [+ gram] 249089_274169
I think that's about right . 274451_275491
<and I think> [//] last thing I'm saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on (be)cause I remembered what had happened with her a little bit . 276728_289818
and &-um so I was thinking about that and praying about that . 290783_298693
and that's the last thing I can tell you . 298793_302243
we were going to the hospital . 302613_303703

and especially as a wife and kids they &-um asked me a_lot_of questions . 366857_376137
and part of the whole thing <I don't know how to say it> [//] &-um is they've had to figure out what I'm trying to say . 376248_386218
and &-uh they've been very patient about this when I get stuck on something . 387470_393320
and every now and then I get a little bit upset . 393396_396226
but not upset like crazy scary somethin(g) . 396278_404328
&+y <I just> [/] I just get frustrated because I know what I'm trying to say but I can't think how to say it . 404892_410282

they give me tons of those . 461441_462691
but my wife's is the main one . 463237_466337
she's helped me out so much . 466399_468559

"or &-like I'll say +""/. 475087_476397"
"+"" oh it's like this . 476565_477105"

that's the best I can do right now . [+ exc] 1546340_1547750
&-um the story of Cinderella . [+ exc] 2145813_2148633
&-um I guess it starts off +... 2148802_2152042
&+leas at least the way I remember . [+ exc] 2152572_2154432
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very [/] &-um &+v very good people . 2154481_2165371
and they treated her as they should very [/] very [/] very kind and with [/] with a_lot_of love . 2166353_2174283
and &-um that would [/] would of_course have been great except &-um her [/] her &-like mother died . 2175781_2191511
and I guess a_lot of those &-like Disney shows do that sometimes . 2193850_2198970
and &-um so the dad was a good man . 2199331_2206451
but &-um like a_lot_of people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else . 2207521_2218881
and so that ends up happening . 2220609_2223529
and really messed up by marrying this other woman . [+ gram] 2223870_2230700
<who ends up> [//] she's just so cruel and so selfish . 2231837_2237597
and &-um oh okay what I should say before &+t also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life . 2238997_2258567
and so what I mean now is that the +... 2259253_2261343
&-uh what is it called ? [+ exc] 2262268_2263708
the other woman &-um she now has &-uh the power I guess where she's really being awful with [/] &-um with [/] &+s with Cinderella . [+ es] 2267475_2293645
&+a and I guess maybe even the [//] her &+d dad might've died . 2294814_2299734
I don't remember about that . 2299750_2300800
anyway ‡ so ‡ <they're showing> [//] they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed . 2301584_2309524
she went through &-um a really nice life which was deserving to her (be)cause she was a very [/] very [/] very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone . 2309719_2329349
so ‡ now that the other mother is now there &-um the other mother &-uh makes Cinderella do everything . 2330371_2345321
all the washing and &-uh everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do . 2346355_2353495
and these [//] <those two sisters> [//] the [/] &+sek &+fes the other &+s &=sighs +//. 2354825_2363065
what are those called ? [+ exc] 2363647_2364297
those two other girls &-um are just so mean to her and so just very &+s &-like very snotty horrible . 2364966_2379266
don't even care about Cinderella at all . 2380824_2383584
only that they can get whatever they want . [+ gram] 2384690_2387060
they make her do everything . 2388165_2389215
but even so she still [//] seems to still have an amazing way to be &-uh lovely and sweet and caring . 2390591_2406811
and so &-um I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place . 2406829_2426419
I can't think what it's called . [+ exc] 2426562_2427512
&-um beautiful place . 2427778_2430338
so ‡ sorry ‡ somebody's walking back here and I'm [/] I'm getting this for &-um +... [+ exc] 2431317_2435477
&+s <okay so> [//] &-um okay ‡ I think then the next part of the story is it shows <that the> [/] &-um that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman . 2436355_2469015
I guess . [+ exc] 2469410_2470060
so [//] oh ‡ this is hard . [+ exc] 2470880_2474210
so ‡ the [/] &-um the &-like +... 2474322_2480602
&+s <how's that> [//] I'm in track where they are . [+ exc] 2481169_2483599
<so the> [//] so ‡ it's made by decree that <they should have> [/] &-uh they should have <this &-like> [//] &+th <yeah okay this &-like> [/] this &-like ball . 2485474_2502814
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta [//] hasta come there . 2504665_2517985
and then they'll be able to [/] &+dec to figure out who's the best one that <he should> [/] he should marry . 2518911_2528051
so ‡ then they showed in the picture if I remember right &-uh his [
"+"" oh ‡ good ‡ we all get to go to the ball . 2544205_2548255"
and &+sh &+s she's excited (be)cause she thinks between those two daughters <that one of them will [/] will be> [//] &-uh that they will want one of &+th them . 2549533_2561333
so ‡ they're all excited including Cinderella was excited . 2562338_2568458
"but lo_and_behold &-um I think it showed that the other mother says +""/. 2568509_2580649"
"+"" oh ‡ no ‡ you're not going there . 2580843_2582573"
seems to me &-like I remember &-like the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear „ I think . 2584195_2592705
anyway ‡ so ‡ Cinderella <part of her> [//] part of how she's just so lovely and kind &-um even <the little> [/] &-um <a little &-like &-um sorry &-like ænəbəl@u [
&-um so ‡ they even <do what> [//] help to try to make her what she can wear . 2636676_2647676
<and I think I'm> [//] what happened with that ? [+ exc] 2649523_2652393
anyway ‡ yeah ‡ then it gets messed up . 2653228_2655608
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think that's where it shows Cinderella really [//] for the first time really crying . 2655702_2666092
"really just destroyed because it's like +""/. 2667332_2669172"

<I'm being> [//] it's like they think she's just nothing . 2677660_2683470
and &-um she doesn't deserve any of that . 2684556_2687096
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother pops out_of nowhere . 2688004_2692504
and she makes a beautiful outfit . 2693600_2699160

&-uh yeah with [/] with [/] with [//] it's &-like a pumpkin . 2712159_2716089
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in . [+ cir] 2717117_2721087

she ran out . 2099074_2099734

she got home &-um without the slipper . 2106244_2110264

and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem . 1156499_1162159
they took me to the hospital and &-um did the scans and so_forth . 1162181_1167651

&-um while I was there in the hospital +... 1171824_1176254

<I you_know was just> [//] that's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again . 1192196_1197456

oh and the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost &-um my ability to focus my eyes together . 1207660_1216570

and &-uh you_know (be)cause <when you're> [/] when you're paralyzed you're not sure whether it's moving or not . 1272321_1277811
you think you're moving it . 1278214_1279244

&-um &-uh <she musta> [/] she musta been sleeping <in the> [//] &-um &-uh out in the stable with the animals „ I guess . 3995205_4005405
&-um she [//] in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters . 4006254_4014044
&-um she was doing their laundry . 4014908_4018508

and &-um like I said she had become more of a slave than [/] than anything else . 4023192_4028482

and &-uh they'll have a chance to show off to [/] to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him . 4114875_4127904

<runs &+ho or> [//] runs and &+g dʒɛn@u [

she was running down the stairs . 4273796_4275326
the slipper fell off . 4275400_4276600
and &-uh she didn't have time to go back and pick it up „ I guess . 4278393_4283003

the [/] &-uh the prince was heartbroken <because he and [/] and me> [//] because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl <who had come to the> [/] who had come to the ball . 4289811_4306311

it was perfectly obvious whose [/] whose foot it was . 4375141_4379741

and I didn't know it was me . 113837_115157
I thought it was a picture of someone else . 115389_117229

so ‡ they were helping me to &-um stand up &+s at the beginning &-um not walking anywhere but able to stand up . 141996_155206
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side . 155471_159871
&-um so ‡ I had one therapist that [//] bet [

&-um then I had another &-um therapist &-um was trying to get me to start &-uh talking . 178362_189222
&-um I couldn't really talk of anything . 189906_193176
so ‡ they were showing me like &-um yes@q or no@q a_lot . 193384_199094
&-um I [//] we had to start with that . 200014_202414

&-um to [//] &-um at the beginning I was very [/] &-um very scared by myself in a room . 236196_247176
&-um <I also thought we had> [//] I [/] I thought someone had took me like [/] &-um like a bad person taking me . 247959_258399

so ‡ I [/] I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run . 286128_291018
that was even that part for me . 291407_293327
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way . [+ cir] 294041_300561
&-um didn't [//] my mom and dad were there . 301401_304451

and it was me . 319243_320103
so ‡ that's when it got started . 320802_322562
"&-um then therapy started with even very small like &-um saying my name , saying yes@q or no@q . 322671_334391"
&-um went from that point to we played some games &+t for numbers like &-um dice . 334829_343509
"&-um we played some games that were cards like &-uh &+p play cards in a way , put [//] sort all the cards together , what colors matching . 344484_359584"
&+suh little things . 359600_360710

I didn't know . 396453_397233

but not really on what they were you_know . 400452_403192
it was happy thoughts . 403275_404615
but <I don't know> [//] I wasn't sure what that was . 404665_406805
that's when it started . 407446_408606
&-um then I was able to start not walking very well . 408652_414852
"but I could stand up , pivot , sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself . 415034_421234"
that's when all that started during [
"&-um once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well , not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning . 425906_437066"
I still do have to watch my &-um &-uh dizzy &+s feelings . 437165_445255
"but &-um therapy [//] that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better , stuff like that . 445722_453452"
"and other therapy was still doing the talking , started at the beginning . 454198_459928"
"&-um so ‡ it's [//] that was about &-uh a year of just talking , working on all those words and all that you_know . 461048_470798"
&-um then after two years didn't have to worry about the other therapy (be)cause now I'm starting to walk &-uh very well now . 471330_479030
so ‡ only just therapy for [/] &-um &-um for speech . 479492_485812
&-um then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years &-um we started working on these numbers which I still not good at &=laughs . 486391_499031
&-um I went from &-um one to now I know one and two to one two three . 500061_508771

"&-um sentences , maybe . 541602_544132"
it depends on what we're talking about . 544181_546281
I'm starting to read &-um books from &-like little kids books . 546706_551936
&-um now I can do some of that . 552374_554234
writing is not as good . 555367_556837
so ‡ I use my phone . 557459_559299
"but &-um therapy people was showing me &-like apps , stuff like that . 559684_566404"
because someday if you can't write again there's other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that . 566500_573820
so [//] well ‡ I can't remember the first thing we're talking about . [+ exc] 574737_577787

okay ‡ &-um I think &-um is [/] is new stuff . [+ exc] 643133_650343
I [/] I think &-um since [/] since I'm &+i a teacher +//. 650433_658063

&-um but now I hafta &-um be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school „ right . 659821_667881
so ‡ one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke . 668379_674559
they have aphasia . 675272_676152
and we [//] &-um when there's a new patient here &-um I [/] I like to help them . 677316_687196
they're gonna have the [/] &+sa the same struggles most o(f) the time that I had . 687700_693870

they don't call me back . 735674_736674

and you take some of the &-um peanut butter . 2224059_2229989
and you put it in the cup . 2230750_2232310
and then you get some of the jelly . 2233362_2235782
and it has to be a certain kind (be)cause my dad only says you can have this kind . 2236095_2239965
I don't know it's one of those things . [+ exc] 2240615_2241165

and you stir it like this &=ges

and then you put (th)em together like this &=ges

not a hundred percent but you_know good enough „ right . 23580_28630
&-um yes it's been &-um a little bit more than &-um three years . 35393_43573
yeah &-um right [//] &+be about a week before my birthday . 44010_48220
yes had my stroke . 49546_50936
&-um I had been having headaches . 56847_59877
&-um and <I was> [/] I was a teacher working at a school and &-um working . 60707_69617
and during that day my headache was getting more worse . 70024_75164
and I went to the nurse that day &-um at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile . 75546_85486
and as we were talking she looked at me funny . 85967_90867
"and she said that &-um +""/. 91191_92791"
"+"" are you doing okay ? 93080_94480"
and I thought I was talking fine . 94590_97210
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that . 98035_103395
and &-um she knew that I was having a stroke from that . 103853_109023
and they called <five six seven eight> [//] nine-one-one . 109507_114087
and &-um I don't remember +... 114701_117281
right after that when they +... 118074_119524
I remember being <in the> [/] &-um &-uh <what do you call it> [//] in the +... 119781_124661
it's not a car you_know . [+ cir] 126282_127932
it's not a truck . [+ cir] 128247_129048
it's [//] is being in there laying down you_know . [+ cir] 129120_132010
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions . 132356_134906
but I could not think . 135094_136804
at that point it was getting worse as it goes . 137263_139653
and &-um they ended up taking me . 140419_144119
and one of the guys who does &-um brains he found a spot . 144642_151212
&+w they made it a picture . 151236_152786
they said that <you're having> [//] you have a &+s clot in your brain in the back . 153272_157842
and it's starting to blood [
and it starts to &-uh take &-um part of your &-uh <what do you call it> [//] &-uh &-like cells in a way that die . 161397_170597
and so he [/] he ended up giving me surgery at that point and &-um fixed it pretty much yeah . 171342_181442
so ‡ &-um I'm still here today . 181534_183724
but the &-um clot is still here . 183771_185991
it hasn't left . 186600_187500
so ‡ &-um that's why I'm taking the medicine I am . 187517_190097
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I [//] &+t it happened again . 190120_195260
they said I was taking &-um medicine that &-um əræktɪd@u [
it [//] &-um most people don't have trouble with it . 202755_206115
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think . 206164_210164
they're hoping that they +//. 210686_211726
yeah it's one of those things . 212109_213209
yup . [+ exc] 214250_214780
&-um I think at the beginning &-um the first thing they were helping me to stand up &-um to be able to walk again . 225351_235791
they were more into that at the very beginning than other &-like &-um aphasia type stuff . 235843_242063
they wanted to make sure I was able to [/] to walk again and [//] (be)cause my one side of my &-um body was starting to have trouble they said . 242230_254160
so ‡ they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning . 254176_261396
they started doing some little task for me . 261629_264189
"&-like &-um we played cards to see how many cards I can find , looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that . 264239_272929"
but we were doing that just here and there feeling . 273338_276948
&-um I was also very sad very &-um emotional feeling . 277586_282826
didn't [//] I couldn't even remember who I was . 283311_285911
and so &-um getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff . 286547_293727
&-um once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year [
"so ‡ &-um said +""/. 307910_309130"
"+"" let's go for our therapy now . 309230_310670"
"+"" let's start walking around and stuff . 310939_312799"
so ‡ once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit &-um we started working on therapy . 313123_320983
"and &-um they said +""/. 321148_322078"
"+"" you have aphasia . 322173_323163"
&-um and my talking <I couldn't say pretty much any> [//] I couldn't say anything . 323989_331629
"they were saying like +""/. 331949_332769"
"+"" do you want something to eat ? 332929_334039"
I didn't understand what that meant . 334163_335973
so ‡ they'd give me &-like a cup . 336375_337895
"+"" do you want something to drink ? 338044_338704"
they'd &+sh take the cup and show me . 338720_340900
and I'd go yes@q or no@q . 341441_343061
it took me a [//] &+lil even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it &=ges
if you don't want it it goes this way &=ges
took that long to figure that out . 352208_353758
little things like that that I didn't remember . 353835_357305
&-um then once I was able to at_least think a little bit more we started with &-um &-uh pictures like that bird <and the> [/] and the boy and the banana . 358157_373297
and &-uh <we start> [//] that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words . 373541_381511
and &-um my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else . 382129_390299
so ‡ still working on therapy myself . 390819_393209
I have &-uh a book at home that I still do my homework everyday . 393283_398843
so ‡ still going . 401055_402145
it's [//] I [//] I'm [//] &-um the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write . 402405_408755
<and I said> [//] but I told myself that I'm going to do it . 409091_413581
so ‡ I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up &+s you_know . 413977_418527
I'm going to read someday . 418838_420218
and I will write . 420238_421268
and I will have numbers at some point . 422510_424270
so ‡ yeah . [+ exc] 424348_425778
&-um let's see . [+ exc] 446419_447699
&-um &-um let's [/] let's see . [+ exc] 448247_455117
I [//] oh one of my &-um from a long time ago &-um when I was <I don't know> [//] ten fifteen right in there you_know teens in a way &-um <we had> [//] my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage . 455416_476766
and we [//] on the weekends you went to the cottage . 477653_481553
and &-um we wouldn't go every weekend . 482119_484909
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools you_know . 485016_490406
we would &-um take that time . 490453_492553
and &-um I think that was one my favorite places to go . 493074_497594
we could &-um fish . 498271_501261
we could swim . 501728_503288
we could +//. 503712_504262
and it wasn't very deep . 504362_506202
there was a_lot +//. 506733_507413
now it was deep in the middle . 507521_509211
<but right now> [//] &+y I_mean you could [//] didn't really hafta swim . 509415_513284
you could just walk around a little bit . 513299_515720
&-um there were frogs . 516399_518198
there was &-um &-um turtles at +//. 518250_522150
so ‡ I_mean <it was> [//] we got up in the morning . 522203_524943
and I think we ate as fast as we could <to be> [//] to go outside . 524965_529625
and I think you're pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed . 530311_534041
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that &-uh &-um all the fun things that we were able to do . 534537_542747
&-like my dad let me +//. 542768_544448
&-um we useta have a rowboat that had paddles . 544986_549816
but we also had one that had the &-um motor in the back . 550242_554672
<and it> [//] now you're [//] you were not allowed to go fast . 554804_557184
it was like two <what do you call it> [//] &-like &+fi no [//] five fast . 557249_563909
so ‡ it wasn't very fast . 564701_565981
you could almost swim as fast as you can the [/] you_know the boat . 566027_569277
but &-um they let me actually &+m mow [* s
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that [/] that paddle boat and stuff like that . 574385_582395
I loved to [/] &+r &-um to drive . 582756_586956
I just thought that was really cool . 588380_589630
I'm not sure why now <it was like> [//] it was such a big thing . 589648_592258
but it was you_know . 592275_593565
and I was by myself on the boat you_know . 593580_596690
and I thought I was something else you_know and all that . 596712_599552
we forgot the gas one time . 600038_601728
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid . 601744_604654
but I think that was . 605668_606538
and at night &-um <we had> [/] &-uh we had &-like a [/] &-uh a place to lay down outside . 607145_612995
and we would &-um go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty . 613045_618665
and I [/] I think &-um <when I have my> [//] if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage . 618681_629611
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads [
I think about that place . 636778_637948
I don't know why &=laughs . [+ exc] 638665_640345

&-um there's &-uha boy outside that was &-um hitting the ball around and having fun „ I'm sure . 686816_699976

&-uh it's pretty good . 8979_11259
I know I &+s struggle when I get overly tired . 11337_14447
I [//] I'm told that people wouldn't know I have trouble unless I

my hesitation is because I'm struggling &=laughs . 29912_32922
yes . 38799_39289
sure . 45689_46109
&-um I went to bed on a Monday night after work . 46617_52337
and &-uh just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and
&-um about &-uh one or two in the morning &-uh I hadta go to the
and I was struggling to get the covers off . 67789_70409
I was laying on my left side . 70589_72219
so ‡ I trying to get the covers off with the right . [+ gram] 73175_76055

and &-uh that was my first sign something was wrong . 79261_82631
I [//] at first I thought (be)cause I had the two cats . 83185_85865
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something . 85998_88348
but &-uh they [//] I [//] you_know the room was dark . 88399_92299
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might . 92317_96717
and finally they came off . 96733_97943
and then I &-um tried to take some steps . 98006_102516
the bathroom was the next room over . 102772_104742
and I was &-um finding that I was exhausted . 105487_110327
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed .
&-uh I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed . 116810_119250
but I just laid on the floor . 119971_121351
&-uh I laid there for about thirty minutes . 122217_124677
"&-um my Garmin told me what was goin(g) on , the timeline . 125046_129196"

so ‡ I did and just crawled back into bed . 135991_138451
and &-uh <then about> [//] &-um I was awake asleep back and forth
and I was trying to figure out . 147560_150950
something's wrong with me . 151000_152050
but I don't know if this is major . 152100_154480
and I was trying to decide . 154502_155922
it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart . 156536_160896
and &-um I didn't want to go to the emergency room . 161942_169102
and there'd be nothing wrong . 170300_171530
&-uh but I called &-uh a guy from work . 172859_176429
I used my phone . 176525_177705
and I thought I was dialing his work number . 177757_180877
but I got his cellphone number . 180964_182454
so ‡ I want to leave him a voicemail message . 183349_186699

and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on . 199024_202824

take me to the hospital . 256046_257565
so ‡ I did . 257748_258577

I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did . 267116_271146
it was a great one . 271193_272053
we've got &-uh four hospitals to choose from . 272099_275779
so ‡ <I don't &+re know why> [//] or remember why we went to that

and so I pointed to that . 300005_301775
and then [/] &-um &+sh then she didn't know what to do with me once
again she was someone with a brain injury . 309128_311188
so ‡ she was having trouble thinking her way through this . 311315_313995
"and so here , me , I just had a stroke . 314856_316936"

mhm &-um I had a_lot_of speech therapy . 382135_388405
&-um I went to two different &-um organizations for therapy because

and &-uh so I went to both . 407952_410052
so ‡ for maybe about <I don't know> [//] six or eight months I got

&-um &-uh I also did some physical therapy . 420675_426995
but I didn't stick with it . 427846_429246
and so I can still feel &-like my right leg drag a little bit . 429310_434560
&-um and I also have trouble writing . 435245_438475

&-um &-uh but the speech therapy &-uh +... 447662_454572

but if I'd have known earlier that that's what they were doing it
but you_know they didn't think to tell me that . 510441_513270
but &-um I did &-uh games on my phone . 513945_518085
&-um I went to a local college that had &-uh meetings on &-uh

and then the second hour we're split up into groups . 532189_535229
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into . 535756_539116
so ‡ you go into a group with about four or five other people who
&-um I bought books &-uh grade school books for math and reading
&-um and I did that on my own . 560325_561965

and then &-uh I went back to work . 565344_567844

&-um there was something +... [+ exc] 580176_582436
oh &-uh I always liked to cook . 582483_586123

&-um I found &-uh about healthy eating . 589067_594217

making conversions is not so easy for me . 621078_623588

that kind of thing . 649377_650537

as [//] &-uh it was like they were full of bricks or something . 69933_73053
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it . 73753_77173
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the
I was exhausted . 89490_90630
and &-uh so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed . 91218_94498

and so I did those . 1074609_1075669
and &-um I always did like to cook before . 1076160_1082330
but now I had a &-um special interest in cooking healthy food . 1082345_1089595
and I want it to be food that tasted good . 1089680_1092900
and &-uh so &-um I got some healthy &-uh recipes . 1093993_1099883
and &-uh worked on those . 1099982_1102222
and I &+s &+s was surprised to see that I struggled with &-um &-uh
like a jar of garlic . 1110945_1113945
half a teaspoon is one clove . 1114979_1117339
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that . 1117936_1123766
I was like +... 1123868_1124388
and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon . 1126278_1131048
so ‡ I did two half teaspoons (be)cause I knew that would work . 1131896_1138196
&-um <and &-uh so> [//] and I learned to highlight in the cookbook
&-uh everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would
and [/] &-um and &-uh so I did really well with the cooking . 1159128_1164738
and &-uh just as time went on &-uh it was no longer a struggle . 1164757_1170077
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like

"and so I thought +""/. 1194310_1195110"
"+"" well ‡ I'm gonna just go whole hog on this and get as much"

<and &-uh so> [//] &-um and there was &-uh two different locations

<and then> [//] so another person took her place . 1375746_1378296
and &-um wasn't real crazy about that person . 1378513_1381723
&-um but [//] &-um and in hindsight she probably didn't do anything
<it was just> [//] I was just struggling with my confidence
&-um <and it> [//] but then I went to another therapist . 1399996_1404406
&-um and that lady was young . 1405361_1408431
and she was very &-um upbeat and very positive and &-uh encouraging
and so &-um that was helpful to me . 1422453_1425923
and so we did a_lot_of &-uh focusing on &-uh short term memory and
I did that with her . 1436787_1438067
&-um she taught me some card tricks to do that I've since
&-um like &-uh five and two . 1446143_1449063
I don't remember what it was . 1449112_1449702

&-hm &-uh something important that happened to me . [+ exc] 1517177_1521667

and &-uh it's just too hard . 1588212_1589642
and so me and my husband <we'll just> [//] you_know we'll just see
and they did . 1594506_1594866
they did a_lot_of traveling and everything . 1594911_1596521

&-um this little girl has a cat . 2387406_2394766

and the little girl can't reach it . 2398885_2400335
and the cat is just hanging out on that branch . 2400431_2402811
&-uh so ‡ &-um somebody apparently called the &+pol fire department

and &-um &+i &+sh there's a dog &-uh at the tree trunk . 2438919_2446869
&-uh and it's barking up . 2447917_2451957
&-uh there's a man up on the branch of the tree . 2452341_2456231
&-um and the dog is probably barking at him . 2456832_2461542
and there's another tree . 2462051_2463201
there's a bird . 2463312_2464022
looks like it's singing . 2464042_2465372
and &-uh there's a ladder on the ground . 2466947_2469887
&-um possibly the ladder was used by the man . 2469936_2475556
and <he looks &-uh kind_of &-uh not &-uh kind_of> [//] &+discour he
and so it's probably his ladder that fell . 2483418_2485758
and so he's just kinda sitting there taking all that in . 2485779_2488669

&-uh they're really not nice to Cinderella and expects [

&-uh one especially &+s shown &-uh powdering her nose or something

&-um the mice became horses . 3076743_3082873

&-um then she gets the palace . 3090323_3092903

but I should back up . [+ exc] 3135230_3136270

<and the> [//] &-um anyway the [/] &-uh the one worker that xxx had

&-uh &-uh her &-uh stepsisters went . 1469504_1473484

it was the [/] the gal that <left the> [/] left the glass slipper behind . 1535789_1538719
&-uh and [/] and so the [/] the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that [/] that lady who left the glass slipper behind . 1538769_1548489
&-uh and [/] and <it was the> [/] <it was the one> [//] <it was the> [/] <it was the> [/] it was the [/] the lady whose [/] whose foot would fit this [/] &-uh <this small> [//] the small glass slipper . 1549451_1560881

&-um &=laughs I was sposta be having &-um a physical &-uh &+s therapy at home . 152201_163961
&-um and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kind_of crazy she said . 164837_176227
&-um I wasn't making sense . 176672_179072
and later that morning the physical therapist came . 180131_188981
and <he had all [/] all the> [/] &-um &-uh he had all the equipment . 189144_199914
and <he took my> [/] &-um he took my &-uh vitals . 200442_204472
and he said that I should go to the emergency room . 206943_211473
and that's [/] that's [//] &+th that I remember . 212263_216103
I didn't remember . 216969_218319
so ‡ my &-uh brother and my wife took me to the emergency room . 219126_223826
and luckily at the hospital that &-um I went to has a good &-uh stroke &-um thing . 223957_236697
so ‡ they took me right in there . 236749_238539
<they took a> [//] even in the emergency room they had &-uh a c_k [
so [/] so ‡ that's about what I remember . 248586_254286
well ‡ <when I> [//] when they took me back to the &-um &-uh hospital room there &-um I saw like five different doctors . 255104_270974
and they all did the same type of stuff . 270995_274835
so ‡ I could probably you_know do the [/] the what a doctor would see to check <about a> [/] about a stroke . 275569_285459
but I remember &-um I had &-um some memory loss . 286500_297150
&-like &-uh by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit . 298369_308739
and although I've know my brother's wife for you_know thirty five forty years I could not remember her name . 309358_323038
"&-like one [//] I said +""/. 323598_325328"
"+"" who is that ? 325571_326211"
you_know stuff like that . 326235_328015
<but it> [//] by the time I was &-um discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the [//] knowing that I did have some &-um &+apha +//. 349930_350100
I didn't know at the time that it was aphasia . 350100_352300
but I [/] I knew the symptoms that I &-uh &+pro &+pro &+pro <protest [
but that [//] that's all I remember . 368624_369844
&-uh &+w <well with the> [//] I didn't have any physical problems with <the streak [
&-uh <so when I did get> [//] &-uh well ‡ at the hospital they brought a speech therapist . 399050_408970
&-uh they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital . 409203_413003
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged . 413896_419316
so ‡ &-uh <I had hoped> [//] I [/] I knew I had problem speeching [* p
so ‡ I had asked if I could &-um forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well . 434463_447503
I [/] I was walking and all that . 449033_449963
"but they said that +""/. 450900_451390"
"+"" no you have to finish your physical &-uh therapy before you can start the speech &-uh therapy . 451996_462436"
so ‡ I [/] I had &-uh home speech therapy . 463215_470585
&-um it was very good . 472528_473058
I [/] I [//] the [/] the therapist was very good . 474712_477462
and she was actually the one that +... 477569_480039
&-uh after they let me have I think it's a Medicare type thing that you can use &-uh ten sessions . 481279_493409
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the &-uh speech clinic at Buffalo State in &-uh New York . 494040_509410
and &-uh a_lot_of that was &-uh to get my memory back . 510219_520869
&-uh a_lot_of the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories . 521677_535227
&-uh &-uh &+i it's hard to explain how it took . 535281_546571
&-uh I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist . 547147_554597
and after a couple of &-um sessions with the neurologist he said you_know there's pretty much nothing else that he can do about it . 555495_569875
but if I had any other problems &-um &-um you_know they could call me . 570683_580023
&-um one of the things <they did> [/] &-uh they did probably one of those &-uh cognitive &-uh test . 581896_592516
I [/] I did them . 594050_594630
and I did okay I guess . 594850_596380
&-uh probably sound &-uh like the stuff that they [/] they said that &-uh President Trump &-uh aced you_know . 596592_608872
I had some problems with it . 609894_611014
but &-uh &=laughs I had brain damage . 611902_614382
so ‡ I guess I had &-uh a reason . 614430_616840
but &-uh that's about it . 618350_619880
&-um well ‡ &-uh probably one of the [/] the [/] the nicest things that I have recently was &-uh my daughter &-uh on this [/] &-uh this Mother's Day she stopped over with the card for my wife . 642465_667995
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant . 675799_688529
so ‡ on <father [
and then on Father's Day we went over to her house with &-uh my oh son in-law's parents . 694564_710314
and they did a &-uh review [
so ‡ they had <a &-uh car [
and we saw that we're going to have a grandson . 729879_733999
<so that [/] that is probably one of the &-um &-um> [//] you_know that period between there has been exciting for us . 735726_750516
okay . [+ exc] 821090_821610
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the &-uh &=clears_throat window . 822825_835085
the ball breaks the window and startles the &-uh man who <grabs the> [/] &-uh grabs the ball and looks out the window to see what's going on . 836677_854897
okay . [+ exc] 877451_877801
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school . 878383_884453
and <he wanted to take or> [//] &-uh she wanted him to take an umbrella . 885111_894241
but he did not do that . 895987_897267
he started to walk back to school . 898718_902888
and the rain started to come . 903683_907043
so ‡ he ran back . 907461_909261
and the mother was a_little angry because <he had not pulled it or> [//] he had not put the &-uh umbrella with him . 911519_929379
"so ‡ he went back , put the umbrella on and walked back to school . 930201_936881"
okay . [+ exc] 955908_956618
well ‡ it looks like the cat was stuck in the &-uh tree . 957888_968488
and the man had tried to get to [
but he was not able to do that . 981184_983664
so ‡ the firemen came to [/] &-um to help him . 984859_992729
I don't know if they're there to get the cat <or the> [//] &+fa or get the man . 993338_1001348
and <the cat [
okay &-uh the story starts when &-uh <a woman [
so ‡ &+cirren Cinderella goes to <the [/] &+step the man or> [//] the bad stepmother . 1370953_1386473
and the two children the [/] the [/] the stepmother's daughters were bad .
well ‡ they aren't bad . 1386908_1388008
but they make Cinderella do all of the &-uh work around the house . 1403653_1414683
&-uh and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her . 1415593_1431313
and apparently they can talk with her . 1435818_1438588
&-uh and then <at after awhile> [//] after several years it looks like after the [//] Cinderella got &-uh a_little older there was a [/] &-um a invitation to go to the &-um ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for &-uh Cinderella . 1439476_1478036
but then &-uh Cinderella's &-uh godfather [
and a [//] she turns the animals into &-uh people that work for <the &-uh stage not the stage> [//] the coach . 1528563_1548603
&-um so ‡ they go to the &-uh ball where Cinderella meets the prince . 1551919_1566469
but because_of the [/] &-um the godmother only could do the spell until midnight &-um everything turned back to normal where &-uh her gown was gone . 1569294_1594424
and the coach were [* m
and the animals were back . 1601182_1601772
but then there was a man that worked for the princess [
&-um at the end &-uh they [/] they put the glass &+slip slipper on <Cinderitta [
and &-um it fit &+per perfectly . 1648993_1652343
and they found that that was the &-uh woman that the prince was looking for . 1653951_1665111
and <they went happy> [/] they went happy <to the> [/] to the end . 1665833_1675533
and that's about it . [+ exc] 1677394_1678144
oh okay . [+ exc] 1686232_1686822
&-uh I would open up the bag of the bread . 1686868_1692898
&-uh put a <piece of [/] of> [//] slice of bread . 1694886_1704866
<I would push [
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around . 1724716_1730336
and then put the second &-uh top of the slice of bread . 1730780_1736770
and I guess that's it . [+ exc] 1739504_1740044
&-uh it's pretty good . 7920_10000
&-um I have problems sometimes especially with &-uh numbers still &-uh . 10158_20268
and sometimes I don't know if it's because I don't hear <the [/] the [/] the> [//] what I'm &-uh saying correctly . 21630_35470
"it's something like if I was to say +""/. 36238_41378"
"+"" &-uh I had to take care of my &-uh income tax . 41992_46222"
&-uh I might say &-uh my income@q taxed@q or &-uh my income@q &+texa or [//] Texas . 47083_59913
you_know &+s stuff like that where I [/] I kinda think twice of what <the [/] &-uh the real or> [//] the [/] &-um the word that I was trying to say . 64196_87076
&-uh something like that . 87541_91261
but other than that I'm thinking I can talk pretty good as long as &-uh &-uh people give me time and slow down &-uh you_know (be)cause normally people speak faster than I can . 91850_116020
so ‡ &-uh usually if I'm in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I [/] I have some kind of problem speaking . 116888_129488
so ‡ they understand . 129615_132575
so ‡ it [/] it [//] it's pretty good . 133848_137078
I_mean &-like I [//] I've gone &-uh to a bunch of doctors . 137100_144780
and you_know they might repeat something for me or you_know &-uh ask what I had really said stuff like that you_know if I &-uh say it wrong . 145039_162929
but other_than that I'm feeling okay speaking . 165607_168917
oh I [/] I [/] I don't really too much about it . 176751_183281
&-uh I knew that &-uh I had been having &-uh physical therapy because I'd had had <a hip replacement> [//] the other hip replacement . 183424_200254
&-uh so ‡ &-uh that morning my wife &+unders <or she said that she understood or> [//] she knew that I was having some kind of &-uh problems speaking . 200445_223045
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that . 224101_228401
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular &-uh session . 229368_240108
and he also noticed that I &-uh was speaking differently . 240945_250245
and &-uh he took my vitals and stuff like that . 250711_255931
and he said that I should go to the emergency room . 256011_259961
and after that &-uh we're only &+ah maybe three miles from the hospital . 260908_269968
so ‡ my brother came over and took &-uh my wife and &-uh him over there . 270716_280406
and they sat there while I went through the &-uh emergency room and stuff like that . 281854_290524
so ‡ it [/] it took about &-uh &-uh maybe three or four hours to have [//] you_know go through . 292524_305034
&-uh they did some task . 305237_307547
and I think they have a good &-uh stroke &-uh thing . 307696_315546
so ‡ they [//] actually in the &-uh emergency room they had a c_t scan &-uh were I could do . 315628_328158
and then they [/] they found where I had &-uh a room . 328909_334159
you_know and they [/] they had found that I had had the stroke through the c_t [/] c_t scan . 334724_341754
and then by the time I [/] I went up to the room probably three or four other &-uh doctors came from you_know the [/] the hospital doctor &-uh &-uh neurologist . 344522_364422
&-uh they actually had &-uh a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to &-uh stop the blood or anything . 365419_375569
but it looks like after it [/] it [//] the clot burst I was okay . 375615_383245
and there was no xxx &-uh more &-um bleeding . 383348_392678
so ‡ that [//] that's about what I remember . 395482_397292
and I [/] I know &-um when I saw the doctors at the &-uh &-uh room <they all had the> [//] they have the same type o(f) test that they do to see if it was really &-uh a stroke and what kind of damage it might've been . 397313_422393
and I knew that I &-um had some memory loss . 423285_431255
&-uh I recognized my &-uh brother and my &-uh wife . 432397_440697
but my &-uh brother's wife came later (be)cause &+sh she was a nurse . 441994_452234
and even_though I know her for thirty five forty years I couldn't remember her name . 452832_463952
so ‡ I [/] I did have some &-uh small [//] <or what do you call it> [//] short memory &-uh loss . 464258_471918
but that [//] that's about it . 473392_474832
well ‡ at the hospital I [/] I stayed there for three days . 491251_498111
and they did a_lot tests . 499993_501463
&-uh they did &-uh m_r_is &-uh &-uh echocardiograms &-uh to make sure you_know I didn't have it . 501481_514160
they did &-uh things &-uh measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything . 514885_525975
&-uh <they did> [//] &-like the last day that I was there they brought a &-uh speech therapist there because they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital . 526117_546257
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my [/] my speech xxx &+a affected . 547248_559198
and it turned out that you_know the next day they &-uh &+dis distarged [
and I never saw her again . 576069_578149
and &-uh because_of my [/] &-uh my medical insurance &-uh when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before &-uh they could start my speech therapy . 580742_608782
so ‡ I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house . 616064_630444
and that [/] that was about it . 632954_634354
&-um I'm trying to think . 651775_657085
I [/] I know last session I think I talked about &-uh my daughter being &-uh pregnant nowadays . 657178_665988
but if I was to think younger &-uh maybe a good time a thing that I liked &-uh was <in my> [//] when I was twenty &-uh I was in the airforce . 667480_693630
and I was stationed in Italy &-uh in the Alps . 694661_703281
it was a radio station on top of a [/] &-uh a mountain actually . 703456_709386
so ‡ &-uh having never &-uh learned <how to play or> [//] how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn <how to play or> [//] how to &-uh ski &-uh because our [/] &-uh our sight was on the top of the mountain . 710432_734402
and they had a &-uh &-uh ski slopes there . 745869_752269
so ‡ I had a good time &-uh in Germany . 753082_757582
and the guy was a very old &-uh German guy that gave &-uh several of us &-uh skiing lesson . 758195_775975
and &-uh after that &-uh because our [/] &-uh our location &-uh &+wa where I would &-uh work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didn't xxx . 776891_797821
so ‡ I got to be pretty good at &-uh ski [//] playing ski . 805276_809536
&-er I keep on saying play@q playing@q ski@q . 809701_812681
&-uh skiing is skiing . 813217_814607
it's not playing ski . 815071_816281
and that [/] that was a good time . 817228_819438
yeah . 824596_824896
yeah I_mean it [/] it [/] it was a very small village where we lived <when we were at> [//] when we were off the sight . 838152_853952
so ‡ there was a_lot_of places to ski . 854783_860083
and it was only like &-uh forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg . 860813_870483
so ‡ we [//] we'd ski in a_lot a places around the Alps . 871162_877322
okay . [+ exc] 899435_899955
&-um there's a boy in the yard playing with the &+sco &-er &-uh soccer ball . 900160_910090
&-uh he kicks the ball . 912354_914454
and it hits the window and breaks the window . 914599_919539
&-uh the window gets broken and comes through into the house and knocks the [/] &-uh the <lamb [

okay . [+ exc] 982973_983423
&-uh the story starts with the mother telling the young boy that he should take a umbrella . 984336_996306

and the &-uh rain starts to fall . 1015822_1020722
it starts gettin(g) a_lot heavier . 1021777_1024777

&-uh all the women the stepmother and the stepsisters were all &-uh dressed up for the ball . 1480744_1501054
but &-uh &-uh Cinderella was not invited . 1501807_1511597
so ‡ she started to look around or she was reading something . 1513038_1521808

and then at the &-um strike [
and the &-uh coach turned in back into &-uh a pumpkin . 1638749_1646469
so ‡ when she was leaving from &-uh the ball she left [//] lost her &-uh glass slipper . 1647868_1666798
&-uh after they found the glass [/] &-uh glass slipper &-uh a man who worked for the king and the prince went around to try and to see if they could find who &-uh dropped the glass slipper . 1668524_1699264
so ‡ they look . 1706386_1707826
and none of the other woman at the house would fit with the [/] the &-uh slipper until &-uh they found <Cindereed [

and I found that the [//] going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know I'm hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my [/] my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it . 30269_56979
so ‡ that's what I do for you_know my help . 57000_63180

"&-uh I normally in the morning go out get the paper , have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work . 81331_92521"

"I took a couple of aspirin , came in and &-uh had a bowl of cereal for breakfast . 98767_106837"
and &-uh while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper . 107746_111956

and I could not read what was on the newspaper . 113859_117339
I couldn't see a whole paragraph . 117358_119888

so ‡ that's the first thing . 124591_125401
so ‡ <I just> [//] I set the &-uh paper aside and said . 125446_129795

&-uh no problem at all there . 162380_163780
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office . 164162_168132
and I couldn't remember my login . 168604_170234
didn't know how to log in . 171890_173370

on Friday morning I got up . 208666_210796

wasn't making sense to any of my friends . 230306_232256
you_know they [//] the words were correct . 232306_236466

they didn't fit whiff [
"and so I said +""/. 244377_244887"
"+"" there's something wrong there . 245050_246030"
so ‡ I came back home and &-uh had breakfast when I got back from &-uh exercise . 246109_257168
and then I normally would go to work . 257577_260096
but I couldn't go to work . 260113_261024
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to &-uh see my doctor . 261041_268561
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a [//] &+hear heart [//] &+col the &+oncolo &-uh heart doctor . 269678_281428
and she &+s talked me instead to go to the emergency room . 282573_285713
went to the emergency room . 285900_286800
and they discovered that I'd had a stroke . 286824_288724
and so they put me in the hospital . 289595_291065
and &-uh I was there three days . 292649_297409
<they were trying> [//] basically my heart was out_of rhythm and &-uh was beating too fast and lots_of different things . 297427_309547
so ‡ they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized . 309596_316316
and then three more days basically discovering that &-uh I'd had &-uh a stroke and aphasia . 316525_325225
<and &-um then I was> [//] <went home after the> [//] trying to think what day of the week it was . [+ exc] 326225_336755
Wednesday [/] Wednesday I went home . 337188_338918
and &-uh Thursday I <drove back to the> [//] drove then (be)cause I could drive . 341345_349375
I could &+s everything [//] do everything I needed to do except talk &=laughs . 349654_353724
so ‡ I went to make a appointment with the &-uh &-uh speech therapy at that point . 354862_361382
and that's where it started . 362669_364019
well ‡ it started out with something simple because basically I could look at [/] at anything and know what it was . 376255_382415
but I couldn't pull the words out . 382463_384283
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example . 384603_387803
looking around the room . 388221_389291
looking at each object in the room . 389433_391003
naming it . 392239_392879
trying to find the [/] the word and say the word out loud . 393093_396453
you_know so ‡ that's where it first started . 397249_399739
and it built from there . 399784_401644
you_know just [//] and some of the things we &+sa looked at just a few minutes ago you_know like with the pictures . 402366_408836
you_know look at the picture . 409568_410528
name the picture . 410546_411226
and over time that gradually got better and better . 411971_417911
but &-uh that's where I think the start with the therapy was . 418668_424288
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out . 424702_430682
and I found when <writing I> [//] taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldn't spell properly anymore . 432034_442044
and you_know that was something I had to work at . 442892_445402
so ‡ I found that with my &-uh keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil . 446154_453144
and with a notebood [
it [/] it has a spellchecker and a [//] &+spell +//. 459122_462382
&-uh not [//] I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily . [+ exc] 463156_466756
a checker . 466771_467381
<but it starts out> [//] you_know if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work . 467435_478085
so ‡ that sometimes helped a_lot as_well writing . 478417_481617
so ‡ &-uh I've done a_lot_of that . 483336_485176
but it's mainly &-uh &-uh working with <seeing what &+uf> [//] seeing the words and then saying it out loud . 485541_495361
that's done more I think better than anything else . 495689_498679
and I worked hard at it for a long time . 498700_502340
and then <I took [//] got kind_of> [//] &+st afterwards I've kinda gotten a_little slow about it . 502360_509620
or not slow but just haven't done it as diligently as I used to . 509637_517527
but &-uh for the first months after the stroke <I was> [//] I worked hard at it . 518941_528341
trying to pull those pictures back . 528513_530313
and I found that you [//] it's [/] it's like learning in school again grade school . 530417_539027
you look at a word . 539042_540562
and you learn that word . 540585_541515
and [/] and oh that's that word . 541530_544350
and it comes back and stays back . 544366_545686
but with aphasia it doesn't stay there . 545738_547458

and he goes back out . 511453_513933
and has the umbrella to protect him from the rain . 514697_521787
I think that the man tried to climb up in the tree to get the cat . 540725_550945
but the ladder fell down . 555804_560484
and he was not able to get down . 561457_570777

then it goes on and shows that they do not take very good care of her . 942961_954601
the father died . 954983_957333

she had to take care of the horses in the stable and was not being treated very well . 967336_976136

and then they made an announcement in the kingdom that they were going to look for the lady who had the foot that would fit in it . 1159315_1179605
and then the stepmother and the stepdaughters tried . 1180490_1188130
and Cinderella came out . 1188672_1192812
and the glass slipper fit her foot perfectly . 1193294_1199484
and then she married the prince . 1200561_1204631
and they lived happily ever after . 1206767_1210217
I would have two pieces of bread . 1221524_1226604

I think I do very well . 8140_11900
I had my stroke at night probably when I was sleeping . 18372_27562

my husband asked me some questions . 47372_51442

it was a land and tour [//] sea tour trip . 274241_282061
we took an airplane from Singapore . 283391_289711
and we flew to other hotels . 290133_295483
the airplane flew to Tibet . 296595_300375
and we got to see many beautiful temples . 302481_309451
and the people were walking around the temple . 309993_317063
and it was very beautiful . 317948_322498
and I enjoyed going inside the temple . 323233_330293
they had a very big Buddha there who was made all of gold . 331583_344463
and it was an immense amount of gold . 345361_350681
the people burned oil in the temple . 351839_355309
and we had to inhale the smoke . 358103_365093
the [//] visiting the temple was very beautiful . 365495_372745

and they prayed by moving their bodies up and down . 390278_399008
so ‡ I enjoyed watching them . 400162_404122
then we walked along the street . 404979_409249
and we went to various vendors . 409862_416352
and we purchased a silver Buddha and a singing bowl . 417021_428031
and that was rary [
then we went to eyenother [
and it was so tall . 444981_448471
the height of the place was very tall fourteen thousand feet . 449481_456381
and I had altitude sickness . 462321_467931
and I had to have oxygen . 469032_476152
and the &+mpee doctor gave me oxygen at night and the next day . 476866_489746
so ‡ I was glad to leave Tibet after that time . 491032_501282
then I took a boat on the Yangtzi river . 502962_512611
and it was very beautiful . 515227_519938
the boat stopped at different cities along the way . 520726_529216
and we saw many bridges that went across the river . 530180_539840
and I thought that it was interesting . 541822_548782
it looks like a young boy is practicing his kicking . 566504_571234
and he is kicking the soccer ball . 571714_576214
and &+an the soccer ball hits a window . 576658_582928
and it is broken . 583421_586991
and he knocks over a lamp and startles the man who is sitting in the chair . 587184_598314
and the man in the chair gets up . 599124_603584
and he picks up the ball . 603863_606683
and he looks out the window at the boy &-uh maybe wondering where the soccer ball came from . 607259_618889
the mother is trying to get the young boy to accept the umbrella when he's going to go out . 640192_651282
but the young boy says no . 651807_655597
he doesn't need the umbrella . 655839_658059
and he will do without it . 658553_661553
but he gets out . 662384_663724
and he finds that it is raining on him . 664379_670659
and he gets very wet and decides that that is not a good thing . 671217_678187
so ‡ he comes back . 679296_681546

so ‡ the mother gives him an umbrella . 693727_697417

but now he has the umbrella to protect him . 702441_706291
and he can walk in the rain just fine . 706307_711607
a picture of a man who went up the tree to rescue the kitty . 729916_735486

and the girl is crying about the kitty . 752771_757721
and the dog is barking . 758520_761020
it seems as_though the ladder fell out away from the man . 761704_767894
and that's how he got stuck in the tree . 767909_773159
the story of Cinderella begins when [

they treat her very badly and have her cleaning out the fireplaces which is how she got her name Cinderella . 1061591_1073571
