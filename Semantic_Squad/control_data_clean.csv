and that was a once in a lifetime kind of experience
I was with initially five other people

because they they didnt consider it safe
but it was it was a fascinating trip to see
and we paddled in one case past two days of forest
and the smoke we hadta put cloths over our mouths to to
the the paddling itself was not particularly onerous
but we did paddle alot
we paddled nine or ten hours a day
we we averaged about seventy two kilometers a day on on
covered almost fourteen hundred kilometers on the whole
and it surprisingly enough although we were on a
you cant see a half inch into the water
so we hadta find side streams that were clear inorderto get

when I was three years old
I have a very vivid memory of being left with my sister and having
and it was the summer of nineteen forty six
and my sister and I was I were playing
and this young gal wanted me to go to have a nap in the
and I was protesting
and I was so upset
I went into the bedroom waited a few minutes and snuck outof the
I did
well youknow youre Winnipeg was a smaller city
and it was different in nineteen forty six
and I knew the way
I being in the car the kids they pick it up fast
so yes you asked for memory
there it is
okay yesterday I was at home in the morning
because we were entertaining some people that were coming over
we had some some of some of my children came
and with a couple of my grandchildren were two or
and then we had some guests that useta live in Winnipeg
so that was for part of the day til about two oclock
I then walked my grandson of two and a half years of age from
I fear it was a good quite a walk for him
and he did it all
and then I stayed a little at my sisters and my daughters
and then from there I visited my one of my sons
and then we came home
and I basically I watched the
I took my wife to to zumba class at Baycrest village
and then we watched the Gray I watched the Graycomb
that was my day
yeah
in these pictures
well the first one is this kid kicks the ball
and it looks like it breaks a window goes through the window
and then the man thats sitting there picks up the ball and is
one seems to have an umbrella
and shes looking to give it to her daughter
who the daughter takes it
unless she takes it
we cant tell that
starts to rain
doesnt look like the daughter takes it actually
well so up in paragraph three its raining
kids getting wet very wet
kid comes home looks like all wet
mothers not happy
and then the kid takes the umbrella the the umbrella
well theres a man stuck in a tree
and the dog is barking
and the girls trying to get the cat off the tree
and shes got a little tricycle there
and theres a ladder
but bod now on come the fireman I guess to help him
what do you want me to tell you
Cinderella a young girl who lived with an a
and she did all the work around the house
she was treated very badly
and life was pretty harsh for her
so one day an invitation comes sent by the royalty that theres
and ofcourse the prince is gonna be there
and and the the two sisters and the mother are very excited
and they plan out how theyre what theyre gonna wear and
Cinderella wants to go but they make fun of her you see
they say
what if she cant go to this
youre just a nothing
so they ultimately get all dressed up and go to the ball one
and Cinderellas left behind
and then along outof the blue comes this fairy godmother who
and she basically turns all her rags into wonderful clothes
and he
and her both horses suddenly emerge
and shes whisked away to the ball
and shes given a warning that she that before she sets
she says youknow the fairy godmother tells her
you hafta be home by midnight or everythings gonna turn back to
loandbehold she goes to the ball
princess
but nothing woulda struck his fancy
but then he sees Cinderella
and after that its happiness for all of them
theyre just having a great time
then she suddenly realizes its close to midnight
and she rushes down the stairs leaves a slipper behind
and she gets into the chariot and heads home
but shes lost her shoe
and shes back to where she was
and xxx comes
there she is working away still
and then theres an announcement that the prince is trying to
and he still has the shoe
and he wants looks to wants to find the match
anyways he goes around from home to home in all the kingdom
and ofcourse it doesnt work
they ask if anybody else is there
and sure enough the they they they pretend shes not
but ultimately she she gets a crack at it and tries it on
and its a perfect fit
and well he she ends up happily with the prince
there it is
my granddaughter of five could probably do it better
sure

sounds like a ten minute interview
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk
it was important to me to get into law school
that was something that happened that was very important
I have no idea why I was accepted because I dont think I met any
thirty two
I was thirty two when I started
so I guess I was thirty one when I applied
and in my year the median age was twenty two
so I was one of the oldest in the class had nothing in common
Imean they still remembered highschool
who thought about highschool
and they all knew eachother from highschool
and they were there because they didnt get into medical school or
and I was just flummoxed
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came
they were just there because
well I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the
and I was there because I just really cared
and so I really didnt fit in really
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real
up until then I was friendly with people but I didnt understand
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what
ke they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious
why would anybody say the obvious
so people said the obvious
and they were rewarded
so those were the people sought after to be in the study groups
not me
so I did almost everything alone for the entire year
and when I asked to borrow one of my friends notes she said she
so I said
thanks but no thanks
dont bother
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didnt
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it
so that was me
so I was part of that group for some classes
at the end of the year in the subway station I met someone who
but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy
and she was in the other group
so I never saw her
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I
and that was good
ke once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the
and he said
please when you write your exams dont think that your mark is
and I thought
wow it is so amazing to hear something like that
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged
it was in law school that I learned that competentq was a
oh hes a competent lawyer
and that the positive term was brightq
if you werent bright you were nobody
so because he wasnt bright the students didnt respect him
and I made the mistake of saying to someone
youknow yeah okay but hes decent
ke hes a decent person
he has a heart
and she said
a heart
I didnt come to Oz where this one doesnt have a brain and this
I came to law school
didnt talk to her again
UofT
UofT was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada
I dont know why
and I also didnt understand that law schools had their own kind of
but I didnt I didnt know that
I didnt even get it until after I left
so really it wasnt the right school for me
I really should have gone to York
but when I came to Toronto people were saying
oh UofT
its the best school
and why would you wanna be way out at York
youre in Toronto
you wanna be downtown
so I thought
okay I wanna be downtown
so I was downtown
boy kicks the ball
flies into a glass window breaks the window and falls into the
it knocks over the lamp
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see
it looks like hes got his gun in the ck pocket
okay the mother tells the child to take an umbrella
and the child doesnt want one
oh the but in this in the second one the
well oh oh oh oh oh I see
so the mother offers the child the umbrella
the child refuses
the child says
goodbye
goes outside
its raining
its really raining
and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother whos not
well whats happening is that firefighters are rushing
but it looks like what happened is that the little girls cat was
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat
and then he got stuck
and then the firemen are coming to save the man
maybe the cat was chasing the bird
no I think the dog was chasing the cat
am I allowed to make it a xxx
the bane of feminists everywhere Cinderellas story about a
and I dont think we find out how she got to that situation but
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a
she always she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking
and she didnt get to go shopping for new clothes
and she wasnt given the best food to eat
and anyway she was just treated horribly
one day the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an
Cinderella thinking shes a member of the family thinks she can
but she cant
so she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get
and then they go
after they leave shes very disappointed because she really wanted
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her
so she gives her a beautiful dress to wear lovely new shoes and
and the only rule is be back by twelve
so Cinderella went to the ball
she had a wonderful time
nobody knew who she was
everybody was saying
oh whos that woman
whos that woman
the prince danced with her the whole evening
she had a lovely time
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta
so she ran out
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper
following that the prince found the missing slipper
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper
so he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on womens
it didnt fit anybody
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly
and he tried it on their feet
it didnt fit any of them
and he saw Cinderella and said
why dont you try it
or possibly she said
why dont I try it
and he tried it on
and it fit
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after
and she of ofcourse being swept off her feet agreed
that shed just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and
but the book doesnt take you that far
it only takes you to the part where they meet and they fall in
ofcourse

this is in SanDiego California by the way
we found the JP but he was way the heck and gone east of
so we drove out to this little teensy tiny town called Boulevard
and then a few months later we learned that there was actually
so but it was still interesting
not too many people know where Boulevard is
these days Im the cleaner of the house and washer of the
and Im also one of the players with the cats
so we do that
I watch way too much television
spend alotof time on my computer
Im working on a project and reading books
and reading constantly reading books
alright okay
so kid kicks a kicks the football through the window
right
so kids out in the field kicking the ball around by himself
and he accidentally we will assume kicks it through the
and man inside the
and knocks over a lamp breaking the window and and probably
and the guy stands up with the ball in his hand and looks out
and I guess hes going to get prepared to yell at the kid
kid goes off to school
mama says
take your umbrella
and kid says
nah
kids walking to school
gets rained on
he says
oops
so he turns around to go back
shes mad because she offered him
and but then she give him umbrella after all
and he goes to school somewhat wet but with an umbrella
did he learn
oh
the little girls pet cat managed to get up a tree and now cant
but Ive had plenty of cats come down from trees
I dont know what thats all about
the cat mighta been after a bird singing in the tree
so a guy tried to help by climbing up the tree
the dogs barking at the guy
and someone had the presence of mind to call the fire department
so somebody musta called the police
youknow less than half of all fire calls are not for fires but
its a xxx
well bearing in mind that what I know is only the n the
and not the xxx
yeah
so is is it better for me to just say what I think it is
I guess thats the one
yeah thats the one with the three sisters and a problematic
and the sisters two of the sisters were all vain and uppity
youknow the one that made Cinderella do all the work in the house
and they got invited to a ball fancy ball
and so they spent a bunch of money getting ready for the ball
and they went and left her behind
but I dont remember how she got how she got the magic
who gave her the magic stuff
yeah xxx
www
xxx
xxx
xxx invitation
oh the invitations for them
right
okay
I dont remember any of this
how she got her dress
I imagine young girls would remember all of that part of
so she somehow got her hands on a dress and ended up in the
and had she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight
so she wowedv everybody at the party and made her sisters
in fact I think they didnt even recognize who she was
and then when the clock started ringing she ran away eventhough
oh xxx
and she ran away and left behind the slipper because it fell off
a glass slipper xxx it was
and leaped into her carriage
and just as she got home it turned back into a pumpkin
and so the prince tried desperately to find the girl that he he
the the shoe was unusually small by the way
find me the person whose foot fits this
and so he had his lackeys go all over the kingdom fitting it on
and they finally found her
and he ends up marrying her
I cant remember what happens with the stepmother and the two girls
I think she doesnt treat them badly
I think she treats them shockingly well
and she lives happily ever after
does that sound
oh right
okay

okay I was running to my class at the university to my finance
next thing I knew I woke up looked at my wristwatch
it was still on
shockproof by the way
it said eight twenty
and the clock on the wall said five to nine
so I assumed something had happened
yes something had happened
I had two broken legs
and I was in the hospital emergency
I remained there for three and a half months and was able to
and walking down the hall I lost my balance on my crutches
and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again
and then they took me back to bed with a wheelchair
and I got into bed
and the nurse came in
and I said
am I going to the operating room
and she said
yes
and I went to the operating room was put in a body cast from under
and I had to remain in that for another eight weeks
and I finally got outof bed and learned to walk again ofcourse
because you cant walk when youre in bed for that long
I came outof the hospital
my accident was October twelfth
came outta the hospital March twenty ninth
and that night I went to university to write a test
so and then I hafta really learn to walk because I was
and I learned to walk
and now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in MiamiBeach all
and while in the hospital they would bring ambulatory patients to
disregarding that exceptfor going for xrays I was in this room at
but I took the approach that theres nothing when you
move on
and make the best of the situation
so the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy
yeah
well you know theres nothing
Im not not to say
I I walk around
I have pain in my leg
but thats not gonna its gonna be there
so I cant ruin my life with it

and I do
after I flip through the paper I do the Sudoku and the
and I usually get the whole puzzle
and then I will go and check the stock market on the internet
and depending on the day I usually meet somebody either for lunch
but it depends on the day
and I belong to an investment club
so I kindof look if theres anything I think they should know
since Im the accountant in the group that I should be explaining
and then if I went out for lunch I will have dinner at home
or I will go over to former neighbor who lives in a retirement home
and somebody gave her the crossword the jigsaw puzzle from
and shes not capable
shes eighty seven
she cant do it
so I go over there
and my goal is to finish it before I leave for Florida in
so whenever I have a night that Im not doing anything Ill go

well one of the big one of the very important things
that was ke very positive experience
and I was a teenager at the time
and it was a significant change
it was quite a drastic change
and but it was interesting in the sense that it was
it was just a big a big change and a big transition
and it was youknow with all these expectations and and
learning youknow getting used to a whole new culture
not language because I spoke English where I came from
and but just getting used to whole new culture and
ke ke youknow we spoke differently from how we
and and so just getting used to everyone and the culture
it wasnt well one of the one of the things
we drive on the we drove on the left in the other in
its former BritishGuyana
and youknow just getting used to consumerism
that was one of the big shock youknow
we didnt we didnt spend money there like we we did here
ke my parents certainly didnt spend money and buy clothing and
and there was just money that was money thats so
right
it is just a dispensable commodity
and I guess its just like everything else today
especially in the last fifteen twenty years youknow
its like everything has become dispensable
youknow its like you buy a shirt
you wear it a few times
and then you can go get another one because its so inexpensive now
and but theres a premium on education
and thats where I invested my time
and I spent many years in education while while working
I just did it because I felt I could do it
and it was immensely challenging
but I struggled through it
and I was very successful
a typical day a workday
Ill describe a typical workday
Im up at five am
Im just I just got useta getting up really early
and I would have a cup of coffee
and I would brush my teeth and shave and shower
and then I would put on my sweatpants and tshirt
and if its the wintertime Id get on my jacket and winter
and I would go around the block for a walk a couple two
pe especially when its colder you kindof
and so by the time Im Ive done I would go out go out
by then Im sweating
so that gives gives my my it revs up my whole
and thats thats great because it just jumpstarts my whole
and then Ill just undress and cool down and then get
and I dont typically have a morning breakfast
its just something I got used to
and it works really well for me
I I dont consume dairy products because Im lactose intolerant
and so Ill walk to work
its about a twelve minute walk twelve to fifteen minute walk
and then when I get there and I Ill have another half
well maybe almost a full cup but with brown sugar again
and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative
and you check your email and other voicemail and all these
so administration consumes alotof time
and by then its eight oclock
then Im ready to get into my work ke for another half an hour
Im ready to get into my youknow the chargeable work
but its the auditing or accounting or tax work
whatever is whatever I have on my desk or whatever is
and so that will take up consume most of my morning
I tend not to eat or snack in the during the day
I Im Im a little bit disciplined with that
because I used to
and I useta be very
and it didnt work well for me
I was very overweight at one time
and I it didnt work well for me
so I and and then I sit down all day
and so thats that became a problem because I was
so I really hadta get rid of the weight
and it changed it made a huge change
so Im actually a pure pure vegan now
and for the last three years
well a total of five years now but mostly so the last three years
and so lunchtime will come around
and I take my lunch
so I I make my own lunch
and and so Ill have lunch between eleven thirty and
I actually go out for a walk
I always get up and go for a walk get some fresh air and come
not a long walk but a short walk
and then Ill have lunch
and by twelve thirty between twelve thirty or one oclock
but in the middle of the day again you might have some

I guess the one of the earliest memories that I have is
it was a wonderful experience because I was living in a small
and there wasnt the opportunity to partake in any sort of
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports
they had rowing
and they also had arts and handicrafts music theater which I
and so that gave us the opportunity to have a really full
and also what I really enjoyed was the fact that they
we could eat if we wanted
if we didnt feel like eating we didnt hafta eat
there was never anybody saying that youknow you werent allowed
so that was I was in my glory because I would have
and that was enough for me
also we resided in these cabins in the woods
and every morning the counselors would take us swimming before
and it was always really really chilly in the morning
and so this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water
I dont know
I cant remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to
but it was always freezing cold
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake
used to attach themselves to your leg
ofcourse suck on your blood
and that the only way that you could get them off is was if
and then you could pull them off your your leg
and then wed all go back get dressed and then go and have
and in the evenings ofcourse youknow we useta sit around the
everybody used to sing songs and tell stories ghost stories and
and then youknow that would be the end of the day
and it was just it was glorious
I just I loved camp
and arts and crafts was really good
we they always had lotsof materials and somebody who had
and theres painting and things that we useta create with wood
and then Imean I think I was only there for a week
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity
because the days were just so so so full
and then at the end of the week youknow theyd bring in the school
I was living in Montreal at the time
go back to Montreal
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it
and I made such good good friends and people that I really
and once home I kept in contact with alotof the people that
alotof the the girls that I met at the camp
so that was kindof nice
and then I went to youknow every year Id go back to that same
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back
and so you would meet the same people over and over and
so it was it was nice xxx
every year its youknow looking forward to seeing FirstnameE or
and yeah those were those were some really really really
it was just so nice to be away from the city and living in the
mhm
well today today Im here
no usually Ive I retired asof last year
so at the moment Im involved in renovating our house
we havent done anything to the house in the last twenty five years
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by
and being elderly she wasnt able to do any of the housework or
so it was pretty run down when I bought it
and she musta been a real cat lover because there were stray
inside the house the the carpets just reeked of cat urine
the walls were crumbling
the plaster was cracked
there was water damage everywhere
I guess shed left the windows open
and the rain had come in
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck
so anyways we did a little bit of renovations
but we havent done much since then
and that was twenty five years ago
so anyways we hired somebody to youknow put together some
and and hired a contractor
and at the moment whats happening is that the contractor and the
so theyre arguing about everything
the the the the guy who designed the space youknow
thats the way it hasta be
the contractor says is arguing that it cant work that way
if youre gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support
and all this kindof stuff
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera
so Ive been dealing alot with that on a daily basis atleast
so many issues
so many details
youknow and I cant really afford a designer
but I know I should because Im not very good at it
but anyways so just trying to figure out youknow
thats thats the major thing in my mind at the moment
okay
so the young young man is kicking around a soccer ball
the soccer ball breaks a neighbors window goes into the
the neighbor gets up outof his chair to look out the window to see
so it was a theres a mother and her son
and shes telling him
look its probably gonna rain today
you better take your umbrella
and hes there
no no no I dont need my umbrella
Im fine
Im fine
sure enough as the mother had said it starts to rain
and he doesnt have an umbrella
he gets all wet
and he comes home
hes dripping wet
and his mother frowns at him says
look why youknow you shoulda brought your umbrella
so anyways she dries him off and gives him an umbrella
and out he goes into the rain
this one
this man was being chased by a dog
and the only way that he could get away from the dog was by
no no no no no no no
there was a dog who was chasing a cat up a tree
and so this man decided that he would try and get the cat
but then he got stuck up the tree
and they hadta call the fire department to get not only him but the
we start at page one
start
okay
oh
whichever way I you prefer
doesnt matter
okay
poor Cinderella who somehow or another became an orphan and hadta
whereas the two ugly stepsisters laid around in bed did
and they berated poor Cinderella called her names and bullied her
and she was basically their their servant
theres also this prince who lived in the castle closeby who
and theres poor Cinderella working away

and they were all talking about how they were gonna get dressed
and poor Cinderella says

and anyway Cinderella was surrounded by all these friends these
and it was the night of the ball
Cinderellas looking out at the castle and trying on a dress
and the ugly stepsisters learned that she was going
and they tore apart her apart her dress and said she was
and the two sisters and the stepmother went off and left poor
poor Cinderella was crying and weeping because shed really

and it was the fair her Cinderellas fairy godmother who
Cinderella if you really wanna go to the ball Ill give you
and she turned a pumpkin into ke a stagecoach

tiger was clawed by the lion
bad weather was caused by long airplane delays
well it was when I was a kid
and I went with a group of my friends
I think I was maybe about eight or between eight and ten
something like that
and we went down to this local creek
we lived in a small village
and it was about a mile down to the creek
and it was springtime
and we were cautioned not to go down because it was youknow
not a river
it was a creek
well anyhow we boys will be boys
and we defied all odds
and we went down
and we always had ke hammers and nails that we bore from our
so we went down
and we found some logs and some odd boards
and we put together a raft
and we went rafting
and the water was a very free flowing
and it was fantastic
but ofcourse we hit one point
and there was a ice floe
and the raft went sideways
and we all went into the water
so youknow and at that time we wore rubber boots
but they were no help because the water was more ke waist
and we got soaked from the waist down
water went in the boots
and and then we finally made it to shore thankgoodness
otherwise it coulda been more serious
and when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots
but we still had our socks on
and we were wet
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road
and it was like sloshsloshslishslosho youknow
and it was getting colder because when youre wet like that
and we got home
and youknow unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in
where have you been
what happened
so we we got a huge reprimand youknow
so but thankfully we made it home
but because the temperature was dropping our sortof jeans or
they were starting to freeze
so it was like walking walking along like a robot
but we made it home
and everything was fine
but it was sad inthat we got reprimanded
but we were happy when we were doing the youknow the
so we had a good time
and youknow we laughed about it
and youknow we were all chummy
and we walked back
we didnt we didnt think too much of it
but youknow when we got home it was kindof sad
thankyou
typical day I would go for a walk
I would go shopping
I would try to get involved in some local activity
we have community gardens
we have a recreation center on site where I live
so there variety of activities
if its a very hot day I would choose to maybe go downtown to
sometimes its kindof neat to pretend youre a tourist
and the tourists seem to be very polite youknow
up in my neck of the woods where I live right now you say hi to
and they look at you kindof strange like
what do you want
whereas youknow tourists they seem to be friendlier
so Ill go to HarborFront
if Ive got the funds available funds Ill go to the islands
and thats time consuming
but during the week its the best time to go
on weekends you hafta stand in line
and its a
you spend more time travel downtown and going across in the ferry
and
and youknow theres bicycle rentals canoe rentals
theres lots to do
miles of walkways
so yeah I try to keep busy
I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities
otherwise I find youknow doing the same thing its like being a
and you have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day
so its kindof nice to try different activities
I like the youknow variety
yeah
theres no Cinderella in these
okay
looks like the boy is kicking what appears to be a soccer ball
and unfortunately it goes and breaks the window a shuttered
and in number three the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in
the man picks up the ball looks out the window glances it
can I just scan the whole story
okay
see the progression
looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy
he says
no no no no
I dont want the umbrella
its not going to rain
and upon leaving for school with his backpack it appears that the
and then hes looks like hes on his way home or way back with
and stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down
and she doesnt look too happy
and he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again
okay theres alotof action here
looks like theres a girl whos reaching up into a deciduous
theres a tricycle
perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle
theres a man up in a tree
perhaps he was climbing up the tree
and now theres a dog barking up the tree at the man
he looks very perturbed upset because he cant get down
meanwhile firefighters arrive in their truck
two firefighters are running with a ladder to probably in an
and theres oh and theres a bird ng chirping on
okay
its a fairy tale
thats Cinderella
and its about Cinderella and a prince
Cinderella lived with her mean say stepmother who had two
they were not too fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she
and she was made to do all the work
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person
and she lived I believe in the attic
and she would talk to the birds
okay
she was always working
but she would think of youknow how she was made fun of by the
she was overworked
shed bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the
there was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse
Cinderella was always mopping mopping cleaning youknow cooking
Cinderella received a delivery
it was sealed
and the delivery went to the stepmother
stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read
Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited
but as it turned out she was not
so the stepmother denied her that
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the
they were invited to a ball
the prince was having a ball
Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the
in fact she tried on or looked at a dress that she would
she mentioned the dress
and then she looked at pictures of the dress
she was friends with all the
they decided to
so they sewed
and they spun
and they weaved and youknow appliqued the bows on the dress
she didnt know this was happening
she
the birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special
she was so delighted with the dress
meanwhile the stepmother and the two sisters were prancing
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her
I believe that they may have been responsible
she cried
everybody was sad her friends the animals small creatures
the fairy godmother heard her pleas and and her sorrow
and she came and waved her magic wand and turned pumpkin into a
its a sad story
into a magnificent coach for Cinderella
then she was off in the coach with the blessing of the
she arrived at the ball and was greeted at the door by two of the
there she met the prince
but the fairy godmother had brstu
in her haste when she heard the clock dong dong dong she ran off
and behind she left her glass slipper
meanwhile she raced home before the entire dream disappeared in the
and and then she made it back
the dress disappeared
the angry godmother met her
and she was very annoyed at her that she came home so late
meanwhile the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom
they tried
it wouldnt fit
however they finally came upon Cinderella
it fit
they brought her back to the castle

I was very happy when my for when my daughter
and I remember being at the hospital with my wife waiting
we waited overnight
and finally and we didnt know whether the baby was gonna be
so we wanted we were surprised when the baby was
and we were I was there right at the time
and and so then there I knew it was a girl and was
I I like to spend a little time on the computer
and then often I go out to the gym and for some
do workout swim and exercise machines
then come back
and I usually have things to take care of back at the
and and I like to read get out
I like to do sports
sometimes I go I have boats
sometimes I like to go out in the boat on the weekends
and and just basically the things I I needta
and
xxx more than me
okay
well theres a man sitting in his livingroom relaxing
and outside a boy is kicking a soccer ball and accidentally or
and it goes breaks through the window breaks the window
and the man looks out and is wondering where the ball came from and
okay okay
so mothers saying to the boy probably that its gonna rain
and you should take your umbrella with you to school
so he the boy basically says
no I dont need the umbrella
he goes out
and it rains
then he runs back
and his mother basically is xxx
I told you so
and gives him the mbrnlu
he leaves with the umbrella
okay
so theres a a cat for some reason a cat has
then a man tries to come to the rescue climbs up a ladder
and somehow the ladder falls down
and he needs to be rescued
so the so the fire department comes and I guess will try to
sortof yeah
mhm
yeah
mhm
Ill hold this
okay
well I guess this is the story of Cinderella
and yeah Cinderella basically lived with her father
and then Cinderella first then hadta go live with the evil
I dont remember the names but
oh yeah Griselda or something like that and something else
is that supposed to be taped
oh okay
basically okay so a bird came
and I all I remember is sortof that she basically was
and all the young ladies were invited to come to the ball
and Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated
she basically hadta do all the work that the other sisters didnt
so she was never
so she was always being giving job giving job
so she kept just getting more and more jobs to do
and and so so she was never able
the so the the day of the the day of the
and she never had any time to work to to
so the
yeah meanwhile the other two stepsisters were
and so they were all prepared to go to the ball
and then the on the day of I believe
and so the the birds and the mice and all the all
and they were stealing I remember they were stealing ke
and she was discovered that was discovered
and the th stepmother basically gave her more jobs to
and somewhere in the story theres a fairy godmother
yeah so this is her still doing all of these jobs
and yeah so shes all sad and unhappy that she is
and then her fairy godmother appears and waved
and basically the some something gets turned
and I think the mice turn into horse either
and so then then she creates a nice gown
and off she goes to the ball
but she hasta be back by midnight because the spell ends at
and so the sisters ofcourse they see Cinderella there in their
and theyre wondering how she and the ep and the
anyway midnight approaches
the bell the stroke of midnight comes
and she remembers that shes gotta leave by then
and so
oh yeah
in the meantime
I think thats the prince
and thats his father
and anyway he he he n he only wants to dance
and anyway when as as as midnight approaches
and so she in her running out she loses her glass slipper and
but shes ofcourse still missing her one slipper
so the next day the the prince wants to find out
and he knows that he the the lost slipper
so he announces to all of his subjects that hes
and so he he come he goes throughout the village
he n eventually comes to to their u their
and its ofcourse its not gonna fit on the evil sisters
and he finds that it does fit Cinderella
but I think in their anger the sisters grabbed the slipper and they
but he sees that it fit her
and they live happily ever after and yada yada

I have three other sibs

he waved his mother goodbye
he got outside
it started to rain
it was rainy
he was walking in the puddles
he finally went home drenched to his mother
and the next day he went out with an umbrella

I guess thats his her father
the the ladder fell down
somebody called the fire department to get the guy and the cat

and Im pretty sure I got the right story

and to do that he needed to see if she could wear the shoe
and the prince came along

this boy was kicking the soccer ball around
he hit a hit a neighbors window and smashed it
the neighbor was sitting in his living room as the soccer
the neighbor looked out with the ball in his hand accusingly
the mother was just lecturing her son about the need to
the son reassured her that he didnt need one
then it started to rain
it started to rain even harder
so he came home all wet
and the next time he went out he brought an umbrella
becauseof two emergencies the the fire department was
this the girls cat ended up climbing a tree and was
and in the same tree there was this man who climbed up it
and someone probably the girl brought a ladder
but for whatever reason it didnt reach either cat or the man
so the fire department hadta come with a larger one
okay
Cinderella was an orphan girl who lived with her
at one point the handsome prince arrived in the house
and the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball with him and so
but Cinderella made a wish
she wished for a carriage
but whoever granted her the wish I dont really remember
so Cinderella and the prince went to the ball
ofcourse Cinderella was concerned about the time
but at one point the prince had ke a glass slipper
and there was some sort of prophecy that it would fit
and it turns out that it fits Cinderella
so somehow they got home before the carriage turned into a
and they got married

so I remember it was a day kindof like this but not so rainy
and it was my first trip to HongKong
and I was on a work trip
and I was tired because Id flown all night and everything
and but I decided I was gonna go out sightseeing
and I did go out
and I went to the top of the peak in HongKong
and I looked around at the vista and saw the beautiful landscapes
and I remember saying
thankyou Manulife
because that was the company I worked for at the time
that I wouldnt have been there had it not been for that work
so I felt a great deal of gratefulness and happiness although I
oh Im not sure there is such a thing as a typical day
but get up in the morning and have a shower and get ready for
and then usually my husband and I have breakfast together
and we figure out whos doing what during the day
and for example this morning
one of my hobbies is I grow orchids
so this morning at the breakfast table we were surrounded by all
and it was youknow a miserable dull day outside
but inside it was bright and very pretty
so after we discuss whos doing what whos doing what
I might have a study to go to
call people who are not well and see how theyre doing
and prepare a meal for the evening
maybe some housework that needs to be done
and then in the evening I have a lecture to go to
so thats kindof a typical
if there is such a thing
Im tired at the end of the day

the dog chased the cat up the tree
the bird was caught by the worm
would you like to star in a movie
books like to read children
icecream tastes good in the summer
beautiful flowers smelled the lovely woman
count to ten as fast as you can
the man saw the boy that the dog chased
tell me the name of the person next door
how many are in a dozen
the tiger was clawed by the lion
bad weather was caused by long airplane delays
havent had that many
but when I was I guess around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader
and I was in practice
and I was doing
which I cant believe I did
but headstands and head back flips
and doing a flip I fell
I tripped
and I came down
and I broke my arm
so I remember that instance
I remember it quite clearly being driven
it was a CYO thing
so I remember being driven in in the car by the priest and the my my other friends around me and going to the hospital and and having my arm taken care of and having surgery
so
I was in a cast
you hafta remember it was a long time ago
so I was in a cast
and I was in a cast for a long time
I do remember my father making me slings that were the holidays
so because it went through many holidays
and and then once it was youknow once it
I went back to being a cheerleader again
its alittle misshapen
but its fine
so I no longer do back flips to say the least
well my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight
well the problems were that he could not communicate
right after his stroke he really had no language at all
so the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and and has continued at this clinic
and this is almost four years later since his stroke
so Ive seen the development of the speech patterns emerging
and what I have seen is him is him recapture language
I I think very similar to what I see in a child
so in moving in in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see
okay
well I guess the thing that always stays with me right now is my husbands stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident
and and I remember asking the question
is he alive
and it was such a strange question
but I needed an answer to it
and they said on the other on the the other side of the phone they didnt know
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and and getting out there
and I remember hearing the sirens as I was as I was approaching
and when I got there youknow he had already been in a he had already been out
he didnt know who I was
and he didnt know who anyone was
but luckily and but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him
so they knew that he wasnt drunk
they knew that he wasnt impaired in any other way
and he knew enough to know that he was he had a stroke
and I remember he was the one who said to me
get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to
and I remember this police officer
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him when Anthony was on the force
so he came in as a as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant
and so youknow I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing youknow in that it was very much like a like a movie or youknow
but and I remember getting down into the into the brain attack center
and everybody was doing what they needed to do
and it was all this kindof prescribed dance that went on
and youknow getting him there and and getting him that shot and and that starting
and and youknow and then from there it was just the recovery
it was the day in day out routine
but I do remember that
that stays with me
yeah it does absolutely
okay
well a boy is outside
and hes playing looks like soccer
so hes kicking the ball
and loandbehold it goes into the neighbors or his own window and crashes through that window
and theres the the man whos sitting and either watching tv or talking or having a conversation
and the soccer ball comes through the window hits the lamp
and the gentleman inside is really quite surprised
he then has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man
and the mother is saying to him
take this umbrella because I think its going to rain
and hes saying
no no no I dont need that umbrella
Im leaving
so shes got the umbrella in hand
and hes out the door
and then sp loandbehold the rain starts
and he is caught in the rain
and he is really wet
and he makes his way home
and his mother is looking at him saying
I told you so
and lets get the umbrella
and then you can go back out
well its a series of circumstances
and the little girls cat is in the tree
she was looks like she was riding her bike
and she was she saw her cat up in the tree
she could have called her dad
and her dad said
okay Im going to help you and go get the cat
and took the ladder
and it doesnt seem like the ladder is quite as as high as what he needed to
so anyway the
no Im sorry
then it looks like he used the ladder
and the ladder has fallen
and he is stuck in the tree
and the dog is barking because they are all up in the tree
and the firemen hafta come and rescue
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house
and there was a stepmother
and the stepmother had two daughters
the father dies
and the daughters the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they so to speak
so Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and and all of that
and then the the the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella
and then comes the the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the for there to be a dance
and everybody is all is all youknow looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the the perfect outfit
and and Cinderella is not going to go to the ball
and she is at home
and and and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot
so they find I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the in a in a hope chest or I guess what I would call now a hope chest
and so that becomes
I dont wait a minute
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing
so the sisters go to the ball
and and poor Cinderella is home with her mice
and and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe
so the fairy godmother creates the the carriage to take her in
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect
and and her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball
so when when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there
and everyone is just
takes her breath away and she takes their breath away
and she meets the prince
and they dance
and they have a wonderful time
but what happens is the clock strikes twelve
and she needs to be home
and she is running out the door
and her slipper is her shoe is left behind
so she goes home
the sisters and whatnot they all go home
and and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper
and he combs through the village
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers
and it doesnt work
and then loandbehold he finds Cinderella
and the shoe fits
they get married
and they live happily ever after
the end the end
and way too many girls are looking for Princecharming
but thats a whole other issue yes
I would get the bread

I will tell you about a cheerleading accident
and I broke my arm
and I was in I believe it was sophomore it was my sophomore year in highschool
and I was in the gymnasium
and we were practicing
and I did a back flip
and I came down on my arm
and I remember hearing it crack
it was CYO so it was it was not ke in a public school
and I remember the some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital
and I remember that I was in the hospital for almost a week
Id never really been sick and have since really been sick
but so I I remember being in a cast for quite a long time
and and and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long
I had a Christmas sling and a and whatnot
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling
but I can now tell the weather
oh well I was I was fourteen years old
your body just gets better
I I there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that
it was going back I never went back to the squad
I tried to do twirling
and I just couldnt do the hand motions
and so I never went back to that
so
besides my husband
well after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him and realizing that he needed time for processing and and sortof understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them
so that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability
so he he was able to do that
so after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sortof a little bit of self teaching and and and giving him time to find his words and and thinking of the process as as as a child learns speech again
so I tried to educate myself on on how children learn language
and then from that he sortof followed that same process but only speeding it up
so he had the foundation there so
but mostly just giving him time
happy sad

in the summers we would go to the beach
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins

and there is a gentleman thats sitting maybe watching tv
I dont see a newspaper so hes watching some tv
and the window
he gets up to see who it is
and you kindof wonder did the boy run away or is the boy still there
I guess the mother heard the weather report because she had an umbrella in hand as the as the little boy is walking out the door
but he I guess took a look outside and said
no youknow I dont see any I dont see any rain so I dont wanna take a an umbrella
so he says goodbye to his mom
and hes walking out the door
and then maybe he gets a couple steps
and here comes the rain
and hes like

so he gets in the door
and his mother is looking at him and saying
I told you it was going to rain

I I found that to be more therapeutic than being home sleeping
youknow I I slept at night
but Id but Id rather come to work and work
so soon as I had the radiation I came to work and worked a whole day and went home and collapsed and youknow
but that to me was more therapeutic than anything just to keep going
do I have a difficult time
well I guess I I should say yeah
I guess through illness and ke my grandson is not he doesnt speak English yet
hes hes only one and a half years old
so youknow like he doesnt he but we communicate in a different form
so I guess you youknow you understand what theyre trying to say eventually
youknow theyll theyll make a point of telling you somehow
youknow you figure it out
some form of sign language if anything
that youknow
well we have our own little sign language right now
ke I dont know why but everytime he sees me he goes
ah
and thats thats the grandmother does this I guess youknow

he and then right away it means getting a cookie out of the drawer
ke youknow so he knows he understands ke Im the one that gives him the cookies all the time
so youknow but its fun
and yeah I guess youknow and in the you want youknow when he wants his a sip of water
youknow theres different just like with any child youknow theres different ways that they they present themselves that they they let you know that they want their lunch
and they start laughing when you show them the right thing youknow
its its its a rewarding experience when you finally get it right youknow
something important
I guess the most important thing I can remember is when my children were born
that was the most the best day of my life on both occasions like giving birth and and holding them in my arms and and what a miracle it was youknow
that that was an amazing experience
I dont think theres anything that comes close to that ke outof everything Ive ever done
but the I guess and the day I got married
that was youknow ke different events I guess that were were important youknow
but I guess the the most important ones were the day day the days I gave birth
those I had a son and a daughter first and then a son two years later

I dont know if hes a relative or he knows him even

and I would put peanut butter on smear peanut butter on the one slice and jelly on the other the other half
and then put them together
and cut it in half
and serve it
well the illness would have the big one I guess would have been breast cancer
and I had that in two thousand and five
I had an ec lumpectomy in October
and then they didnt get it all

and they didnt get it all
and it was my last chance inorderto save my breast
I had I had one more in February of two thousand and six
and that one worked
that was that was good so
it I remember recuperating was a long process
I also had radiation
and it made me tired
but I worked I worked every day
I didnt miss any work
still came to work
it was therapeutic to come to work just to because if I was home I would go nuts thinking about stuff

youknow and and luckily all is well yet youknow
so thats a
but its it was a long haul at the time

youknow it looks like its gonna rain
you better take the umbrella
and he says
mom I dont need the umbrella
its not gonna rain
Im not gonna need it
and he leaves to go
and allofasudden it starts raining
and it starts raining raining
he gets drenched
and he hasta turn around and go back and tell his mom
you were right
its raining
and I need the umbrella
and he gets the umbrella and goes off to school
thats moms always know
well it looks like I think there was a cat that was being chased by a dog up the tree
and the little girl it was her cat
and shes she wants her cat to get down from the tree
and so I imagine its her father that decides to climb up the tree
but he gets stuck up the tree
he cant get down
and finally somebody called the fire department to come rescue all of them
they the father and the cat were stuck up the tree
so they the fire department came through again
so its a story about a daughter and her father
and her mother dies
and her father remarries
and the woman he r marries has two daughters
who the the stepmother thinks her daughters are beautiful magnificent and es doesnt want Cinderella to get any anything once the father passes away
ke makes Cinderella do all the work
and her she wants Cinderella to be her servant and and clean the house
and theres this handsome prince that lives in town
and the princes father the king decides its time for his daughter
and he sends a notice out to everyone in town all the women that are eligible to come and to a ball to dress up and come to this ball
and Cinderella wants to go
and the she gets her dress
I think it was her mothers dress if I remember correctly
and shes gonna wear that
and the sisters find her trying it on
and they they rip it on her and make a mess of the dress
and so she cant go to the ball in that dress
and off the s the the stepsisters go to the ball
and the fairy godmother comes and helps Cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up
and she looked just gorgeous
and sends her off to the ball with a coach and a coachman
and goes to the ball with glass slippers
and dances with the prince
and the prince falls in love
and the only one thing was that she hadta be leave the ball by twelve oclock on the strike of twelve
she hadta get outof there or she was gonna turn back into her rag clothes again
so she was having a wonderful time
and she hasta leave the ball when the when the clock starts striking twelve
and she loses one of her glass slippers
and the prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this glass slipper
and finally they they they werent gonna try Cinderella because she they nobody thought she was at the ball
but they finally try her foot in the slipper
and it fits perfectly
and she turns back into this gorgeous gown and clothing again
and and the prince marries her
and they live happily ever after
okay
to make a sandwich if Im gonna make a whole sandwich I would use two pieces of bread
and smear the peanut butter on one half and the jelly on the other half of bread
and then put them together
and cut it in half or fours whatever way you like it
and eat it
you mean in terms of how I felt or what happened
I was I was thrown off of a horse once which was was quite traumatic
and the horse reared up and seemingly simultaneously kicked back
and I was thrown in the air and tumbled pretty much head over heels in front of the horse
and I was out with a group of horses riding along a beach
and the the rest of them were behind me and just went galloping over me
and it it was that was really scary
I I love horses
I love all animals
but I never went horseback riding again
it was serious and I ended up with a serious back injury
it didnt manifest right away which I found out in my travels through the osteopathic world that they oftentimes dont
sometimes years can go by before you realize that theres been a disc injury or anything like that which is why most people dont connect it with an accident
sometimes youknow great a great deal of time could go by years
and suddenly they arent saying
oh I remember I fell off that horse five years ago
youknow theyre thinking what happened to me yesterday or last week so
but that was traumatic
noone trampled me but it it
yeah and the the terror of watching them youknow running over me
it was pretty bad
yeah yeah no it was very scary
my back
oh yeah
when it first went out so to speak I ended up seeing an orthopedic surgeon
didnt want surgery
totally against it
was lucky enough to find an osteopath who
hes not a chiropractor but they do manipulations
and Ive met people who have had surgery
and Im doing way better than them
Ive had about three rounds of physical therapy
and I also began doing weight work to strengthen my upper body
there was a time where I could youknow be taking a gallon of milk or a half gallon of milk outof the dairy case
and it would go right to my fifth lumbar
so now my my biceps and shoulders have been strengthened with regular weight work
so there are things you can do youknow
and Im doing better than many people
the disc was cracked
so but surgery never seems to be a solution
no
no
I understand how to lift and bend
and I just strengthened myself
mhm
not really
Imean from time to time in our day to day youll encounter people but never youknow a for a sustained period of time or did I ever work with any person like that
oh yes
no it usually goes pretty well
ERROR
well maybe more than a few words in some languages
and they tend to know a little bit of English
I remember I was I was in Frankfurt once by myself and I ended up going to a pub
I dont think they called them that in Germany
but anyway I had a wonderful time talking to people
I dont speak German
and alotof Germans do have some youknow language recognition in terms of English
but I tend to get along okay
there are way other ways than words to communicate
and its fun
when my daughter was born
favorite day of my life well the worst and the best
I had I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell
and it was just it had no ke youknow that old song what a difference a day makes
Imean from the pregnancy which was just wonderful
I ate everything I wanted
I felt terrific
I was working full time
my freezer looked like an Oreida convention
I could eat my youknow my crinkle cuts my shoe strings with pasta
I could do anything
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say
my my my obstetrician youknow during the the buildup to this would say youll be sorry
and I said youknow I cannot imagine regretting this
youknow Im eating Im making ice cream sandwiches with the the the the
its two pieces of pound cake youknow with the HagenDazs in in the middle
so then I get to the hospital
and it was really nasty
it was really it was probably the worst experience I ever had
I was told that if I had automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward
thats what I was told
and I did it did spark revenge in me that I actually carried out
youknow my my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook
he said
well were just going to break your water
itll move things along
I said
no
dont
step back
step back
just leave me alone
I can do this myself youknow
and then he kept saying
relax
I dont understand while youre not relaxed
and this is psychological Im sure
every time he said relax I became even more infuriated
youknow this is the effect it had on me
and he wasnt listening when I said stop saying that
when you tell some one to stop doing X you expect them to stop doing that
so anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful
she was born smiling right away recognized my voice
it was just the the most special experience of my whole life
and so now I went for my first postpartum checkup
and Im sitting on the table
and he youknow does the finger pricks and to get some blood out
and he turns around
and he puts the little tube in the machine
and then he turns it on
and the machine is whirring
and I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock
it happened really fast
and I threw him on to the table
and then I jumped on top of him put my knee in his groin
and I was
his glasses were askew
and he his tie was crooked
and I said
relax
relax
I dont understand why youre not relaxed
whats the matter youknow
it was such a calamity
and although youknow it was all in good fun because later on youknow he
and his wife useta work in his office
and they had a nurse too
and they said
selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives
its really selfish on I on our part
so that was it
thats it Keli
that was a big big experience youknow PeeWees big adventure
well it seems theres a boy out playing
kicks the soccer ball
unfortunately it goes right into the window breaks it
Im gonna guess thats his father sitting there
now he gets the ball
and hes looking at the surveying the damage and his son I guess
and it doesnt doesnt look like its going to end too too well
might be a problem
okay well heres this little child I guess leaving for school
mother saying
take your umbrella
child says
no no I dont need an umbrella
very optimistic
I do the same thing
now its raining
and now its pouring
and then the child comes home youknow obviously soaking wet
the mother is kindof in her Itoldyousoqadj mode
and the little the little boy I guess it is he learned a lesson
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella
life is learning from ones mistakes
listen to your mother
well the cats up in the tree
they get stuck in trees I guess
Ive Ive heard stories like that
I guess its the the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like shes ready to catch the cat
the little dog ofcourse wants the cat down for different reasons
and then the fire department shows up
which theyre good like that
they got the ladder
and all is well
so Cinderella is sent to live with this with a family
and she is basically a a maid
and they there are the two epsis the two
I think its the wicked stepsisters if I recall
and they were they were rather homely
and Cinderella ofcourse was very pretty
and shes very youknow sweet and helpful
and these two are kindof spoiled and youknow not very pleasant
and theres going to be a ball
and I I believe invitations go out
and the two sisters are going to theyre going to go to the ball
and Cinderella is not invited
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in
and Cinderella ends up with
well its all magical youknow right
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach
and by dint of youknow luck and good favor from the fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight
so shes dancing with the prince having a wonderful time
the other two sisters I I forgot where
they just kindof melted into the background
they werent very popular
I could have told you that from the beginning youknow
but anyhow Cinderella finds out what time it is
and she needs to leave youknow to get into the the the carriage to go back before midnight
and she her slipper fill
and the prince finds it
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that youknow he wants to find this this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper
I remember the details now from my own picture book
put it on
when when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet
and the slipper was ke even half not even half the size of her foot
so anyway they locked Cinderella up
I think nobody wanted them to find her
and the mice helped
they brought the key
and the mice she youknow the animals loved her
they were her friends
and ofcourse it all ends happily ever after
she does it does it is discovered that the slipper fits her
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince
just the way we all live
its exactly what my experience has been
its the same thing
its like they its like they met me
and they ali youknow they they it was the youknow really it was like they knew me
its so uncanny
alright well first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture
now when I make a sandwich
and its not just with peanut butter and jelly
I I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up youknow
its got to be just right
so anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter
again two slices of bread is nice but for this well put the peanut butter on first with a knife
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around
and it it just works better than with the knife
and thats it
youknow in this case you could cut it in half fold it in half get another piece
youknow if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle youknow like that
and thats it
I like a good smdu
oh gee
actually I fainted once
and thats a terrible feeling
and I guess youknow I guess we could compare that to a a stroke in the sense that its a sudden onset
and you do have a a short window if its the same as a stroke
there in my case theres a short window of realizing something is really wrong
and you do have time to to be cognizant of being in big trouble
infact I remember one time I I I fainted
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house
and that was I was really afraid of of the fact that I was in a hard tile room
and my daughter was downstairs
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight
and I just in a panic I said
Dolly call nineoneone
so I knew I was in trouble
and I I then I I was able to just slowly go down myself
and then I went outof the picture
and the paramedics did take me to the hospital
and I had food poisoning
and when I got
now that was really frightening as youknow they theyre racing me through the the er
theyre asking me youknow all sorts of information
and and the pocketbook disappears
and then youknow testing and monitors and all that
and they said
youknow your potassium level is in the basement
so it was really a
and youknow you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either youknow in the hospital or even dying
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to those sortof sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly
so it was truly an emergency situation
so and my daughter as young as she was youknow I credit Natalie with youknow the fact that it wasnt worse
that she she just listened to me and didnt question it and dialed nineoneone
yeah so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice I think
right
and thats probably as scary just like that
yeah yeah
I was in the hospital for the night
and they gave me a liquid potassium
and then in ivs
and then I left the hospital with
well before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions youknow to to call
but it was liquid potassium and ivs for many hours
and they were monitoring me and youknow taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that
so but youknow I was out youknow by the next morning
but still
I felt really weak and tired
Imean you needed to recover
the the the rest of that day was really kindof not on the map youknow
but Imean I I just felt really really tired
and wiped out maybe is better
tired tired doesnt capture it
youknow it was scary
youknow when you see these stories right
you you hear them
somebody died
ke how do they die
right right
it can be serious
and I had been doing a good deed that day
I was at the YogiBerra stadium
at the time and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation
and I was at the YogiBerra stadium working an event
it was family day
and they had I had some chicken
and thats thats what did me in
trying to do a good thing right
they almost killed me
yes
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it
a very dear friend of mine was was had cancer and was dying
youknow she was at that youknow close point
and she I guess it was the liver starting to shut down
youknow the again the organs the the kidney and liver especially the liver
and she was incoherent
and she was speaking to me
this was a very strange experience
she was speaking to me
but I couldnt understand a single word that she said
and it was just gibberish
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way
and she would it would be frustrating for her that I wasnt understanding what she said
and it sounded like words too
but it wasnt
and I spoke with the the nurse who was caring for her
she was at home
and I was told that when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of youknow the medical sequence of events
but but that thats very frustrating to be
and I could see the frustration on her face
and then I feel badly
and I feel frustrated too because I I really wanna understand and and cant
well you could only have simple communications at that point sortof like point to things
and then I would I would I would tell her at different ver intervals
I cannot understand what youre saying
and she would feel even worse
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was saying words
I I realized that pretty pretty quickly
she she thought she was youknow saying things
so I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or just pretend sometimes I even understood
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever
youknow then she would it would be pretty clear Im not coming with the water
but that that thats very frightening
and and its frustrating for everyone
youre imprisoned in your own body in a way arent you
yeah that hasta be a hell
""
something important
I guess alotof important things sortof happened youknow
be hard to
I think I think in a sense I made my own important things
for instance I grew up in a family
I was one of five children
and now I dont want this to sound youknow politically incorrect but my father was Italian of Italian descent
and he had this mind set that girls just dont go to college
and unfortunately four of us were girls
so he didnt that wasnt a
he wasnt pleased with that either I dont think
and I was the third one
can you imagine
in a row
no boys yet
so anyhow it was made very clear that college was not on the map
and his his his idea was that
Ive been supporting you all these years
and now you owe me
youknow you hafta go to work and contribute to the household
so this was a builtin thing
at the time I wasnt realizing how grave it was
infact there was something that felt almost exciting about it
that Ill be going to work soon youknow
and the good news was that I was also an honor student
and I got to highschool at twelve
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete
and now I was going to work
so my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasnt going to college because I was an honor student
she actually wanted to call him
and I was very calm about the whole thing
I said
theres really no point
youknow its youre not going to get anywhere
this is the state of things
its the state of the art at the Lastname household
and thats that
so anyway she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on WallStreet and who worked at a personnel department at what was then the IrvingTrustCompany which no longer exists
and they took great pride in that that company
they they were at one WallStreet
and they considered themselves at the top of WallStreet
and this was verbalized
so anyway she called her friend
and Ill never forget her
her name was FirstnameLastname who I went to see
so I I put a suit on went shopping and bought myself youknow a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview
and I think I was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her
and so she hired me
and I ended up in a subbasement
not just a basement
it was a subbasement
I think I was lower than the vaults
in a secretarial pool where else
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool
I did
and good good on me
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to
eventhough I had an academic course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study
and I and I I took typing and stenography
I thought this might help me
and maybe my job wont be so random
I have atleast a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up youknow
so I end up in a secretarial pool
and they banks are notoriously very frugal
and back then the things were even worse
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization
and I I I preface that because they didnt tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because theres a fee involved
so if somebody youknow in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches youknow where I was
so I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in
it was sortof like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at being at any orphanage where a call comes in
and they pick you
so they a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust department on the twelfth floor
he was a a a senior vice president of the bank
his secretary was unexpectedly out
and they needed a fillin
so they selected me
and up I went
and I walked in
and you could hear a pin drop in this place
I could tell it was going to be
I didnt know how I was going to generate any level of youknow lightheartedness
you youknow it it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water
and you should genuflect youknow before you to sit down at your desk
so there I am
and it turned out that his secretary
Ill fast forward alittle
so here I was
youknow my skills were good
Im answering the phone
Im taking shorthand letters
things are getting things are humming along
everything is great
and it turns out that she the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back
she was pregnant and was having some difficulties some complications so the the absence was going to be long term
and they hired me
so now and I had a raise right away
I thought this work life is a cinch
Im here for a week and I got a raise
I got outof the subbasement youknow
Im in the light of day
things were youknow ke things were moving along so quickly that I I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on WallStreet youknow
it was the trajectory I was on
so one day I was there I was there for about three months I guess
and I was out to lunch still trying to youknow explore the area
its a very exciting place youknow
WallStreet
and I found the NewYork StockExchange
and I youknow I was m sortof like a pseudo tourist
so I was walking up Broadway one day
and I encounter the MarineMidlandBank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving
it just youknow it was a great place light and airy modern
I went in
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was
so I was directed there
I sat down filled out an application
and I was drunk with power by then youknow because I had gotten the raise
things were moving so quickly
so I filled out the application
the interview with the personnel manager went very well
she told me about three different types of positions I could have
and visited all three of them
and I could pick whichever one I wanted
so I picked the one in the international department
that sounded really interesting to me
and was working for an executive there
and it was just a wonderful environment
and I was in the LatinAmerican division
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and Chile
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when there was the coupdetat in Chile when SalvadorAllende was
and we had lots of money
we we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the LatinAmerican area
so those were those were some pretty exciting times
and I then I was there for a few years
and my direct boss who was the he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor
so ofcourse youknow how romance always wins out
I had a boyfriend
I didnt wanna move to Paris
and many people probably would have said Paris youknow
and ke it would have been
I look back
I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didnt work out either
but thats okay
so I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was alittle more fast moving and exciting
I I figured this is a good youknow juncture to get outof banking
it seemed very staid no matter where you were
so I I I got a an agent
I had youknow kindof felt my way around youknow how things work down on the street by then
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms
so to fast forward
hope that wasnt too long a story
then I I I I had my daughter
I was a stayathome mom
and the college thing was always on my mind
so I applied to MontclairState
and and I was accepted
I came in at the time was a second career program
and the important thing was that I did it
I got my degree
and I graduated summacumlaude
and I had marvelous experiences
and plus I was a day student
and that was another thing for me
I realized that I could still kindof live the life I might have
when I mention a day student its because I was a young always among young mainstream students
and I thought
gee maybe Ill be sortof ostracized from main society here
but I wasnt
and they liked me
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience
so I got the degree anyway
and here I am
yeah
youre welcome
yeah this is that same disaster that we had last week
disastro
the boy is outside having fun youknow kicking around the soccer ball
and crash
it goes right through the window
looks like his father
knocks the lamp over too I see
the father was happen happened to be sitting in the chair
and he gets up
and hes got the ball in his hand
he looks out the window
and seems like the boy is going to have a bad evening
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that
funny he was just sitting there
you dont even see a newspaper or something youknow
he was just sitting there ke waiting for disaster to strike
well we have what looks to be a mother and her child
its funny
my first impression is a girl a little girl
but in other pictures I dont know
I think its a little boy
maybe its sposta be r generic
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella
child says no
youknow that that whole idea is rejected
mother offers the umbrella again
no bye
uhoh outside started to rain
now its pouring
child comes in soaked
the mother is standing there with that youknow Itoldyousoqadj attitude and and kindof annoyed I guess
but thats what mothers do youknow
you wanna protect your child
and the child they dont like the idea
they think youre mean and difficult
you just dont want your child to fall down and skin their knee
you dont want them to get wet
you dont want anything to happen to this child
I know thats how I was
and so now its another rainy day
or later maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella
learned a lesson
listen to the mother
and youknow so maybe a lesson learned for the future
that maybe mommy youknow isnt that bad after all
trying to protect me
well we have a cat emergency here
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like
and I guess the father or maybe some well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder
got up in the tree
hes stuck up there too now
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to get the cat
and now I see the fire department is on the scene
and theyre going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after
well for reasons that werent entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a being a maid working for this family
and it was a mother and her two daughters
they were just very shrill and very unattractive young women
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and just just very nice
these two were were very spoiled and and didnt have any appreciation for anything
Imean Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard youknow animals loved her
the horse the whoever was out there
mice even youknow
she was a delight
anyway theres a a an an announcement comes to the unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their their their mcmansion I guess where they live
they werent in a castle
they got an invitation to to a ball
the prince was going to give a ball
and Cinderella useta she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance
and so when news came of this ball she was also silently very excited about it
but the two girls youknow ofcourse they were going
they had an invitation
and somehow I forget some of the details in between
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up youknow helping working some magic
and Cinderella does go to the ball
ke a pumpkin that that that what was that gets turned into a a a carriage and with horses
and shes got a beautiful gown on
and she just looks really just beautiful
and she the prince ofcourse youknow sees her right away
and youknow one of those across the crowded room
and they danced all night
and it was very romantic
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the that or whoever or that they were
was that the stepsisters or was that another story
the wicked stepsisters I dont know
anyhow those horrible faces like
so anyway the the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight
and you see the the the clock is is striking twelve
and shes saying goodbye to the prince
and ofcourse he doesnt wanna let her to leave
and shes late
shes running down this youknow a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe
one of her glass slippers
and the butler or whoever majordomo from the the palace was sent around youknow to the town to find who fits into the shoe
and Cinderella gets locked up
youknow the mother the that horrible mother thought that youknow theyd cram the shoe on one of her daughters feet
and I remember their feet were ugly too
and the mice end up getting
oh she was locked in this room youknow
they didnt want her on the scene
and the mice brought her the key
she got out and tried on the shoe
ofcourse it fit perfectly
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after
one hopes
and I hope they werent the bridesmaids at the wedding those those horrible people
okay
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here
otherwise its an open face
they dont call it a sandwich right
so be nice
well were pretend we have two pieces of bread
and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly
and just gently spread that on
close it up maybe cut it in half
because I love smdzu
but I dont like a bite of the crust first
on a peanut butter its
so thats why I
yeah and I like to cut it ke on the diagonal
hasta be a particular way youknow
yes I had in in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor
and he told me that if as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen
and two days later it ruptured
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm
and fortunately it was he needed do surgery
but after that I was fine
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain Ive ever experienced
so thats the first thing that came to mind
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically
and it could not be
so it was full blown surgery
and I remember being I was obviously much younger
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience
and I hadta go very slowly
and I was outof work for a long time which is what I remember the most
and then little by little I just got my strength back until
I had the the privilege of working with a hippotherapy organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who worked with children with multiple sclerosis and and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would would elicit your sympathy
and you just sortof hadta tell them to youknow to to buck up and do it
but it was very it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that
and now ofcourse here Im doing that in in in a much broader spectrum
there are several
let me think what would be a good story
well very recently two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country
and since we didnt have complete leisure time we v divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every major league un major league stadium in the country
and in two thousand twelve we completed that
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in in thirty cities
yeah and it was absolutely wonderful
and then ofcourse they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami
so on Memorialday weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there
and in August well be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there
so when we hear if you build it they will come we think its meant for us and that were going to go see baseball games
and eventhough I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that wed never seen or never would have seen
and it was just the the the best six years the best time I can I can recall
and we love to talk about it
yep
okay theres a young boy kicking a soccer ball
he doesnt know his own strength so he kicks it r very far and very hard
and it breaks the window
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked
oh thats the ball
Im sorry
hes holding the ball
and hes looking out the window to see who kicked the ball
okay a little boy is leaving for school
and his mother obviously thinks its going to rain or knows its going to rain offers him the umbrella
and he says
no mom I dont need it
see ya
Im leaving without the umbrella
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder
and he gets really really wet
so he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry
and hes hes happier at the end
okay the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree
a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure
and now the man is stuck in the tree aswell
and the fi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat outof the tree
okay Cinderella is a story about a little girl who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled
and she is not treated as an equal
she is treated as a real stepchild
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders outof the fire
and she grows up in that role where her her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry
and the invitation comes
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball
and Cinderella thinks she wont go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball
noone knows who she is
and part of that is the glass slippers
she has her glass slippers
and she gets into the pumpkin thats turned into the carriage
she rides to the ball
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight
so she goes to the ball
and she has a wonderful time
and the clock strikes twelve
and shes running outof the ballroom
and she loses a glass slipper
and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry hes going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his his true love
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live
and the two epsis two stepsisters try on the slipper
and ofcourse it does not fit
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him
but the slipper does not break
she tries on the slipper
it fits
and they live happily ever after
and thats about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella
I would take a knife
I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first
and then I would spread the jelly
and then I would fold the bread in half
in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst
and my doctor had told me that I could just do normal activities and nothing would happen
and unfortunately it did rupture
and it burst
and it was February
and it was an ice storm
and it was the middle of the night
and it was very treacherous getting there
but I we did
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic operation
and they couldnt do it that way so it was a fullon operation
and I remember it was I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time
and eventually I just got back to my own my old self
I dont remember too much about what I did to get better
I do remember though that I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown
and it required crossing a very busy street
and there was no traffic light
and I remember them being able to cross very easily
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in in either direction to inch my way through
but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to to move
and now I dont even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but
yes
okay thankyou
yes my first experience was back in the late nineteen nineties
I worked with a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges
and the the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they had been
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse
so that was my first experience was was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually substituted for words that could that could not be understood
and and the the kids were great
and they were youknow they would manipulate because if they didnt know what to do they would just start to cry
and youd hafta youd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just ke I dont wanna do this
and now ofcourse fast forward to here this has been an amazing experience working with both children and and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate
and what theyre doing youknow to to make themselves better
and Im Ive taken cues from the people with whom Im working what not to do and and what to do
and and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps
so
yes Id like its something I love talking about
my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in in the south and then the midwest and
and eventhough we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something
and we were also very sad that it was finished
but every time they build a new ball park well be going
so and and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our Christmas cards our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with with the the trip itself
and the first one it said
from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home
which which was mine
but it was nice
and it in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen
we saw cities we never would have seen
and we interfaced with people that we never would have youknow communicated with because theyre very different when you leave the NewYork area
so
okay this story begins with a boy playing soccer
and hes kicking the ball in the air
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction
and the ball goes crashing through the window of a home
and theres a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window
and at the end he picks up the soccer ball and looks outside to see who kicked it from whence it came
okay
a little boy is leaving the house
he does not want the umbrella
he says bye mom and leaves without the umbrella
and as he starts walking it starts to rain
and then it starts to rain even harder
so he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet
and then he takes the umbrella and starts out again
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down
so her dad takes a ladder climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat
unfortunately the ladder falls
he cant get down
theres a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really cant get down
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree
Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters
and eventhough they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family
infact her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders
and she is kept down at heel eventhough they are wealthy and snobby
and an invitation comes to a ball
and the the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going
but its quite clear that she will not be going to the ball
the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife
and Cinderellas friends from the field make her a dress
and shes all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say
youre not going
and they destroy the dress
and shes devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress
she turns a pumpkin into a carriage
she turns four white mice into four horses
I could sing it but I wont
I really could
and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken
and everything will turn back to the way it is
she goes to the ball
she meets the prince
she dances with the prince
theyre falling in love
and the clock strikes twelve
so she hurries out
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman hes fallen in love with
so they set out to try the the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in the town the village
and eventhough the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it they eventually find that it fits Cinderella
and they live happily every after
okay
I would take I would open both jars
I would find a knife
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread
and since there is only one piece of bread I would just I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich
okay I had fallen at one point
and I fractured my right wrist
and I remember that
well it was how many years ago
it was probably in nineteen ninety two or three
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream
and I was looking at the sign
and then I tripped and fell
and I was holding my keys in my right hand
and so Ive but I got a little fracture
and I hadta go to the emergency room
well I was casted for quite a while
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge I think was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own recovery
but it wasnt really a bad thing all in all
I had the cast on for awhile
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist
yes I do
I have a very dear friend cousin who is has aphasia
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and shes now seventy one
and I visit her regularly
and we communicate in a very interesting way
well I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to
and I dont give her many choices
and we do alotof hand motions
and she has a way of communicating
shes pretty amazing
she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats alot
she she likes to say she wants to go home indicating her frustration with her situation
but I can see when I speak with her that shes very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts
she has the thoughts she if she could only put the words together
and it is very very frustrating for her
but I think that shes kindof come to terms with where shes at
its hard
wow well the first thing that came into my mind because Ill Ill take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place
and the most so its a trauma event where my grandfather passed away
and he was not sick
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work
so he went off on a normal day
and I remember playing youknow with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital
and a friend of mine and I made put some cookies together and for when he was going to come home because we didnt entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with the death
so its kindof a sad story
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the o cycle of birth and death and whatnot
so it turned out he passed away that night
and I never did see him again
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship
and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life
and then looking back on it as an adult now realizing that this man was really an angel of mine
I didnt realize it then but I came to believe
and I dont know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there
came to learn about that
and it just served as a a real learning in my life in many different ways
okay well this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went outof the way and broke the window
not his intention but it was an accident
and loandbehold his dad was sitting in the living room
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad
and the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didnt see the boy because the boy ran away in fear
this is the story about a a little boy who was on his way to school
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella
but he didnt wanna take the umbrella because he didnt wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain
so he went on his way
he got caught in the rain
it started to rain very hard
he got very wet
and he came home
and he got the umbrella
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom
ERROR
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson
okay well little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park with her dad
and as they were going along they noticed that a cat was running along the field
and a dog was chasing it
and dont you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so
she encouraged her dad to get the ladder because they lived right across the street
and the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree
but then he got stuck in the tree
and looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down
so Im sure someone had a cell phone in this picture eventhough its not shown
so the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat
and they all lived happily ever after
okay once upon a time there was a young girl
and she hadta go live with her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldnt take care of her anymore
so he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived
and they took the the girl in
and turned out they really didnt treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted
and she was sortof like their maid
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent alotof time among the cinders by the fireplace
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball
so when they got the announcement Cinderella knew about it
but ofcourse the wicked stepmother wasnt going to let Cinderella go to the ball
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball
so the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house
and then they saw how sad she was
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such
but Cinderella I guess she knew in her heart that she couldnt really go to the ball
so as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go
and they had beautiful dresses
and she hadta help mend them
and lets see what happened
she I think she went out in the garden
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad
and she was crying
and she really wanted to go to the ball
and her fairy godmother had said youknow
you may go to the ball just change
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress
and she said
fetch me a pumpkin
and then turned it in to a coach
and shen
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin
and so she was able to go off to this ball
and when she got there the ball was in full swing
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the the prince
and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious they really werent gracious people
and one had a tic and a creaky knee
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just
things that they just didnt know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the prince in a proper way
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince
and there was this magical thing that happened that wed like to think is love
and they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting
and suddenly the struck
and she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight
and with that she ran away
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind
she made her way home
she was alittle sad because I guess she thought shed never see this prince again
and then the prince found the slipper
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper
so he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on
and then they did come to the home of the where Cinderella lived
then they the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot
wasnt going to fit
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe
and it fits
and they get married and live happily ever after
that was not the best version of the story that Ive ever heard
well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would open up the freezer and get some glutenfree bread outof there
and I would put a paper towel on the counter
and Id put the slices of bread on the paper towel
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly
put them on the counter
and I would retrieve from the drawer a implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly
and I would then open up the peanut butter
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread
and then I would close the jar
and then I would open the jelly jar
and I would take a nice heaping
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around
and then I would put the top on the bread
Id close up the jelly and put the knife and the spoon in the sink
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate
and I probably wouldnt cut it
and I would go sit down
and I would enjoy a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich
oh thats right
I injury I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant
I was going to a store to get some an ice cream
I was really hungry
I had just worked really hard that morning
and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying
if they sell cheeseburgers Im getting one
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist
and immediately a big ball popped outof my wrist
and I couldnt move my fingers
so I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast
and it was it was it was interesting mainly in my my in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything
but ofcourse I couldnt work either
but it presented a challenge
I learned how to do things lefthanded
I hadta write lefthanded
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars
and that was in I think it was in May
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in ColumbiaPresbyterian with him with the cast on
we have these pictures
and I remember he had ke a little kindof like a scrape on the back of his head or just not not a ke a bloody thing but a a kindof like a wornout spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast
I dont actually remember doing physical therapy
once I had the cast off I think I was fine
and I regained all the strength in my wrist
I think six weeks
yes it was my dominant hand
yes I do
youknow my cousin Ann shes seventy one now
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six
and so shes lefthanded
and so she lost the use of her right side
her hand is all mangled and her foot also
and her communication skills are very limited
she its aphasia is what I think she has
and shes gotten progressively better over the years
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again
she useta always say
zoom zoom zoom zoom
and I always thought because she was in a car she was sitting in a her parked car when she had the stroke
and she doesnt say that anymore
but alot of the people where she lives thats her nickname Zoomzoom because she useta say that alot
but shes very challenging to communicate with
and Ill go see her and spend and hour or so
and we have lunch
and things and we try to communicate as well as best as we can with asking her simple questions
and she communicates in sortof a roundabout way
she has three children
and when she wants to talk about them she cant always get their names but shell say one two or three
and thats how we know because sometimes she brings alotof numbers in
so when she tries to tell you shes in pain shell take her good hand
and shell say
one two three four five pain
I dont know
I dont know
like that
she somehow its amazing how she communicates
I give her alotof credit
yeah
okay I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather
because he was the one of the most important people in my life when I was a child
and I was it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten
it was in July
and it was just a normal day
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street
and it was back in the day when there was alotof freedom
you you went out the door and came in for lunch
and then you went out the door
and there really werent very many parameters
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had
and came home to find out that he had had a
he they didnt use the word stroke but thats what he had
that he hadta go to the hospital from work
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home hell have these cookies
and then the next morning I remember waking up
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like
I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that you know he wasnt coming home and just as a child an innocent child kindof coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing
having that be my first experience with death
and youknow I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who is in the nursing home
she was around because she she kindof lived with us for awhile
and it was just she actually I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard
everyone went to the all the adults went to the funeral at night
I just remembered that
and I was hysterical crying
I was so so sad
and she didnt know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me
and it worked
she wasnt being mean
but I was beyond being consoled at that point
and I I felt very alone in my grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man whos my grandfather
but anyway that that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future
and I remember a time when I was in sixth grade
and we were having a sleepover in my friends back yard
happened to be with a a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to u leukemia a the other girl who lost her grandmother
and I had lost my grandfather
and we it was like they they could make a movie about the bond
we were all in the tent
and and we were just talking
I can see us all sitting there
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life
and we put it out there
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go
and we all just just let it out
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this
and its a good thing
so thats why I think this story is is so important to me was because its something that affected my life youknow as I grew up
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didnt know about angels then
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe
and he can sortof watch over me if you will
yeah one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball kicking the ball
and inadvertently it went through the window of his his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp
and he stood up and looked out the window
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window
he kindof shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing
and he was going to go speak to his son about that
okay well Johnny was on his way to school
and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said
Johnny take your umbrella
and he said
nope mom
I dont think its going to rain today so I I dont wanna take it
so off he went without his umbrella
and sure enough it started to rain
and it it started to rain harder
and he got wet
so he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said
you were right mom
I needed my umbrella
then he took his umbrella and went off
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of taking her advice next time
its always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though
okay Sally and her dad were walking around the park one day
Sally was riding her tricycle
and as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree
and her dad she urged her dad to help the cat
and so he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over
and some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the fire department
and sure enough the fire department came to help retrieve the dad from the tree and the cat
and at the end of the day every one was fine
once upon a time in a land far away there was a little girl named Cinderella
and she was brought to the home of a a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the the mom her stepmom
and they actually put her to work
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose
but Cinderella was happy nonetheless
and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends the mice and the birds and such
and she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella
and she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom
and in her heart she thought
oh I would just love to go to that ball
and she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that ofcourse she wasnt going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella
and but the stepsisters were going to go
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball
and Cinderella was sad
she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said
well help you Cinderella
and they brought out some ribbon and some some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her
and she had the dress
but she had no way of getting to the ball
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared
and it was her fairy godmother
and her ir my
dont cry my child
I know you wanna go to the ball
and and I can help you
just fetch me a pumpkin
and Ill turn it into a coach
and your mice friends will be the coachmen
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the the coachmen
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world
and when she got there she approached the ball and looked down the stairs
and there everyone was dancing
and they saw her come in
they turned and looked at her
and the prince looked
and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen
he invited her to dance
and they just had a nice connection
and she engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing
and suddenly the time had gone by
and it was midnight
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight
so quick she ran from the castle
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper
and she found her way home
and
so he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them
and everyone tried on the slipper
and when he came to the house of the where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper
and it didnt quite work
but the Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs
and the mice gave her the key
and she got out
she came down
and she said shed like to try on the slipper
and with that she tried on the slipper
and her fairy god
but as it was they she tried on the slipper
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted
and they got married
and they lived happily ever after
Id like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness
yes well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of glutenfree bread from the freezer
put them on a paper towel on the counter
Id get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon
and Id open up the peanut butter
and Id scoop out some peanut butter spread it on the bread
close the jar
Id use the spoon to get the jelly outof the jar
Id put it on the other slice of bread
put the jar the lid back on the jar
Id put the peanut butter and jelly back
Id put the lid
and I probably would not cut it in half
and I would take it to a table
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich
I can remember when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing
I was swinging with a friend
and we were standing facing each other
and I hit my head
and I did have a concussion
and I remember feeling quite ill
and my mother was taking some nursing courses
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight
but I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache
and then I was fine
after a day or so
no I think just rest rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes
yes
all different people whove had
I think youknow Ive encountered people who stutter
and I will usually just try to let them finish
Im pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them
and Ive encountered people with aphasia
and Ill often do the same
unless they really look as though theyre struggling
and then occasionally Ill try to give them a cue
yeah so I would say thats the most that I can think of
and children with speech and language difficulties
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words
mhm I can remember when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas
it was a couple weeks
she had been in the hospital
and she had not been ill
but she was diabetic
and youknow periodically she would be in the hospital
and it was Christmas eve
and we got a call that she had passed away
and it was terrible
my dad was at work
and my mother hadta contact my dad
and it was a really very difficult time
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry
so it was really something that I think I really remember
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father
and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve
we put everything up then
and then we would get up
so my mother did have all of us do that
but I remember thinking how sad my mom was
and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers
and my dad didnt come home until very late
and then he was there ofcourse on Christmas morning when we got up
but it was a difficult Christmas
and I do remember that very vividly
yeah mhm
one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball
and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbors window
his neighbor was sitting watching television
and the ball came through knocked over his lamp and caused quite a and caused quite a loud noise
his neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off
one cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school
he said
I will not need the umbrella
however when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard
it rained and rained
he hadta run through the puddles
and he got wet
he tried to cover his head with his hands
when he got home his mother said
look at you
youre soaking wet
and he thought about having an umbrella
h and the next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson
one day a girl was riding her bicycle
and she saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard
she looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat
she went and got her dad who brought a ladder
he started to climb the tree
and the ladder fell
so now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree
someone called the fire department
and they were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad
Cinderellas mother passed away when she was a little girl
and her father was raising her
and he met a woman that he thought would be a good wife
and she had three daughters of her own
and they got married
and they lived together
but Cinderella was not treated fairly there
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores
and the stepsisters would say
Cinderella get my lunch
Cinderalla clean the laundry
Cinderella youknow do everything
so and the stepmother was not kind to Cinderella
and one day an invitation came that all of the unmarried women in young girls in the village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince
they needed to find a suitable wife for the prince
so Cinderella heard about it
and she dreamt of going
and she was a friend to the animals
she was a kind girl
and the mice and the animals helped her
and they made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night
but when it was time to come they said that she could not go
and the wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly
they were very very mean to her
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go
and they locked her away
but the mice came and they helped her
they got the keys
and they opened the door
and allofasudden the fairy godmother was there
and she helped Cinderella
and there was a beautiful dress for her
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight
so Cinderella went
and she danced
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her
but then the clock struck twelve
and out Cinderella ran outof the ball
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes
and then she turned she turned back into Cinderella
and she made it back to the to the the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters
and a few days later some of the princes men came
and they had Cinderellas shoe
and they said we can try this on
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince
and all of the stepsisters tried it on
and Cinderella I I believe she was she was locked away then too because they had noticed they knew the stepmothers m
they realized
so I think they had locked her away at that point aswell
and they helped her get out
and she tried on the shoe
and sure enough it fit
and she was able to see the prince
and they lived happily ever after
aw
youre welcome
well first you would get out your bread and you and a knife
and you would open your peanut butter and spread some peanut butter on the bread
and then you would get I would get a clean knife
I dont mix my peanut butter and jelly
and I would open the jelly and spread the jelly on top of that
put another piece of bread on top
cut it in half
my mother said if you cut it in half its a little extra love in that sandwich
so we would always cut that in half aswell
I remember
I was playing on the swings with a friend
and we were swinging
and I fell
and I did come down right on the back of my head
and I got a concussion
and my parents took me to the hospital
and they were very concerned
and I was very sick to my stomach
and they were going to keep me overnight at the hospital
but my mother hadta get home
she had three other children at home
my dad worked in the evenings then
and she had promised that she would wake me up every hour
so I do remember that
and the next day remember resting on the couch in our living room and getting all kinds of visitors
and yes the neighborhood children were all coming in
and yeah it was a day or two until I felt better
no
yeah I just remember my mother having to wake me up every hour or so even through the night and being extremely tired and wanting to sleep but her continuously waking me up
Im sure she didnt yep
I have
some that I think of are talking with people who had difficulty with maybe disfluent speech
they were stutterers
and really trying hard not to finish their words for them or their statements
and th also patients with aphasia
just really sitting and giving them additional response time
and also working with children with difficulty with language and with articulation
and mostly with them just modeling correct production for them
mhm
I guess that was an important day in my life
and I remember I was student teaching as a speech language pathologist
I was working hard
back then we didnt have SuperDuper speech company so we hadta make everything
and I had contact paper that I was laminating pictures with
and my husband
now hes my husband but then he was my boyfriend
had called and said
oh lets go over to the park
lets do this
and he was acting kindof funny
and I thought
I dont really have time for this
and even when he came to the house he was acting kindof funny
and I said
oh youknow I really wanted to finish what I was doing
so we went to Brookdale park which is where we live right now across the street from Brookdale park now
and that was the day that he asked me to get married to marry him
and then I was so shocked
and then I went home
and my my parents knew
so then they had invited my brothers over
and it was this whole ke small party
and I kept thinking
oh this is so wonderful
but I really hafta get back to what Im doing
my husband was like
really
ke were engaged
but I guess I was a conscientious student then too
I think so
so yeah and then it was nice
because the next day I went in to the youknow to where I was doing my student teaching
and it was nice to tell my cooperating teacher
and all the children were very excited
it was nice
youre welcome
one day a boy was playing soccer
and he wasnt being very careful
and he went to kick the ball to his friend
but he kicked it through a window his neighbors window
his neighbor had been sitting there watching television and was very alarmed and upset that the ball came through the window
when the neighbor looked to see who had kicked the ball the boy had run off
youre welcome
okay
one cloudy day a mom was encouraging her son to take his umbrella to school with him
she warned him a second time before he left
but he said
no I dont need it
I guess hoping that it wouldnt rain
but sure enough it did rain that day
it rained on the way to school and on the way home from school
when the boy got home he was soaking wet
and his mother looked at him and said
I had told you that you should bring your umbrella today
and then from then on he carried his umbrella and learned a lesson
okay one beautiful day a cat ran outside
and a dog chased it up the tree
a little girl was riding her tricycle and saw that it was her cat stuck on a branch in the tree
she ran and got her father who got a ladder and tried to help her retrieve the cat
but the ladder slipped off of the tree
now both the dad and the cat were stuck in the tree
the mom called the fire department
and they came
they were going to help both the dad and the cat get down from the tree
and everyone would be happy
sure
Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away
and her father married a wicked woman
she had two daughters of her own
and they maltreated Cinderella
she hadta clean the floor
she hadta bring them breakfast
she hadta make their dresses
and one day where they lived an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land
and all of the unmarried women in the in the area were invited to the ball
and the two stepsisters were going to go
and Cinderella helped them get ready
and she on her own made her own dress with the help actually with the help of the animals
she was very kind to animals
and then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her
and they were evil
and they ripped her dress and tore her dress
and they told her she couldnt go
and she cried and cried
and they left
and she cried
and then allofasudden a fairy godmother appeared
and she told Cinderella
I can help you get to the ball
and she used her magic wand and made a beautiful dress
and she turned the pumpkins into a coach
and she had coachmen come
and Cinderella got to go to the ball
and sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did fall in love with her
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that Cinderella hadta be home at midnight
that if she was not home when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form
so Cinderella was at the ball having such a wonderful time
and it was getting closer and closer
and she didnt realize
and allofasudden the clock struck
and she ran outof the ball
and as she ran down the steps she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers
and the prince found it
and that was all that was left of Cinderella
so the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him
and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella
so the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away
and they tried on the the glass slipper
but it didnt fit either of them
and the mice snuck the key under the door to Cinderella
and she was able to get out just in time sothat she could try on the glass slipper
and sure enough it fit
and the princes servants brought her back to the castle
and she and the prince lived happily ever after
youre welcome
okay so first I would have two slices of bread
and then I would have a knife
and I would spread the an I would open the jar of peanut butter and get some peanut butter on my knife and spread it on the one slice of the bread
then I would use another knife
then I would
and then I would put the second slice of bread on top
and then I would cut the sandwich in two
okay
I remember hurting my back about five or six years ago
and I really didnt do anything to hurt my back
I just kindof moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back
and it was weeks of going to the doctor going finally just having physical therapy to to fix it
but it all worked out
yeah
it was alotof exercises
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield
and they had me lift weights and do different exercises stretching mostly stretching my back
and they used some kind of electronic ke stimulation therapy
and that really helped
it was the big part
yeah
not really
Imean a little bit here and there
youknow Ive know people who have had strokes and
I think alotof it was sortof just waiting them out
sometimes they just couldnt get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign sortof a sign language where they kindof point to what theyre looking for or what they need
that was mostly
kinda what did it
I guess Ill tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace
it was a long haul
it was alot youknow alotof discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it
and we probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents
and at one point I would be kindof more wanting to do it
and Eileen would be busy
her parents were ill
and we were trying to take care of them
and then it would swap
I was busy at work
and she was more interested in talking about it
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kindof we were on the same page at the same time
and we made this decision n to to that we should look possibly look at foster care
and we looked into it closely
and it just wasnt going to work right for us
and then we decided to to adopt
and we identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family
and we looked into all of her medical records and things
and then we traveled to China
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that
and then we v then we went to China
and actually the adoption occurred there in China
and we have an older daughter who came with us also
so were all part of all became one big family all at once
thanks
well there was a little boy who was playing practicing his soccer kicks
and looks like he kicked the ball alittle too hard right through the living room window where his father was sitting there watching tv and keeping an eye on the baby
and his father hadta gather up the ball and look out the window at him and and say youknow
what are you doing kicking the ball right near the window
okay
a little boy was on his way to school
hes getting ready to go to school
and his mother offered him the umbrella to take with him in case it rained on the way to school
and he said
no thankyou Im fine
and he walked out
and on his way to school it started raining really hard
and he hadta turn around and run home
and get youknow when he got home his mother wasnt happy that he did not take the umbrella from the beginning
and he he took the umbrella
and off he went again to school
it looks like there a little girls cat climbed up the tree
the girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard
and the cat ran up the tree
and she went in to get her father to help her
and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air
and the while once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too
so they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall outof the tree
okay there was a little girl named Cinderella
and her mother died
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own
and the new mother the stepmother didnt really care for Cinderella that much
she was more concerned about her two daughters
and then as they grew up the the she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her
and one day there was a an invitation to a a big ball to meet the prince because the prince was looking for a wife
and his father was having a big party a big ball to so he could meet all the eligible women in the in the kingdom
so she wanted to go to the the ball
but she was too busy
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for everybody else because they all hadta have their clothes made cleaned and ready to go
so she in she started to get everybodys everybody elses clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball
and in the meantime her friends the the the mice put sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go
but the sisters found out
and they tore up her dress
and she was she thought shed never get to the ball
and then she met her her fairy godmother
she went out in the yard and was crying
and the fairy godmother came
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the the mice into horseses
but told her that she needed to be home by d leave by twelve oclock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point
so she went off to the ball
and she met the prince
and they fell in love
and allofasudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight
so she hadta run out
and she ran down the steps of the the castle
and left the prince
and she lost her shoe on the way
so the prince thought he would never see his this girl again
and so the next day the father and the and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on
and that was Cinderella
so then she married the prince and lived happily ever after
I would take the bread
and I would spread the peanut butter open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter
and then put another piece of bread on top of it
alright back when I was in high school I broke my collar bone in physical education class
I was a senior in high school
and I was playing third base in gym class
we we were playing softball
and I was playing third base
and it was a ground ball
I kindof moved over toward the short stop
and the short stop charged in to get it and ran into me and kindof hit my shoulder and snapped my collar bone
and it was in the springtime
so it was I youknow they hadta Id never broken a bone
they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me
and take then I we the field was about half a mile from the school
so I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm
and and they said my arm was broken
and they put this harness on me that kindof pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight
and so I got to wear that for my prom and for graduation
and there was a miserable injury
Ill say that
no really you just its a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and youknow meet up when while they heal
and otherwise its just limited activity for awhile
right around the funnest time of the year
yeah it did
yeah I go I distribute communion in the nursing home once a month
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making alotof sense and some are not so communicative
and youknow you end up youknow using my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to youknow coax them into talking to you communicating with you
and youknow you do alotof different things ke make youknow with trying to make facial expressions and trying to youknow to just kindof jar them back to the present so they can determine whether theyre even ready to take communion
but youknow thats kindof its alotof its alot more alot less verbal and alot more youknow trying to make a personal connection with them
when
Ill talk about my other daughter
when Erin was born and we it was a little postdated the energy s
and she was a little bit late so they decided she would they would induce her
and she we went to the hospital
it was all planned
it was only going to be a couple of hours
and it ended up being ofcourse like thirteen hours
but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileens parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby
and it was the first my parents first grandchild so a really exciting time
and I have three brothers
so it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl
so youknow it was the whole thing was just that being that we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done
and a little but it made it so exciting because we knew our an that the grandparents could be there
and we could be youknow it could be exciting for everybody
yes it was
so the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard
and it goes through the window of the house
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily
and Im sure hes on the other end running from his father
the little boy is getting ready to go to school
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and because its sposta rain
and he tells her he doesnt need it
and he walks out the door
and youknow he just barely gets away from the house
and it starts really raining hard
so he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her
you know what you were right
I needed the umbrella after all
the little girls cat climbed up the tree
it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog
and she so the cat got stuck in the tree
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell
so then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father and get the barking dog away from the tree
so once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone
and the father met a a woman and decided to get married
and this woman had two daughters
and the so the they became a family
and quickly the new mother who became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters
so she they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the stepmother and the two the stepmothers two daughters
and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody
and then one day there was going to be a ball
the king was going to have a a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party
and Cinderella wanted to go
but her ep her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody elses needs were taken care of first eryb her the two sisters dresses were ready and everything else
so Cinderella got it all ready
and in the meantime her the mice sewed a a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear
so after she got all of everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her
so she thought she wouldnt be able to go to the ball
and then she met her she ran out into the back garden of the castle
and she met her fairy godmother
and the fairy godmother told her that youre going to go to the ball
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown
and she put the she turned the mice into the horses
and she went off to the ball
and the but there was one stipulation is that she hadta be home she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was
so she went to the ball
and she met the prince
and they fell in love
and then the allofasudden she heard the clock strike twelve
and she immediately tried ran outof the ball hadta get outof there before she turned back into Cinderella
and she lost her shoe on the step of the of the palace
but there was nothing she could do
she just kept running
and the next day the kings minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldnt fit into it
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after
I would put the bread down
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it
the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast my right breast
and our son Joseph had just been born a year ago a year before the the diagnosis or the concern anyway
and so I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him
but there was surgery required
and there was a waiting period
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on not on me sothat I could get back to taking care of him
as it turned out everything was fine
the lump was removed
it was benign
and everything was alright
so but it was a scare for awhile
and important that I kept the priorities that I thought was were important
there was very little recovery
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasnt too sure whether they had removed the breast or not when I first woke up from the anesthesia
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright
and I was so busy
I dont recall anything special otherthan a dressing and keeping up with whatever medications whatever they told me to do
but I nothing was was bothering me after it was over
yeah
mhm
I useta teach English as a second language
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation exercises that we did
I always tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew
but yeah theres difficulty when someone is not fluent in in your language
sometimes with elderly
I took care of my mom and my dad as they were really in advanced years
nineties
and sometimes my father would go back to Italian
it was a place of comfort I think especially as he was maybe dying
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow
all I al but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking
but it was memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too
but I was very interested in where he was going with with the Italian at the end
with my mom she was more more grounded
sometime it was hearing it was her hearing problem
was alotof shouting going on
so its sometimes for me its that
its like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive
yeah
youre welcome
oh Ive had so many happy things
oh whats happy
Im sure the happiest day was the day Joseph was born
we were in EastOrangeGeneral hospital
I had a wonderful doctor
my husband Joe who had alittle too much background in language problems that can occur with babies and children made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food
whatever the heck his he worried about my doctor removed from the diet
so when it was time for Joseph to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes
so when the day come came I for Josephs birth I was one lesson short of the full of the full course I guess of childbirth preparation
so I was going fine without any medication
it was just taking awhile
and then I said to them
this is all I know
I dont know any more
so they were laughing
and they said
well take over
and they just pushed my head from the pillow and said
lets line up the mirror correctly
everything was going fine
still no medications
everything was going fine
DoctorSobol my doctor said
Firstname this is going on
I wanna get home for supper
I said
Ill get you home in time
so it was a little bit longer but at five twenty on December ninth ninety sixty nine Joseph was born
no medications
no nothing
I was on a high
I can Ive never been on such a high
but it was it was such a happy day
and everything was fine
it was the way Joe had hoped without any interference
he got a really nice Apgar score
yes he was a ten right off the bat
so I said
well did my job
now comes the scary part
raise the kid
so happiest day
for sure
mhm
once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball
and not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair
and shocked outof his ennui he looks out the window and with ball in hand has judged correctly that hes going to hafta go outside and speak to little Ned
well I think this is my daughter inlaw Tanya
and this is Nick
and Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him to school that day
and as hes waving goodbye he is reassuring my daughter inlaw that he surely doesnt need an umbrella independent little soul that he is
within the first block on the way to school he it begins to rain
as hes sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he understands what his mom was trying to say after all
a bit reluctantly he has returned home and just hasta stand there sopping wet while my daughter inlaw tries very hard not to say
I told you so
but he he happily accepts an umbrella and returns to school in the opposite direction it looks like
returns to school
umbrella
and dry
and happy
enough
well this is little Mary little MaryBoyle who has noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree
and and has called the only person she knows who can rescue Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household
and that is her dad
he has gone to help her climbs the tree
but the ladder has gotten away from him
is falling
as if things arent noisy enough the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark
and so now the neighbors I guess have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue in this order dad Fluffernutter
and theyre not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because hes the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with
there you go
youre welcome
there was a a widower with a daughter whose name was Cinderella who had remarried a a mean woman
he didnt know that at the time but thats what marriage reveals over time
she had two two daughters
and so his stepdaughters were part of the household that Cinderella and her father had enjoyed
but things changed once they all arrived together
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude
the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way
she performed servile tasks
at one point an invitation comes to a ball
and theyre considering happily going
Cinderellas face is lighting up
but she doesnt realize whats going on
the ball was held because the the King decided that his son it was time for the son to marry
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town
well Cinderella would love to go
and it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and the stepmother and the and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves
so they prepared had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy
but she was there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family
well theres a book in the picture and the picture book I dont remember at all
she discovers a book
I dont know if thats where she comes across an incantation
but a fairy godmother appears
and because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her
fairy godmother helps her
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too
and as as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball Im going to just remember that she dances with the handsome prince
and at as she runs back tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair
I didnt see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight
but she hadta get outof there by midnight
and she does
but then theres the there is the return of the slipper the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night
but as I said the book seems a little bit different
theres a key
and I guess when she lets everyone in finally
where is he
why is the key there
I dont remember that part
but as I just remember the story ends happily
that he does find her and the slipper
and theyre reunited
and so happily ever after
uhhuh
well I would keep all my ingredients at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly
lay the bread down
get a nice butter knife
and I begin with spreading a a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the the well around all four sides sothat when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesnt actually go over the side
it just stays within the the borders
I useta like mine folded over
I think I I like it just the one slice
so it just looks really kindof beautiful with a little wall a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle
okay
youre welcome
the the most the most memorable event was
it but I think I did tell you about it
the the yeah
it was about the the possible scare
it was just a lump in in my breast
and that Im Im pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of of our son to think about
and I didnt think because of my age or the the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything more than precaution to do the the procedure
but as close as I came was youknow the the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and and caring
and I I felt supported the whole the whole time
just that I I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasnt sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so the dressings and bandage were so tight
but I just remember thinking the the theyll be Ill do whatever I hafta do on it
and whatevers next Ill find out about and take care of
so its a moving progression
I dont usually write the end of a story if its something like that
if you tell me Ill say
oh well go through it step by step
and well get there
it was like that
so Im fortunate that it hasnt been anything worse than that
just I can only remember being busy because with with a toddler
he was a year old then
and and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another
it was nothing short of show up for a doctors appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done
so I didnt think about
I knew I had it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright
so it wasnt much to do except youknow just take care of of the healing part and cooperate
but I was sure everything was going to be alright
something important
well I think I think oddly enough of of meeting and and continuing a a life with Joe
it was Im sure the most important thing that ever happened
the most memorable day was the day our son was born
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how how interesting that all was
we were students at MontclairState
and in those days freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus
we hadta sing the the almamater
but the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at at LifeHall
and he noticed the sign and said something about
I think I had part of it was covered
and he said
are you a a speech major
I said
no English
and I I unveiled the the words English
but he was a senior
and I was a freshman
and so I got to meet one of the youknow the upperclassmen got his signature
and then later we just had it was an easy conversation
we just we talked alittle
he he continued when I whenever I saw him to say hi
and I people would tell me
hes a BMOC
youknow hes a he was a a vice president of student government
and I said
ohmygoodness
but the more we hadta talk about
I was a student leader in my high school
and I thought when he when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee
but it turned out that he we he was interested
so our first date I think was the
it was something like the KingstonTrio or something like that
some folk group
it was really nice
they were on campus
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come
that was one of his duties
but when I just think of how all that unfolded just
I knew I I was gonna finish school
and so we we paced ourselves I guess youknow to to be logical about things
get to know each other no surprises along the way
because you have time with a person and you you see them in all the seasons and all
but I think when it finally came to to getting married I dont think there was a formal
we we people ask us but this was not even a formal proposal
I think everyone around us assumed we would marry
so we did
and so I I wasnt engaged
youknow I we I was pinned
and someone said to me the next day
youknow youre youre engaged to be engaged
I said
no Im not
and they said
well thats what that means
and I said
oh I thought it meant sortof going steady college style
they said
no youre engaged to be engaged
I said
well we have some time to go before
I said
it means what it means to the individual couple too
so I tried to assert myself
but I guess they might have been right
but I dont I dont care
it didnt mean anything
but that it when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross Imean thats thats probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married
and all that happened at once
it all converged
its alright that weve done this before
okay same story
now was it little Ned
no this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself
and the trajectory is off
it goes right through a window
and we hear the crash
and the lamp has gone over
and and Im assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody whos startled that this intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture
and he says
I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard
okay
its still raining
okay in the first picture its about to rain
mom is telling little sweetie
take your umbrella with you because I think its going to rain today
and the little little Sammy this time says
no no no no no I dont need it Im a big kid
and as he says goodbye his mom is just offering it one more time
he says
solong
see you later
but as he steps out the door wouldnt you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall
and as hes getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says
oh drat
and when he back gets back home and looks at mom I think shes restraining the
I told you
and hes looking a bit sheepish little Sammy
but hes out in in the last frame
but hes still going in the opposite direction here
okay
were in a time warp youknow
you guys have not moved forward from last last week
okay
groundhog day
no this is cat up in a tree day
ohmygoodness mygoodness
this is little sweet Sue
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb
the ladder that he must have taken to to get to to the cat has fallen
so hes stranded
and little Fido is barking and saying
what the heck are you doing up there
but thankfully the the firemen are on their way
kindly neighbors must have called and said
help help help
and so theyre rushing along with the ladder
they will rescue him shortly
and I think theyll get dad down before they get the cat down
I think thats the priority
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world
its all going to work out just fine
alright I think last time it was a combination aswell
what once upon a time there was a a family where the there was a widow
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to a woman he had met
but the woman had two daughters of her own
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after the woman and her daughter the became the stepmother and the stepsisters and joined the the household of Cinderella and her dad
Im assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again
and she must deal with the family her new family
and theyre not very kind
theres theyre mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of Cinderella at every option
and so she did the rv chores and she was treated badly
simultaneously there is another father and a and a b and a offspring a prince this time
and the father is a king
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son
and I assume that its time for him to be married
and so the prince a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful maidens who are available
an invitation goes out to Cinderellas stepmother to the household
and everyone is smiling
and Cinderella I guess assumes that she might be able to go
but this is not going to happen
this the the book
and I dont know whats going on with that little book yet
but she I maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house
the little animals or begin to help out
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready
and Cinderella now knows that with the help of her godmother she will get to go
there is a little admonition from after shes dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably
be sure youre home by midnight
and then it switches to the to the ball
and I and the prince sees and falls in love with at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty
when he could see all that
so they dance and dance
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase
I guess the the the right hand man the the first secretary first VP of the king is running after her to say
wait a second
wait a second
but she runs back to the to to home
and then comes the search for who matches the slipper
and its he in your little booklet the first vice president then who comes to the door
and theres a funny little picture of somebody tripping and a cushion
but I dont remember any of that from my stories or my film memory
but apparently there the key there was a key there that still doesnt mean anything much to me
they must have let him in
the the match is made when she tries on the slipper
and so I I suppose the the fella
xxx weve got our girl
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot
and I dont know why I thought it was direct
but he could afford to hire help to do that so so the help took care of it
anyway its a happy ending
they they get back together again
and Im sure its the prince and his sweet Cinderella and p life is happy from then on happily ever after
ERROR
did you try it with the little wall
and did we say theres only one piece of bread and we want we think we want two
we can do it either way
well do a half one this time
well use the just the one piece of bread but were going to make it the same way
were gonna lay all the ingredients out first because Im analretentive
we get everything out
the knife butter knife
we open up the peanut butter first
and we spread a a thinnish layer in the middle because were gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges
all four edges will have a slightly raised perimeter
were going to put red raspberry jelly
open that cap up
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesnt cross over the walls so it doesnt hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your your hand as youre enjoying
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich
if you like you can fold it over which was the way alotof people in my neighborhood did it
but I think thats it
thats how well do it
mhm
well I recently had Hodgkins disease
was diagnosed I guess about three months after I retired
I spent several months in chemotherapy
but i prior to that before the chemotherapy started I had an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks
that was was a StevensJohnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no no burning to my skin
it was all a result of the allergic reaction
and that stopped the chemo
I had one round of chemo
and then the allergic reaction took place to the dica not the chemo medication but to a medication thats designed to protect kidney function
so I was in the hospital for three weeks
that resolved
I started chemo again
and I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since
so my hair came back
my weight came back
and I hafta watch it now because its its back more than it has been
but it was its been quite a year and a half or so
well I had married my wife about forty eight years ago
and it was
sorry guys
pretty much her her doing plus my oncologist ofcourse
so it was youknow it I had chemo every two weeks
and the oncologist was just great
and and Firstname was quite a support
sorry
and I I didnt do much else because it was youknow the chemo and and eating as best as I could and resting as as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasnt too hard
so that was it youknow following doctors orders as they say and my wifes orders
so
a story
well this being SaintJosephs day in the RomanCatholic calendar and since my sons name is Joseph aswellas my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday
that I do know the day of the week in December December ninth
and it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that that we found out that we were pregnant that my wife was pregnant
hes our only child
so his his the announcement of the fact that he was that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess are happy memories prompted by as I said today because of of the of SaintJosephs day
about the about SaintJosephs day
its a its a feast day in in the in the RomanCatholic calendar that comes just after SaintPatricks day which I think overshadows overshadows it
and its as the Irish celebrate SaintPatricks I think SaintJosephs day is mostly celebrated by the ItalianAmericans and by Italians
and theres a special pastry that is consumed
and its called a Zeppole or the the donut of SaintJoseph
its quite rich creamy fattening cholesterol laden but quite delicious
if you if you meant my sons birthdate we prepared for childbirth
I was to be a coach
it was very early in the time when the socalled painless childbirth developed or Lamaze
but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didnt allow fathers in the waiting
so eventhough we prepared we prepared for the day of birth going to childbirth classes Lamaze classes
when it when
pun intended
when push came to shove I couldnt go into the waiting
so I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery
and and I we did use some of the coaching
so it and and she did employ some of the techniques that were taught to her
so yeah so that was that was the day of his birth
a boy is kicking a soccer ball which goes through a house window smashes the glass
and its falling into the lap of a man whos sitting in a chair in the house
he picks up the ball looks out the window actually looks through the hole in the window
ERROR
the mother is handing an umbrella to her child because its probably raining outside
he is saying
no I wont dont want the umbrella
he walks outside
its raining
didnt listen to mom
he runs back with water now drenching him the rain drenching him
back in the house mothers not happy
shes frowning
the boys frowning soaking wet
he leaves the house this time with the umbrella
well a cat is stuck up in the tree
and this childs father probably he he did climb the tree to try to get the cat
but he now himself is stuck up there
the dog is barking at him
and someone called the fire department
and two firemen are rushing over with a ladder
and theyre gonna take him down aswellas retrieve the cat
okay
Cinderella is a young girl who whose mother died
and shes brought by her father to live with I I think a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderellas age
father meant well
but the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully
she became their maid essentially and hadta clean the house take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella do the cooking do the washing while they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to to please themselves
one day the prince
they they lived in a in a principality
the prince whose father wanted him to marry was asked to or was told that there would be a ball held at which many of the or all of the single women in the principality would would be invited
and the idea would be that he would the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife
the three Cinderellas three stepsisters prepare for the ball
the mother their mothers very excited
and ofcourse Cinderella is excluded
she cannot go to the ball
and so shes left at home alone while the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball
shes visited by her fairy godmother who grants her her wish of attending the ball
because Cinderella says
how am I gonna get there
what am I gonna wear
so the h fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her outof magic takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach
mice become the horses
I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too
I forget which animal becomes the coachman
they take her to the ball
shes not really recognized by her stepsisters and and the stepmother
but they the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight
otherwise or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera
so she promises to return at midnight
but shes having so much fun that shes still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight
so she panics
rightly so
runs gets back in the coach and is taken home
but one of her slippers glass slippers that was part of what the fairy godmother made for her is left behind
and the prince at at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and wanted to to know who she was
because she was going to be the one
and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind
so he has all of the young ladies in the nici in the principality try the slipper on
it their its brought to each of their houses
and the ofcourse the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for the one who was at the ball
and sure enough it is Cinderellas foot that fits the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and but to her great delight
and the prince marries her
and they live happily ever after
well I would take two pieces of bread
on one of them I would take a knife and spread the peanut butter
and on the other piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together
and Id have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
yeah well the big one is my cancer Hodgkins disease
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven
I had symptoms before then but didnt connect the dots
I had night sweats
I was tired and h just didnt think much of it
but then I noticed that I was losing weight
and thats what caused me to seek a doctor
so I went to
I hadnt been to a doctor in years
so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses
shes now both our physician for both of us
she did an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something the lymph nodes turned out
so I went for a sonogram
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan
that led to the need for a biopsy
so at that by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong
the decision was gonna be is it
it it was lymphoma
but is it gonna be Hodgkins lymphoma or NonHodgkins lymphoma
so I went to Mountainside hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasnt enough not enough tissue was obtained
so I hadta go into the city into NewYork to Sloan for a more complete biopsy
and that clinched it
it was Hodgkins lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two
Hodgkinss is much more treatable at a higher success rate
so I started chemo
and after the first session I developed a rash
and we werent quite sure what was going on
one of the nurses
the the oncologist wasnt sure
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment h for the for the Hodgkins
but one of his nurses said
this is an allergic reaction
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol
I think I mentioned this last time
which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney
its actually a drug for gout
but it has a protective effect for kidney function
that landed me in the hospital with with whats called StevensJohnson syndrome which is treated like a burn
it s people with StevensJohnson are often sent to burn units
my mouth was inflamed
I I it was just awful
I couldnt drink water
it it burned
that ofcourse suspended chemo
I we worked through the StevensJohnson
I was looking forward to chemo
it was it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation
so and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather
but still I I couldnt take solid food for for two weeks or so nor water
it was it was the only thing that really worked was was iced tea
so I got through the StevensJohnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months
it ended last May
had my Pet scan at that time which was clear
oncologist waited another six months
had another Pet scan
that was clear
and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed
I dont know if you know about ports
so that sorta that sorta clinched the the idea that Im youknow home free
youknow I hafta be monitored every six months
and chemo wasnt it wasnt all that bad
Imean Firstname got me through it if as I said last week
I broke down
she was just super in getting me through all of this
and the chemo wasnt bad
I I really wasnt nauseous
my appetite started to come back
infact we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo
wed send out for lunch
so the it was it was tired
Id I would get tired
but I had chemo every two weeks
and my hair came back
and thats where I am now
not all that much
Im a Im a very bad eater when it comes to nutrition
fish
but it it it wasnt all that much to do
the the chemo was the the primary source of of treatment ofcourse
the oncologist was very responsive
and he youknow he he gave me antinausea medication
but I didnt I took it once during the whole treatment time
and and even then it wasnt because I was starting to to vomit
I just felt a bit queasy
alotof rest
I slept alot and had tender loving care from Firstname
so it I didnt do alot different youknow
so I I really cant go beyond that
it was the chemotherapy and the rest
youknow that was pretty much it
well I guess one of the most important things
I think I think last week I mentioned my sons birth so I I wont go through that again
another milestone was was getting a job at MontclairState
I I had I was a speech clinician doing work as a as a a speech language pathologist
but I missed interacting with students
I had and and and I I had some experience in doing that because I my undergraduate degree was in history
and I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that
but then things things sortof changed obviously
but I I I missed that kind of interaction
I worked mostly with children when I was a speech clinician
and r Firstname was teaching English at the highschool level
and she would come back home with stories about youknow working with students and discussions they had in class
and I was sorta jealous of that
and so when I was invited to to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance
that that changed everything
and I was warned that from from friends colleagues that I was taking a big risk in in doing this because I wasnt going to get tenure
that they were h I was gonna be taken advantage of
I dont know where they got the idea
but that I would youknow I I would work for xl number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldnt get tenure
but I wanted to be in the classroom so much
and it was more that than doing research actually
it was actually teaching that drew me to it
that I said
the heck with it
youknow Im gonna do it
and so I I did
and it it changed everything
and that was a very very positive event youknow
and I spent forty five years after that being here
yeah
so yeah
yeah
well no lucky for you
okay a young boy is kicking a soccer ball
hes out I guess in the backyard
but as hes when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbors house or maybe his own house and lands on the lap of a of a man sitting in a chair who then gets up holds the ball in his hand and looks out the the hole in the window
and thats where it ends
so we dont know if hes gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what
but hes just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened
this is a story about not listening to your mom especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella
mother is suggesting that he he do that
that hes theres its going to rain
and hes hes rejecting the whole thing
says goodbye
and mothers a bit dismayed because hes not taking the umbrella
and sure enough once hes outside it starts to rain hard enough that he hasta run back to the house
hes not very happy
hes soaking wet
mother is looking at him almost saying
see I told you show
and next we see hes out back in the rain but with the umbrella
well it seems as though this young girls father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat whos up on a limb
he himself though ends up being stuck
his facial expression indicates that he hes having difficulty moving one way or the other
and being of no help the dog is barking making a racket
and someone evidently called the fire department
and there are two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder
and theyre going to try to get him down
his ladder fathers ladder is on the ground I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him
so the fire fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope
story of a young girl whose
I guess shes a teenager
whose mother dies and father remarries
and shes introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters
and they immediately take advantage of Cinderella
she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and hasta attend to their needs and the needs of the household
and evidently father was of no help in mediating any of this
so the girl ends up being in a household but but being rather a member of the household being a a servant as I said
one day a ball is announced
she she lives in I guess a principality headed by youknow royalty
and one day a ball is announced
if I recall correctly its because the prince is in need of finding a wife
his father tells him that its time for him to marry
so a ball is organized
and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend
and the three stepsisters and and their h their mother go plan to go
and they get their gowns ready
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too
but it turns out that shes not gonna be allowed to go
she ofcourse is very sad about that
enter her fairy godmother
they they go off to the ball the the the the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella
youre gonna go too
and were gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen
and I guess the mice too become horses
Im not sure which animals become the horses maybe the mice
shes outfitted Cinderellas outfitted with a gown and a pair of l glass slippers
why glass
I dont know
but shes told she hasta get home by by midnight
because at the stroke of twelve everythings gonna turn back to what it was
the coach will become the pumpkin
the coachmen will become the mice
shell lose her beautiful clothing
so she goes to the ball promises to to leave by twelve
but shes having a great time
and the prince is very much drawn to her
and shes still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time and gets gets back home in time
but as shes running out one of her slipper slippers comes off
and the prince picks it up
and it turns out that shes the one that he wants
and he figures hell be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into the into the glass slipper
so a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper
and the the the stepsisters ofcourse try
and they dont fit
and they try to push their feet into that slipper
and it doesnt work
and theyre very upset
and loandbehold Cinderellas foot fits perfectly
it was her slipper
and theyre very very surprised shocked and upset
but shes the one
the prince is delighted
and they end up being married and live happily ever after
well as I said before Im not very good at nutrition
so I would not use what looks like whole wheat bread
I would use American white bread two slices
on one slice I would spread the peanut butter
and the other slice I would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich
I think I do fine
quite well
although Im better at writing
no I have not
my father
yeah hes had triple bypass surgery
hes fine now
it took well we took him to the hospital
and he wanted to wait
and they said they need immediate surgery
so they did immediately operate on him
det next day he was able to speak
and he recovered
he eats better
and he
I dont know
he hes trying to stay healthy
okay well I published a book
whee
and I was able to make my money back on the publishing fees and and share my stories with alotof people so and got positive feedback
so it was very exciting
she was a poor stepsister
and she had other stepsisters
she hadta clean the house while her other sisters didnt
and she went to the ball
and she met a prince
and she went in the coach which was a pumpkin
and anyways at midnight stroke of midnight she lost contact with the prince
and he went ahead and looked through the whole town for some little glass slipper that she had worn that night
and then they met and lived happily ever after
I think Im pretty good
no I do not
people in my family have
I really havent not in the past eight years
youknow Ive been hospitalized once
oh youknow and Ive had alotof general baby boomer problems that people in their fifties have but nothing thats serious life threatening or anything like that
well I I discovered yoga
I started taking yoga
I realized that that was something to do thats made me alot calmer and stronger
its I it caused me to sortof move my life forward in ways that I hadnt done prior to the hospitalization
which was a stress reaction to my father passing away
thankyou
well I think giving the first speech I ever gave was a good thing
I was very anxious about it because noone had ever asked me to give a speech before
and I carefully wrote everything down and wrote four pages of notes and got up
and I knew I had exactly fifteen minutes or no more no less
I had a group of about twenty five
I read my notes
I threw in a couple of spontaneous jokes and finished in twelve minutes
so everyone seemed to like it
okay
okay
I think I can do it
first panel has a kid kicking a soccer ball
the the ball goes through the mans window
it ends up knocking over the mans lamp
and the man stands up with the soccer ball looking at the hole in the window and thinking about what hes gonna do next
okay
oh I can do this
its a mother and her son
the mother is trying to tell the son that he needs an umbrella
hes gonna go out because its gonna rain
the son is telling his mother that he doesnt need it
hell be fine
he goes out in the rain and gets really wet and comes back home
and his mothers doesnt like how wet he is
so he make sure to goes
okay
oh this is a story about a tree
theres a cat thats stuck in the tree probably because the dog has chased the cat into the tree
a little girls crying because her cat is stuck in the tree
and shes come over on her tricycle
a man probably the girls father has climbed the tree with a ladder
and he seems to be stuck too
and the fire department shows up with a bigger ladder
and presumably theyre going to get the cat and the father outof the tree
yes
well yeah
okay
okay this is
oh okay
oh
I cant explain all of these
but I can
okay
alright
okay
well Cinderella was the littlest of three daughters
I think maybe the other two wouldve been her stepsisters
and they all wanted to go to the ball
the stepsisters got to go
but Cinderella hadta stay home and do chores that involved alotof sweeping and dirt
however a fairy godmother shows up and does alotof hand waving with her wand
and she has a beautiful dress
and the problem is that she hasta leave at midnight or else her coach will turn into a pumpkin
the prince falls in love with her and wants to know how to see her
she ends up leaving at the last minute but manages to leave a glass slipper behind
the prince tries to figure out whose foot gets to go in the glass slipper
and the two stepsisters cant fit in the glass shoe
but she can
and the prince says
thats great
and they live happily ever after
the end

you take a jar of peanut butter
and put several scoops of it on one side
and then you take a jar on one slice of bread
and then you take a jar of jelly and open it up and put jelly on the other slice of bread
and then you put the two slices together

and after a meeting was over as in the manner of Friends we shake hands with people
and I looked into her eyes and said
would you like to buy a cup of coffee with me
and that was our first date
so there you go
see I didnt find her in a bar
little Ralphie had just received for his birthday a new soccer ball
and he was out in backyard kicking it
however he wasnt a very good soccer player at this point in his life
and he had inadvertently kicked it through the picture window of his neighbor mean old MisterSmith
MisterSmith was sitting calmly in his chair in his living room when the soccer ball crashed through the pane of glass knocking over a lamp on his table and startling old MisterSmith
Smith was a mean sonofabitch
and he looked out the broken window and held the soccer ball and yelled
you want this ball little boy
youll hafta come and get it and pay for the broken window
the end
oh same story
oh
these are in order arent they
alright it looks like little Charlie is refusing to take an umbrella from his mother
hes leaving I presume for school
his mothers looking sternly at him with the umbrella in her hand
but hes waving goodbye and seems content to go without it
however halfway down the street on his way to school the rain begins
little Ralphies covered with rain
hes wet
hes unhappy
hes stomping through puddles
he realizes hes made a tragic mistake
he gets home drenched looking unhappy
and his mother looks I asif
I told you so
and the final pane of the picture shows little Ralphie with an umbrella in the rain whistling a happy tune
presumably the story begins when Melissas cat Fluffy climbed up a tree and wasnt able to get down
she called her dad who was who thought he could climb up the tree with a ladder and bring little Fluffy down
but clearly he was chased by their neighbors dog
and consequently the ladder that his dad her dad was using to climb the tree fell down
so he was trapped on a branch
Fluffy was still on the branch
the dog is barking at the base of the tree
and some wise neighbor called like they should have called in the first place firemen
firemen rescue cats in trees
and in this case they most may hafta rescue the dad
the end
Im sorry
of onceuponatime there was a little girl who
the Disney with the bluebirds
oh yes
okay I dont believe I need to look at the book unless its its changed since
Cinderella was a poor girl who lived with her evil stepmother and her two evil stepsisters
Cinderella was young and lovely
but she was forced to work cleaning the cinders outof the fireplace
her two evil stepsisters were mean to her
never let her go out and socialize
the night of the ball at the local palace the stepsisters and Cinderella all thought they would love to be invited
however because Cinderella was a a cinder girl dressed in rags she was unable to go
however a fairy godmother appeared
granted her a wish
the wish being
can I go to the ball
the fairy godmother equipped her with a dress and shoes specifically little glass slippers and a pumpkin carriage to take her to the palace where she met and danced with the handsome prince but said
I hafta leave by midnight or I will turn into a pumpkin or my coach will turn into a pumpkin
the prince didnt believe her
but she ran down the steps reached the pumpkin the coach before it turned into a pumpkin pulled by mice but left one of her glass slippers behind
the next day the prince searched his kingdom from top to bottom looking for the owner of this delicate little glass slipper because she was such a lovely young thing
they went to the house of the wicked stepmother
the two wicked stepdaughters tried desperately to get their fat ugly feet squeezed into the little glass slipper but failed
and Cinderella was luckily was there
and the prince said
you try it on sweetheart
and it fit perfectly
and she lived happily ever after marrying the prince
and threw her stepsisters into the fire

a little boy is out playing ball
and hes kicking the ball
and the ball goes through a window
and we see that it goes right into a persons home
the person is sitting only a few feet away
and it knocks over the lamp
and the person gets up and looks to see what just happened
okay I well a mother and a little boy
and the mother is trying to give her son an umbrella
and he looks like hes about to leave the house
and he tells his mom

and he walks outside
and its raining out
and it starts raining even harder
and he runs back home
and was soaking wet

okay
okay
okay
alright
so Cinderella is the story of a young woman who
she is very poor
and she lives with her aunt and her three eps
well no actually it was her stepmother and her three stepsisters
and they they treat her very badly because shes the the steprelative
and they make her do all of the work around the house the cooking the cleaning and while they sit around and eat bonbons and take baths
and one day they let her come to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing this lavish party for his son and is going to be looking for a bride
and the stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince will want to marry one of her three daughters
and Cinderella hears about it
and the stepmother says youknow shes gonna hafta help to make the dresses for the for her daughters
and and she can stay at the house while they go to this fancy party
and they youknow all get all excited and get ready and go
and while Cinderellas at home cleaning up her fairy godmother comes and tells her that shes going to help her go to the ball
and she waves her magic wand
and the pumpkin turns into a stage coach
and her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown
and shes whisked away to this lavish party
and and shes also given these glass slippers to wear
and and she ofcourse she comes into this party
and nobody recognizes that its her including her stepmother and her stepsisters
and so shes this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party
and ofcourse the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the stepsisters
he dances with her
and they immediately fall in love
and she and they have a a dance
and in the middle of this dance she remembers her d her fairy godmothers instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken
and so she realizes that its almost midnight
and she runs from the palace
and in doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes
and she goes she gets home just in time
and youknow she when the when the stepmother and the stepsisters come home she youknow is is home in her tattered clothes again
and shes cleaning
and she asks them how the party went
and they theyre not happy because the prince didnt notice them ofcourse
but then the prince he wants to find this mysterious girl
and the only way that he has to find her is the glass slipper that he found
and but he decides hes going to go to every house to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on
and that will be the way he will identify this girl
and so he eventually arrives at the stepmothers house
and ofcourse the three girls run right over because they they know that theyre gonna one that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly
and ofcourse none of them do because their feet are too big
and they the stepmother figures out that the the shoe belongs to Cinderella
and she tries to hide Cinderella
but the I think it was the fairy godmother who who comes along and rescues Cinderella
or maybe it was the mice
anyway they they free Cinderella
and the prince sees her and has her put on the shoe
and ofcourse it fits
and everything is just wonderful
and they get married
okay
I would get two slices of bread
and I would put peanut butter on both slices of bread
and then I would take the jelly
and I would put it on one slice of the bread
and then I would put the one slice of bread on top of the other
fine
Spanish
no
my mother had MS
in her case it was medicine medical and therapy physical therapy
mhm
how much detail do you want
I got married in nineteen seventy six
the story of it or a story that goes
you just wanna hear me speak basically
at the reception back in those days I was not much of a hugging type person
my brother inlaw is very much a hugging type person
hes a big burly guy
so were going down the reception line
and when I got to him he xxx
I stuck my arm straight out at him like
no youre shaking my hand
oh okay
the boy kicks the soccer ball
the soccer ball hits the window
the soccer ball breaks through the window into the mans house
it knocks the lamp off the table
and now the man is looking out the window holding the soccer ball asif to find out where it came from
okay
okay
the mom appears to be telling the boy the child to take the umbrella
the child doesnt want the umbrella
he wanted no hes not
he goes out walking
and it starts raining
he turns around and runs back home
and hes all wet
and the mothers looking at him like
I told you so
and then he ends up carrying the umbrella and going out after all
weve all been there and done that
no I dont need an umbrella
when I was a kid umbrellas were like girl things
ERROR
we wear a raincoat or a hat or something
okay
the kitty is up in the tree
the little girl its obviously her kitty
shes got her hands out waiting for kitty
the man went up the tree apparently to get the kitty
the ladder has now fallen down
theres a dog down there barking
so the man cant jump down but the fire truck with the real leader has finally come to the rescue
a book ohboy
Cinderella
alright
yes
okay
let me make sure Im remembering the right fairy tale then
youknow we had these when I was a kid
oh yeah
xxx a little GoldenBook
comeon little GoldenBook
okay evil sisters evil stepmother
shes the good kid cleaning up
her sisters are snobs
xxx
you didnt alter the pages did you
no no no I mean the storyline no
well its kinda weird because we go from that to that
I dont I dont remember it skipping like that but its been a long time
she goes to the ball Bippityboppityboo
ohlord I can hear the music
she meets the handsome prince
he comes around to find out whose slipper glass slipper
he comes around to find out whose it is
and the evil mother hides her
yeah I guess so
okay
Cinderella is the daughter
Im not sure from the story if she was the adopted daughter or what she was
but Cinderella was the daughter that the rest of the family didnt particularly care for
there was she had a mother and ofcourse stepsisters who didnt like her
they were basically jealous of her
and when it came time to go to the ball they were not gonna let her go
they wouldnt give her any nice clothes etcetera because she wasnt worthy of going to the ball with them
along came her fairy d
so they go to the ball
and shes stuck at home by herself
along comes her fairy godmother who does her magic with her wand and gets her a beautiful gown turns a pumpkin into her carriage turns the mice into horses to pull the carriage
and they go off to the ball
she was obviously the most beautiful thing at the ball
the handsome prince fell for her
but she hadta leave by the stroke of midnight or all her magic went away
so she goes rushing down the stairs to leave at the stroke of midnight
and one of the glass slippers falls
and it gets left behind
she comes home
everything turns back to normal
nobody knows any better
but then the prince starts scouring the land with the glass slipper because he knows if he finds the girl who fits the magic glass slipper he can find his princess
gets to their house
the two stepsisters cant fit into the shoes
the mother insists there is nobody else
but loandbehold somehow Cinderella comes out and is found and fits the glass slipper beautifully
and there she has her handsome prince
and they live happily ever after
I would make it I would take two slices of bread
smear peanut butter on one
smear probably spread the jelly on the same one
and then put the other piece onto it
I think I speak English adequately
a few words here and there and a few words maybe phrases actually of French
but thats all
okay
when I was a little girl I may have been eight or nine
I dont know
and I was in a play
and the play was AliceInWonderland
and my father came from work to watch me
and somewhere there was a line about giving a dog a biscuit
and I said this line
I gave the dog a biscuit a bone a biscuit a bone
and I saw him laughing at me from the audience
and I will never forget
""
yeah
theres a young boy who is kicking whats probably a soccer ball
it could be something else too
and he kicks it and right into a window
breaks the window
goes right through the window practically on top of the lap of this guy whos sitting there
and he gets up and has the ball in his hand and is standing by the window and looking out
okay
the child is going outside
and the mother is standing the mother is standing there with an umbrella
and I dont know whether shes taking it away from him or giving it to him
in the second one it looks like hes reaching out for it although maybe he just gave it back to her
and hes outside now without the umbrella
and its raining on him
and hes not very happy about it
he goes back to his mother
shes not happy
and hes not happy
and then he takes the umbrella
puts it over his head
and he looks alittle happier because he took it and is not getting rained on
okay
""
so here we have a cat seems to be stuck in a tree
and a little girl is right below worrying about him
wanting to get him down
she has a bicycle
and its probably the daddy sitting up in the tree
whether he used the ladder to try to climb up there or climbs up without it I dont know but he seems stuck up there
the dog is on the ground barking at the barking
what hes barking at Im not sure if hes barking at the man
the firemen are coming with their ladder
the truck is sitting on the street in the back
theres a bird singing away in the tree
the daddy looks alittle abashed
yes
oh sure
okay
am I using the book with the pictures
you might want to cover that up
okay
now there is a picture of a handsome prince with his wonderful xxx standing by a fountain I think
and Cinderella is standing next to him
and he seemed very nice to her
and she xxx
but loandbehold outof the window the mean stepmother and her two mean sisters were watching
thats what happened
and they dont look happy about whats going on down there
then xxx
the prince is talking to his father
and they arrange to have a ball
and the invitation somehow get around
and the stepmother and the girls hear about it
and lets see
I guess she asks to go with them
Im trying to remember if that was pictured or not
and ofcourse they say no
and the fairy godmother comes
and she trains the mice into white horses
and she turns the pumpkin into the wonderful couch
coachq is the word
I guess she doesnt come home
and Cinderellas stepmother locks her out locks her in with the key
and the mice find the key and bring it all the way downstairs or all the way upstairs and let her in or let her out
and the prince comes around
and the shoe fits her
and they all lived happily ever after
well heres a neighborhood guy playing soccer
kicking the soccer ball
and oops he kicked it too hard
and it went right through his neighbors window into the neighbors lap while he was relaxing
and so then the neighbor looked out the window with the ball
and thats the end of these pictures but I imagine that he found the guy and asked him to repay or correct the mistake
oh
okay
I guess mom offered a young child an umbrella to go out
and the boy ofcourse said
no I just dont need this umbrella
and he goes out
and he starts walking
and he may be walking to school because he has a backpack
and its starting to rain
and its starting to rain really hard
and hes getting really wet
and hes really unhappy
so then he goes home to mom
and he walks in really sopping wet
and mom doesnt look too happy either because he is really sopping wet
and finally he takes the umbrella and goes to school
okay
the dog chased the cat up the tree as often happens
and the girl is very upset

so she tries to get her dad to the climb the tree to get the cat
and hes not too successful
okay

and hes having a good time
and hes kicking the ball
and ugh oops by accident the ball goes through the window of his house
where does it land
it lands right next to his father who is totally surprised because he hears the crash of the of the window first
and the ball lands practically in his lap
and dad picks up the ball
and he looks out the window saying
what is going on
he sees his son
and so dad is at the end here hes contemplating
well it was an accident

the young man here is going off to school
and his mom says

so dad climbs up the tree
and loandbehold the ladder falls down
now we have both the kittycat and dad stuck in the tree
and the little girl shes kinda worried about the cat there
and dads like
well Im stuck in the tree
so a neighbor has actually seen all this transpire and has called up the fire department to come and get dad and the cat down from the tree
the end
she had a she had a wicked stepmother and two not very nice stepsisters
and they were very mean to her
and they made her do all the housework
and they made her do all the cleaning
and they made her do everything
and she just kindof had a sad isolated life where I think her mother died when she was very young or something
and then one day I think a fairy godmother granted her three wishes
and I think she wanted to go to a ball where the prince was going to be and everything anything like that
so the fairy godmother set her up with all the with a turned a pumpkin into a coach
and a beautiful dress and beautiful shoes
but she hadta be back by midnight or everything was going to turn back into what it was originally
so she did all the work and got everything ready
and the sisters went off
and so she went off on her in her coach and went
and the she actually met the prince
and he fell in love with her
and they danced the night away
but then the stroke of midnight she hadta run
she left
and hes like
wait
and one of her glass slippers
she had glass slippers
one of her glass slippers got got left
and so she her clothes turned to rags again
she got home and
but the prince was so taken with her that he went all throughout the kingdom to find the person whose foot fit into that glass slipper
and when he came to the house the step the stepsisters tried to put their big feet into that slipper
and it didnt work
and then Cinderellas foot fit in there perfectly
and the prince like
oh then youre my true love
and she lived happily ever after
yes
I should tell you that
okay
I would take two pieces of bread
I would take peanut butter
and I would take a knife
and I would spread the peanut butter on the bread
and then
peanut butter and jelly sandwich you said
mhm
and then I would take a then I would take a knife and put some jelly on the sandwich
xxx so many peanut allergies in house that I take a spoon and put that on and then do that
and then I would put the top
and I would cut it
and I would serve it
okay
a young boy is kicking a soccer ball
and he accidentally kicks it through a window
the man sitting in the room hears and sees the soccer ball come through the window
and he retrieves the soccer ball and looks out to see who may have kicked it
oh thankyou
okay
should I start
a boys mother offered her son an umbrella
the boy refused to take the umbrella
when the boy went outside however it started to rain
and it rained hard
and the boy came home sopping wet
he regretted not taking the umbrella
the next time he went out he walked with the umbrella outside
thats okay
I guess you dont usually have a class when youre doing this
you need a soundproof room
yeah
okay
yeah
okay
a girls father climbed a tree inorderto retrieve a cat that got stuck up on the tree
in the meantime the fire department was called
and they came to rescue the cat and possibly the father
the girl was waiting there ready to catch the cat if it should jump down
and the dog was barking at the man at the top at the on a branch in the tree
oh outof batteries
no recharger or something
ah
nope
I do great speaking English
thats my native language
I speak a little bit of Spanish
Ive never had a stroke
serious illness
I dont consider it a serious illness
ongoing I guess chronic pain
yes
I have had yes
a serious illness
my mother has had Eosinophilic Fascitis
years ago at age forty eight
and has slowly gotten better from that
yeah she has done physical therapy to help improve her condition
she does massage twice a week
and she does a little bit of exercise but no medication
oh okay
okay so I just tell you what happened in picture one
okay
so there was a little boy who was kicking a soccer ball
and he kicked it outside
and it went into a window
and then it broke the window
oh I see
and then it hit a lamp
and then this man
oh okay
the ball landed I guess
the man that caught the ball
and he saw he looked out the window at the broken glass
okay
so in the first picture okay so the mom is gonna hand a little boy an umbrella
it looks like hes gonna go somewhere with a backpack on
then he goes outside
and it starts raining
oh he steps in a puddle
and his hairs wet
oh he came home
his hair his mom is angry at him
I think his mom is angry at him
maybe shes angry at him because his hair is wet
then he went maybe he forgot to use the umbrella
Im not sure
then he went back outside
and he used the umbrella
was that right
okay
ohgosh theres alot going on here
I see a and theres theres a cat in a tree
and lets see
the girl is trying to get her cat down
so maybe the dad climbed up the ladder to help get her cat down
oh then the ladder fell
maybe he used the ladder to get the cat down
then the ladder fell down
shes trying to catch this cat maybe
I dont know why these people are here
maybe theyre coming to help get the cat down
and I dont know why hes upset
I dont know what the dog is doing
is that it
how I would make one
I would use two pieces of bread
and I would put them down on the table
and then I would take the peanut butter outof the cabinet
and I would take the jelly outof the refrigerator where I keep it
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread
and then I would use a knife for that
and I would probably use the same knife and put it in the l or I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread
and I put the two pieces of bread together
and then I would cut them either in half or on a diagonal
and then that would be it
and then I would wrap it in cellophane
for one of the boys to take to school
and then Id put it in the freezer
because I make five at a time
okay
the boys kicking what looks like a soccer ball
only it goes through the window
breaks the window
and it alarms this man who notices whats happening
he looks out the window to see whos done it and whats happened
okay
well the boy I believe its a boy is leaving home
and his mother probably his mother is suggesting that he take an umbrella
she I think shes suggesting pretty strongly
he says no he doesnt need an umbrella
probably says its not gonna rain
walks out and it is raining
walks along further and its raining even harder
even perhaps windy because the rain is slanted
hes walking through puddles
he gets home pretty wet dripping
and his mother or the woman is pretty mad
got hands on her hips
she gives him the umbrella again I assume
and now hes walking out alittle happier with the umbrella over his head
this is a switch kindof
okay then the little the little girl here whos riding a tricycle apparently
and her the cat went up she either notices the cat up the tree or saw him go up
I think her father or somebody was trying to get up there to get the cat
but he got stuck
and he looks kindof dismayed
the dog here is barking up at the man in the tree stuck in the tree
and for all of this they the fire department has come out to rescue everyone with a ladder
and rescue the man and the cat
okay
okay

alright John is trying out for the soccer team
and he really wants to make it
and he has a soccer ball

he got too close to the house with his with his kicking
and he the ball he kicked the ball
and it flew in a direction he didnt really want it to go to
and it went through the window
it went through the window
and it just happened to be his father was sitting in the living room when the ball came through the window

and eventually they do find Cinderella
and the shoe fits
and they live happily ever after
two slices of bread a knife
and you put the jelly peanut butter on first
then put the jelly on top if you eat peanut butter
and put the slices of bread together
mhm
okay the boy kicked the soccer ball
and it flew into the window on the house next door probably and broke the window
and it fell inside the mans house
and it hit the lamp and broke it
and the man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid
trying to and the kid probably ran away
hes gonna go knock on his daddys door and say
pay me for my broken window
mama said to the little boy
its supposed to rain today
take your umbrella with you to school
and the little boy says
ah no
I dont need an umbrella
its not gonna rain on me
and then he walks to school
and it starts to rain
and it rains really hard
so he hasta run back home
and hes all soaking wet
and hes not happy
and his mothers not happy either
and he hasta change clothes probably
its hard to tell
and then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry
well the little girl has a cat that the dog chased up the tree
and then a nice man maybe her daddy came along
and he had a ladder
and he climbed up in the tree to get the cat
and then the ladder fell down
and then hes stuck in the tree
so somebody else watched this whole deal while the dogs still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody
and they came with their truck and ladder
not quite there yet but theyre getting there
and theres a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them
the cats on the other side of the tree
says
Im gonna catch the bird and eat her
and the firemen rescued them all
yes
thats interesting
I dont think I remember the beginning
I obviously dont remember alotof this
I dont remember any of these things from when I was a kid
I used to read science fiction
I still do
well lets see
if I remember Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl
the nice man took her home to his family or somebody
and the stepmother had already had daughters
and they took her in
but they treated her like a servant
and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff
and she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out to wear
and she was usually in the kitchen cleaning
and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball I think in honor of PrinceCharming or somebody
and the evil stepmother wanted her daughters to get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and be rich
and so they all got fancied up to go to the ball
and Cinderella wasnt asked if she wanted to go
and she wanted to go
and she was crying about it
and a good fairy godmother came along
Im not quite sure how she got there
and she was able to turn ordinary things and creatures around her into fabulous ones
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses
and she turned the mice into something
anyway and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers
and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left
and when she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her
and they danced the night away
and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry
then the fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning
and so she hadta be sure to leave by midnight
and she was a little late
and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach
and she lost a glass slipper
and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her I think
and she jumped in the coach
and it ran away they ran away from the ball
and it turned back into a pumpkin
and her clothes turned back into rags
and she had one glass slipper on her foot
and then the prince was very sad
and he wanted to find her
and he they took the glass slipper she had that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs
and they went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit
and the evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper
and it wouldnt fit cause they had big feet
and finally Cinderella got to try on the slipper
and it fit
and the prince and the was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry
he was in love with her
so he found out
they told him I guess
and all the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of Cinderella then
and she married the prince
and they lived happily ever after
the end
so were gonna do something alittle different
well oddly enough I never had peanut butter and jelly growing up
I still havent had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
it was not part of my growing up
but Id take two pieces of white bread
and Id put peanut butter probably if it were me Id put it on both pieces of bread
and then Id put jelly in the middle
and I happen to like well grape jelly I think would go good with peanut butter probably
strawberry is nice too
and then Id smush it together
and then Id cut it in half diagonally
I believe
we didnt eat peanut butter growing up
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all
occasionally I eat peanut butter outof a jar because its a protein
and I my stomach is growling at me youknow
adequate
a few words of French occasionally
I listen to people speaking Spanish
and youknow I picked up a word or two
and I usually can figure out what theyre saying when theyre trying to speak English
and people who speak
I dont know what language is kis that Pakistan
and that theres multiple languages
and I hear Arabic I people wherever I go
so I hear English thats accented that way
most of the time I can figure them out too
no
illness
well my daddy died of a heart attack
and my mother probably died of a stroke although they said heart attack
strokes ran in her family and heart attacks in his
and my mother had emphysema
I guess these days they call it COPD
she well her family were coal miners
and you talk about secondhand cigarette smoke
well my familys got secondhand coal dust
because they carried it in
and by the time she was in her early twenties she already had stuff that showed up on the tv xrays that they do because she worked in a school cafeteria
back in the days where they actually cook real food
thats mostly Imean Ive got glaucoma and youknow those kind of things but
thats well I have diabetes
that seems to run in the part of my daddys family
well I always wanted to do horseback riding
and a friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at RockcreekParkStables in the district
and she wanted to go but she didnt wanna go by herself so she asked me to go with her
and since Id always sorta wanted to do that I went with her
and they taught Englishstyle riding
and we took this introductory group of lessons
and she quit and I kept on
and in fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp
yeah
but it was lotsof fun
I learned alot
and I enjoyed that for a couple years until I had sortof a accident
they tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy
youknow wed be
and hed go like that at sound
and I usually went right off youknow
and so a couple of times and I dont land on my feet
so I sorta landed on my lower back and so thats caused me problems
and I didnt go back after that
but it was really nice while I did it
little bit of almost jumping
the best part was riding the jump trail in RockcreekPark which is a a horse trail that theyve let the little little usually trees fall across
and its rough
and if you take and my horse because he didnt like his neighbor horses
we were always at the end of the line
thats not a good place to be when other horses are moving along
because horses being herd creatures they wanna catch up
and stay with their good buddies
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles
and Im in the back of the line
and hes running to catch up
and its alittle more exciting being at the end of the line
but it was really it was really good
but now I do helicopters and its better
I presume you needed a special one for that is that right
extremely well
a little bit of French and a little bit of Spanish and some Yiddish
just the neuromyasthenia
it it meant I had a six month old daughter
and I was paralyzed
so I did hafta hire someone to help me
but I knew that very often people do die from that
but I live by
anything is possible
and and it works for me
it did take several years
and I did hafta have rehab which was not very effective so many years ago
and I I guess I must have had a residual from that because I was doing reasonably well
as a matter of fact I I was leading groups as we traveled and organizing trips and so on for MontgomeryCounty
but the I I did find I then needed two hip replacements
and recently I about two years ago I was in an auto accident
so I do use a cane now
but Im fine
and and and the daughter is fine
this is a tough one but Ill say it anyway
it was a sad one but it had a great impact on my entire life
I was eight years old
and we were extremely poor
and we were dispossessed from our apartment
and it was ice on the ground
and at that time when that happened I made up my mind that I will never be poor again
and that I will not rely on a man
that I can make it on my own
and I certainly have
okay heres a little boy whos having a good time
and he kicks the ball and unfortunately it breaks a window
and the the ball rolls into the a mans home
and hes very very disturbed over this
he looks at the window holds the ball and looks to see who kicked the ball
I want you to know Im enjoying this
this is my thing
mama is telling this little boy
its raining out
you hafta take the umbrella
and hes saying
aw shucks I dont need an umbrella
so he goes outside
and ofcourse it is raining
and hes annoyed with himself
and hes trying to hold his head to get outof the rain
he comes in
and he finally admits to his mother
yup I guess I need the umbrella
and he walks away with the umbrella
okay
a little girl was riding her bike
and the the cat was following her
and the cat ran up the tree
she comes back crying to the father and the mother
and the father says
dont worry about it
Ill get the cat outof the tree
and he takes the ladder
and he climbs the tree
and the ladder falls down
in the meantime a dog comes along and is barking at him
and the cat is also alittle afraid of that dog
so it doesnt come down
and the kids still crying
I want my cat
I want my cat
anyway either the man uses his cell phone or she cries to her mother
and they get the the fire people to use the ladder to get the cat down
yes
a little bit
okay
Cinderella lives in a home with a wicked mother and two ugly mean sisters
and shes really abused in every way
they take tremendous advantage of her
shes the cleanup person she wears rags and all that sort of thing
anyway they hear that theres a great ball coming up
and the two daughters and the mother are going to the ball
and ofcourse theyre gonna leave Cinderella home
they want Cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on
and so she does
and she thinks about the ball
and shes really very very sad
and she makes a wish
and the wish is that she can go to the ball
when a fairy godmother appears and tells her
yes you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight
and she says
okay I will
and the fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well
and she gets into this big pumpkin
what can I call it
anyway its its something that carries her to the ball
and when she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her
and she hears the midnight stroke
and she gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise
so she goes running down the steps
and she loses her shoe
and she gets home okay
the prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit
and it doesnt seem to fit anyone
and the the ugly the mean mother has him try on the the shoes on the two ugly daughters
and finally Cinderella comes down
and although the mother doesnt want him to he tries on the shoe
and it fits her
and I believe he he then wants to marry her
I would try and get good bread like whole wheat bread or something like that
and Id first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick
and then get raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on
and put the second slice on top of it
and then cut it in quarters for a young child
did you want something to raise it up
oh I think Im a very good English speaker
everybody tells me Im very articulate
just like a smattering of Spanish just really a few words
no
well I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from NewMexico to the east coast
it was such an immense change culturally
and we also we lived in a very rural area in NewMexico up in the mountains
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all
so when we came here it was absolutely shocking
Imean just the fact that they had sidewalks alone
they just amazed us
and the street lamps and everything
I think one thing thats different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money
its so much richer
and they can afford to do all of that youknow
we had alotof unpaved roads out there
ofcourse theres the theres alot sparser population
so alotof times theyre not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place
but here it was just amazing to us all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city
it was just indescribable the impact that it had on us
I think it took us years to really kindof overcome the culture shock
so I Imean I remember that period of my life all the time
what just the immense change that we underwent
in fact we had Spanish accents
very heavy
my parents always did their whole lives
but we had such a terrible time at school people teasing us and everything
and we really tried hard to emulate English speakers especially
I used to listen to DavidNiven for some reason
I was really crazy about him
and I wanted to sound like him
so youknow and it really was a it really it had a huge impact on us each in their own way
okay
alright
this little boy Tommy found this ball
oh yeah
found a soccer ball and decided to try his luck at kicking it around
so he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick
and sure enough it went through the his neighbors window
his neighbor was watching television
and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window knocks over his lamp
he looks out the window but theres nobody there
okay
theres Tommy again
his mother that morning knew that it was gonna rain
shed been listening to the weather channel
she told him to take his umbrella
no hes positive that theres not gonna be any problem
also he doesnt wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella
and he says goodbye to his mother
and hell be fine
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain
so he runs back
his mothers quite annoyed with him because shed argued with him
and he said it was not gonna rain
he feels bad
finally takes the umbrella and goes to school
okay
Susan was out playing with her dog
and the dog chased a a cat up into the tree
and oh I guess it was actually her cat
so she became quite upset about it
and her neighbor came out and said
well thats okay
dont worry about it
I have a ladder
and Ill get up there and get your cat
so he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground
and then he couldnt get down
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree
so somebody hadta call the fire department
and they came out and rescued the both of them
oh yeah
yeah
I dont remember these animals
I forgot what an involved story it is
okay
okay
Cinderella lived with her father and her mother in this little village
when she was very young her mother passed away
it was just her and her father
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry
he met somebody there in their village
and he remarried
and then sadly he passed away very shortly after that
so she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters
and it they turned out that the stepmother was not very nicely she was not very nice to Cinderella
so she made Cinderella into kindof a little maid who hadta sweep out the
sorry
yeah
its another one of these turtlenecks
these are my favorite things
so they turned her into a little maid
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her sisters her stepsisters and her stepmother
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant
she was very unhappy
but she didnt really know what else to do
there was nothing else she could do
then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son the prince who was
they were trying to find a suitable bride for him
so they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoipolloi of the area
so the sisters decided theyd go
and at first Cinderella thought that she might go
and they laughed at her
told her she didnt have anything to wear
she was not pretty
so they went to the ball
she was very sad sitting among the cinders
and her fairy godmother shows up appears and tells her shell get it all set for the ball
so she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses
and I forget what she made her dress outof
so she goes to the ball
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers
so she goes to the ball
and she meets the prince
the prince falls madly in love with her because shes the most beautiful girl there
but the fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was
so she saw midnight approaching
so she hadta leave suddenly the prince
youknow she hadta run away from him and hide run away jump in her carriage
and just as she got back she jumped outof the carriage
and everything turned back to what it was before
so she al thought
well thats gonna be my one night of happiness
but Ill always remember it
but the i she had left behind the way she was running outof the castle she had left behind her glass slipper
the prince had run been running around trying to find her
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper
so he told his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper
so they went around to all the villages
and they they had them try had the women who might possibly be that Cinderella try on the glass slipper
so they got to the house of Cinderella
and they asked her
how many girls do you have
no I only have two
because they had found out what was going on
they were having them try on this glass slipper
so she hid Cinderella forced Cinderella to stay inside her room
and she they tried the slipper on to the the stepdaughters
and the first one was was the heel was too big
so the mother said
no no that itll fit
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel
but it still didnt fit
and they tried on the for the second woman
and but her toe is too big
and the mother says
no no it fits
and she cut off her toe in secret
but it still didnt fit
so they said
no this isnt her these arent their shoes
so then they were leaving
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there
I dont remember exactly who what clued them into that
so they insisted on looking around
and they found Cinderella
and sure enough they tried her the shoe on her
and it fit
so they took her back to the castle
she married the prince
and she was very forgiving
she brought her sisters to live with them
well when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I toast the bread
and then I let it cool off
and then on one side I smear the peanut peanut butter
then on the other side I smear the jelly
and then I put them together
how do I what
very well
excellent
well I have noone to talk Yiddish to so I dont know whether I should include that
well I I can speak some Yiddish
but theres nobody to converse with so I dont know whether that would qualify
no
would you consider Alzheimers
yes my husband
what
well it started about six years before he passed away
I noticed that he was very forgetful
he couldnt remember what building we lived in and other things
and even driving his driving was erratic
and I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and and canasta that he no longer wanted to play
he didnt want to we used to square dance quite a bit
and then he decided
he never gave me a reason
and at first I didnt quite understand
and he dropped out of alotof the things
he was a volunteer at the KennedyCenter
and he loved it there and they loved him
and the next thing I know he wasnt going anymore
and I tried to figure out why
and he said
well they want me to use a different technique when I write up a sale
write it sothat he would write it write the sales for by hand
and then they put it in the computer
so the final straw came when I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him
and that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts
and he got very confused with the different women
they all happened to be black
and so he mixed them up
and when one wanted to feed him hed push her hand away
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldnt handle it and I couldnt handle it
and thats when he went into a nursing home
and he remained there
and he deteriorated quite a bit
he forgot how to walk
he forgot how to teach to feed himself
he didnt remember whether where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands
and so they took good care of him
he was always neatly dressed and clean outof bed until he reached the point where he stopped eating
and he eventually passed away peacefully
Ive had so many happy memories I dont even know where to start first
just one
I cant think of anything outstanding
I guess the day I got married
when my children were born
Im trying to think of
one one really stands out
we were fortunate enough to have my parents babysit for the children so we could get away
and we went to Jamaica for a week
and that was one of the most wonderful enjoyable vacations we ever had
the weather was fine
the food was great
the the entertainment
the just being together and
from all weve been on many vacations but that one really stands out
the scenery the beach in front of you and
it was so enjoyable
that was the only time that I remember crying the night before we hadta go home because I said
I dont want to leave this place
so I guess thats the one
have you been have you been
well its one thing to go with friends
but its another thing to go with a husband
thats thats what was perfect
this one here
is this supposed to be one story
or is each picture supposed to be a story
well little Johnny is outside playing
kicking a ball
seems to be having a good time
and loandbehold the ball goes through a window and it breaks
and it goes through the window practically onto the lap of this man whos
is that a baby there
thats not
it knocks over a lamp
is that it
or is it
I see two feet here
is there
ERROR
and hes sitting here
now this is his hand
but that looks like another leg here
and that also looks either like a lamb
xxx a chair
what is this round thing over here
is that a lamp shade
and the man is quite surprised
and he is wondering could his son have done that
and he decides to go to the window and check
and theres nobody there
so he doesnt know who to blame for this
and I dont know
xxx
well this mother who tells her son that he needs to take an umbrella because you are going to school and youll get wet
and he said
no its not going to rain
and he insists upon going without the umbrella
and loandbehold as hes walking it starts to rain
and his shoes get wet in the puddle
his head is wet
he comes home drenched
and his mother is quite upset by this
now why havent you listened to me young man
dont you know that mothers know best
and he is a little bit remorseful about that
and as a result of listening to his mother the next time he goes out he takes the umbrella
mother is happy
he is not getting wet
and everybody is very content with their life
for some reason dad has decided to climb up the tree
hes out on a limb
and maybe he went to rescue the little pussy cat that was there because his daughter is quite upset that the cat is up on the tree and cant get down
now the dog is barking because he would like dad to come down
somewheres
and were in the midst of a serious rescue
do we pacify the dog
do we take dad down
or do we rescue the cat first
what a dilemma
these firemen really have a big job on their hands
Im just wondering who comes first
yeah I think so
according to this book
flipping pages
I dont remember who this man is
the father is the
okay
the best I can
Cinderella had a stepmother
two stepsisters
Cinderella was beautiful
the two stepsisters were mean ugly vicious just like the mother
and she did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just indulged themselves
and then they announced that the the king would have a ball in the palace
and everybody was invited
ofcourse Cinderella was not
and she would have liked to have gone to the ball
and along came the fairy godmother
and he s
well get you dressed up and get you to the ball
and she got into a beautiful gown and a a coach
but that she would hafta be back by midnight
Im improvising
and off she went to the ball
and the PrinceCharming asked her to dance
and she danced with him
and I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother
and at the stroke of midnight Cinderella knew she hadta return home
so she quickly ran down the steps to get into the coach and in the process lost one of her slippers
and she got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters
well PrinceCharming was enamored with her but he didnt know who she was or where he could find her
so he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball
and when they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into them into the shoe
and it wouldnt work
and Cinderella they would not let Cinderella do it
however the prince or the attendants said
why dont we have this this young lady try on the shoe
and they finally did
and the shoe fit
and thats when the PrinceCharming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball
and she was she went back to the palace
and the the king granted a marriage for his son PrinceCharming and Cinderella
and they were married
and they lived happily ever after
well I guess you would take two slices of white bread
smear some peanut butter on one side some jelly on the other
put them together
see that they the top one matches the bottom one
cut them up across in a diagonal
put them in some Glad bag
and then give it to your son
what are choices
well
probably not good
when you say when you say the ability to tell a story like from like creative
o if the will the ct pictures be making a picture
probably
no
no
when you say serious illness
you only thinking about things like strokes
that kind of not like cancer
okay
cancer yeah
my sister had cancer my mother my father
oh yeah well she she was in a
what is it what kind of study where youre clinical
yeah
she lives in NewYork
she was advantaged
and it it include I think chemotherapy and a whole bunch of a whole bunch of stuff
and she still goes back I think every six months for checkups and
oh yeah
she had a hysterectomy
and that was the end that was it got all the cancer
but she still hasta go back youknow for
I have such problems with that
ohgosh
ohlord
something happened
yeah I went
I have such problems creating stuff and tell it
youknow when somebody says like
I went on a cruise
but I can only probably say I liked the food something
youknow yeah like entertainment
thats about it
but but but really describing everything and that kinda thing Im never good at
okay
theres this child playing with this kickball or something
breaks out the window
person sitting in his house probably doesnt have tv or something
and the ball comes in
and then looks like he just looks out the window to see who there
""
okay
it looks like maybe she tried to give him an umbrella
yeah I think he because hes out there he decided he didnt want to take it
he goes out and gets wet
walks a little bit
decided to come back
and I guess she looks like shes scolding him I guess
and hes looking
yeah okay
and then he takes the umbrella and goes xxx
it look like it didnt start at the beginning
the cats in the tree
and it looks like thats what happened what should have happened first
I dont know why shes standing there with her hands up
alright anyway then I guess he goes up to get the cat down
and I guess but it doesnt look like hes getting the cat down
hes just sitting there
oh wait a minute
I dont know
and then the dog
oh looks like hes barking at the man
so maybe the mans scared to come down
I dont know
and then finally I guess somebody calls the fire
yeah I guess
I probably dont remember all of this
I I absolutely dont
I probably remember very basic because I dont even know what theyre doing
xxx
okay
Im not very good at any of this
ohgod
wow
any of any of I really dont remember all of this of Cinderella
all I remember of Cinderella is
should I read be reading from the bottom
""
ohgosh
okay
let me just say what I know about Cinderella
she had these stepsisters I think
and I think they made her do all the work
and according to that it looks like she had that animals were her friends
and Im not even sure how she got to to the ball to go to the ball but she did
and and I think she was supposed to be back by midnight or then she turned into a pumpkin
so that thats not it
I dont remember that
and after thats kinda what I remember
and I I think she almost didnt make it back
but I think she did
and and I dont even remember all the stuff about meeting the prince
but according to that youknow some kinda way she married met the prince
and they got married
and and had the animals at the at the wedding
I dont know
ugh
okay
Id have two pieces of bread
I would put the peanut butter on one slice
and let me see
I havent made one lately
but I think I would probably put a jelly on the other slice
and then just put it together
I think I do fairly well
I think very well
not fluently
Ive not had a stroke
and I guess no Ive not had a serious illness
my sister had a mild stroke years ago
and this is the same one who just had cardiac surgery about a month ago
mhm
well shes still in the process
shes still shes in a nursing home now
they took her
and that was all part of the plan
she had the surgery
she had mitral valve whatever or a leaky valve or something
and so shes in a nursing home now
and shes feisty as ever
so yeah shes recovering and probably driving everybody crazy
thats off the record
a happy memory
and Ive done this in training so I I didnt pull this one out from outof the air
I was the president of the black alumni association at Collegename in
no I was the vice president many years ago
and we had the first black president of Collegename while youknow I was in the post of this office
and so we invited him for the community to meet the community
and I literally organized everything
and my father had a liquor store then
and I had the people in the liquor store the liquor business contribute
and I think people smoked then
PhillipMorris contributed cigarettes
and I had the chemical bank contribute money and had all kinds of youknow cheese
it was one of the best events they have ever had at the school
and they have said that
it was well attended by the whole community of Collegename
we did an instulement
we did everything for this guy
its still one of the things I like best
it really was
exactly
and even the president said
you should really have been the president
and I could have been
I just didnt want the job
I didnt realize I was gonna do his work anyway
right
so the little boy went out to play kickball that day
I forget what its a soccer ball I guess
and he never expected to when he kicked the ball that it went through the window somebodys window and broke it
went in
the gentleman who was in the house was shocked by the noise he heard
and he sees a ball coming
and he went to the window to find out who did this because he was gonna go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games
oh okay just the beginning middle and an end
okay so then I hafta look at it so you dont hafta hear all my thoughts
theres a mother getting ready to send her child off to school
she tried to urge him to take an umbrella
obviously shes heard the weather report
he went and he didnt listen to his mother
so he went out and got wet
when he came back he looked very sad
and his mother looked very annoyed
and the next time he took an umbrella
theres a whole lot going on here
well okay
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside
and he and he hes up on a tree for some reason
oh theres a ladder so he was obviously trying to do
oh he was trying to get her cat and from the ladder
and he the ladder fell
hes stuck up in the tree
the daughter is still upset because the cats still up the tree
the dog is barking because everythings outof sorts for him
and so the fire engine comes with a ladder ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them
dont do that again
yeah
not one of my favorite
I forgot all about this the wicked witch and her stepdaughters
okay you hid the text
you dont want me to know the text
I gotta I gotta make up my own
and cinderq means shes sweeping up the cinders from the chimney
and the ugly stepsisters
I dont remember this
they are talking about how theres some young lady theyve never seen before
I dont really remember
oh the invitation whatever
I dont really remember it too well
not one of my favorite stories but anyway
so she the wicked witch talks about the party
the sisters dont want her to go
isnt that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly
and then the xxx fairy godmother helps her go
she captures the eye of the prince charming
she hasta leave before midnight
he doesnt know where she is
shes in her tatters
and her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin
the wicked godmother locks her in
but then they bring the key
and they take the key to the cellar
they try every maiden in the town whatever they call those old things parish to see who the shoe belongs to
and it belongs to Cinderella
and she marries the prince and gets prince and gets
lives happily ever after
Cinderella is this shes living with her wicked the wicked stepmother
I guess its her stepmother
I dont know where her father is
and the stepmother has these two not attractive daughters
and Cinderella shes very pretty but shes left in tatters and rags
her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the youknow the cinders from the whatevern
and the fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor
and so one day there was going to be a ball
the king
and he makes this announcement
and she wants to go aswellas his daughters her daughters
but theyre figuring whom you youknow
but her fairy godmother comes along to the rescue and tells her she will make youknow turn
get me a pumpkin and some rats whatever
and the pumpkin will be your coach
other rats will be your coachmen I think
she gets her a great dress or something to wear
her hair they dont even talk about all that
and so she goes
and the prince is dancing with all the young ladies but she captures his eye
and he dances with her
and ofcourse its love at first sight
and she realizes at the stroke of midnight she hasta be home
so she runs out there before he can find out who she is
and in running she drops one of her slippers
she runs into the coach which turns into a pumpkin before she can get home I think
the rats turn the coachmen turn into rats and whatever
so the the king the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to
hes gonna go to every house and see if the shoe fits
and the fairy godmother is like shes trying to get her daughters now I remember this their big feet into the shoes
no it doesnt work
and they say
is there anyone else
we see this young lady
oh it wouldnt be her
but its her youknow
its so she sits down
and they the shoe fits perfectly
he knows hes found his princess
and he whisks her off
and they get married
and they live happily ever after
thats a long story
okay
how I would make it
from the word goq
go to the cabinet and take down a jar of peanut butter
Id probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something
so Id go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out
and go to the refrigerator where I also keep my bread
take out two slices of bread
Id put them open them there
I would take the peanut butter first
and smear it on the on one side of the bread
pretty thick though
I like alotof food
then Id take the jelly and put that on over top of the peanut butter still on the same side
and I would take the other side and put it down
and then I would take it and cut it in half
and then I would start eating it
I speak pretty well I think
the language is certainly
no
no
ERROR
I mentioned the appendix the ruptured appendix
I think that was
well I was outof work for about eight weeks
I was in the hospital for about fourteen days
yeah
I was pretty sick
my current favorite story is a day last year
it might have been the year before last
it was Christmas time getting towards Christmas time
and I was to meet some friends for lunch at Zaytinia downtown
and I realized when I got down there that I was an hour early
it was kinda cold
DC sets up a a kind of a Christmas bazaar down on GStreet
I guess its GStreet
and they had closed the street to traffic
and there were wonderful little kiosks along the street with really nice stuff
and I was kinda cold so I bought a wool beret
and then I felt fine
I walked around
and I walked I was walking up SeventhStreet
and up ahead of me on the right in descending letters it said RegalCinema
just across the street was another sign also descending that said LegalSeafood
and on the window of the bank facing me right below that sign was coming soon EagleBank
I love I love Washington
okay
I make up a story
okay
okay weve got a a a perfectly okay little boy playing with a soccer ball
and he kicks it
and it goes through the window of the house probably his own house
and it breaks the window knocks over a lamp and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father
who then picks up the ball stares out the window and probably swears at the at the little boy
this is another little boy
theyre alotof trouble
this little boy does not want to take an umbrella to school
you can tell hes going to school because hes got his backpack on
and his mothers trying to give him the umbrella
and hes saying
nope
and he walks out the door and waves goodbye
and it starts raining on him
and he runs home
and hes soaking wet
and his mother is frowning at him
and the next thing you see is him with walking with an umbrella
okay
the cat went up the tree
the little girl wants her kittycat down
and the father clearly tried to go up the tree and get it
and he got up there
and the ladder fell
okay
Cinderellas father married for the second time when Cinderellas mother had died
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters
and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her clean the fireplaces hence the name Cinderella
and do other menial work
at some point the prince of the whatever principality it was was in need of a wife
said his father and the I dont know minister of whatever marriages
so they cooked up a scheme to have a ball
and they sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality
Cinderella got one but she ofcourse could not did not think she could go because she didnt have the clothes or even transportation
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with white horses and a footman and soforth
so she was able to go to the ball
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight
she went to the ball
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love
midnight came
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be outof there
so she hurried away
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her
she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth
but she managed to get home anyway
and later the the prince was very depressed
he had fallen in love with this woman
and she had disappeared
all he had left was a glass slipper
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else
so the his father who I guess was the king and the minister of marriages went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on
and ofcourse it would not fit anyone at all including the two unpleasant stepsisters
eventhough I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit try to fit in
but it still didnt work
and it got blood all over the place
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper
it was Cinderella
and ofcourse she was just a sladeyn
but he insisted that she try it on
and sure enough it fit
so he had found his bride
and there was great celebration throughout the land
and they got married and lived happily ever after
how I would make a peanut butter and
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it
but I you would I would take two pieces of bread
and Id put peanut butter on one using a knife
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread
and then Id put the two together
and I would probably slice it
because it would be for a kid Id probably slice it in quarters
well not bad
Ive given several speeches
haltingly
Ive had prestroke incidents
TIAs
serious illness yes
I was flat on my back for a year at age ten with rheumatic fever
the days before there were antibiotics
so there was no way to cure it
and I was one of the few who survived at that time
that was one of the close calls
well I I was when when they told me I could get up I was very happy
and I was gonna go out and play baseball
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed
I hadta learn to walk again
so I got into all sorts of athletic activities
my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again
and he also bought a one arm printing press because he wanted me to exercise on this printing press
so I went into business printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve
but I I maintained some form of athleticism all the way up until up up up until the time that I enlisted in the in the navy
I was a long distance runner in school
I played basketball with half hour quarters
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time laughs
and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and got into as much of that as I could
and I think it had a salutary effect
thats the naval air core flight test which is the toughest physical
its four days of physical examinations aswellas academic
you hadta be at the top top ten percent of your class to get started
then came the physical
that was a challenge
and so thats why I got into the navy
yeah theres no theres no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever
the few other people who survived the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort
and the first time I went through the navy exam they said
well youve had rheumatic fever
you have a heart condition
get out
so when I went back again I I checked to make sure I didnt
and then I went back again
and I didnt fill out the paper first
I went through the exam and got through got to the end and they said
well have you had any conditions
yes rheumatic fever
well you you cant be here then
and I said
well I just passed your exam
well alright if you wanna go go
oh theres so many
what kind of a story do you wanna hear
well there there was there was one interesting time when I was when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasnt working
we we had a we had a good program by all appearances
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms
and they looked like an army
and theyd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight
and still malaria
why
so I went out looking for answers
and on this one occasion I drove for across this desert area for about oh musta been six hours
Id been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark
and Im getting alittle concerned
I was also warned about the Danakil people also called Afars
very no I dont think youd call it hostile
but they didnt have many friends because their their the way they qualify for marriage
they had these mass weddings that were made
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body
so after about six hours we happened upon this little group of tuplesn round mud houses
and we stopped the Landrover
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars
I thought
boy I shouldnt be here
and it turned out that about a third of the community maybe more were down with malaria
and they assumed that I was a physician because theyd the only white people they had seen before were physicians
just by sheer accident I had a car full of medication
so for about the next two hours I was a physician laughs
peering under eyelids and and baby bottoms and and administering this medicine
and at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy
and suddenly the chief appeared
seven feet high long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests
I said
whats that
they said
smoked camels milk
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days
I said
apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but
and the driver kicked me and he said
youve been doing fine up until now FirstnameJ
dont ruin it
so we had smoked camels milk
its better than PeptoBismol
it really works
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds
and the chief got a big smile on his face
it all ended well
I dont know whether this is in your interview or not
but at my age I very often forget the word that I want to say
and its getting alittle worse laughs
names especially
well the dad sends the son out to get alittle exercise
and he finds the soccer ball ending in his lap
and he looks out there and he says
good shot son
end of story
oh this reminds me of my childhood
mom wants son to take an umbrella with him
and he says
I dont need that
its just something to get in the way
and is surprised on his trip by running into a rain storm
he comes home drenching wet
mother says
I told you so
and son has learned a lesson
just like my childhood
this this is an instant right outof my life
girls girls cat has crawled up into the tree
and the dad says
well Ill go fetch it
why is the dog barking
I dont know
possibly because theres a man in the tree
and in the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder
somebody called for help
here comes the firemen to get him outof the tree
this happened to the fellow next door to me
when I had a house nearby he got up on the roof to repair it and accidentally kicked down the ladder
and he called me over and said
can you pick the ladder up
and I said
well not for a while
I wanna call the neighbors here
maybe I can charge admission to see this
mhm
vaguely
this goes way back
wow I dont remember this version
yeah
these these two first two pages I dont remember at all
xxx
""
good lord
this is gonna be tough to remember
flipping though book
something missing here
oh there it is
whats with the key
I dont remember that part
humming
and I dont remember those first two pages
but I gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who lives on an estate
and is is to have a ball maybe coming out party
I dont know
is that the way the story goes
mhm
well as I recall Cinderella and and her sisters were all workers in this estate
and she being the youngest one was the most discriminated against
the others treated her badly
she always got the worst tasks to perform and longed for a different life
I dont remember the bit about the key her
her sister locks her in the room
I dont know
well that comes alittle later
a fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because shes been such a good person
and the arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight
and at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her
but then hasta flee on schedule to avoid the being converted back into a chambermaid
and in the process loses her shoe
the handsome gentleman upon upon discovering the shoe determines hes gonna look for a person that that that fits
and the evil sisters are determined its gonna be one of them
so that must be where the key comes in
they lock her room
I dont know I dont recall how she gets out
but at any rate its eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits
and everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters
almond butter
absolutely
well I usually put almond butter on one slice of bread and and jelly on the other and fold it
very good
average
no
Im doing very well thankyou

I would first get the peanut butter outof the cabinet
I would get the jelly outof the refrigerator
Id take them back over to the counter
Id pull out a plate come over and get a knife then go over and get the bread outof the bread bin
take out two slices
and I would put the peanut butter on first one slice and then the jelly on the other
and then fold them and combine them together
okay
I see a boy out on the field
and he is kicking a soccer ball
and the boy is kicking the ball into the air
and it seems like the ball is in the second picture going through a window the window of a house
not sure if its his house or a neighbors house
but its breaking the window and going inside
to the third picture where there is a gentleman who is sitting in a chair
dont know if thats a family member father or a neighbor
but it breaks through the window
and the ball comes right at him
and the man in the picture seems to be alot older
probably very scared and startled
and he going into the fourth frame picks the ball up and looks out the broken window to to see if he could see who kicked the ball through the window
I see a a lady and a smaller child
I do not know if its a mother daughter
the lady is holding an umbrella
they seem to be talking
and in the second it seems to be a little girl but not sure
the second frame they seem to be continuing the discussion
and the older lady seems to be holding the umbrella and listening to the child
and it seems like the child is discussing the fact that he or she does not need the umbrella
and the child goes out into the outside in frame three
and they notice he or she notices its starting to rain
and he or she puts her hand out and feels the raindrops
and this childs going somewhere because theres a backpack on his or her shoulder
and in frame four the rain is coming down alot harder
the child is panicking and turns the other way and puts their hand over their head and is running presumably back to the house
in frame five the little boy or girl meets the lady again
Im presuming its the mom
and hes soaking wet
and the mother presumably gives the child an umbrella
and the child goes back outside in the rain with the umbrella open and goes off to wherever theyre going
okay here
it is a picture of a man in a tree
along with the man in the tree theres a cat and a bird
and theres a dog at the base of the tree barking up
and theres a little girl underneath the branch where the cat is sitting
and her tricycle is there along with a ladder
and to the right of the tree the fire department two fire men are bringing a ladder presumably to rescue the cat from the tree which the older gentleman seems to be trying to rescue
but from the look on his face has not succeeded
and the little girl is very upset because she thinks the cat is endangered
okay Cinderella was a young lady who lived with her two stepsisters and stepmother
and they treated her very badly and made her do alotof work
and one day a gentleman came to their house and announced that there would be a ball that the king was having for the prince to find a wife a princess for the prince
and they were all very excited
and Cinderella thought she was going
but her mother stepmother said
no shes not going
just the two other sisters were going
and she was very sad
and they got ready to go to the ball and left
and as Cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses
and they went to the ball
but the fairy godmother said
you hafta be home by twelve oclock or everything will disappear at twelve oclock
so she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time
and the prince fell in love with her at the ball
and it was just about twelve oclock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes crystal shoes at the ball
and she barely made it home
and poof the carriage and horses turned back into the pumpkin and mice
the prince wanted to find her
took the shoe and made a decree that theyd check every girl in the village until Cinderella was found
and they came to the house
and her two stepsisters they tried the shoe on but it wouldnt fit
and they finally found Cinderella
and they put the shoe on Cinderella
and it fit
and Cinderella was reunited with the prince
they got married and lived happily ever after
fine
no
no
anyone I know
yes
my brother inlaw had cancer
and oh serious illnesses
friends that have Ive had friends at work who had illnesses
one of them died of cancer
in the two cancer situations there was nothing to do to get better
it was just youknow the progression of the disease
oh the birth of my children which is a happy a happy occasion and one of the best things in my life
so that was those were those times were both exciting
and then their childhood and all the antics that go with that
okay a young boy is out in the yard playing soccer
hes in his front yard playing soccer
and he kicks the ball
and it goes through his neighbors window into the neighbors family room where the neighbor is sitting there watching television
and it goes right in to where the neighbor is sitting
and the neighbor is jumping up
he jumps up to find out where that soccer ball came from
he looks out into the yard to see who kicked the soccer ball
okay
okay little Johnny is getting ready to go off to school
and his mother as as hes getting ready to walk out the door his mother says
dont forget your umbrella
and he tells his mother
I dont need an umbrella
and he says
bye mom
I dont want an umbrella
Ill be fine
he gets outside
hes walking
and it starts to rain
and it rains harder and harder and harder
so he turns around
and he runs home and goes inside
and hes drenched
and his mother asks him
whats wrong
and he says
I need my umbrella
so then she gives him the umbrella
and he takes it and goes out back outside in the rain where he isnt going to get wet anymore
but I believe he has changed his clothes first before he goes back outside because he goes outside dry
and he stays dry with the umbrella
okay
everything I see
okay
okay
Fluffy the cat has been chased up the tree by the family dog
and little Lucy whose cat it is sees her cat up in the tree and tells her dad who comes out and climbs up into the tree with a ladder
but the ladder falls down
so hes stuck up in the tree
the cat is still up in the tree
the firemen come to help get the cat outof the tree and her dad outof the tree
so the firemen have arrived
and theres help thats come to help get the cat outof the tree
yes
yes
so I can use details eventhough there were no pictures about them
oh okay
so Cinderella
her father remarried a woman after her mother died
and this woman had two daughters
and so Cinderella came to live with her father and her stepmother and two stepsisters
and then her father passed away
and she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters
so they were very mean to Cinderella
and she became like a housekeeper for them
she did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked
and and they treated mistreated her
so one day there was a ball given by the king and queen to find a suitable wife for their son the prince
so the invitation came
and the stepsisters were all excited
but poor Cinderella she couldnt go
she didnt have the clothes
her stepmother and stepsisters said she wasnt invited to the kings ball
so she she wished she could go to the ball
but she had no way to do that
and she was very sad
and so the night of the ball the stepsisters get to go to the ball
theyre all dressed up
theyre very fancy and and ready to go to the ball
and out the door they go
Cinderella is down in the basement
and shes crying
and allofasudden her fairy godmother appears and asks why shes crying
and she says she wished she could go to the ball
and so the fairy godmother said that she could
and she fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into carriage drivers
and they had she had horses for the carriage
and she casts the spell
and Cinderella has a beautiful dress
and she her hair is beautiful
she has a beautiful dress
and she says
you will go to the ball
go to the ball
but one one rule is that at twelve oclock midnight you must be home by twelve oclock because all of this magic is going to go away
Cinderella goes off to the ball
she gets there
the prince becomes smitten with her when he sees her
hes dancing with her
her stepsisters are just seething because who is this who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with
they wanted to be chosen by the prince
and the night is going wonderfully
and then she hears the clock strike twelve
and she remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken
and she runs out and down the stairs leaving the prince behind
and as shes running down the stairs one of her glass slippers comes off
because when the fairy godmother cast the spell she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing
one of them gets left behind on the steps
and she runs home
and she she gets home before youknow as the spell is being broken
well the prince is very smitten with her
and he wonders who this beautiful woman was
and he wants to find throughout the kingdom where this m who this woman is
so he sets out he finds the glass slipper on the steps
knows it belongs to her
and he sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper
who does that shoe belong to
so they go throughout the kingdom trying the glass slipper on all of these women
and noone can wear the glass slipper
it fits noone
so they finally get to the house where Cinderella is living
but shes downstairs
and theyre keeping her in the basement because they know that the prince is coming
and they dont want her out youknow out and about where she could talk with him
and he tries the glass slipper on her two sisters
and it does not fit
and hes wondering
is there anyone else that this could be youknow this shoe could fit
and so Cinderella they realize that Cinderella is there
and he asks the the the the kings the princes assistant asks for her to try on the shoe
she tries the shoe on
and its a perfect match
and he takes that news back to the prince
the prince summons Cinderella
he realizes she is the the young lady that he was smitten with
and they are married
and they live happily ever after
and she never hasta be the housekeeper for her stepsisters again
and so they live happily ever after
I would get a loaf of bread
and get the peanut butter outof the cabinet and the jelly outof the refrigerator
and I would remove two slices of bread from the loaf of bread
I would open the peanut butter jar and take peanut butter on a knife and spread it across the bread
then I would spread open the jelly and spread jelly on top of the peanut butter
and then take the second slice of bread and put it on top of the first slice that has the peanut butter and jelly on it
okay
I do very well speaking English
Im a native English speaker
Ive been speaking since I guess the normal age
when do kids start to speak
a couple of
young very young
and Ive been reading pretty young
Ive learned sortof selftaught myself to read when I was about four
so I was reading pretty well by kindergarten
my speech is I think fluent and generally understandable
I talk alittle fast sometimes
thats about it
no not really no
not that I know of
yes my mother had a stroke
and my grandfather had two small strokes
my grandfathers strokes or my mothers
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four
so she was very young
they think it was because she had blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx in her in her atria
and then she youknow unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid
and it basically took out essentially a fistsized portion of her left hemisphere
so its left her pretty severely impaired
my grandfathers strokes were smaller
I believe they were right hemisphere
he had some serious apraxia
but he had no evidence of aphasia
he was still able to read and write and did not make alotof effort to speak
I was fairly young
and he was hemiparesis and used a wheelchair
but again he also just was very stubborn
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all
he just sortof refused to do it
so he kindof just lived in his own head for the last maybe ten years of his life
shes been pretty good
its been ten and a half years now almost eleven years
yeah its been a long time
shes been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then
initially she did about a month
initially she was after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute
so she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname
she was there for about a month
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks
and actually no sorry she went home
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting
and then after that went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT and got to about the
she was not as cooperative with that
she found it very uncomfortable
and right and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress
especially given that she was not willing to to work at home besides doing range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own
shes very good about that
so we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay outof physical therapy
and she shes doing that
and then but we we continue to do speech therapy
weve done it here for at this point I guess almost ten years
and shes done a mix of group and individual
and she goes to an adult daycare program where shes very social
we dont spend alotof time with friends outside of that
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then
but we hafta make an effort unless shes sick or has something else going on to get outof the house at least once a day even if its just for a small short activity
it can its its hard
it takes alotof time and effort
and for her not every activity is easy
so
see now you make me wanna think of a really good story
well Ive told you about my mom
thats probably the like the singular event thats most significant
okay Ill tell you a story
this is a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird
but its so clear in my mind and it still doesnt make any sense
so my first semester of my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname
but my family was from DC
and I had a car
so I would drive back and forth over break time with my car
its about a thousand miles
so it generally takes about two days
so the first semester back its winter and Im driving across IEighty which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with alotof corn
so it is an extremely boring repetitive drive
there is alotof youknow driver tunnel vision that happens
and its cold and gray so its not even pretty green fields
its just empty empty empty fields
but Im Im kindof proud of myself because its my first semester went well
I was youknow independent excited
so Im on IEighty in sortof the middle of Illinois
and there is a slowdown
and its very flat so I can see ahead
I dont see that there is construction
I dont really see an accident
but I youknow figure somethings happened probably a minor accident
it looks like its a rubbernecking delay
its kindof pissing me off
IEighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction
and theres ke no exits nothing built along it
and we get closer and closer and closer
and I still cannot see whats going on
Im just like
what could this be
and we get alittle closer
and I see okay it looks like Im in the left lane
and then theres a median between the youknow east bound and west bound routes
and Im going east
and I can see that theres something over in the median to my left
and it looks as I get closer like an animal
and I get closer
and it looks like a fairly large animal
and Im thinking
is it a cow
is it a moose
Imean there wouldnt be a moose in Illinois
but it looks it looks fairly large and theres something unusual about it
so Im alittle more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay
but Im still kindof internally rolling my eyes going
why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal
wasting my time
I just wanna get home
and I get closer and I can see that theres these kindof large hind legs
so its oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car
and theres kindof a long tail
and its brown
and its this big hump
and Im getting closer and closer and closer
and I youknow my mind is doing that thing where its just trying to do the pattern matching going
what is this thing
I dont
its not a cow
its not a deer
its too big to be a dog
and Im literally as Im passing it ke my head is
youknow were just creeping along
my head is sortof like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view
and its only until its ke at my shoulder and I passed it that it my mind kindof pattern matches and goes
its a kangaroo
and then youknow again I hafta turn around and look at the road
and everythings cleared up behind me
and I spent like the next five miles going
thats no way it was a kangaroo
but it wasnt anything else
it was a kangaroo
it was clearly a kangaroo
I saw the ears
I saw the big massive tail
I saw the big hind legs
I saw the little tiny front legs
it was a kangaroo
and so to this day its this thing where I just dont know
I just dont know
I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo
Ive even start Imean this was
okay so this was the winter of two thousand two thousand one
so the internet was a thing but its not like
Google was around but there werent really if you didnt know how to search
and I think Ive subsequently every now and then done like kangarooq roadkillq kindof to see if theres any any information about this but no
Im pretty sure it was a kangaroo
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that
so its not a significant story
but it is kindof a funny story
I just dont know how
I just I am so certain and so uncertain
and I mostly just kindof like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going
what
it doesnt have a neat little conclusion
I dont know
I dont know
if it wasnt a kangaroo thered be no story of it
it couldnt be anything
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo
Imean it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind Imean massive hind feet
I dont know what else it possibly could have been
anything else that it might have been a wallaby or something like that
wallabys are pretty small
it still wouldnt have been in Illinois
Imean basically if its not a dog or a cow or a deer its something that shouldnt be there
okay what am I looking at
okay
okay
a beginning and middle and end
alright so theres a little boy named Ralph
Ralph is a science geek kid
his dad is a former athlete
his dad is always on Ralphs back about youknow
yeah you gotta participate in a team sport
you gotta you gotta learn to be a member of a team and to compete
and youknow its fine if you like science and you wanna become an astronaut
but youknow you still gotta learn some skills
so here I bought you this this soccer ball sothat you can youknow
its easy to play soccer
all you hafta do is run around
you dont even really hafta have some skill
but heres this soccer ball
lets go out and practice
so Ralph whines and whines and whines
and his dad says
listen if you if you dont do this then Im gonna hafta severely restrict your internet time to get you to be a wellrounded kid
so finally Ralph goes outside
and hes practicing with the soccer ball
and ofcourse hes pretty terrible
and he he cant quite get it
he keeps doing the CharlieBrown thing running up to it missing almost falling down
and finally finally finally he kicks it
it arcs high
he sees it
it goes toward the house toward the house toward the house into the living room
Ralphs dad well call him Jake looks up
and the soccer ball comes in and it knocks over this lamp
but thats okay
its an ugly lamp
he hates the lamp
his wife might be mad but youknow for now
and hes just hes getting really angry
and he gets up and he sees he he walks over to the the window
and he looks out
and hes like
Ralph
and Ralphs like
I was just practicing
can I use the internet now
the dad Jake sighs and is like
yeah you can use the internet
he gives up at that point on ever making his son wellrounded and decides his son will just be the best damn astronaut that ever there was
the end
okay
well this ones pretty simple
theres a mom
well call her Sally
and theres a kid
well call him Andre
Sally has bought Andre a really really ugly umbrella
Andre refuses to use it
he gives it back
he says to his mom
listen mom
Im gonna go out
its going to be fine
I dont think theres gonna be rain
Im a meteorology nerd
I saw on our local news my favorite meteorologist said theres no way theres gonna be rain
so you keep your ugly umbrella
and if it does rain Ill come back and you get to say that you were right
so ofcourse little Andre did I say goes out into the weather
and it immediately starts raining
he thinks
ah gosh darn it
that meteorologist Im gonna hafta start watching channel nine instead of channel seven
he runs back inside
hes very upset
he looks at his mom and he goes
you were right
the the channel seven guy was wrong
and mom says
well I told you so
and you told me I could tell you so
heres your umbrella
and little Andre goes out
and hes got his umbrella
and hes in the rain
and he just thinks
well I guess Im a channel nine viewer now
the end
alright
theres a little girl Jenny
she has a cat named Moggy
Moggy shes trying to play dressup with Moggy
Moggy gets very upset
he manages to dash outof the door where he encounters the dog named Goldie
Goldie starts barking at Moggy
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard
meanwhile little girl Jenny runs after them
she starts yelling and yelling and yelling
the cat wont come down
hes terrified little Moggy
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder and tries to to carry it
its very awkward
into the yard
shes dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up
he sees her out the window and starts yelling
no Jenny no thats too dangerous
so the dad comes grabs the ladder sits it against the tree climbs up it to try to get Moggy
as hes climbing up the tree Goldie the dog knocks the ladder over
poor dad is stuck in the tree
the ladder is too unwieldy for little Jenny
she runs back to the house
she calls the nineoneone
the fire department comes running out
on her way back she grabs her tricycle and tricyclesv out to the tree just to youknow save time
and all this time the the fire department comes out
they rescue dad
they rescue Moggy after alotof difficulty
and this whole time this little bird is just singing enjoying the show
the end
sure
okay
well I remember Cinderella but I will give it a first shot
ohboy
its very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella
okay
onceuponatime there was a little girl named Ella
she was the daughter of two loving parents
only one day when shes a little girl her mother dies suddenly
its very tragic
everybody cries
everybody loved her mother
her father in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures
he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps
until the father partly outof heartbreak and partly outof just a really bad diet also dies
at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy
they make her run around working all the time then begin mocking her for being dirty
and they call her Cinderella
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are
so one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other brides all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people
or perhaps hes commanded to hold a ball
and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match
so the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns
Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to youknow get outof the house and to have a bit of glamour
but ofcourse they wont let her
because they they tell her that she would be an embarrassment
but mostly they dont want the competition
so they go off to the ball
and Cinderella is left alone sortof brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house
and she begins crying
and shes crying and crying by the fireplace when allofasudden a woman materializes from the flames and says
Cinderella why are you crying
Cinderella says
I just I just wanted to go to the ball
I just wanted one night of happiness and joy
and the woman says
well I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this
so can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs
and youre already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do
and she waves her wand
and the pumpkin turns into a carriage
and her ball her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown and her slippers into slippers of cut glass
and youknow none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling
and she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen
and Cinderella is just overcome with joy
and she gets into the carriage
and shes about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says
unfortunately my magical power is limited
and at midnight when the the chimes go everything will turn back
so make sure that you are well away from the ball and and out of youknow an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens
so Cinderella says
I will I will
and she waves goodbye
she goes off to the ball
and she arrives
and its even more dazzling than she thought
and she comes in
and everybody is just enchanted with her because shes beautiful and charming
and in the midst of of her being greeting by by throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up
and he sees her
and he asks her to dance
and they begin to dance
and ofcourse theyre both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that theyd have really cute kids together
and the prince is is about to propose to her there and then on the spot
and the clock begins to strike twelve
and she says
ohno oh yeah I need to go
she she runs off
and the prince is kindof stumped for a minute
hes thinking
wait a minute
theres a lady running away from me
what is this about
so she gets a good head start
eventhough shes wearing heels of glass she runs outof the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach the prince chasing after her all the while
on the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes
she doesnt have time to stop and pick it up
she leaps into the coach
it starts racing outof the palace grounds and and down the road as the clock youknow slowly strikes midnight
and on the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and and her clothes back into rags
and she hasta run the rest of the way home
the prince has been unable to catch up with her in time
he did not have a coach at the ready youknow being in his own palace and all
but he has the shoe
and he looks at the shoe
and its its very delicate and tiny
and he thinks
I have a clue
and I shall not rest until I find this woman because truly shes the hottest lady Ive ever seen
its gotta be her
nobody else
so he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest but still a kingdom
and goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person every woman of eligible age
and it doesnt fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason
and finally he gets to to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother
and he tries the shoe on the first stepsister
and it doesnt fit
and he tries it on the second stepsister
and it doesnt fit
and hes about to leave when he he sees in the corner of the courtyard this this little servant girl
and shes shes sweeping away all of the dust
and he just has a sense
he has a sense
he says
I dont know
shes kindof dirty but she looks kindof hot
I dont remember if shes as hot as the lady I saw last night but lets give it a go
so he he calls her over
and the stepmother the whole time is like
no no it couldnt be her
shes just a gutter wench
you dont want anything to do with her
shes dumb
shes ugly
shes infertile
why not consider one of my daughters
youknow theyre they might not be your first choice but theyre a pretty good second bet
the prince continues to wave her away
and he approaches Cinderella
and he asks her to try on the shoe
and she does
and ofcourse it fits
and he thinks
good enough for me
and he whisks her away
and they marry
and depending on your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters
possibly they just feel really bad
supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after
the end
well
lets assume that
Im not gonna make the bread from scratch or grow the peanuts
you would go to the grocery store purchase bread whatever kind of bread that you like
if its not already been sliced you would need to slice it at home or have it sliced at the grocery store or bakery wherever you prefer
take two slices of bread
take a jar of peanut butter
again if you wanna buy youknow your organic custom ground at WholeFoods you can do that
or you could just get youknow your jar of generic Jif from Giant
also jelly or jam or preserves
theres very little difference between the two
Im sure somebody could tell you
grape is traditional
also purchase that at a grocery store
open both up both of those jars
might need one of those assistant little clamper things if its really on tight
you need a plate
put one piece of bread on the plate
take a knife
spread first the peanut butter on the bread
then inorderto avoid cross contamination clean the knife
put it in the jelly
spread the jelly on the other slice of bread
put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing eachother
not outward
its not a sticky sandwich
and then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across
and then stick it in your mouth then chew
well this looks like theres going to be a little bit of a disaster
looks like Dads up in a tree and cant get down
it looks like he was chasing the cat up there trying to get the cat down
dogs barking at the bottom of the tree because the cat aint
Dads just sitting there going
ohdear
and then must be his daughter whos trying to catch the cat incase he does fall down
and theres yeah evidently Dad lost his ladder
and the firemen are coming
and theyre coming with a ladder
and hopefully they get them all down and everything is okay
""
well this looks like theyre out in the country with a couple a man and a woman in a car
and theyre driving
you can see a farmhouse
so its close to farms and in the country
theres a farmer by a little tree there
and hes waving at them and saying hello
theyre waving back
evidently they must be lost
the man takes took out the a map
and then the farmer is giving them directions and pointing to where and how to get wherever theyre going
so they take off driving down the road
and the farmer went back to digging the hole to plant the tree
so hes there alone
allofasudden in the middle of his digging theres the car again and the couple again going the same way
and he looks very astounded and going
how did they get back here
this is crazy
hes probably thinking
he just looks very astounded that
what are you doing here
well its inside of a house
and theres a couple fighting
it looks like shes yelling at the man
theyre yelling back at eachother
hes dger hes reading a newspaper
and shes got her coat on and her suitcase heading for the door
evidently shes going to leave him
and he looks all distraught very distraught that she left
and hes still sitting in the chair
and then the door opens
and there she is
and they look at eachother
he gets up
shes crying
and he opens up his arms to welcome her home
anyway and theyre hugging at the door and everything like that
and it looks like she crashed the car
and hes looking towards the car going
wow what happened here
that must be why she is crying because she crashed the car
Im sure theyll be alright
www
okay this is about a birthday party
and it looks like a young man is having a birthday party
and people are coming in with their children
and mom is standing there with a broom shaking it at the dog whos hiding underneath the sofa
and then you look over at the cake
and guess what
he evidently took a big chunk outof the birthday cake
and thats why the boy is crying and moms gonna hit him with a broom
but he left his pawprints going all the way underneath the couch
so he wasnt hiding very well
okay you get the peanut butter and jelly
Im sorry
you get the peanut butter and jelly
you set it on the counter
you get your bread
close up the bag to the bread
then you put the bread on the plate
and then you get a knife
and then say you start with the peanut butter
so you open up the jar of peanut butter
and then you spread
close up the peanut butter jar
and then you open up the jelly jar
and you spread on one side the jelly
close up the jelly bar
put the two breads
and cut it
you can either cut it or eat it whole
put everything away
eat
no
okay
I would imagine first of all youre gonna go down to the garden store and buy some flowers or a flower thats already planted if its going to be a flower youre gonna plant
so youre gonna buy a pot or those
so you take it home
and then you go out to the garden
and then you
a hand hoe
and then you dig that hole for it
and you can even put in some fertilizer
and then usually you take the the plant
the hole
and then you cover it back up with some more dirt like that
then you take
I forgot what
pour some water or a hose
and pat it down
and then you planted a flower

she was sorta ke house in the house all the time so

she didnt wanna go to the restaurant like she useta and visit the people and oversee
Imean she owned them
and I told her
youknow you shouldnt be

I says
you cant be embarrassed about

youknow on a walker you dont want the neighbors to see ya
Ill roll you around in a wheelchair
and I says

I think an accident in a car that I was in
my daughter was driving
and so we were driving down the street
the grandson ofcourse is the baby
and we were in the car
and you could see this guy coming from
we were stopped
and then we pull up but the guy didnt stop
so you could see him youknow coming towards you
nothing you can do
nothing
and its its probably the third scariest thing I think Ive ever experienced because you cant do anything about it
you cannot do anything about it
hello
hit me youknow
anyway and the the car
and I was more frightened for the for my grandson than anything
but thats frightening when you know you cant control
if you cannot control your situation like that and you know something bad is gonna p run into you its very difficult
its scary
because you know it
www
it looks like it looks like theres a
I was gonna say she looks like a young child
I dont know
not young young but
shes stuck in the water
it looks like after a flood
shes very stressed
scared half to death no doubt
and Id venture to guess that this would be a rescue person whos hanging on a tree limb trying to get to her
and hes got a hes got his life jacket on and stuff like that
and theyre really really struggling in this water that is just like terminal
looks like a flash flood or something like that
hes really trying to get a hold of her there and trying to get her going
I couldnt tell you what the end of it is
he aint
difficult time there
www
well theres a boy playing kickball soccer outside kicking the ball around
and hes playing and having a good time and all that and everything
and he kicks the ball
and it goes through a window
and hes probably going
uhoh
Im in trouble
and theres in the home you can see the ball coming through
lands break the lamp
a gentleman is sitting in a chair
its coming through there
and hes standing up ofcourse looking out the window with the ball in his hand trying to figure out who and where this ball came through
so I would imagine the ending would be hes gonna go out and the boys gonna be in trouble
www
its a school morning
and the boy
and hes got his backpack on
his moms got the umbrella in her hand because shes saying
it probably will rain
you needta take this umbrella with you
and the boy is saying

Imean theres even puddles
now hes running back home
and he went in his house
and his mom looks like
well see I told you
it was gonna rain
you needed an umbrella
hes standing there looking just drenched and patheticlikenadj

so and then hes leaving again with the umbrella
and hes happily walking in the rain now
atleast he isnt getting wet
on to school

and they were trying it on everybody
and ofcourse they tried it on the stepsisters

and they it didnt fit either one of them
and then they said

me being
oh
I didnt know if I was sposta remember what you had said there
or if Im sposta tell you what I did last weekend
last weekend we did my husband and I did our usual Saturday lunch at Sues
he decided he did not wanna share a a dish with me so we each had our own meal
after that we ended up since we didnt share we each ended up with leftovers to be finished the following day or days
after lunch we decided to meander a little through one of the antique stores down in Chandler
nothing to buy
we have a house full of stuff that we really dont need anyhow
but it was fun meandering with my husband
went on home
I grabbed a book
he put on noise also known as television
and we spent the rest of the day together very comfortably
Sunday was again a lazy day
read the paper
had lunch
finished reading the paper
other than that it was a nice comfortable day for the two of us
in how many words
okay Im telling you the truth
this the last vacation was in the early part of middle part of September
we flew to Copenhagen
we spent an extra day
had a wonderful time and feel we must go back
if we can ever figure out how and when
picked up our cruise boat on a Sunday from
got to meet people
met most of our dinner companions
very very nice very compatible
as we were traveling with friends we decided we better set up our side trips
our first trip was London where we had been before but our friends hadnt been
did a wonderful trip of seeing the highlights high points of there
and then they dropped us off at CoventGarden for a couple of hours
we grabbed a bite and meandered
prices being what they are we really didnt buy much but enjoyed ourselves
the trip both for Paris and London
the ports are two hours by bus from each of them so we enjoyed country sightseeing
following day was Paris
took a a tour of the city and a three hour boat ride on the Seine
again it was our first trip and their first trip to Paris
again a city that needs to be visited for a longer period of time
from there we had a day at sea
enjoyed lazing around
the ship itself I would not particularly recommend but enjoyed being with the people we were with
from there we spent a few hours in Vigo Spain
havent figured out yet why they stopped there
from there Lisbon a again a city we had been to before
our friends had not
enjoyed a tour of the city
spent some time meandering in the square and ofcourse have finding some pastry my husbands favorite
from there we went to Cadiz then Malaga
a very nice city very friendly people interesting architecture
back to Genoa and then on to Genoa where we spent a night and then flew home
well leave the airplane trip back in the realm of nightmares atleast from Charlotte to Phoenix on USAir
and dont ever ask me to fly USAir again
and how was that for a vacation
you caught me at a good time in terms of something worth talking about
Im sorry what
past Christmas
ke last year
Im going to hafta say
Im trying to remember
I dont even remember if we went up to Vegas
youll hafta understand Christmas is not a holiday for me
ERROR
ERROR
the last holiday would be Passover
and we go with to a friends house for the Seder
the meal beforehand
and joined with as we have done for the last fifteen years or so
the friends we are with we have known for many time
our hostess is a friend from highschool for my husband and me
and we had our usual family
ERROR
frequently we would go to Vegas because atleast restaurants are open
but I for some reason I dont think we went at Christmas time
I think we went at a different time so
ERROR
right
xxx
never broke any bones
are you sure you wanna get into female surgery
other than hospitalized I have two children
and that is the extent laughs
thats not quite true
I had my tonsils out when I was in the eighth grade
where do you want me to go from there
now eighth grade is going to be quite a few years ago
injuries
illness
a cold
I cant remember a
Imean I can go back
okay Ill make something dramatic
and Im going back
lets see nineteen sixty eight nineteen sixty nine
married two young children
not living in Phoenix at the time
it was a bad year for our whole family
not for my my side my grandparents three sons inlaw all died in nineteen sixty eight
it was a bad year
my aunt who was her husband was one of them came and lived with us for about nine nth ten months until she could get herself together
I was sick
I had a cold
I couldnt lift my head up
I mommy Ive got two small children
but my aunt was there
and she took over
shed bake meals
she took care of the kids
ofcourse they adored her
everybody should have an aunt like my kids had an aunt
and I it was my aunt too
and I could be miserable
and sleep
and wallow in my misery
unfortunately I got better in a day or two
but I did enjoy being sick that day
thats the best I the sickest I could be laughs
it was laughs
right
I went back a few years
the greatest example or the most recent example I can think of is a cousin of my husbands who had Parkinsons
he lived with it for some twenty plus years
one of the problems with Parkinsons is as it progresses you lose the use of your vocal cords and your voice gets softer and softer and softer
I have a hearing problem
I understood how frustrated he was
he was in a wheelchair by that time
and basically I tried to get him to raise his voice a little
and blame me
and since my husband has Parkinsons I am using all those lessons
www
the closest I can think of is being scared in retrospect
I probably was maybe five at the most
and my parents my aunt and uncle
the same aunt from a previous story
and I cant remember if my grandparents were there or not
we were at a lake not too far from the house
walking distance if one walked
we didnt
we drove
anyhow I was in the lake
apparently nobody was paying too much overly amount of attention to me
and I stepped
and the next thing I know my uncle has grabbed me and pulled me outof the water
huh that was nice
I like playing games in the water with him
however I realized afterwards I had disappeared from their sight and they were scared
so ofcourse if they were scared I guess I was scared too
can I keep looking at it
oh okay
www
a whirlpool or eddy turns and twirls and sucks whatever is in its path into its vortex
a woman for some reason fell
what she was doing in the lake or the in the river does not show
however she is being sucked into this whirlpool
and the rescue squad has gone in to rescue her
as you can see he does have his life vest on
and is holding on to a branch that hopefully will hold both of them
since he is well trained in his profession he will grab her and get her outof her get her outof the river safe but more than a little wet
ah the care
oh
ah the carefree days of youth
kicking a ball around
playing no school to worry about
whoops
right through the window
looks like the lamp is broken the window is broken
and the man has my ball

oh mom its nice
I dont need an umbrella
oh dear
oh dear

its raining heavily
mom mom I need my umbrella

here you are
now get to school before youre late

once upon a time long long ago in the land of makebelieve there was a man that lost his wife but had a young daughter
a sweet young gal sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella
he decided it was time that he got took a wife for himself and got a mother for Cinderella because she needed a woman as she was growing up
she needed a mother
and so he married a widow
a lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters
the woman who was Cinderellas stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her
and she banished her to the kitchen to do lotsof chores lotsof jobs
and her l her own two little girls who were really nasty little brats got to sit around get lotsof new clothes and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked
but she had her little cat who she loved
and the cat kept her hompany
and this went on
daddy was completely unaware
he did not know what was going on
and so he blithely went along his way enjoying his wife his two stepchildren and every once in awhile seeing his daughter who was so sweet and didnt complain to daddy
meanwhile in this kingdom that they lived so long ago and far away the king and queen decided that their oldest son needed to get married
it was time
and so they planned a great ball
which is a big big party with lotsof dancing and music and people
and they sent out a herald that is a messenger who l told everyone throughout the land that all the single girls were to come
all the single young women because they hadta be old enough to get married
to come to this big fancy party in their prettiest dresses
and so the stepmother heard about this
and was very very excited because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince
and she plotted and planned and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get
meanwhile poor Cinderella didnt get wasnt going to get to go
her stepmother said
no
you hafta help me get the girls ready and dressed
and then you have work to do
you hafta keep this house clean
you hafta make sure that it is spickandspan when the prince comes to claim his bride
poor Cinderella
after the girls and their stepmother left for the ball she sat and sat and cried
she wanted to go to this fancy party also
allofasudden a light started shining
and a balloon came down
and it got bigger and bigger and brighter
and she heard a giggle
and she looked
and there in front of her was this sweet little bouncy bubbly lady

asked this sweet bouncy bubbly lady
because I wanna go to the ball to this fancy party where the prince is going to be and dance with everybody

my magic only works a little bit or for a little bit of time
so go along

dance with the prince
but remember when it start when the clock strikes twelve everything goes back to the way it was
okay Ill remember
and off she goes
makes her grand entrance because shes late
the prince sees her and dances with her
dance after dance after dance
everybody is wondering
who is this beautiful young lady
the stepsisters dont recognize her
the stepmother doesnt recognize her
they have never seen her so nice and pretty and clean and all dressed up
Cinderella is having a wonderful time
but allofasudden the clock starts to strike twelve
oh she remembers
gotta go gotta go
she tells the prince
and scoots off
and runs and run
but the prince is so startled he doesnt realize whats happening
and she gets all the way out from the palace before the clock finished striking
and the coach disappears
the beautiful dress disappears
everything
but as she had been running she lost her shoe
now for some reason it does not change back
before you ask me why that doesnt happen
I had kids who asked questions
so she keeps running
eventually she gets home
back to her hearth
the pumpkin is squashed
the prince has only the shoe
but he has fallen in love with Cinderella
a proclamation goes out the next day
he wishes to see every woman every young woman in the kingdom
and whoevers foot that glass slipper fits will be his bride
and so he goes around to all the
and so his messenger goes all around the country trying it on
somes
gets to the house with Cinderella
older stepsister tries it on
cant squeeze her foot in
her
the other sister says tries
they push and they squeeze and they push and they squeeze
and they still cant get her foot in there
messenger says
is there anybody else around
I have tried everybody in the kingdom
no
says the stepmother
theres nobody else in here
at that point Cinderella peeks around the corner and the messenger sees her
oh heres a young lady
let us let me try
weve gotta try her
the prince says everybody
eventhough the stepmother is saying
nah shes nothing shes nothing nothing
so Cinderella comes in the room
slips her foot in easily into the glass slipper
its not too big
its not too small
not too wide
not too narrow
and the messenger says
proclaim
I have found the princes princess
the prince comes to claim Cinderella
and they get married and live happily ever after
and yes the stepsisters mended their ways and really became nice little girl nice girls instead of the mean spiteful ones they had been
when I was was a time that I was really sick
there would only be one instance in my life when I had surgery for malignant melanoma in the middle of my back fifteen years ago or longer
I had never seen it
it was discovered by my skin doctor when I went in for a rash
I was in the hospital with surgery within four days
was in the hospital ten days
had skin grafts
losing a section of my skin on my back that was about the size of a small saucer
the skin grafts were taken from my left hip
I dont know which was worse pain the wound in back or the skin grafts on my hip
but you cant hardly get comfortable in bed
you just sleep under lights that dry up the skin wounds
and then that was I was outof the hospital
I was back at work within six weeks with still the sortof a semi open wound over my spine in the back which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years
in order to close the wound on the back they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar take the flaps of skin close them back over the original scar wound
and so I had for about six weeks a lump on my back where they were infloating
that was done and I had ten years with an oncologist
and now I have a clean bill of health
thats about all I can remember laughs
www
as far as their speech is concerned I I had a husband who had a stroke and had cognitive reasoning problems that made it difficult for him to understand what I was saying or der
he knew who I was but he did not connect with what I was saying
and when people came to visit him in the hospital we had the same problems
now he could communicate reasonably well but he did not comprehend so his communication was it was just difficult
oh he was in therapy for
and I useta watch
he was given many many tests
he was to write elephant
a great deal of therapy
and was really doing fairly well
six weeks after the stroke
so I had him back home by that time
and he was doing reasonably well
mhm
did you do some when you were communicating with him
no I did not hafta do anything
they just gave me instructions on always
and he had hearing aids
ERROR
and that sort of thing just to help him
no because by the time he was home and an outpatient he was doing he
and it was it had affected his swallowing and that
so so there was some speech difficult only because of the swallowing
that was about my only experience with
Im sure there were many instances when I was frightened

but not certainly I was afraid but not a terrified type of fright
maybe like boo scared but not hysteria hysteria scared
its thats a hard thats a real hard question
I have been afraid when Id been dreaming because I was lost
but that was a dream not and I always seem to get outof it
lets see what ever where would I have been lost
I have been lost but not afraid
it hasta be hasta have the fear
I certainly worked in a very large industrial plant where there were certainly dangerous situations all around with mechanics and equipment and furnaces
but
its not anything that was its not scary because you are trained to cope with that but you are working constantly around large equipment
and I think probably many times since I was a supervisor I was probably more concerned about a young man working on one of the drill presses or on a lathe that would lose a finger or was injured by a grinder or something happening to one of the men that worked for me
and then the furnaces in a large plant its always a concern
an industrial plant is is something to be very cautious
not to be fearful of but to be cautious about your people who are working for you and also that your own behavior you dont do stupid things
and I worked midnights which was
I was the only female in the plant
and that still was not a fearful situation
but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was and the machinery was working
and we never had an accident we never had a fire we never had
we had a blizzard
but they would have never left me alone with
Imean they they picked me up at the plant took me back home
but not that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in
but it wasnt it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job
you were just more aware of what was going on around you because there was just alotof mechanical equipment and dangerous electrical and that sort of thing
but that was about the only situation that I was ever in that was ever might might have been life threatening but certainly never was
but it was an interesting experience
no it was when I worked in the automotive industry back East
yeah no there we dont have any really heavy equipment
matter of fact Boeing is here but
oh yes
oh we had rr
oh Ohio ugh
from Ohio okay
we had gee it was terrible
we were o we hadta shut down all the furnaces in the plant
and then ofcourse they we let all the people go
the only people who hadta stay ofcourse was the management
but then they would not even let us get in our cars
they actually brought emergency equipment in to take us when they n
well we hadta shut down all all the heat eat
we hadta shut down the entire plant for four days
in
it was outside of Columbus in a town called Newark Ohio with the WabcoInternationalAutomotiveOperationsPlant outside of Newark Ohio
big plant
where
oh Cleveland sure
thats an industrial city
yeah
yeah you have lake effect
lots of it up there
yeah oh yeah oh yeah
I had lived here for many years
got my masters degree
then moved
because at the time I was looking for a job you couldnt make any money down here
so I left and went
the weather back there is really awful

this story begins with a whole family of mice coming outof their house and climbing into their big red truck
theres a it looks as if there are either two blind mice or there are two grandparents a mother a father and several babies
and one baby is carrying his doll which is sortof a pink mouse
they all get inside the big red truck
and they start up a very very steep hill
they go across country
and allofasudden they hit very deep rough rocky road
and baby mouse in the back goes bouncing out still clutching his her its pink doll
and allofasudden looks up from the middle of the road laying on its back with its doll and watches the truck disappearing off into into the horizon where its watching it disappear
the mouse family arrives at a lovely big glen with lovely big shade trees and flowers and decide this is the spot for their picnic
so they all pile outof the big red truck carrying the picnic basket the tables the various and sundry items that they need for the picnic
they spread the table down
theyre beside a pretty little pond with a diving board dock
theyre dancing theyre playing they have musical instruments
the either the grandfather or the blind mouse has a white cane

they have a Thermos jug with a beverage it must be iced tea
the little mouse with the red cap is dancing with the little girl mouse
and theyre all having an absolutely wonderful time
the next scene theyre playing the instrument

all the beautiful picnic is all laid out
the mother or the the grandparents are up on the side of a small hill playing music
the kids are playing baseball
somebody is swinging from a tree over the brook
and then we flash back to the baby who got bounced outof the truck who has still got his ladybug by his side and his doll his pink doll
he looks all around
doesnt see much
doll is upside down but hes still hanging onto him
allofasudden spots a whole bush full of red berries or flowers
I would assume maybe berries because the flowers on the page look like flowers
back to the picnic
everybody is having a wonderful time
the picnic baskets have now been opened
theyre taking pictures of one another
one of the baby mice is jumping off of the dock into the water
theyre two or three of them are playing in the water
somebody is sailing a boat
the baseball glove is now laying on the ground
mother is pouring milk
one of the babies is in the salad
another one is eating watermelon
and now the mother is calling to the children out in the water that are playing to come in and eat
grandmother with glasses on is taking a picture of grandfather
back to the baby mouse who now has spotted
the lost baby mouse has now spotted the red berries
and since its getting to be meal time he begins eating the red berries
allofasudden were getting ready now with everybody lined up beside the picnic
all the food is out
we count noses and were minus a kid
were minus a mouse the smallest mouse
the red hat is there grandmother and grandfather are there mother and daddy are there various and sundry other folk in the family are there
the picnic is all ready to be eaten
no baby
now they start looking
they look under rocks and in the water
and theres a frog now in the pond
somebody else is looking in the patch of weeds
they are crying
theyre looking under rocks
theyre looking behind the grass
no baby
so the mouse family picks up the entire picnic
and heads back for the big red truck up on the bumpy road
meanwhile down the road is baby mouse flat on his back full of red berries with his baby his pink baby fuzzy animal sitting beside him
his doll his baby his stuffed animal
everybody is loaded back into the red truck now
and we haul off back down the road
and we go down the down the country lane
and we start back down the steep road
and allofasudden baby mouse in the grass hears something
and starts towards the noise
and runs into the middle of the road
and here comes the red truck with the entire family group shouting and hollering and telling him hello and the red hat is flying in the air and they have found the baby
they are all hugging and kissing the baby and having such a good time
and then allofasudden goodness gracious throws his hands up to his head and says
ohmygoodness I forgot my my teddy bear or my baby stuffed animal
takes off through the grass again
finds his baby
picks it up
gives it a love
runs back to the group that has now spread the picnic table out again and is once again getting ready to have a picnic
this time with a found baby mouse and his toy
its a beautiful day in the country
and the mouse family
looks like they have about nine children
are all going into the forest to look for a place to have a picnic
they all pile into a red truck
we think its dads but it could be Grandpas
and up they go up a hill
and then they go across another fairy area
and oh its green and its beautiful
but allofasudden the truck hits a boulder in the road
and the little mouse falls off the back of the truck which has no tailgate
and in the little mouses arms are his his little pet mouse
well there he is flat on his back in the trail all alone with his little toy
and all he sees the truck and the rest of his family disappearing into the distance
and he doesnt know what to make of this
now we follow the family in their red truck
they found a beautiful spot
so they all get outof the truck carrying their picnic things and their toys their baseball bats and all sorts of toys cameras everything they have with him
now we have them in a perfectly beautiful glen by a small lake that actually has a pier
some of them are swimming
one is on the pier getting ready to thinking about diving not not too sure
two other of the children are dancing in the grass
another one is picking flowers
another one is carrying the thermos
and bigger ones are carrying the picnic basket
and mom is shaking up the tablecloth
and dad has his banjo
and grandpas getting ready to take a walk
everybodys getting ready for a wonderful time
beautiful beautiful lake in the beautiful forest
next we see them playing baseball
the older folks relaxed playing the banjo and just sitting and watching the younger ones play
and one little one has laughs a rubber tire
he doesnt know quite what to do with that
and then we go back and we see the little one all by himself in the middle of the road
little tears running down his cheeks clutching his pet
xxx pet mouse
he gets up
he looks around
he doesnt know what to do
hes all alone and everything around him is very tall
the grasses and the bushes
oh there are berries on the bushes
maybe he could eat some of the berries
now we go back to the rest of the family
theyre photographing each other
theyre frisking about in the lake
theyre sailing a boat
they have a beautiful picnic spread out with watermelon and salad and sandwiches and cheese
well they are mice youknow
then we go back to the little guy
he reaches up and he finds that he can reach the berries
so he pulls them down
sets his little his little friend down on the ground
and he starts eating the berries
suddenly we go back to the picnic and there seems to be something amiss
there are only eight little mice when there should be nine
and mom is kindof rubbing her hands together
and dad is shading his eyes looking off into the distance
and Grandma and Grandpa are looking every which way
noone knows what to do
and theyre not eating their picnic
theyre just all sitting the little children are all sitting with their hands folded looking very worried
where is their little brother
well one of them is one of the brothers the bigger ones sits on the edge of the pier and is calling and calling his little brother
the little mouse who was sailing the boat brings the boat in and starts to cry
the other little mouse is crying
a bush with flowers on
all the children seem to be theyre all looking but they cant find
theyre looking behind rocks
theyre looking among the tall grass
they cant find him
but they know hes missing finally
so they pack up everything
the baseball bat the banjo the picnic basket
and they all load up in the little red truck
now we go back and we see the little missing little missing boy mouse laying on his back with his hands on his tummy
maybe he ate too many berries
we dont know though
so the truck comes back and everybody is looking
theyre looking out the windows
theyre looking over the back of the truck
theyre looking every which way
they are looking for their little brother
little brother stands up
he thinks he hears something
he looks and looks but hes in hes in the tall grass and he cant see anything
suddenly he finds his way back to the road
and he sees his family
and they are all cheering
and theres a hat thrown in the air
and all of his little brothers and sisters are screaming with happiness

they cant believe they found their little one

then we have Carl
he gets the Hershey syrup which has two holes already punched in the top so you can pour it
holds the can in his mouth and pours the syrup into a little cup
then Carl goes and gets the milk

and you need jelly
and you need a knife
so I would take two slices of bread
and Id put them on the bread board
and on one side I would spread peanut butter
and on the side I would spread jelly
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place
so then
and I serve her
Im going back to my kids
my daughters fifty three
and her sister her younger sisters already retired
well I am seventy four almost seventy five
what we gonna do now
yeah I can I can tell you what I did
I went into the hospital the day after Christmas to have major surgery laughs
but getting ready for that is is much more of a story
because my daughter and her husband came from Florida two days before Christmas
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan
and there were seven of us for Christmas
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldnt let me drink wine because but I snuck some in
then five oclock the day after Christmas we went to the hospital
and the rest wasnt that much fun
the rest of it
the the reason my daughter was there was to take me look t look after me because shes a registered nurse
and so she was there for about a total of seven days
and then the cousins stayed on
but thats what I did over the Christmas holiday
and I dont plan to do that ever again
no
it was a new experience however
last weekend
oh last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida
and theyre arriving tomorrow evening
so I moved the car outof the garage
and I got my
and I
and I took my chamois and some pail of water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday
Sunday I vacuumed the living room
moved all the furniture
put
Ive found if you
so I did that to
then having s having vacuumed forwards
because youknow if I dont have everything looking just right theyll think
things are getting ahead of her
time to put her in the home
youknow
so then I discovered the spots in the rug
so now I go out and I do the spot rug thing
upstairs made sure everything was ready in the in the guest room
generally I didnt have a whole lot of fun
youknow
oh and I I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason theyre coming
so all in all I worked the entire weekend
and Im tired
ohmygosh what when did I have my last vacation
it was probably in
well youknow when youre retired its hard to tell when youre on a vacation laughs
but I did go to Florida
I think it was in June
it was a sad time because
yeah
and youknow its a sad time but I did have fun
the reason its sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years
they were litter mates
and one became very ill and hadta be put down
and I think it was well February or March
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down
so those were those were not fun
those were not fun
but had I did have fun in in Florida
because we always do
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx
and we go out to dinner
and we have wonderful gourmet meals
we just kindof play family
because we dont see each other that often
but we do things
we we go to the Everglades
we take an airboat ride
and and that kind of stuff
and they have they once had two dogs and three cats
theyre down to two dogs and one cat now
so that that keeps me happy
but pretty much thats it
www
okay
well well set the scene first
were in a lovely little rural location here
the banks of a very tranquil lake
and we have a sailboat in the lake
and we have actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite
a boy little boy playing with a kite
so its its windy
its windy enough to keep the flag fluffering
now we have a cozy little house on the shore
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade
and the car is parked in front of the garage
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach
now the beach is very very narrow
but its wide enough that the little girl out there can play and shes making a sandcastle
and it also has a pier
thats where the sailboat comes when its tired
and looks like dads on the edge of the pier
or maybe its Grandpa
we cant tell from here
but hes fishing and hes caught a fish
now the boy whos flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass
shoes beside them radio playing dad reading a book
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine
and then they have a picnic basket between them
so all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home
www
now here we have a rural scene
we have just a two lane highway
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front
and the man has a map in his hand
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree
well its clear
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the cars headed
off they go
we see them receding into the distance
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole
and suddenly theres the car back in front of the farmer
it looks like they just went around in a circle
who knew
www
www
www
we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boys birthday party
and the little boy looks to be about six
and what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table
we have the front door open
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in
obviously theyre guests
and theyre carrying presents
each one accompanied by the mother
and they all stop and they look at the cake
well theres a big chunk taken outof the cake
and one of the candles
looks like the little boys fifth birthday according to the candle count
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa
and theres a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this
the little boy is crying
doesnt look like we had much fun at this birthday party because it leaves it right there
but there she is
everybodys unhappy
but Im gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out that was that the dog chewed on
and the little boy stopped crying
and everybody came in and they had a wonderful party
dont you wish real life was like that
www
I counted the candles
I cheated
well I have dogs and kids
www
we have a little household setting here
were in the living room
and husband and wife
husbands sitting in the chair trying to read his newspaper clearly angry mouth wide open
and what we assume is his wife is standing in front of him pointing at him in a very menacing way
in the next picture we see husband with paper up
and the wife heading for the door with her coat on and a suitcase
she has had it
looks as though as soon as she goes out the door the door closes husband was sad
possibly remorseful
thinking of the things he should have said
thinking of the things he should not have said
and all that kind of stuff
whats he going to do
he doesnt know
it shouldnt have gone this far
door opens
he looks over his shoulder
its his wife
shes back
he cant believe it
she forgave him for whatever it was he did which he doesnt really know it was
so they embrace
and theyre both very happy
and in the middle of the embrace the husband looks out the open door
and he sees the family car
www
www
okay
set the scene here
here we have what what appears to be an emergency
and how do we know this
because we have a fire truck on the street and that goes by this large tree
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder
""
so we look at the tree
and we have a dog barking up the tree
barko barko barko whats he what is he barking at
well theres a little bird up there but I dont hes not barking at the bird
we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree
well what
wait a second
what is he doing up there
so we look alittle further and we see a kittycat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man
and beneath the kittycat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying
go kitty jump
come kitty come down
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder
now this this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree
cant get down
dad went up after the kittycat
got stuck up there
the dog is yelping
hes barking
and someone called the firemen
and then theyre coming to rescue first the father and then the kittycat
and its a happy ending because the little girl gets her kitty cat back
www
I better pay attention
that is an easy one because its fairly recent
the the the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition
and I remember hearing a womans voice saying
oo shes a bleeder
and then I went
and thats the only thing I remember from the recovery room
I me
is this what you want
memories
okay and then I remember being
and I remember having a
I cant remember what it was exactly because I never knew
but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it
and they said
you could push this button whenever you have alotof pain
you cant push it any less than six minutes apart
if you try it wont do anything
so youre alright
dont worry about it
so whenever I l felt that I couldnt stand it I would push that button
then I remember seeing my daughters face
I remember seeing her and her husband
and I
I remember bits and pieces of nurses coming and catheters being inserted and
but again
I never saw
just bits of it
and I remember getting outof bed the first day and being
and I remember the second day
Id had a hip replacement
around the the
and
and each day I remember seeing my daughter and her husband at some time
but not communicating with them or anything
and when I left my daughter asked me several questions
being a nurse
and I said
do you know I remember one day you came twice
she said
we came twice every day
see
so thats that shows how much I was out
I remember another thing
sitting sitting up straight in the hospital watching
and
and the nurse came in later and she
I could hear her
she was saying
boy she fell asleep sitting up
and I thought
Im not asleep
Im just
youknow
and that thats pretty much it
and I I remember the the therapy afterwards and and youknow pain and the and the medication of the Vicodin
and I remember saying things that didnt make sense
and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to
and I remember asking him
I had just taken Vicodin
and I remember asking him
now who are you
and I knew very well who he was
and he would answer very slowly
and I thought
oh hes hes hes hes trying to youknow
and Id say
why am I asking these stupid questions
and I was i and I said
I could hear myself saying
now let me write this down
and so in due course about three hours later these men showed up
and I was back
and I said
hi
and they they had come in
and we we talked a bit
and I had a my
I was walking around
and finally I said to him
did your dispatcher say anything to you about the telephone conversation he had with me before he sent you out this morning
youknow he said he said
yeah
I said
whatd he say
he said
well I dont know what youre gonna find when you get to eighteen sixty East Crystal Way
so I told him I said
when you get back please tell him I was on drugs
tell him I was thoroughly drugged
I had just taken a pain pill
and it was three hours ago
and this is the difference between me right after it kicks in
so thats what I remember from from that
is that any help
okay
the first problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese
so it was frustrating
I hadta put children in school
I hadta take them shopping to get their uniforms
I hadta take a taxi and tell him where I wanted to go and how to get home and
so how did I deal with it
I studied Japanese
every morning five days a week until I got so I could do it
happened again when I went to Korea
it happened again when I went to Guatemala
so and and and Brazil
where they did not speak English
spoke English in Jamaica and they spoke in English in Malaysia at that time
but the only time that Ive really had what
and I hafta communicate immediately and then study at the same time
and I find I do it by reading body language reading facial expressions
and alot of this moving hands and to describe what I want
and then as as the language picks up on
thats pretty much my experience with that
okay
I was on a boat a ship I should say
and the USS President line it was President Wilson
and we were sailing from I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo
and I had my my husband and my two youngsters were there
they were probably third and fourth grade
and we came in we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up
so the captain youknow notified us
theres a
well what happened was
and the
and our little ship was in the vortex
I was frightened
I was my children one of them was thrown outof her bunk and youknow
and and I we strapped them in something
I cant remember exactly because I was miserable
I was seasick
and I was on the promenade deck
and they had
so because the promenade youre sposta be able to see but they had these
and I was strapped in a deck chair that was
and I was sitting in this chair sick as I could be watching the waves come up over me gpxraises arms above head
and then I would hear crashing
and one wave would go up real high
the ship would creak
it would go
I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life
they had ropes for people youknow if you hadta go to the bathroom or something you couldnt walk so you would do this to try and find your way
they had bed spreads
so that was it
and youknow we survived
the boat didnt go down but it I dont think it ever sailed again because it was already thirty years old and it was ready to be
which wasnt very helpful being being on it
but we survived
but Ive never been as frightened before or after
also I had two little kids there with me
so that was scary
bet thats a new one for you
www
this one is puzzling to me
its clearly a rescue operation
and it clearly is in water because the man who appears to be rescuing the young lady is wearing a buoyancy vest
what I cant make out is whether she
ahhah
it looks like she she got caught in a flood possibly
and she has grabbed a branch that has stuck out into the raging waters
thats what it is I bet you
and shes clinging to this branch for dear life
and he is trying to get her and bring her to shore
did I make it up good
boy that was tough though
I couldnt figure out what was going on there for a minute
www
okay we have a series of four drawings here
the first one shows a youngster about eight or nine having a wonderful time kicking what looks to be a volleyball
his aim is good
goes right through the neighbors window
we dont know whether its his window or whether its a neighbors window
but as luck would have it it breaks the window goes through knocks a lamp over probably breaks the lamp
yes it does
and theres a gentleman sitting in the chair right next to the lamp
now we dont know whether this is this boys father or whether its a neighbor
but the gentleman stands up
and he picks up the volleyball
and stands looking out through the hole in his window
and we are looking we are left trying to decide whether he is going to throw the ball back at the little boy or whether hes going
hes not sure exactly what hes gonna do yet
but hes gonna do something
but we dont really know
www
the title of this little scenario is Mother Knows Best
in the first picture we have little boy setting setting off for school
hes ready to go and mom pulls out an umbrella
nah I dont want an umbrella
I dont need an umbrella
okay
she says
alright
so she keeps the umbrella and he heads off
its not raining
he says goodbye xxx
okay
he starts off to school
and little drip drip drip starts
just a little bit of rain
and then its more than a drip drip
we have a little downpour
so
so puts his hands over his head turns around races back home
there he is with his mom
shes looking down with that I told you so look that mothers have
and hes standing there soaking wet
next picture hes smiling going back to school and he has his umbrella

once upon a time a long time ago there was a throat beautiful little girl whose mother died
so her father married giving her a stepmother
and the new stepmother had two daughters
well the two daughters were not anywhere near as fair as Cinderella
and the stepmom did not treat Cinderella very well
she did not treat her like she did her own daughters
she made her do all the laundry
she made them do all the housework
she made she made her wait on her stepsisters with her xxx
and it looks to me like she slept out in the barn with the horses
but she liked horses and she liked the dogs and she liked all the animals
so they liked her so she didnt care
well one day she was looking out the window at the castle
she could see
and word came that the king was very angry with his son prince because he was not in any hurry to get married to take a queen
so the king says
alright enough of your fooling around
he sent out an
well it wasnt an edict it was more of a letter
to everyone in the kingdom saying that there would be a ball
and his son would meet all of the eligible young ladies in the kingdom
and there would be a way that one would be chosen from this ball
Cinderella thought
wouldnt that be wonderful
wouldnt that be wonderful
so she
and she made a beautiful well very beautiful dress
wasnt fancy really but she was such a such a pretty girl it looked beautiful on her
so she thought she could go to the ball because she was certainly one of the members of the of the kingdom
two stepsisters came in
no way are you going bitch
so they ripped off her gold necklace
go back into the scullery
so she went back into the scullery
and there sitting on a big trunk was someone who looked very much like a fairy godmother
she had a
she took the story and she says
yes you shall go to the ball
you shall be beautiful
you shall have footmen
see these little mice
theyre gonna be your footmen
see that pumpkin
its gonna be your carriage
you see this dress
boomo
beautiful slippers
she was just beautiful
she couldnt believe this was happening
she didnt really know it was but she was all ready to go
and she got into the carriage
and she had gorgeous horses
and the mice were now footmen
and they
when they helped her down
the prince took one look at her and he thought
who are these dogs
he didnt say that
he he thought it
so hes dancing with her
and theyre dancing around the ballroom
and then comes time for her pumpkin to her pumpkin and her mice to reappear
its midnight
and she was told
youve got til midnight
she sees the clock
she races outof the ballroom
and the prince says
where are you going
he starts following her
and she races down the stairs and jumps in the into her coach and they race home
and then there she is in her regular clothes sitting on a pumpkin
but as she was running down the stairs she lost one of her glass slippers
the prince saw it
and he said
this is the slipper from the most beautiful woman in the kingdom and I am going to find her
and so that began the search
they went to every house in the kingdom
every young woman in the kingdom
and noone could fit their big fat foot into that pretty little glass slipper
went to Cinderellas home where Cinderella was nowhere to be seen
two ugly stepsisters they tried to push it and they shove it
they could
and so the question was
isnt there another young lady
no no no no no
well finally
no
he was gonna put it on
so
and it fit like a slipper
he was so happy hed found the girl of his dreams
and if you can see what happened
the next few pictures show us them
no more pumpkins
and as they say they lived happily ever after
gee
I havent broken a bone since I was five
and I havent been hospitalized since I was twenty nine
I havent been really sick
so its gonna be hard to come up with something laughing
lets see
ERROR
I was I was five and my folks were we were
I was an only child
so the three of us had gone to to see the Von Hindenburg
which had which was a big dirigible that was transporting people across the ocean
and it was the last one before as it turned out before it exploded and in in its return trip
and so my dad was real anxious to see this thing that that he had been talking about
so we went to see it
and on the way back they decided theyd stop at a little kind of amusement park but it had monkeys and other small animals down in the front area
and so my mother hadta go into the restroom
she said
now you watch her
dont let her get into trouble
and so I was watching the monkeys
and he was standing there talking to me
I poked my finger in the cage
and the monkey
sothat although it didnt actually break the bone it twisted my finger sothat its always been crooked
and ofcourse when my mother came out she said
it does look like for five minutes you could watch her
and I remember that very vividly laughing
because laughing because it was my fault but my dad got into trouble
it was
not really
yeah that gets to be difficult
oh okay laughing
well I spent last summer taking an ASU class in Florence Italy for a six week summer session
and ofcourse I do do not speak Italian
so it became imperative that I be able to atleast read enough so that I knew what was going on
but lots of times I misunderstood
and so I would hafta point to what somebody else was eating if thats what I wanted to order
or wed go in a f a cafeteria and so I could point to the food that I wanted
and I needed directions I hadta show them the map of where I wanted to go
and laughing and point to youknow what I wanted to do
and then they usually could point me in the right direction
so I used objects
I used food that other people were eating
and I used a map
and I tried one of the few of my other words but they werent very good so
they would always smile at me
they usually figure out what it was I wanted laughing
I dont get so
I I cant remember any time when I was really scared
I I Ive never been in fear for my life
but I did have an automobile accident
I was driving south on Central
went to turn on Bethany home
and I looked at the oncoming traffic and there wasnt anybody
but there was a car about a block down the street
and I started to turn
and before I got through the intersection the car hit me broadside
and knocked me into the telephone pole
and my I had on an Indian necklace that had a wire that was strung on jewelers wire
and they hit me so hard that it broke that necklace off my neck
and the pieces went all over the xxx
and I wasnt frightened from that
but I was really nervous because we didnt have very much money and the car was relatively new
and I didnt wanna hafta go home and tell my husband that that Id wreck the car
and so when I got home
my mother came and pick me up because he was outof town
but she called him
and told him that I was that Id had an accident
so he came home
when he got home I was standing out in the driveway waiting for him
and he said
oh what did you do
and I told him
and he said
oh as long as youre okay
I dont the car can always be fixed
and so that was as close as I came to really being scared
oh I it was
it really was
oh I guess I hafta take that back
the only time I really was scared when I went in to take my dissertation defense

Cinderella had a very happy home
but her mother died
and after a bit her father remarried
and stepmother had two very unattractive and unpleasant daughters
and they made Cinderellas life miserable
as they grew Cinderella became the the housemaid and took care of everything for the for the girls
did what they wanted her to
fetched whatever they wanted from her
and in the meantime the young prince had grown
and the father was disturbed because he hadnt found the princess that he wanted to marry
so he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday
and he sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball
so the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation
so they got their new dresses
and had Cinderella polish and shine everything sothat they would look just elegant
and so because the invitation went to everyone Cinderella decided she would prepare a a dress to go too
all the animals had helped her prepare it in the movie
and she sewed this lovely little
it was simple dress but very very pretty xxx
and when she what this the time came for them all to dress and go to the ball why she helped the stepsisters get dressed
and then she went up and put on her pretty little pink dress
and when she came down the stepsister says
oh
they couldnt she could not go with them
that was absolutely impossible because she was nothing but a chambermaid
and so they actually tore her dress so she couldnt wear it
they got in their coach and left
and Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball
and the sisters were so mean to her
and allofasudden her fairy godmother appeared
and she said
I will take care of this
I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land
which she did
and it was just gorgeous
and Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful
but she said
how am I going to get there
and the fairy said
bring me the pumpkin and mice
and she made a coach outof the pumpkin and horses and mice became horses
so they carried her to the to the ball
when she entered the prince was just dazzled by her
and he asked her to dance
and they danced again
and they danced again
and finally it struck midnight
and she knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave as soon as before midnight
so she dashed outof the ball
and in her hurry she lost one of her slippers glass slippers
and got into the coach and took off
but unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve
and she had nothing but a pumpkin and mice
and she had lost her pretty dress
but she still had one single glass slipper
and so she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she didnt think shed ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had
and the the sisters came home
and they were talking about this strange young woman who was there
that she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her
and they wondered who she was and howcome he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once
and then the prince was s so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing Cinderella
and the the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper on all all of the eligible young women
and so the stepmother said
we have only two
and so he they tried to push their big feet into the i i glass slipper and it wouldnt work
they were too big
and he said
but isnt there another young woman here
and Cinderella came out
and she said
yes Im here
eventhough the stepmother said
no no no we dont have anybody else
and the envoy said
oh well then you must try it on
and so she pulled out the slipper that was in her pocket that shed been carrying
and said
I think this matches
and he slipped the other shoe on her foot
and they both fit beautifully
and he then took her back to the palace
and they had a beautiful wedding
and Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after

in the meantime all his family members were having a good time in the picnic in the meadow
and he was eating the raspberries
and when the family realized that one of them was missing they started looking for the for the little mouse

I tried to explain it in a different way using different words different sentences using examples
or not or letting them reexplain making them repeat back what I just said so they understand it
so I understand what theyre what theyre listening to what Im saying

I just rode it out and hoped for the best
and I finally recovered on my own without getting needing surgery or anything
I just got through it I guess

this is the story about Cinderella a nice young lady who wanted to go to the ball but she had lived with an evil stepmom and three evil stepsisters
she was made to clean the house while the stepsisters got ready for the ball
somehow she found an invitation to go to the ball or someone invited her
she went to the ball and looked very pretty
and up suddenly a prince rode up and said
Im looking for this person whos sposta be my princess
I know its her if her foot fits in the shoe
he came over and tried the shoe on Cinderella
it was the right fit and turned out that was his princess
and they went off and she became a gold digger and rescued
they settle down
theres a little girl and she was playing outside with her bike and her cat
the cat got up in the tree
and she couldnt get him to come back down
so her dad went out to try and help
got the ladder climbed the tree
then the ladder fell over
so hes now stuck in the tree with the cat
and the dog is barking
but he cant really climb the tree to help
so the firemen have showed up with a tall ladder to save the man and the cat
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need some really good high quality sprouted grain bread
maybe
so then youd take two slices
and you wanna get a nice high quality peanut butter
preferably just peanuts
maybe a little bit of salt
nice organic
and then you can spread the peanut butter
and then for your jelly you could actually use a preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself so its got really pure high quality ingredients
and you would just
and then you would introduce the two slices to each other
and you have a sandwich
in elementary school I was rollerblading with my aunt
and she took off down a hill
and I went behind her
and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone
but I didnt really feel it at all
I didnt feel any pain or anything
I was just happy I had ke avoided
but when I looked down and saw all the blood
oh
and then I kicked into ke a pain association
so I hadta go get stitches
and a large man carried me into a wheelchair
and it was awkward
and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front
and she was I think she was pretty spun on something else
and she was just shouting having fights with everybody
so she came over and attacked us
and my friend was she was trying to attack one of my friends
so we were trying to get in the way and stop her from doing that
and during the whole commotion as we were trying to separate this really upset woman a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with ke just a
and and then he was actually
because my friend then got really pissed off because that was her boyfriend
and she was just kinda screaming
and he was about to knock her out
so that was a little bit high tension
hadta break that up and call the cops and all that
Ive had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they cant really have a genuine conversation with you because they cant get around their own
just very self oriented kindof selfish in a way
cant really have a two person conversation because they dont move past a certain point in their mind
they just loop the track and go right back to another place
yeah I try to just be patient and continually try to open those doors of communication
so its its my mother
so its a lifetime process
but maybe in the next twenty years or something we can talk
so theres a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better
and he still hasnt quite learned
so as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house
and theres a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened
so there is a little boy getting ready for school
and his mom comes up and says
dont you wanna take your umbrella
and he says
no
hes asserting his independence and making decisions for himself
so he doesnt wanna take his mothers good advice
he goes out for the day and realizes that its raining raining very very hard
there are puddles everywhere
its really uncomfortable to be that wet
so he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels alot better because now he has some weather protection
so there is a little girl whose mother has died
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her
so shes introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters
shes excited
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean
and the stepmother is very cruel
so all the years as shes raised with them during the beginning few years its its okay
its not great
and then her father dies
and shes left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters
and they basically make her to be a maid
theyre never very kind to her
and she hasta do all the work on the farm
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food
so theres also in the same area a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince
so he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region
so an invitation for a ball sothat the prince can choose a bride
and they get this invitation at Cinderellas house
the stepmother reads it
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited
they wanna go meet this handsome prince
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess
so they get ready for the ball
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball
she wants to go dance and have fun
so she hangs out with all her little animal friends and is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that shes not allowed to go
shes not going to go
they rip off all of her jewelry
they tear apart her dress
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes aswell
so Cinderellas very sad
she doesnt know what to do
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that shes going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny
so she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride creates a beautiful dress for her gives her these delightful glass slippers and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was
so Cinderella goes and is very excited
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night
and the stepsisters are very jealous
they dont know who this woman even is
and shes having a great time
but then she realizes that this the clock is about to strike
and so she runs in such a hurry
and the prince goes after her like
wait
you cant leave
why are you leaving
and she just says
I hafta go
and she leaves
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe
so Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house
but it doesnt fit the fat foot of the sister
it doesnt fit the fat foot of the other sister
and it sure doesnt fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella
so they know that shes the one that was at the party
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after
I would open the can of or jar of peanut butter
take a knife
and get some peanut butter on on the knife
and spread it on the
and then we get a spoon and and take some jelly outof the jar and spread it
put the other slice on the top
thats it
it looks like the family caught
and the father goes up the tree to to rescue the the cat
and he goes up a ladder
and and while hes up there somehow or other the somehow or other the ladder fell off fell away from the tree
now hes now hes stuck
and the dog is barking
hes all excited
and a little girl I guess thats his daughter is trying to coax a cat to come down
and somebody had called the firemen to come out and rescue the father
and so theyre theyre on their way to to put up a ladder and and get the get the father down
oh a good many years ago I was diagnosed with congestive heart failure
and a year ago this last June
and its always a concern of my doctors
and and I have diabetes
and a year ago this last June Ill never forget it
I was taking a shower on a Sunday morning getting ready to go to church
and Ive started panting
Id never got got there before
just over and over
and I couldnt get it outof that shower fast enough and get dressed
and so I called nine nineoneone
and they took me into the hospital
and that night I went to the bathroom
and I and I was vomiting throwing up
and before I got back to my bed a nurse comes running in
she says

so Ive been in great shape ever since
I exercise alot
but I thought my time was up but got through it
yeah
youknow its a funny thing
when when the nurse came in and told me that my heart had stopped I was just went back to bed and went to sleep
I dont have any worries about death
I figure that the good Lord has been really good to me for a very very long time
so
ERROR
oh Im really scared of heights
I remember my couple of my sons and my wife and I went to HolyLake
and we decided to take a back road back to where we were staying at HolyLake
wed be gone out shopping or something
and allofasudden there was this this downpour like you wouldnt believe
Imean it was just like the whole skies had opened up and dropped
and so we had crossed this little bridge wooden bridge
and we couldnt get go any further
we noticed the water
I told my wife
I says
hey you you walk
Im gonna back this car out very slowly
you know what she said to me
she says
if you go I wanna go with you
I thought
wow
that that bridge mustve been slippery
and I backed up very very slowly
that scared the life outof me
that was really scary
yep yep
yes theres a lady here
I I like to sing
theres a theres a operatic soprano that comes here once a month and and leads us in group singing
and we had a talent show
and this one one lady she had had a stroke at one time
and she wanted to sing with me
and God bless her
I cant I have a hard time understanding her just talking
but we got through it
we sang together and did something
and but shes a real sweet lady
and I I I always have a hard time understanding her
there is one other lady that is hard to understand
but anyway theyre stroke victims
so I guess that happens
this little boy is playing out in the yard
and he and he kicks this
it must be a basketball
gives it a good kick
and it goes right through the window of this this house
and it knocks over a lamp in this living room
I dont know if its his house or if its a neighbors
but anyway the man looked like he was kindof upset
he picks up the ball
and he looks at the hole in the window
and and hes hes probably perturbed
thats about it I think
looks like this little boy is is getting ready to go someplace
and his mother says
its its sposta be raining
its sposta rain
and you better take this umbrella
and the little boy just waves waves and
well nah I dont need the umbrella
and so he goes out on his for his walk or to school or wherever
and sure enough he gets caught in the rain and goes inside
and he looks like hes kinda down in the dumps
and his mother is frowning at him saying
I told you take the umbrella
and so this time he does take the umbrella and walks out in the rain
Cinderella I believe was kindof a
I believe she worked for this wealthy family if Im not mistaken
and she was always envious of the rich the people that had alot more than she had
and she wanted to go to this ball
and I forget how the shoe is involved
I believe she danced with this prince
I believe she was told that if she could wear if this shoe would fit her she would be accepted
ohgosh
and it did fit her
and everybody was so happy
I dont I dont remember
flunked that part
so a little girl lost her cat up the tree and then couldnt get the cat outof the tree
so there was a
the neighbor said
oh Ill come over and get your cat outof the tree
and put the ladder up ke on the tree and started climbing up the tree
and when he got up in the tree he realized he couldnt get to the cat
meanwhile the dog came along and knocked the ladder over and started barking at him
and he got scared
and so finally another neighbor hadta call the fire department so they could save the cat and the guy in the tree
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you needta have a loaf of bread peanut butter and jelly

I was hospitalized once when I was in SouthAmerica
I was on vacation within a vacation
and I was out late one night at a bar and restaurant coming home
and I got jumped and stabbed and subsequently led me to be hospitalized
and what I remember I hadta I the doctors didnt have any anesthesia
so I hadta watch them stitch me up without any anesthesia
and it was a pretty terrible experience
and I recovered
so thats good
yes Ive been in a situation where I was frightened and scared
that was this one time when I was the same time I guess
should I use the same story
okay so the same story I had before when I was in SouthAmerica and I got jumped and stabbed I was pretty frightened for my the safety of my life
and so that was a scary time
I dont Im really sorry
it was dark and scary
I believe Ive had experiences with people whove had a difficult time communicating
Ive spoken with people who are shy and arent very confident
and I would take my time and listen to them and try to help them along with their conversation and just be patient and try not to say anything negative to them
I wanted to help them along with their conversation
so there was a young boy who decided to go out and practice his soccer game
and while he was out practicing he kicked the soccer ball into the neighbors window
and the neighbor was at home while this happened
freaked him out because a ball came flying through his window and crashed
and so the neighbor decided wanted to know what happened
and so he grabbed the ball
realized some kids mustve been outside and kicked the ball through his window
so he decided to go reconcile the situation by bringing back the ball and getting some information from the boy
okay
so it was early in the morning
and the young boy young boy hadta go to school
and it was raining outside
so the mother said
you gotta take your umbrella
and the boy said
I dont wanna take an umbrella
Ill be fine
I like walking in the rain
and the mother is
okay well go ahead
so the boy starts walking out into the rain and starts getting really wet and realizes
oh its not that fun to go walk in the rain
comes running back home
and hes all soaking wet
and his mothers just furious that hes all soaking wet because he didnt take the umbrella
and now he came back
so hes gonna be late for school
so the boy finally dries off and gets ready
okay mom youre I guess youre right
Ill take the umbrella
and the mother was happy that the boy finally listened to his mother
the boy made it to school walking to school without getting wet because he used the umbrella like his mom told him in the first place
so the story of Cinderella starts off by Cinderellas father takes her to her new home with and introduces them to her new stepsisters and her new stepmother
and so at first things are okay
and Cinderella just ends up having to do chores and earn earn her keep inside the house
and then one day there was a grand ball going on at the great palace
and an invitation came that said all the ladies in the house could come to the grand ball
so everybody was really excited at that they were gonna go to the grand ball at the palace
and so everybody was getting ready
and Cinderella had a nice dress
and it seemed to be nicer than her stepsisters
so her stepsisters got jealous wrecked her dress made fun of her and everything
and Cinderella was upset
and then she couldnt go to the ball because her dress was ruined
and the stepsisters just laughed at her and made fun of her
so Cinderella stayed at home
and the stepsisters ended up going out to the ball
meanwhile there was a magic mouse or
I think it was a magic mouse that granted Cinderella a wish
and Cinderella wished she could go to the ball and and have a nice dress to to go to the ball in
and so oh it was a fairy godmother
the fairy godmother granted the wish to Cinderella and gave Cinderella the most beautiful dress that there ever was and turned the pumpkin into a carriage sothat she could be escorted in to the to the grand ball in a nice carriage with her nice dress
so when she gets to the grand ball everybodys impressed with how beautiful Cinderella is and how nice her dress is
and the prince asks Cinderella to dance
and the evil stepsisters are there and are so jealous that Cinderellas there and now with an even nicer dress than she had before
and now shes getting asked to dance with the prince which all the stepsisters wanted and and were so envious of Cinderella
so Cinderella was so enlightened and enthusiastic about being at the ball with the beautiful dress and now dancing with the prince
and it was like a dream come true
but the fairy godmother said
you hafta be home before midnight
so otherwise everything wont go back to normal
and so Cinderella noticed that it was almost midnight
so she runs out outof the ball in a right after her dance with the prince
but the prince wanted to know more about Cinderella
so the prince chased after
Cinderella was running down the steps lost one of her slippers
but she didnt care because she hadta get home before midnight
and so she gets in her carriage and gets escorted away back to her home
but she makes it home in time
so everything turns back to normal
her her nice her beautiful dress turns back to a normal just apron dress
and the carriage turns back into a pumpkin
and so the next day the prince still with the the thoughts of Cinderella on his mind wants to find out who Cinderella was
and all he has left is a glass slipper
so he sends out his servant to find who the woman was with the glass slipper and makes everybody try out the a glass slipper
and finally they find they finally find someone who the glass slipper fits on
and its Cinderella
and all the evil stepsisters are again so furious at Cinderella because shes the lucky one that fits the glass slipper
and she had the greatest experience ever
and so the prince oversees that Cinderellas just a lonely servant girl
and the prince decides to marry her
and they youknow get married and live happily ever after

one sunny day in June a family of rats decided to get all the family together and go for a picnic
they packed the truck with all their toys
and they gathered all the rats
they climbed some climbed in the front of the cab
some of the younger rats climbed in the back
off they went down the road up a great big hill with flowers and bushes
it was a very bumpy road with lotsof rocks
when they hit one particularly large rock a little girl rat with her baby with her stuffed animal flew right outof the back of the truck
the truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls
she lay alongside the road watching the truck drive off in the distance
the rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic
and they all climbed outof the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys
some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water
some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers
it was a beautiful lake
and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time
grandpa rat played the fiddle while grandma sat next to her
and mother and father rat watched their children play
everybody was having so much fun except for the little rat who had fallen outof the truck
she sat alongside the trail hugging her stuffed animal to her and crying
she was so scared and lonely
the woods seemed so big and scary
she looked every which way
and didnt know what to do
the flowers were pretty
and she looked at the red flowers around her
and the yellow flowers
meanwhile back at the lake father called all the little rats to come and have lunch
back in the woods the little rat the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her
she found that they were very very yummy
and she filled up on juicy red raspberries
meanwhile back at the lake the family started to realize that something was wrong
they were missing the little girl rat
the children sat and waited while the parents searched and called
but she was nowhere to be seen
they looked in the water and along the edges
they looked under rocks and in the grass
they were sad
some of the young rats were even crying
they did not know what had happened to their little sister
they decided that they needed to pack up and head back the way that they had come
nobody was going to be able to eat or have fun until they were all together again
the little rat back along the trail had filled up on berries and was laying down in the grass just looking up at the sky wondering what to do next
the rats in the truck searched and searched as they drove back along the trail the way they had come
the little rat thought she heard something
she thought she heard the rumbling of a truck and her brothers and sisters and mother and father and grandma and grandpa calling her name
she rushed through the grass back towards the road
she ran out into the road just in time to see her fathers truck cresting the hill
and they spotted her
and they all waved and were so happy to find her again
but and they hugged joyfully did cartwheels and jumped and cried
but the little girl realized that something was wrong
she had lost the stuffed animal that had given her such comfort when she was lost in the woods
she ran back through the woods
and in the grass there she found her bunny laying down her stuffed animal
she hugged her stuffed animal to her
and she was so happy
they all climbed back into the truck again
actually they all decided to set up and have a picnic right there where they had found their little sister
so they started to spread out the blankets and get the food out once again
but this time they were most certain to have a happy picnic because they were all together
the same thing

good dog Carl
Carl lived in a family lived in a house with a family that had a little baby
Carl was a big Rottweiller
and he was when when the mother went out shopping she said to Carl
look after the baby Carl
Ill be back shortly
Carl was being left to babysit for a baby
and he was just a big happy dog
they waited as they watched the mother get into her car and drive away
Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone
the baby also waited expectantly
when Carl was sure it was safe he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed outof the crib and onto Carls back
Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse
they were going to have such a good time together
they walked down the hall into mothers bedroom
it looked so soft
they jumped up onto the bed
and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch
afterwards they got off the bed and they went over to moms vanity
there the baby got into moms powder perfumed powder
and he dusted Carls nose
it tickled Carls nose
but he liked the smell of the powder
and he was having so much fun with baby
they played dressup
Carl looked so cute with mothers beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can on top of him just like a little purple hat
baby had a hat too
baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff
they looked at themselves in the mirror and they smiled
this was so much fun
next Carl took the baby to the laundry chute
uhoh
what do you think is going to happen here
the baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down
and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby
he gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry
Carl jumps down the stairs gets the baby on his back again and climbs back up runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck
Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room scattering the newspaper every which way
they walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish
the baby decided that he wanted to go swimming
and so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water
the baby splashed and chased the fish
afterwards Carl decided that he wanted to dance
amazingly Carl knew how to turn on the stereo
and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music
and Carl danced and danced for the baby
and the baby laughed and clapped his hands
afterwards Carl and the baby were both very hungry
so they wandered into the kitchen
they got into the refrigerator
and what did they find but bread and butter
Carl got a package of whole wheat bread
and he ripped it open
and ate all the bread
meanwhile the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers and tasting the salty buttery taste
they found grapes
and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth
they made chocolate milk with syrup
what a mess
you can imagine there was syrup and milk all over the floor
and whats in the red jar
ohmy
there was food everywhere
and the baby was a mess
the baby climbed onto Carls back
and they climbed back up the stairs leaving the mess behind
Carl smart dog that he was started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside
he got a washcloth a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap
and he scrubbed the baby
Carls mouth was full of soap
and he made bubbles when he breathed which made the baby laugh
afterwards Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry
he brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside
then Carl had work to do
he went back down to the kitchen
finished off the bread
put the wrapper in the trash
licked up the milk
he looked out the window
mom wasnt back yet
he still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away
after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around and fun time he looked out the window and saw mother coming home
the baby was laying in his crib quietly
and Carl laid down next to the baby and waited
mother walked in to see them just as she had left them
she was happy that Carl was such a good babysitter
good dog Carl
she said
and rubbed his head while he put his head on her lap

okay
to plant a flower in the garden the first thing that you needta do is dig a hole twice as big as the root or twice as big as the pot
and then you needta mix some compost in with the soil that you just dug out
put the plant back into the hole
and fill around it with the mixture of the dirt and the compost
and then you make a mound in the middle
making sure that the root ball is just just covered
and then you can make a little moat make make a little moat around the dirt ball
then you water it
and as the dirt settles down you add more dirt if necessary
and then saturate the soil to make sure that it has gotten all the way through to the water to the roots and that the soil is settled

on my last vacation we joined my best friend and her family in their rv going to the GrandCanyon
there were seven of us
four in my family and three in her family
we loaded into the rv on a very stormy night here in Phoenix
as we head north towards the GrandCanyon the rain stopped but that wasnt but we werent in the clear
a trucker passing us waved at us indicating that something was wrong
and so we pulled over alongside the road
and found that the vehicle we were towing behind the motorhome had blown a tire and ripped up the whole front side of the truck we were towing
while the children slept in the motorhome the adults got out
and changed the tire
and did the things that we needed to do
and we proceeded on to Flagstaff
we stayed in the Walmart parking lot that night sothat the very next morning we could wake up and get the tire fixed
and proceed with our vacation
the next morning after the tire was fixed we drove up to the GrandCanyon
and had a wonderful time eventhough we were a day late getting there becauseof our problems
we had a wonderful time
and we hiked into the GrandCanyon and out again
we went to dinner and watched an Imax movie
and everybody had a wonderful time
and it turned out to be a really good vacation despite the rough start
last Christmas
we had Christmas at my house
so I hadta put together a big dinner for everybody
but my mother inlaw did a prime rib roast prime rib roast
and my husband fried a turkey outside
all the family about fifteen people came to our house
and after dinner which we had outside on the patio we went back inside and gathered around the Christmas tree that we had cut in the forest a couple weeks earlier
everybody said it was the funniest looking but most beautiful Christmas tree they had ever seen
we had a white elephant gift exchange with a forty dollar maximum
and we all selected a gift
and we traded gifts
and we took eachother gifts
and everybody laughed
all the gifts were very nice and
in the end everybody got what they wanted
and we had a nice time
we had a nice dinner
and after dinner and the gift exchange we all went to the movies
and thats how we spent Christmas Day
yes it is

last weekend we went into the TontoNationalForest in Payson outside of Paysin to cut firewood
I had gone to the ranger station in Mesa and bought a firewood cutting permit
and so we packed up without any motorhome
just tents and sleeping bags and trailers trailer and a chainsaw and axes
and lotsof food and cooking supplies for my mother inlaw
and early Saturday morning we drove up to Payson
we we followed along a dirt road that the ranger had recommended
and we found a nice place to camp with lotsof dead trees around us
after we set up camp we unloaded our atv
and we started dragging huge logs back up the hill to our camp
we cut the logs we cut the the long tree stumps into logs and laid them next to the camper where we would load them the next day
but mother inlaw was gonna be sleeping in the camper or the not the camper but the trailer so we couldnt load until the next day
my husband and I stayed in a tent on a air mattress
and it was so nice
it rained as we were going to sleep
but we could still hear the crickets
and the the popping of the fire just outside the tent
and some and so thats thats how I went to sleep
it was beautiful
sometime during the night I woke up we woke up because there was a coyote howling closeby
so we got up
and we opened up the tent
the rain had passed
the sky was clear
the theres a million stars
and we sat and listened to the coyote
and I was actually it was it was so dark out there besides the stars
there was nobody else around us
and I was able to get outof my sleeping bag and wander around in just my underwear and sneakers
and it just felt so good because nobody could see me
nobody cared
and
seems like I stayed up half the night looking at the stars and listening to the coyotes
got up in the morning
and and grandma cooked pancakes and sausage over a propane grill
and we loaded up the firewood and went on home

I was riding a quad
I was thirty years old
and we were at LittleSahara sand dunes in northern Oklahoma
it was nineteen ninety four
right before Thanks right before Halloween
and my husband and I were out riding
he was on a performance quad that had big shock absorbers
and we were and I was on a utility quad like a hunting quad thats more made as a workhorse and not for racing
we went over a hill
and sped down the other side of the hill
and at the bottom there were bumps
and my husbands bike just went right over the bumps
but mine hit the bumps and
as my body was coming off of a bump my bike had hit another bump and came back up
and I heard a loud and felt a really loud pop
and I stopped the bike or the bike stopped itself
and I realized I was in alotof pain
couldnt move
so my husband came back
and he took me off the bike
and laid me on the ground
and I remember making sounds
I remember I was embarrassed at the same time that I was in pain because I was making sounds like an animal
it was embarrassing
and I told my husband I could not get back on the bike
that I couldnt do it
I couldnt move
and I was in too much pain
and he was annoyed
and he said
if you dont get back on that bike were gonna hafta get a ambulance crew out here for you
do you want that
and I said
no
I dont
so he lifted me back on the bike
and he put both of my hands on the steering wheel or the handlebars
and he put my feet on the pedals
and he drove he drove ahead of me
and he he went as quickly as he could back to the car
meanwhile it took me about an hour to get three miles
and I made it back to the car
and he hadta lift me off
and put me in the seat
it took three hours for us to get home or to the hospital
and xrays and everything
broken back
and when my husband called me that night from home and I was in the hospital not having any idea when youknow what our what our future was going to be like he told me he was very sad
very sad and very sorry
oh yeah

my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia
so her first language is Mandarin Chinese
and then her second language is English
and I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods insteadof really understanding things
and its taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her eventhough she insists she understands
youknow and the the very next day shell not have a clue what I had told her
and so I have just learned to watch for cues that shes not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding
and Ive hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase inorderto make sure that she understands
I was in the military
Id just come to Phoenix from Korea
and I didnt know anybody yet
and so I got a parttime job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard
and I worked middle of the night shift all night shift
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons
we werent allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon
theres actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for selfdefense or as a weapon
so on this fifty acre site there was one light pole
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds
so all around you its pitch black
and youre just under this light pole
and you cant see beyond the darkness or beyond the light
and so I would sit there at night
and one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning
and this time it was around three in the morning
and I didnt realize that they were going to be coming that early
and I was sitting where I shouldnt have been sitting
I was just outside the light sothat I could see
because its creepy
very creepy all night long
and so youknow by three oclock in the morning I was already on edge
and allofasudden
and I hadnt seen anybody approaching
but allofasudden a man jumped out from behind a closeby PortaPotty
he yelled
and he had a rope in his hand
and he was stretching the rope inbetween his hands like this
and he yelled
and I screamed
and he laughed
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up
and he continued to laugh
and I cried because it had scared me so badly
as it turns out he was just one of the construction workers that showed up early and maybe got dropped off along the road

it was monsoon season in Phoenix Arizona
and it had been raining for days and days
and the creeks were flooding
and the there were roads that were impassable
there were roadblocks up everywhere
but every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads
they dont realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water
and that its much deeper than they realized
one father had gone across the or had attempted to cross the road
he thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine
then as they entered the water very quickly the
and pushed his truck right off the road
he and his daughter were the only ones in the truck
daughter was in her seatbelt
he was able to get outof his seatbelt
then he climbed to the top of the truck
and over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter
the water swept them off the top of the truck
and as they as they were swept downstream they caught a tree
and the girl hung on to the tree alone because her father had been swept further down
and he hadta grab another tree down the way
someone watching who had seen everything had called nineoneone
the fire department got there
and they saw the little girl clinging to the tree
one particularly strong handsome young fire fighter put on his life vest
jumped out into the water
grabbed the tree
put his arms around the little girl
and she clung to him knowing that her life depended on it
he held her very tightly while he put another belt around her
it was a belt similar to the one he was wearing
and they they tied themselves together with the belt
and his friends back on shore the other fire fighters pulled him back to the shore with the girl
and when she was safe a different fire fighter went in after the father
and got him safely out
and they gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law
and he got a bill for fifteen hundred dollars for the rescue of him and his daughter

once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella
her mother had died
and her father married a new wife who had two children of her own

and they started planning right away for the ball
Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she couldnt go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs
and the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of of very long difficult dirty jobs knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them inorderto go to the ball
Cinderella was so sad
and she went in her room and cried
and her animal friends gathered around her
she was friends with all the animals because she was so nice
the animals loved her
the animals helped her do her chores
and they all worked very hard
and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball
when it was time to go to the ball she went downstairs
and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress they just went crazy with rage
and they tore the dress off of her the pins outof her hair
and they pushed her down
and told her that she didnt deserve to come to the ball
crying she went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her
and then fairy godmother appeared
and took pity on Cinderella
with a wave of her wand the fairy godmother produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen
and Cinderella looked beautiful
the stepmother or the fairy godmother said that Cinderella was to go to the ball
but she hadta be back home by midnight
because at midnight her clothes and her carriage and everything were gonna disappear and go back to normal
so she took some mice and with a wave of her wand she turned them into horses
and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage
and Cinderella climbed in in her beautiful gown and went to the ball
everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom
and the prince fell in love immediately
they danced all night
she was having such a good time Cinderella was she didnt realize how late it was
and as the clock struck the first bell for twelve oclock she looked up and realized how late it was and what was gonna happen
with a gasp she ran outof the ballroom leaving the prince shocked not knowing what was going on
she ran outof the ballroom and down the stairs
she hadta get outof there before the last bong
before the twelfth bong bell
on the way down the steps she tripped and lost a slipper
a beautiful little glass slipper
she made it home
and all the beautiful dresses and pumpkin coach and horses turned back into what they had been before the fairy godmother visited
so she had made it home safely without anybody quite figuring out who she was
and she went she went to her room and went to sleep dreaming about the prince
the prince wasnt happy because he didnt know who she was where she lived
and he didnt know when he was gonna see her again
so he took the glass slipper and had his his servant go to every house in the city
and all the girls hadta try on the slipper
he knew that whoever the slipper fit was gonna be the girl who he had fallen in love with at the dance or at the ball
the two girls the two stepsisters tried to fit their feet into the slipper but their feet were too big
and the servant said
isnt there anyone else
Ive searched all the houses
there has gotta be somebody else
and just then Cinderella appeared in her work dress
and he says
ah
heres another girl
she needs to try on the slipper too
so Cinderella placed her foot into the slipper
and it slid in very easily
and she smiled
and the servant smiled and said
oh
at last I found you
and he brought Cinderella back to the castle
while the sisters stared after her with anger in their eyes
the prince was very happy that his servant had found Cinderella
when they got married Cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them
and she was kind to them
and they all lived and they were sorry for how mean they had been to her
and they all lived happily ever after

okay when I was seventeen years old after Id a graduated from high school
I went to Anaheim for a week long conference
and while I was there I developed meningitis
and I couldnt lay my head down on the pillow
it it it was excruciating
youknow the my scalp is very sensitive so I couldnt lay my head down on anything
I really didnt know what was wrong with me
I just thought I had a bad headache
so I went out to the kitchen and just sat there for about an hour or two
it was the middle of the night and didnt really know what to do because I couldnt lay my head down
but I was exhausted
and so I ended up going
and there was someone staying in the room with me
I I told them that I couldnt sleep
something was wrong with my head
and he was actually a neurologist
but he ended up giving me some pretty strong pills to help the pain go away
and it helped through the morning
but then the next day it continued to hurt
so I ended up going to the hospital that evening
I was actually staying with three doctors
so they took me to the the hospital
and they checked me in
they did a first did a ec
lets see what was it
a cat
think it was a cat
and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me
so that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture
a it was a it was a resident it was a teaching hospital it was UCIrvine
and he didnt do a very good job at it
so the the doctor was watching him took over
it was painful
but they had given me morphine by this point
so I felt much better
I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside
and I was still in the emergency room at that point
and eventually the next morning got me into my own room
and I felt fine by the next day
but they didnt think I was doing well because I wasnt eating that much
but when I was seventeen I was only eating one meal a day
but they said I they would let me go home if I didnt eat more
so I hadta eat three meals a day
and they wanted to monitor me
and but I felt great
and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there
and they kept me two more days
and they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go
and to check my white blood cell count
and it was pretty much the same as it was before
so it didnt show much of an improvement
but I felt great
so they let me go home
lets see is it
my niece and my one of my nieces one of my nephews had a speech delay
it was it was mainly with phonation
just problems with mainly with
lets see what was it
I think it was the sl hl sound

but thats not a big problem
youknow you develop later
I I actually did work with one of my nieces in regards to that
she was very responsive
but it it wasnt that big of a difficulty
youknow we could just I could still understand her for the most part
wasnt a big problem

Cinderella was a little girl
her mother had passed away
and her father ended up remarrying a woman who had two daughters
the this woman and her two daughters
well eventually Cinderellas father also passed away
and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother
her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her their servant basically
and everyone they were very cruel to her
and she lived a very meager life
and but she was friends with all the animals
the animals were the people she got along with people she could talk to or the the creatures that she could talk to
and then one day the there was a prince in that country
and they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife
and as it was time for him to marry
and all and Cinderella and their her stepsisters were very excited to go
however Cinderella could not go unless she had finished all her chores
her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first
so by the time it came to go Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to make a dress or prepare herself to go
but unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters clothes and such that they had cast away because they didnt want it
so Cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her
and while the the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away
and they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters
and she went out to the yard and was crying
and then a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight
she made her very beautiful and all that
but she warned her
it would only last til midnight
and youknow she turned youknow a pumpkin into a carriage and youknow transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince
and I guess it was love at first sight
and they were dancing together
and youknow he he very much enjoyed his time with her
and they were dancing outside
and she saw the clock
and she knows its almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs leaving one of her glass slippers behind
and she went racing off in the carriage
and she actually didnt make it quite home in the when it struck midnight
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers
and so this prince after this happened he was very interested in finding her
youknow he was he wondered why she had ran away
and so he set out to search for her using the glass slipper
youknow whoevers foot it fit would be that girl
he sent out his I dont know it was the duke or something to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit
it was very small
and eventually that duke got to Cinderellas house
and Cinderella got excited
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella
I dont remember how
and locked Cinderella up there
and while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper
their feet were way too large
they went flying youknow every time
and the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper
the stepmother was very angry at this
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper
and the stepmother tripped him
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces
and youknow the duke thought that everything was over
and everything was ruined
and theyd never find her
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity
and she ended up marrying the prince
and they lived happily ever after
one day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat Patches was in the tree stuck and was crying
she ran home quickly to get her dad to help him to help the cat out
the dad brought a ladder just in case
and as they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree
the father then climbed up the tree
well thats kindof wrong but
and the dog happened to knock over the ladder after the dad the dog knocked over the ladder after the dad already climbed into the tree
now the father was also stuck
meanwhile the neighbor called nineoneone
and then an a the firemen came to help him down from the tree
okay
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
first you would go to the fridge and get the bread
then
well then you would take the bread and grab two slices
and you would put peanut butter on both slices because I love extra peanut butter
then you would put jelly on both those slices
then if you want you could put the banana in it but its peanut butter and jelly so I wouldnt put banana
and I would just put the two slices together
put in on a plate
and then begin to eat it
milk might go better but were good
alright I am
so the it is little Johnnys birthday
and he comes home comes into his house and kindof is a surprise party
people are arriving
and needless to say his birthday is ruined because his birthday cake is half eaten by the dog who is nonetheless sleeping under the couch after a nice fat meal
we all know how that feels
and so he sees that and he gets mad
the mother gets worse even more mad and wants to go you know get the dog out from under the couch and youknow use her broom and bop him on the head and teach him a lesson
and eventually they realize well its alright
its not the end of the world
they love the dog
the dog only meant well
the kid becomes happy
he gets his presents
the little girls and everyone plays
and thats the end of today
nope
well actually Ive never been hospitalized or broke a bone
knock on wood
I really I wasnt the kind of person to really ever get hurt
I mean bumps and bruises but nothing too serious
the only one time
well I could name two mainly
but the the the most recent kindof hurt was my senior year of high school no my junior year of high school playing football
I was during practice
yeah
I we were doing a drill and I had the ball
and the other guy hadta tackle me
and I was kindof sposta let him tackle me
so I go and I let him tackle me
and as he tackles me he youknow throws me to the ground
and I land
and I end up just landing on the ground on my shoulder
and it ke kindof cracks
I go
a
terrible terrible pain
and youknow I I go off to the side
and the coach checks me out and says
yeah youknow you needta get checked out
that then I end up I end up youknow that the next day or maybe that I think it was that day
I I go to the hospital just to have them look at it
and Imean I dont know if I I consider hospitalized overnight
but I I wasnt overnight
just go in and look at it
they say
well youre
why do I think this is
Im sorry
I skipped a part
I go to my sports doctor first
he he looks at it
if I got this right the separation the difference between a separation and a dislocation is the distance
anything less is a dislocation
and mine was at seven
so seven centimeters separated
so yeah he tells me that
sends me to the says
go to the hospital just to youknow have them get you the the correct equipment
and they put me in a sling
Im youknow and
Imean it didnt didnt really like I didnt it wasnt really too painful
it just hurt when I landed on it
and Imean I was out of football for ke all
I think I was only outof football for like two weeks because I didnt really didnt I really wanted to push myself and I didnt wanna miss that much
so I was outof football for like two weeks
came back
and that was about it
youknow
yes my brother
okay
well the person I have had trouble communicating or has had trouble communicating that I know of that first comes to mind would be my brother
eventhough Ive worked with many autistic kids
I useta do alotof volunteer work at camps with autistic kids and manic depressive all those different disorders
I probably know my brother best
and my brother I diagnose it as just a social problem
but when he was younger he he just youknow he couldnt really say what he wanted or tell you or or youknow kindof socially get along with my me and my friends or anything of the sort
and youknow just take for example one time he wanted to youknow play on the trampoline with us
and we werent sure what he was wanting and he was just jumping on the trampoline
jumps jumps on and jumps into the middle of our game and youknow kindof frustrates everybody
and youknow I see that and and after awhile
this has happened before
I I understand what hes trying to tell me
and I read that he just wants to hang out with us and have fun
so youknow I tell him
alright well why dont you do this
and I have him do something else on the side and youknow then jump in and join us
and youknow we kindof end up beating the hell outof him on the trampoline
and he still laughs eventhough we beat him up
and it ends up turning into alotof fun
and and youknow hes happy
and and eventually he learned to communicate better
there have been times when I youknow Ive told him youknow
say what you want talk to me tell me
and Ill tell you youknow
Dave dont come out with us or Dave come out with us youknow Dave do this tell us
and he has learned to communicate alot better
and thats it
oh I could tell you

and ke he I dont remember what he said too much but he was kindof ke trying to put him in his place telling him youknow
you better better watch yourself
you better shut up or something
and the kid starts to get in his face
and the kids much bigger than Tal
hes about the same size as me
and he gets in his face
and youknow I hes youknow theyre starting to argue
its getting heated
and all the while when things start to get bad like that or when things get scary or when I get scared the number the thing that I always do is I get very quiet and I I dont mean to do it but I kindof get like I heighten my senses
I feel everything heighten
and I just listen and look and feel and try to take in as much as I can
and I get ready
and make a long story short the kid gets in his face
and I simply my friend Tals
I put my head kindof closer to his near his shoulder
and I just sit there looking at the guy and standing next to Tal
and I Im scared because I dont like fighting
I dont ever wanna see fighting
I dont wanna see a punch thrown
I dont wanna see
even we youknow in my mind Im youknow we could have had we had alot more people at the party that we knew
he didnt
we Imean it really we knew that it could have been bad for him
but I still didnt wanna see anyone get hurt
so Im getting scared
and youknow I just stand there calmly and quietly and dont lose my cool eventhough Im nervous and looking at the kid and just waiting for him to to take a swing at Tal because then Tal knows and I know that were gonna go buck wild on him

little boy was having a birthday

really
I dont get sick very often
never broke a bone and never been hospitalized really
the most recent tragic sickness I had
I went to the freshman camp for engineering students as a staff member
and the cabin that we were in had fleas or bedbugs or something
and I got bit all over and broke out into big rash hives
and it was that was quite traumatic
I took three days off of work to stay at home because I didnt actually know that they were bug bites
I thought I had chickenpox
so I went to a dermatologist and found out that no they were bug bites and very
anyway so it was still traumatic
when I did get back to work I found out that everybody who stayed in that cabin had similar experiences but probably not as bad as mine
I just got eaten up
and so it was awful
yeah
times when Ive hadta communicate with people from another country
I went to a seminar once where there was a bunch of Brazilians who didnt speak English very well
so like all other ignorant Americans I talked louder and slower so that would help
but they just didnt understand the words
so we usually hadta find someone to intermediate because of the language barrier
or I guess try different words that I guess I thought they might understand better than the ones that I was using
tell me the story
well I was out we lived
I was a teenager late teenager
probably I think actually I was about nineteen eighteen
had already graduated high school
was out with a friend
her father was the sheriffs deputy where we lived
and he came to find me because he knew I was with his daughter
and I found out that day that my brother had shot himself
so that was a little bit scary
it was alittle unnerving
its hard for me to remember how I felt back then because he ended up living in our our
and he is just has some problems now
but he didnt die
so the resolve l helps me not remember as much as when I was as scared or as intense
but Im sure at that moment that it was very unnerving
it was scary for what might happen
would he die or not
we lived not close to a city and so he hadta be helicopter air evacked
my parents were outof town
and my youngest brother was the one who found him after it had been quite awhile
so there was alotof blood loss
Im sure I was scared
Im sure it was a tense moment anyway
in this story it looks like
okay
there was a big rainstorm
lasted for many days
there was alotof flooding
family was trying to get outof their house a or trying to get to safety
one of the daughters got swept away in the river
and grabbed onto a tree limb where the water was rushing and very violent
it was a scary situation
a nice paramedic or helicopter man as they were out searching for people found where she was located or was notified where she was located
and so he hadta be lowered below and drag himself across the water sothat he could rescue her
okay
a boy is out on a nice day playing soccer kicking a ball around
and kicked one a little bit too hard hit a window broke it
man was inside of his house
when the ball hit the window it smashed into a lamp
and picked up the ball and started to head out the door find out who kicked the ball through his window
and filed a home owners insurance claim to get his window fixed
told the boy to be more careful
a boy like any other was ready to head out the door on his way to school
and his mom said
hey why dont you take this umbrella with you
and he said
no Mom Im too cool for an umbrella
Im just gonna go
but as he headed out the door the rain started to fall just like his mom said it would
he started to get wet
so he ran back home
his mom was upset that he didnt listen to her
but boys needta learn and to listen to their moms
so he changed his clothes and took the umbrella and headed back outside and was okay and dry
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella
and she had happy life with her mother and her father
and her mother died which was sad
she grew up
father decided to get remarried
and he married a woman that had two other daughters aswell Cinderellas stepsisters
and he was a busy man so he was always off politicking leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters
and her stepmother wasnt very nice
and as she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her
and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them
it wasnt a happy life
one day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married
and so the king said
Prince were gonna have a ball sothat you can meet some ladies to be married
an invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball
and she was happy
and so she was went to get ready for the ball
and Cinderellas mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball aswell but that Cinderella couldnt go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done
which was kindof disheartening because she wouldnt have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear
so the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people
and she slaved away the day
and so eventually it was time to go to the ball
and Cinderella felt like she hadnt had time to get ready
and the stepsisters and the mother were happy
but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made
and she was excited because then she could go to the ball
so she ran down the stairs to leave
and the sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart
so she wasnt able to go in shambles
and while the stepmother stat
and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince
and as she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out
so they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress
and she was all ready to go to the ball
and so she headed off
and the prince danced with a few people but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really
he was very infatuated
the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal
and so Cinder Cinderella lost track of time
and it was about to strike midnight
she realized what would happen and so she ran
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers
and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was
she was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear
so she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper
so he was distraught
the king and he hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit
they worked long and hard the prince long and hard to find the person
and when they arrived at Cinderellas house the stepmother locked Cinderella in a room sothat she couldnt try on the slipper because she suspected that Cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen
and the stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper
and it wouldnt fit
and the mice snuck the key past Dragon the cat to open the door to let Cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say
but wait I can try it on
and luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on
but Cinderella produced the other slipper and said
well heres the matching pair
I was the girl and it does fit
so they were very happy
and Cinderella married the prince and they lived happily ever after
in this picture its a cat climbed a tree to try and catch a bird
and the daughter knows that her cat was stuck in the tree so she went and got her dad
the dad got stuck in the tree aswell
and they hadta call the fireman to come and rescue both probably from the tree

he has tied the branch to himself with the belt sothat it doesnt come loose
the woman is thankful that he is there to help her
a little boy is outside playing soccer
he kicks the ball through his parents window
the father is inside the house
and the ball comes through the window and knocks down the lamp
the man is very very mad and yells at the boy through the cracked window
a boy is going off to school and the mother would like him to take an umbrella
the boy tells the mother that he does not need an umbrella because it is not raining that hard
the boy starts on his way to school
and the rain gets harder
and the boy gets all wet
he runs home and tells the mother how sorry he is that he should have taken the umbrella
she gives him the umbrella
and he heads off to school again
Cinderellas father marries a wicked stepmother
and then he passes away leaving Cinderella alone with the stepmother and stepsisters
they are not nice to Cinderella
and they make her work very hard in the house serving them food and doing their chores
the king decides to throw a big ball in honor of the son his the prince who needs to find a wife
the wicked stepsisters are happy to be going to the ball but they do not want Cinderella to attend
so they make sure that her dress is ruined and that she cannot go to the ball
Cinderella is lucky because the good fairy stepmother
she tells Cinderella that she must be home by midnight or the dress will be gone and the coach will be back turned into a pumpkin and she will not have the pretty dress
Cinderella goes to the ball and has a wonderful time with the prince
at the strike
and as she is running she loses one of her glass slippers
she gets home and only has the one slipper
the prince goes all over town looking for the owner of the slipper
he wants that girl to be his wife
he finally gets to Cinderellas house
and she tries on the slipper
it matches the one thats missing
and they live happily ever after
the end
I was hospitalized when I was thirty years old for a heart issue
I had open heart surgery
I remember waking up with a breathing tube down my throat
and I wasnt able to see because I wear contacts
and I didnt have my contacts in and everything was very blurry
and people were moving around alot
and I remember being thirsty but nobody would give me anything to drink
I was in the icu for several hours waiting for them to take the breathing tube outof my throat
once they did I was moved to regular room
and I was in pain for a very long time
yes I have
say that again
Im sorry
my grandfather had a stroke and now he cant talk
I dont live here in town so I dont see him very often
when I come to visit its very hard for me to communicate with him because I cant understand what hes saying
he really tries hard to make sounds and point to things and make hand motions but its its difficult to understand
so I watch him very closely and I try to hand motion back trying to match what hes doing to maybe think about what he may be trying to say
I watch his lip movements but sometimes thats not so successful
oh
the last time I was really scared it was the middle of the night
and I listened to the baby on the monitor
and allofasudden I heard that she was having trouble breathing
so I jumped up outof bed and ran in there and picked her up
and she was crying
and I held her for a few minutes and tried to get her calmed down
and then I gave her a bottle
and we called the doctor immediately
you take two slices of white bread and put them on a plate
you take the peanut butter with a knife
spread the peanut butter on both sides of the white bread
after that you take the jelly and spread the jelly on both sides on top of the peanut butter
then you take the bread and close the sandwich and cut a slice down the middle
to make a peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter the jar of jelly a plate a knife bread
and so then you would take with your knife
I would put the peanut butter on the bread
and then I would take and the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter
to put the two slices of bread together
cut it in half on my plate
and go for it
well Im very lucky because Im basically very healthy
I was ill as a young girl
and so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did
so going along pretty healthy
youknow I had one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery
no drugs no anything
so I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains
and they would be ke between my waist and my boobs
and they would last like four hours
and they were bad
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position youknow where I could just get some relief
youknow and you kindof felt sick to your stomach but it was pains were terrible
so this happened a few times and youknow you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out whats wrong
so you tell them all of this and they think
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but theyre not telling you a thing
so they send me a for a sonogram
well Ive never had one of those
and so I told them at the place I said
if you find a baby in there and Im like sixty years old
I said
we both can make alotof money
so it kindof made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me
well the report comes back later
and so I have a gall bladder problem
so youknow its like what do I do about it
and youknow nothing happens few little simple attacks
but my husband and I are in Tennesee
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks
scared my husband to death because he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane
so when we get back I go back to the doctor again
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder
and thats the way life goes
yes the other people would be my mother because I do feel like shes maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory
and I want her to be my mother and ke she always useta be
so its been very hard ke in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently
I try not to tell her
cant you remember
because Im now learning that she cant
so its difficult because its a learning process
its changes weekly maybe even daily
thats the main communication problem right now
I Ive been I was frightened or scared many times when I was young and growing up
we lived in a small town like six hundred people
but I did live in the town
my I guess I was scared maybe because my father would go away to work into the big city
and he would leave ke on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night
my father being that he didnt live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town
then we had a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was loud and Im gonna say verbally abusive eventhough I didnt realize that at that time
and so he would scream and yell and maybe not m always treat our mother like we thought
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and and the difference
well here in Arizona we sometimes have flash floods
we had one and a young lady and her vehicle decided that she could drive off across this wash no problem
guess what
there was a problem
the car stalls
the water comes up to the sides
shes able to get outof the car and get on the roof
but then shes stranded
the water is just roaring like crazy
but people on the shore on the banks see her
they call rescue people in
they have all the equipment
they work their way to get out to her
theyre gonna rescue her with their their ropes and their belts and their ties
theyre making sure that they can safely get her attached to them so they can get her to shore
what a learning lesson for the young lady

DixieCup Lisas kitty had gotten up into the tree

Lisa was calling for the little kitty to come down
but the kitty was afraid so the kitty stayed up in the tree
so her father got the ladder
and decided to climb up the tree to see if he could get the cat down
well while he was climbing up and the dog was barking the ladder fell down
and so he was stuck up in the tree
so the mother hadta call the fire department
and the fire department brought their ladder on their fire truck

and heres the bird up here watching all the goings on
okay

put them on a plate side by side
go to the refrigerator
and get a jar of peanut butter and a jar of strawberry preserves
get a knife outof the drawer
take one take a knife
and put it in the peanut butter
and spread the peanut butter on the one slice of bread
take a clean knife
put the knife in the jelly
and spread it on top of the peanut butter
put the second slice of bread on top of the first slice of bread
use one of the knives to cut the peanut butter sandwich in half
and proceed to eat
icus were not known then
and so I was put in a semi private room which was what they used during those days
and my classmates specialed
what do I remember about it
I remember being so ill before I had the surgery that I refused the baby because actually we thought I thought that I had the flu
and I was just feeling so badly
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didnt know really what was wrong
but they really didnt think anything was wrong
they just thought that I didnt wanna take care of my little girl
finally after three days I had that
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three am
and finally I had surgery at Monday evening
so I was really very very ill
infact I had peritonitis
and they really did not think that I would live
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they thats just the way they did things
and I actually chose you could choose if you wanted to have the baby to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are healthy and not ill
and I chose the baby to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kindof thought of her as their own
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses
and consequently from that I had ototoxic drugs
so I lost my hearing that way
okay since I am hearing impaired I understand that situation really well
so I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing and not admitting it or not having hearing aids
because you can you just notice that theyre not understanding or theyre not interested in what is being said or theyre just on a different page
and what have I done about it
actually what you do is you just talk to them
and you just go right in front of them sothat they can see your face and your lips
and also if youre in a really noisy environment go outside and where its quiet
okay
oh dont put that on yet I hafta think
ERROR
well the only time that I can really remember
is it on
okay the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon
and we were driving in Florida
and seatbelts were new
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car
and we were just driving down a country road
and allofasudden this truck just came right out barreling down the side road
and came right out in front of us
and we actually drove into the ditch
and if we wouldnt have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured
but since we had our seatbelts on we just took my husband just turned the car
and we continued on
and that guy just never that truck just never stopped and just kept going
Imean he was oblivious
okay
well you sure like beginning middles and ends dont you
okay
well it looks to me that it had been raining for many days or raining very hard
and this hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream
and managed to grab a hold of a branch
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in
and the man is there rescuing her
and pulled her to safety
well looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking
well Johnny was kicking really too hard
and kicked the ball right through the neighbors window
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair
and the ball came through the window
knocked over the lamp
and the neighbor went

and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball
well it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school
and mother said
well youknow its sposta rain today

and Johnny says
no Im not going to carry that umbrella
I dont like to carry umbrellas

infact it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands
and run through the puddles
and run home
and by the time he got home he was really really wet
and mother said

so Johnny started off to school again in dry clothes with his umbrella
okay
oh
when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters
and so Cinderella grew up with two stepsisters
but then the father must have died because allofasudden its the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella
and Cinderella became the cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day
it was the everyone had grown up and gotten older
and they received an invitation from the prince from the castle because the prince was old enough to get married now
and he was looking for a bride
so they were having a big party at the castle
so the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters
and Cinderella overheard it
so she ran to her room
opened up her trunk
and got out her special gown that shed been saving for a long time
she tried it on
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball
so the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball
and Cinderella was left home all by herself
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and especially the mice were felt very sorry for her and were very upset
and then allofasudden a Cinderellas fairy godmother appeared
and said
Cinderella we you are going to go to the ball
and so she fricked
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach
and I think the dog became the footman
and everybody went off to the ball
and she had a wonderful time
oh and she had glass slippers
that was the special thing
the fairy godmother had given her glass slippers
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything the coach would turn back into a pumpkin
and she would not have her dress anymore
so she had a wonderful time at the party and danced with the prince all night
and then allofasudden the clock started striking midnight
so she ran down the steps
and ran into the coach
and ran all the way home
but she had lost her one shoe
so the prince had found the shoe
and said
I will only marry the girl that fits into their shoe
so there was a proclamation sent around that the princes footman would be going around with the shoe
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe
so the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball
so she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket
and the mice connived and got the key outof the pocket
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe
but they didnt make it as because their feet were much larger than Cinderellas
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave
and the mice had just gotten the door open to Cinderellas room
and she came running down the stairs
and said
may I try on the shoe
and the footman said
yes ofcourse
and he went over to try the put the shoe on her
and the stepmother used her cane to trip him
so the shoe fell to the ground and broke
and so the stepmother said
well thats that
and Cinderella said
no
and she pulled the shoe outof her apron pocket
and said
here it is
and so the footman put it on her foot
and the prince said
oh Cinderella
and everybody was happy
the mice were dancing
and everybody was happy except the stepsisters and the stepmother
the end
okay

okay peanut butter and jelly sandwich
first you pick out the bread
white is always the tastiest but wheat is better for you
and take the bread
and you first put some butter on one side of one piece
and then you spread some peanut butter over that
and then you pick a good jam maybe strawberry
and put that over the peanut butter
and then slap one more piece of bread on top of that
and youve got a peanut butter jelly sandwich
okay
well I remember when I was young
I think it was probably in the the fall because we were playing football down in the next block on the corner house the Larsons
they had three kids
Christine was the oldest
and she was their natural daughter
and then Joanne a year older than us was their adopted daughter
and Bruce Larson was my buddy
and we were playing a little game of football in his front yard
and we had some older kids with us who joined in our games
my brother was three years older but he didnt play alot in the neighborhood games
but one of them was a jock
his parents were phy
and he tackled me right at at the at the goal line or the
and I got hurt
I had the football in my hand
it was a little fake football
and he landed here
I had a sweatshirt on
and I just got up
and I was kindof crying a little bit
I felt kindof sick to my stomach
and I just said
well I cant I gotta go home
I dont feel good
so when I went home I pulled off my or my mom helped me out of my sweatshirt because my arm was hurting alot
and the the wrist
Imean youknow you could tell it was broken youknow
were taking you to the hospital
so I went down to the Vista hospital the hospital I was born at and got checked in
and the next thing I remember Im on the operating table
and theyre telling me to to count back from a hundred
seems like I made it maybe to ninety seven or so
and next thing I know Im waking up in my hospital room with I think my dad was there
and I have a
and I had that for the next six weeks or so in school
and I remember I would still play tetherball
because I was big into tetherball
but thats thats that illness
a little bit with my dad
but it was over the phone
and he had a stroke around the end
okay
just he slurred his speech and just had a little difficulty saying his words and stuff
and just by being patient
it wasnt that bad
so I just listened and tried to be patient with him
and it it wasnt terribly difficult
and he recovered quite well from his stroke
so
I guess in the army in my airborne training
one of the first things we hadta do was it was called the thirty four foot tower where we were connected to harnesses
but you hadta go
but just that jumping out into nothing was scary
but I was excited and I did it
but we looked back and there were some guys that couldnt couldnt get past that leap to to do the jump
and theyd wash outof the program at that point
one day the paramedics or the rescue team was called out to a popular rafting area river rafting area where young Sally a thirteen year old who was out with her family rafting had fallen outof the raft and was caught in the river
and Joe the fire rescue man climbed out on a branch and rescued Sally
and everybody lived happily every after
alright
Billy was playing soccer with his friend Joe outside their house
and he kicked it
and the ball apparently flew out into his next door neighbor mister Smiths window crashing though the window and breaking the lamp
mister Smith was startled
but he had kids of his own and wasnt too upset
he knew the window could be fixed and luckily he hadnt got hurt by the broken glass
the end
okay
Joey was ready to go off to his friends house with his backpack all packed for an overnight trip
his mother said
it looks like rain out there Joey

Joey said
no no its not gonna rain Mom
I dont need it
so Joey hopped out into the to walk over to his friends house
sure enough it started raining
he ran home all wet and said
Mom you were right
give me the umbrella
and then off goes Joey
Im singing in the rain
Im singing in the rain

the end
okay theres a home with a little boy and a very upset mother
it looks like the little boy was going to have a birthday party
and the mother had placed the birthday cake on a table
and the family dog had come in
and gotten into the cake
eaten part of it
and retreated under the couch because the mother caught him in the act and was chasing him with a broom
so hes under the couch
the mothers very upset
the little boy is crying
and the guest are starting to arrive
theres another woman with probably her son bearing a gift
and then another mother coming with a daughter with a gift
and theyre just standing in the doorway watching what is going on
I take two pieces of bread from the loaf of bread
put it on a plate
I open the peanut butter
and get a knife
and spread the peanut butter on the bread
I would put the two pieces of bread together
and cut them in two
and I have a peanut butter sandwich
okay the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago
I had vertigo
extreme vertigo
and I was working at the time
I couldnt walk without bumping into things
I was afraid to drive
and I went through all this testing
I was never hospitalized
but I hadta take six weeks off from work
I never miss work
and Ive never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me
I did cat
and they could never find any reason for it
all the blood work was fine
its very frustrating because they dont know how to treat it or what to do
you just hafta wait it out
so I stayed at home
went through all the testing
went to the doctors
finally decided to go to a chiropractor
and my doctor agreed that was fine
so I went for massage therapy and muscle and nerve stimulant
and that helped
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium
now thats not proven
my regular doctor ofcourse doesnt go along with it laughs
my chiropractor thinks thats the answer laughs
but it was just a terrible ordeal
and Ive not had it return
just a little bit once in awhile
but I find that when my back is outof alignment and my discs are compressed that it kindof slows down your your functioning
so anyway that was the worse thing Ive probably experienced
somewhat yes
well my husband has been treated for lung cancer
and he had extreme hard core treatment
he had chemotherapy and radiation
and he had brain radiation
they do that to ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain
but in the process of doing this my husbands been on alotof medications
and hes a very bright man and very articulate
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow
his thought process was very unlike him
he just didnt process well at all
so you hafta be very patient
hafta listen
hafta try not to lose your temper
try not to be argumentative
tried my patience as much as its ever been tried
just kindof wait wait it out
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self
and you work back into it from there
he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment
but it his
and the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me
its just a matter of speaking distinctly
I hadta repeat my myself
I hadta make decisions for him
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it
so we did work through that
actually it went pretty well
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be
and
I do not wanna be a care giver laughs
but you work through it
you do what you hafta do
oh yes
lets see
I guess the most frightening time would be I lived in Colorado
and I worked for the telephone company
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne
that once they closed my office I commuted first to Fort Collins
we closed that office
Boulder we closed that office
and then I went to Cheyenne
and thats about just under a seventy mile trip
and its on il twenty five
it was winter time
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible
I was on the road and a storm came up
I slid off the road
ditched my car
and I hadta call for help to come and get me
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up transmission
so I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley
and he came with a tow truck and got me out
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there
and its very frightening because youre not really sure whats going to happen
but he did get me
we got back to town
they got my car back
and I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over
okay Im not real sure
is that ice
it looks to me like theres water with ice on it
and a young girl has fallen through the ice
and shes unable to get out
and theres a rescue person probably a firemen that is holding onto a stick or an overhang of some kind
and he has on a life jacket
and he is going out to rescue her
and it looks like he is very close to getting her
and it looks to me like hes within reach of of grabbing her outof the water
very scary
theres a young boy playing with a soccer ball
and he kicks it
it goes through a window
breaks the window
goes inside a house
knocks a lamp over
and theres a man sitting in a chair by the lamp
he gets outof the chair
retrieves the ball
goes to look out the broken window
but I dont think he finds the young man who kicked the ball
hes just standing there looking out the window wondering where the ball came from
theres a mother with an umbrella
and her son with his backpack going to school
he is trying to leave
and his mothers trying to give him the umbrella to take
but he doesnt want it
so he waves goodbye
goes off without the umbrella
gets outside and it starts to rain
and it starts to rain really hard
its coming down
and hes getting quite wet
so he turns back
goes home
and he appears to be quite soaked
his mother is scolding him
he then evidently leaves with the umbrella
and walks to school in the rain with the umbrella
mother does know best

and they go away and live happily ever after
well in about I think it was two thousand and one I became ill with a fairly serious strain of viral something
they couldnt really tell me
but it was highly contagious
I hadta stay outof work for a week
kindof isolated
I was allowed to stay home
I wasnt hospitalized perse except for the initial diagnosis in the er because I had spiked a hundred and four temperature and was having difficulty seeing
the one er doctor that came and saw me thought I might have meningitis
but then his superior came and said it wasnt meningitis
it was just a really bad viral infection
so I was laid up in bed
and what happened throughout each day and evening varied anything from spiking temperature to chills and hot flashes
there was some vomiting ofcourse
alotof nausea
my husband was great
he he wasnt my husband at the time
we were living together
but he made chicken soup for me and and did youknow the clear liquids and and apple juice and things like that and made sure that I was eating
it was kindof frightening actually because I didnt know what was actually happening
a viral infection doesnt really describe much
but I came through it okay
I was really weak
I would say that after that week had passed it took me couple months really to feel like my old self again
but I was okay obviously
Im okay
thats it
sure
what I specifically did about it
ohmygosh I am trying to remember a specific incident
holymoly I cant think of anything right offhand
I know I have been in those situations before
ofcourse I witnessed
its not always me that solves the problem
let me think let me think
well yeah that has happened
on the phone usually
just becauseof cultural differences too
okay
well in the couple instances that I remember I hadta just keep repeating myself
I would try to slow down my words
speak clearly
try to find related words to what I was saying if they didnt understand exactly what I was saying
and ask them leading questions to see if they understood what I was asking of them or trying to explain to them
and I believe resolution came about
from what I recall it sounds like it
again I cant remember a specific instance with who I spoke to and what we spoke about
but in those cases youknow the couple
I remember youknow some time ago it worked out okay I guess
no
oh yeah
oh so many to choose from
she says trying to remember
okay frightened or scared
well there was a time I was actually afraid for someone else
my husband and I when we first started dating he was involved in a group that did medieval reenactment
and part of their events and group gatherings involved a a large gathering where the people could take on personas of warriors
and they would dress up in youknow armor and things like that
and go out and hit eachother with sticks and stuff youknow
no real swords or anything like that
thats not legal
but youknow like I said it was a reenactment
and at one point during a battle at this particular battle he was basically tackled by several members which isnt usual
and when he fell he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor
but they decided to step over him
and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids
and it wrenched
they hadta call the paramedics from a nearby emergency center
we were out on the outskirts of town out on the the country side of Phoenix west Phoenix
and so the closest place was several miles away
and they called the ambulance
they came out put the neck brace on
loaded him
he was in alotof pain
I was freaking out
I didnt know what was going on
I heard things like convulsions
I heard neck broken
I heard just it was craziness
so they loaded him up on the ambulance
I ran back to my tent because I was out there camping with him
grabbed my car keys and hopped in the the car we had taken together
and met him in the emergency room
when I got there they had him in the xray taking xrays of his neck
it turns out he did not break his neck which was a great relief
but he was pretty badly bruised and banged up
he had severe
I was very grateful that it wasnt worse than it was
but that time inbetween youknow what happened and finding out from the doctors was
I yeah I was off the charts
what do you do with that
you have no idea
so it was that was really frightening to go through
hmhm

or if they repeat it back to you you dont quite get it what theyre trying to say
when I was younger my brother and I liked to go to my neighbors house
and he had a pack of Dobermans
and we would tease the dogs because they were fenced in
and we would go on our way
it was it was nothing
it was nothing
we didnt abuse the dogs
we would just mess with them
and then we would go on our way home
and inevitably the dogs would always get out
and wed literally hafta run for our life with a pack of Dobermans on our heels
and I was afraid of dogs pretty much my whole life until about two thousand because I had images of dogs chasing me for dear life
but they never did catch catch us
and they never hurt us
but still I was afraid of dogs
this young girl has been caught in a flood water or a raging river
and someone saw this
called for help
help did arrive
and he is in the process
this fireman or rescue worker is in the process of of trying to get her outof the water and take them both to safety

okay so one day I decided to go outside and enjoy the nice weather and go for a jog
I noticed that I had been that I was feeling kinda weak and feeling kinda nauseous
thinking that it was just part of getting back into exercise I didnt think too much of it
however the following days it continued to get worse and worse
I started to get more nauseous and feel more weak
and I was sleeping up to twenty one hours a day
finally I decided that I needed to go to the doctor
and at that point I had become jaundice which is yellow yellow skin and the whites of my eyes had become yellow
the doctor had sent me to the hospital and where I was hospitalized for four days while they did tests to figure what might be wrong with me
all of my family came to visit
and they hadta wear gloves for protection since they didnt know what was wrong with me
and after several tests and several visits from the doctor they discovered that it was Hepatitisa
and after several days of being on iv and getting rehydrated I did recover as there is no cure
and I after about about two months after that after I got outof the hospital
I was one hundred percent recovered and very happy that it wasnt something worse

wait
by language problems communication problems does it mean someone that mighta had a disorder or is just it an issue communicating
okay
alright
okay
okay
okay so a few years ago when I was in school I was taking a class where I was partnered up with a student from China who had a very difficult who had difficulties communicating verbally in English
he he was hard to understand
but I did my best to communicate with him by maybe not trying to understand his complete sentences but trying to pick out words outof what he was saying and try to match that into the context of what was going on around us to piece together what he might be saying
and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on stating how I was understanding him sothat at some point if I didnt understand him he would realize that I wasnt understanding him
and rel after several weeks it just got easier and easier to understand what he was saying
I would just became accustomed to the accent and the words that he might choose to use
and over time it got easier
okay so it was it was night time on Friday night
and one of my friends was having a small gettogether over at her house
just a few of us
and she invited me over
so I went over there
and I got to the house
and the few of us were just hanging around watching tv having a good time
and we hear a knock at the door
and just thinking that maybe it was another guest or not thinking much of it the one of her friends answers the door
and it turns out to be a guy in a mask attempting to either rob us or rob the house
and the first thing that the girl who answers the door says is that he has a gun
and he so he comes in
and theres another man behind him that stays outside
but one of one of the guys comes in
and he proceeds to take things from the house and take things from the people that are in the house
just very quickly grab some things and runs out
and thats thats the end
so without getting too detailed

when I was five years old I had tonsillitis and hadta have my tonsils removed
it was very scary because I was young and I wasnt able to breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become sore and aggravated
so I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out
the best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better
but afterwards going home I hadta take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better which gave me vivid dreams
and I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo
and when I woke up screaming it my mother had come in to take care of me and it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake
and apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsillectomy
after about a week I got better and I was happy that I never hadta do that again
I actually had an employee that worked with me that was hearing impaired
and inorderto work with her and explain directions and meet with her on a regular basis we went and got a sign language specialist that would come in and sit with us and translate from my speech into sign language to explain what tasks we had for her or give her regular updates meetings etcetera
in addition we also learned some basic sign language and worked with her using different electronic means to communicate more easily to get around any communication barriers that we had becauseof her hearing impairment
it worked out well
yes
I was in Vail Colorado with some friends and family to go on a snowmobiling trip
we decided to go out when we got there later in the day when it was still snowing and take a quick trip around the area to get our bearings
there were five of us on snowmobiles
and this was my first time I had been on a snowmobile eventhough I had told them I had ridden them before
we began to run through a series of roads in the the backwoods areas of Vail
and it got darker and darker and the snow became snowier and snowier
as we got through the area the group began to spread out
I wasnt going as fast as everyone else and I lost track of the people in front of me
so I couldnt see which direction to go and drove off the side of the mountain in my snowmobile
I tumbled down the hill about a hundred feet crashing through the darkness falling off the snowmobile and eventually landing and stopping in the snow
I was momentarily I think unconscious
and when I woke up it was dark and cold and silent which I thought was very bad because I didnt know where I was and I was in a snowstorm in a mountain in Vail somewhere lost
I began to move around to see if I was injured and I had hurt my back and my head but could still move around find my flashlight and start looking to see where I was
I actually landed on top of my snowmobile on the side of the mountain at about a forty five degree angle towards the top where the road was
and I could see with the flashlight the direction where the road and where I had crashed through the mountain was
so I began signaling with my flashlight and trying to yell for people when I heard a snowmobile coming
I saw the light and flashed my my flashlight
he saw me stopped and went to get help from the other group of people that we were with
about ten minutes later they all came back
and after about a half hour they managed to pull me up and the snowmobile and get us back up to the road to look over my damage and the damage to the snowmobile which was pretty extensive
but we did manage to ride the crippled snowmobile back into town to the camp where we were where I proceeded to get medical attention and rest for several days
it was pretty scary
what is that
oh I see its like a
okay

the most painful thing Ive ever had in my life
you cant move your hands afterwards
so I hadta go through physical therapy but now its perfectly fine
well its interesting to try to have a conversation with somebody who English is their second language and their first language is Spanish
and I dont know I know ke almost zero Spanish
and so to try to have a conversation of any depth or anything you can really just get the basics
so its very interesting to try to communicate with a s
I think Im communicating just fine
I think theyre not listening
but laughs do you mean ke they couldnt understand what I was saying to them
can I tell you how that was
do you mean ke what was I feeling
what how did I experience that
ohmygosh oh I guess the only time was when I traveled to Mexico
and oh they they stop you going down there sometimes
and theyll pull you over
and theyll ask you ke what do you have in your trunk or things like that
or theyll say something to me
I have no idea what they are saying to me
and then finally theyll find English words
and Ill be ke
and so its just its just its its a little scary because you dont know you really dont know what theyre trying to say
and you could get in trouble if you dont respond the right way
because of communication like that
or just when was I frightened or scared
""
you know what
it was the strangest thing
I I made a right hand turn
and I thought that I looked but I didnt see the car
and so when I turned once I was turning then I did see the car
and I thought I was going to get hit but I didnt
but its amazing because my entire body flooded with adrenaline
I felt like I had gotten hit
nothing had happened but it just it scared me like crazy because I just knew for sure they were going to hit the back of me but they didnt
there was there was a girl that was out hiking with her family
and all a sudden there was a storm that came up
and in Arizona we get alotof flash floods
and unfortunately she got in a part where theres the flash floods
and she got caught out in the water
she was able to get a hold of a stick and hang onto that
and so they called the rangers
and they came out
and they rescued her from the water
there was a little boy that was outside playing with his soccer ball
and he was practicing his kicks and kicked it
and it got away from him
and it went through the window of the neighbors house and landed in
and the neighbor was sitting in his easy chair
and he got up and saw the hole in the window
and looked out and saw the little boy
and said
well I guess youre gonna hafta mow my lawn for the next fifteen years to pay off the window
www
okay
there was a little boy who was leaving to go to school with his backpack
and his mom told him to take the umbrella
and he said
no no I dont need the umbrella
so he waves goodbye to his mom and he heads off to school
and sure enough it starts raining a little bit
and then it rains really really hard
and hes drenched
so he decides he better go back home and get his umbrella so he can maybe stay a little bit dry
okay
so
and they were mean to her
they made her do all the chores
and she became friends with all the animals because were in the Disney version the animals in the in the house and outside the house
and so there came the announcement that there was going to be a ball that the prince was gonna have a ball
and all the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball
so they got all ready to go
and Cinderella couldnt go to the ball
but her little friends decided that they would help her
and her fairy godmother came along and wanted Cinderella to go to the ball
so she turned lets see a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses and got her a gown and glass slippers and sent Cinderella off to the ball
and she met PrinceCharming there
and she danced with him
and just had a great time
but she hadta be back before midnight because everything would go back to pumpkins and mice and everything would disappear except for the glass slipper
so she runs outof the she runs out and loses her glass slipper
and so the prince decides hes gonna try find her by going through the land and taking the glass slipper around
and trying it on everybody
and they lock Cinderella up in the tower because the stepmother doesnt want her to try on the slipper in case it fits
she tries to get the her daughters to cram their feet in it but it doesnt fit
and their little friends get her outof the tower
she comes down
tries on the slipper
and it fits
and then she marries PrinceCharming and lives happily ever after
there was a cat that went up the tree and got stuck
and the little girl wanted her father to get the cat out
so he got the ladder out and climbed up the tree to get the cat
and then the ladder fell down
so hes stuck in the tree

and the dogs barking below them
so they hadta call the fire department whos coming with a ladder so they can get the cat and the man both outof the tree
this is a story about a birthday party gone awry
here was a beautiful birthday cake with candles on it
and the neighbors were invited over with their children for Tommys birthday
apparently he was four years old
there were four candles on the cake
but Tommys dog saw the cake unattended and took a big hunk outof it
and then he ran underneath the sofa to hide from the mom who got very angry and had her broom out and was gonna beat the dog with the broom for chewing up the cake
in the meantime all the guests were arriving
there was a little boy guest with a present and a little girl guest with the present and their moms
and they were seeing the whole event unfold as they approached the room for the birthday party
the end
the boy was crying
he wasnt very happy on his birthday
in order you take out your bread

and voila you have your peanut butter and h jelly sandwich
I had a gallbladder attack on my twentieth wedding anniversary
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown gallbladder attack which is very very painful
and so I went to the hospital
I was beginning to turn green
and I had the surgery done
I was in the hospital about three days
thats before they did it with any kind of scopes
youknow they did a regular open laparotomy
so
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work
so I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure
and then once its over you feel alot better thats for sure
okay the problems are word finding and the ability to speak
my mothers disability is apraxia aphasia
and so she sometimes uses different words to try to get her point across
what I do is I offer her extra time
sometimes extra processing time helps
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the is it this and touch
if its an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever
sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is alittle better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it
and then because we live with each other and were together so much I can kindof read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs
ke today with I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring
and I figured that maybe they didnt take her credit card
so for the most part I can kindof guess so
a little bit like VannaWhite
is it this
is it that
does it begin with the letter
sometimes beginning letters help
so thats how we work it out
my husband and I were in WashingtonDC doing some sightseeing
and it turned when we came off a a boat trip it it got a little darker
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel
and so we were walking along
and it went was pretty isolated street
there wasnt alotof people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us youknow maybe twenty yards back
and it was three young kids three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough
and so I was very I I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing
and my husband said if they come after us Im gonna take the the movie camera
and Ill hit em
and you run like hell
so we were picking up the pace
as we picked up the pace they picked up the pace
and as we turned the corner there was a bus station
and people were waiting there
so we were just so grateful to see other people
and they backed off
and they left us alone
so I think it was a couldve been a robbery youknow
and thats it
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldnt
and this lady was driving her suv thinking she could get through the wash
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her
and so it appears as though the hes strapped hes got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot
hes holding onto a branch thats hanging into the rushing water
and he is attempting the rescue
no Im not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but Im assuming thats the belt for helping her
I dont know
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer
so hes kicking a soccer ball down the neighborhood street and inadvertently kicks the wrong way and hits a bi
and the soccer ball goes through the neighbors picture window
goes through the window
knocks over the lamp
scares the neighbor
the neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it
and hes got the soccer ball in his hand but he cant seem to find who kicked it
but Ill bet ya
the end
well its time for Joey to go to school
and his mom said
youknow Joey I looked out the window
it looks like in the looks like it might rain today
and the weathermen said that rain could be coming today
oh
he said
no Ma
I dont wanna take that umbrella
only sissies carry umbrellas
not kids like me
Im not gonna take that umbrella
and I dont think its gonna rain anyway
well there he goes out
and whats happening but his mom was right
it starts to rain
first just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder
and the puddles are deep
and when he comes home he is soaked to the skin
his mother is very angry with him because he did not listen to her and take the umbrella
so the next time that this occurs and theres rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry
that was a lesson learned
hmhm
Cinderellas mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls her stepmother and her stepsisters
as time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls
and she is very cruel to Cinderella
she uses her as a servant
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along
and the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals were not treated as well
but Cinderella loved them all
and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice
and and they all loved her
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle
in the castle there was a wonderful prince handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married
and the princes servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife
and so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball
and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery
and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time
well the stepmother got the invitation
she only considered her daughters and she didnt consider Cinderella at all
so she got the her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery
and they were ugly stepsisters
and Cinderella made her own dress
and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress
and when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball that they are gonna go to the ball but she is not
so she was put into locked into a room
and she was visited by the fairy godmother
and the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the the ball
so the fairy godmother with her magic bitty bippetyboppetyboo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown
and outof a pumpkin she made a carriage
and outof the mice she made horsemen horses to carry the carriage to the palace
and she was dressed in her the most beautiful woman in the in the land
but she did have a stipulation
she said that she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear
so she went to the ball
and she was the bell of the ball
and she caught the eye of the prince
and the prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters
so she danced the night away
and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes
and she knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the the night would disappear at that time
so she ran from the prince
and as she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps
and she ran and she ran
and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night
the pumpkin returned to its former self
and and the animals were no longer horses
and everything returned to theirselves to what they were
when she returned home the stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace
and they would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper
so the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it didnt work
and they a mouse brought her the key Cinderella the key
she got outof the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on
she tried it on
it was a fit
and the prince then designated her as his princess
and they got married and lived happily ever after
we have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard
but we also have a kittycat who loves to go up the tree
and the kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and couldnt get down
so dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all
it appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree
he then took a ladder dad did
put it up against the tree to climb and get the cat
but the ladder fell down
so after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree
the fire department not police department
and theres also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree
thats it
one afternoon the little girls cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch
and she was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down
and her father being the silly man that he is decided to go up and take care of the cat
try to get the cat
so as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch
and the ladder falls off of the tree
at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and which scares the cat all the more
and the cat is not gonna come to the father
but the father cant get outof the tree anyway
so they hafta call the fire department
who comes and rescues the man outof the tree
and rescues the cat
the end
there are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
one of them is to get out the bread thats already cut
and and put peanut butter on it
actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store
and so all you hafta do is just use one
and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into this into the jar
and you can put it right on the bread
and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
very lazy
very easy
the good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread
cut it in six inch long pieces
slice it longways sothat its open
its nice and crunchy on top
its very soft on the interior
you take your peanut butter
crunchy and and regular
you mix those together
you put it on the peanut you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich
you take the jelly
I wouldnt use grape jelly
but you can use other kinds of jelly
and I I like strawberry
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together
I put it on there
and then I take that sandwich
and I put it in the microwave
and I heat it sothat the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together
I still have crunchy on the top
but its nice and soft on the inside and warm
and then I eat that
four years ago I had my knees replaced
I had them both done at the same time
it was scheduled for July the fifth
however they fouled up on the scheduling so it wasnt done until the next week which is I think July the eleventh or twelfth
we I went into the hospital at seven in the morning six thirty or seven in the morning
they prepped me
and I went into the operating room about eight
and woke up about eleven eleven fifteen with two new knees
they told me to go ahead and use the the morphine drip for pain
and so thats what I did
I used the morphine drip for pain
and unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them I have a sensitivity to morphine
and I as Im using this little button that you push every ten minutes
I I begin to see rats coming outof of the wall
I got real oozy
and I passed out
and the next thing I remember was the doctor standing over me saying
Bill Bill Bill
wake up wake up wake up
and I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again
and they took me to the emergency room
and I hadta stay in the emergency room for a little while or wherever they take you
youknow it was not in the recovery
they run me down the hallway
they were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that
so the next day I woke up
and I was fine
and they got me walking around
and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees
I did have some pain pills but it wasnt morphine
and my knees oh
ten days after I I had my knees replaced I could walk
do whatever I wanted to do
I drove two weeks afterwards
and Ive had very very little problem with my knees since then
except they dont have alotof strength
in getting up outof this low chair that Im sitting in right now Im gonna have a hassle
but its my knee replacement was very successful
I would suggest ta
thats it
in October of nineteen ninety four my wife had a stroke
and she was rushed to the hospital
and then oh ambulanced
I went I followed her down and because I needed my car down there to go home
and when we got there she was unable to move her right side and unable ta
all she could say was
Bill
Bill Bill Bill
Bill Bill
I found out later that she thought she was carrying on a regular conversation with me
and she thought she was saying all the words that she should have said
but all all she could say was
Bill
after about a week of that I told her that we were gonna hafta change the word that she knew
so we sit down
and I says
okay dont say Bill anymore
say bye
so Elaine began to say
bye
then shed say
bye bye bye bye bye bye bye bye
and thats what she still kindof says sometimes when she gets flustrated
but normally thats gone now
she doesnt use that anymore
she still has aphasia
she still goes to the speech therapy
she still cannot speak
this is in two thousand and nine
so weve lived with this for fifteen years now
and we get along
I kindof know what shes gonna say
youknow after youve been together long enough well you kindof figure out what the other ones wanting to talk about
and shes very good at using alternate communication skills
spelling words
inflections on the few words that she can say
and doing things that allow you to figure out what shes trying to say
she still has trouble just saying the most simple words
this morning when we got up why we were in the bathroom
and she was trying to tell me I always put a rubberband around the bottom of the toothpaste
and we had a new o toothpaste thing
and it needed a rubberband at the bottom of it
because it had we hadnt started rolling it up yet
and it took her two minutes
when I get the newspaper in the morning I take a rubberband and put it on the handle of my chair
and so it took her two minutes to tell me to go in and get a rubberband off my chair and put it on the toothpaste
I had a rough time figuring out what she was trying to tell me this morning to get
youknow shed started spelling chair
chak
and then shed say
cheese
and then shed youknow everything that had chq in it was the words that she used
shed never use chair
and once she did get out chair I didnt know what the heck she was talking about
and so then we finally understood I then she picked up the the toothpaste
and bent it over
and says
chair
and then I knew that she wanted me to go get a rubberband off the chair
and put it on the toothpaste
so we still have trouble
but normally we get along pretty good
throat I did tell her not ta
were not a depressed family
so we dont get depressed
one of the things she was starting to get depressed saying she was gonna die
and I says
listen
you dont know when youre gonna die
I dont know when Im gonna die
so as long as were here we just well take make the best of it
and weve pretty much done that since then
excuse me
huh
nope thats it
n Cinderellas mother died when she was a young girl
and her father remarried to a lady that had two other daughters
oh
so they treated Cinderella very badly
they made her clean up the house
they made her do the cooking
they made her do the mopping of the floor and everything
Cinderella didnt didnt have a great life compared to the other daughters
but she got along with it
she was fine with it
oh
she knew them
and and some of the other animals
some of the birds
she was a happy girl
some of the the blue birds and the people like that
they really enjoyed her
and she enjoyed them
there was an edict from the there was a king and a prince and a king queen and a prince that was the head of the land
and the prince was alittle gay
he didnt he he wasnt into girls all that much
and so the king says

and he says
I
I dont like any of these girls
and he says the king says

so the prince says
so they send out an edict and an invite to all the young girls all over the all over the the land
and the those godmother and the two stepdaughters they got the edict
and theyre gonna go

so the prince comes along
and oh Cinderella wants to go
and they says

so she gets her work done
and she says
oh I got all my work done now I wanna go
and they say
you cant go
its impossible for you to go
youre too ugly
you dont have any nice clothes
forget about it
youre not going
so the princess was or Cinderella was very sad at the time
and she was feeling pretty low
she was around the house
and poofo out comes her fairy godmother
and not knowing that she even had a fairy godmother
she says to the fairy godmother
what in the world are you doing here
and the fairy godmother says
well
she says

and Cinderella says
no
she says
Im not gonna be able to to that
she says
I dont have a dress
I dont have any way to get there
she says
its just gonna be a big drag
and the fairy godmother says
well I think I can make that happen
so she takes her magic wand
and she poofso
and Cinderella is in a new dress
and Cinderella looks at her
and say
hey thats pretty good but my hair is a mess
so the godmother goes poofo
and Cinderella has a great bouffant hairdo
and so Cinderella says
well this is pretty darn good
I I think I yeah this is gonna be pretty nice
however I have no way to get there
well there was a few little mice sitting over in the corner
and they were watching all of this
and the fairy godmother goes over to them
and goes poofo
and turns them into six white horses
and theres still no carriage
Cinderella still didnt wanna ride on the back of the horses in this new white dress
so the godmother says
well I can fix that too
so she goes over to a pumpkin
and she goes poofo and turns a pumpkin into a carriage
Cinderella being the the person that knows a good thing when she sees it jumps into the carriage
and the godmother says
now listen Cinderella
youre gonna have a great time tonight
theres no problem
youll youll do really good
but you gotta be home by midnight
and Cinderella says
thats kindof an early curfew I especially on a main party like this tonight
and the godmother says
I know I know but this everything changes at midnight
and Ill hafta start all over again
youre gonna turn into a a scrub lady again at midnight if you dont get outof there
and then wed hafta start all over again
and and you dont wanna be sitting in the middle of this ball looking like a scrubber lady
so the princess says
oh oh I understand
I I know whats going on now
so she gets to the ball
and the prince who is not taken by any girls
he simply doesnt like girls
theyre all there
and hes looking around
and whammo
Cinderella comes in
and she changes his whole train of thought on girls
so she because shes she is shes quite striking
and so he says
well maybe I can take this one out for a night
and so he begins to dance with her
and all the other girls are kindof sitting over there by themselves
and the king hes pretty happy with himself because he thinks hes finally found a girl that the prince may be able to like
so the king hes happy
the queens happy
the prince is pretty happy too
and Cinderella is ecstatic
but f before they know it its eleven fifty nine and forty five seconds
and theyre still dancing
and she says
oh I gotta get outof here or Im gonna turn into a chore woman right in front of the prince
and so she says
Prince I gotta leave and I gotta leave now
and he says

no
she says
I just gotta leave
I gotta get outof of here
and so he says
well wait just a minute let me get your name
and she says
no its Cinderella
thats all you need
thats all I can tell ya
and she runs down the stairs
and as shes running down the stairs she loses her her slipper
which happens to be glass by the way
oh
now shes wobbling down the stairs
and she jumps into her magic carriage
and begins to ride home
and through sheer luck she makes it outof the eyes of the prince before the the final gong of twelve
and the the the pumpkin does turn back or the carriage turns back into the pumpkin
the mice turn back into or the horses turn back into mice
Cinderella is back into her ar or chore womans dress
her bouffant hairdo is all straggly again
and she walks home about half the way because she did get outof the sight of the prince
and she walks home
and she gets home
and says
well that was a pretty good night
probably wont hear from that guy again because I can kindof tell maybe he was not all there either
so so the prince he gets up the next morning
he says
hey
says
I think I could go for that gal
so and all he has is a glass slipper slipper
so he tells all of his people
he says
listen we gotta find that girl
and so they go out
and they begin to look
and they check all around
and they come up to Cinderellas house
and the two the two stepdaughters are there
and the two stepdaughters they come out and they look
and they say
oh I know I can get that shoe on
and if I can get that shoe on bammo Im gonna be the princess
so the prince is standing around
and he says
well
he says
you dont really look like the one I was dancing with last night or last week but here try on the shoe
lets see what it if it works
and the first one tries it on and its too big
her foot wont fit into a size ten army shoe
and the second one comes over
and she tries it
she cant get in it either
and the prince says
hey is there any other girls around youknow around the house here
and they say
nope there isnt anybody
and Cinderella on the other hand is looking from the kitchen where shes scrubbing the floors
and she hears this
and the prince says
wait a minute I just saw somebody in the kitchen
and they said
oh thats thats our stepdaughters
she doesnt she you dont even wanna see her
shes too ugly
and so he goes in
and she is shes pretty straggled
her hairs all all a flutter
shes in a charwomans dress
and he says
well I dont know
she looks alittle familiar
youknow if she had a good bouffant hairdo and a white dress Id probably recognize her
so he tries on the slipper on the Cinderella
and it fits fits like a glove
and he says

and she says
yes it was me

and then you water it
it is the little boys birthday
hes having his birthday party today
but the dog found the cake
and ate a big chunk outof the cake
and left caky doggie footprints all the way under the couch
the mother is ma
shes got the broom
I think shes gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why its hiding
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived
so they are coming in with their presents seeing a a mangled cake for the birthday
oh and it looks like the little boy is crying
okay so I was hospitalized well sortof in November for abdominal surgery
and I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before
but it kicked in really fast
ke they tell you to take three deep breaths
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out
and it was kindof like taking a long blink
and then I opened my eyes
and it was like three hours later
which was really strange because usually ke youknow when you sleep you can feel time passing
ke it didnt feel like any time had passed
so it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that youknow three hours had gone by
everything was all over with
and then I was on pain meds
I stayed overnight
and then I went home
I was on pain meds
but then I I was able to go off of those
Im not sure what else you wanna know about it
no not off hand
okay so I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator
she would hold things in
and youknow you could just feel the energy that she was upset
but she wouldnt talk about it
I asked her on numerous occasions to youknow if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her
she always said
no
and then she kindof passively aggressively started youknow not participating in things or youknow just kindof being rude I guess
so it finally youknow broke my last little straw
and I yelled at her one day
and kicked her outof the group
so thats what I did about it
okay well Im afraid of heights
even little heights
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder
so I decided one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving youknow thing youknow jump I guess thats what you call it a jump for his birthday
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights
so we went sky diving
and it was terrifying
and when I when we jumped outof the plane youknow youre attached to someone else
so when we jumped outof the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute while we were free falling because I was just ke
and then the parachute opens
and then you start gliding which is kind of nice
that was that was better
it was a little bit more like being a bird youknow and flying
so that was nice for a little bit
and then we landed
and then that was that
and I said Im glad I did it
and Ill never do it again
and Im still afraid of heights
so the story starts with the flood
theres lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat to save her cat from the flood and the rains
so she got caught in the flood
she got swept downstream
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out
and shes been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her
someone saw her
called the fire department
and now the the firemen are there
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him I think thats what that looks like to get her outof the water
and thats the end
okay the boy is playing soccer outside
he kicks the ball really hard
it goes crashing into the window
it crashes through the window into the lamps m
he jumps up
he grabs the ball
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it
yep
the boy is leaving for school
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella
it might rain
and he says
Ill be fine
bye mom
so he leaves
he goes outside
and its sprinkling a little bit
and then its r
and theres puddles all over
and mom was right
so hes running back home in the rain
he comes home all sopping wet
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face
and he gets the umbrella
and leaves again for school with the umbrella
okay well the father his wife dies
and he is left in the care of his single daughter
and he remarries
and he remarries evil but she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own
and they live together
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen
and the dad is kindof nowhere in this part of the story laughs
and then theres Cinderella lets see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream
so then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married
and he must have a ball to find his wife
so they send out invitations to around the town
and the stepmother gets the invitation
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince
so they get ready
Cinderella has the the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them
but her sisters say no she cant go
she hasta stay and clean
and they rip her dress
she goes back up to her room crying while her sisters and stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball
then the ir her fairy godmother appears
and says she will create the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball
but she has back by midnight or shell turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin
so and she gets glass slippers
so she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her
and her stepmother and the sisters dont know who she is because she looks so different
and then it gets to be midnight
and she says
oh I needta go home
so she runs away from the prince
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs
and she runs home
and the her dress turns back to rags
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin
but she still has her glass slipper
then the next day the prince sends out someone to fit the glass slipper on all the womens feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was
so they show up with the slipper at her house
and the stepmother locks her in the room locks Cinderella in the room
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsisters feet which it doesnt fit because they have big feet
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper
and loandbehold it fits
so they bring her back to the prince
and they get married
and they live happily ever after
the little girls pet cat is stuck up in the tree
shes gotten off her tricycle and is concerned
jumping up and down trying to get the cat to come down
the father decides to help
so he gets the ladder
climbs up the tree
and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down
and the dog is barking at him
and is probably going to bite him when he comes down
but in the meantime the fire department is coming
theyre on their way with the ladder to come save both the man and the cat

and at the same time that shes chasing the dog and upset about the cake being bitten into the little boy has friends arriving for his birthday party with gifts
one time I was playing with some weights at a gym
and I was trying to fix something
and the weights came down and smashed my thumb
I remember it was throbbing

but it healed and got better
Ive spent time outof the country with people that didnt speak English
and I usually ended up acting things out like I was playing charades to get myself understood
or scared
yeah I useta live in California
and I was there for the big Northridge earthquake
that was pretty scary
yeah it was about five in the morning and my dog started barking
and he usually didnt get up that early to start barking
so I was alittle alarmed
and I turned around
and before I could open my mouth to say what is it what do you hear allofasudden I started to feel the ground shake
and you could feel it
and then I heard crashes and boom and crash and boom
and I lived in California on a hillside
and so I was I was in the back of the house
and I was only afraid that the front half of the house had fallen off and fell down the hill
but when Ive it seemed like it stopped
and it seemed like it went on for a long time
but Im guessing it was probably ten seconds
but when I finally got up to go look my kitchen was a mess and and half the things in every cabinet had fallen on the floor but the structure of the house was intact
but I had alotof stuff to clean up

I fell and landed on it funny
and then it started hurting
and it kindof got all big
and eventually went to a doctor
and thats about all I can remember
yes
the problems were we were seeing things from different perspectives
where theyre looking at it from just one rs one flat perspective and not seeing the different layers and levels that I see
and what Ive what Im learning to do about it
its still in process
is just to accept where they are and accept where I am
and know that theyre where they needta be
Im where I I needta be
and I dont need there approval to go to the levels that Im seeing and experiencing and and feeling and things like that
and that listening to them and accepting them where they are and doing that with myself
and trying to to reach out on their level and what what works for them
and how seeing how we can communicate with
with my mother its like with art
we can communicate on art terms and and creative kind of stuff
with my father its been more negative kind of stuff or more challenging kind of stuff recently
but seeing ways looking for ways to connect and positive ways and taking advantage of those and trying to ignore the rest
yes
I guess
well the there are quite a few of them actually
where Ive been frightened or scared has been more recently just speaking out for myself and saying this is my truth or this is what I believe or this is how I see things
and what Ive been doing about it is talking to friends talking my therapist alotof inner research to see whats going on
and then o looking at the fear
and look reading doing lots of reading and seeing remembering a a great sage said youknow
how do you how do you stop fear
you look it in the face
so trying to look my fear in the face and taking little baby steps
and looking at ke with showing my art yesterday at at at church to people
just taking an taking risks with people that I trust
and getting positive feedback from that
and moving forward from those little steps

today was little Timmys birthday
he was five years old
his mother had baked him a large chocolaty cake with beautiful drippy icing and five wonderful candles
but as the guests were arriving the dog took the opportunity to take a large bite of the beautiful chocolaty cake
and
but the dog hid underneath the sofa
tracking chocolaty footprints all the way
the little boy was crying
but his party guests two of them were standing there with their presents
and the mother angrily continued angrily to threaten continued to angrily threaten the dog with the broom
however the mother counted to ten
put the broom away
put the dog out
cleaned out the mess cleaned up the mess
cut the cake in half
and everybody got a huge slice of the untainted side of the birthday cake
and little Timmy had a wonderful fifth birthday with his little friend John and his little friend Greta
the end
no
one day I was out to lunch with my friend Bill
it was a work day
and we were at Mimis cafe
and my stomach started hurting
and I thought that it might just be stre
so I ignored it
but by seven oclock that night I was throwing up constantly
it never the pain never let up
and I was just throwing up throwing up throwing up
at five oclock in the morning I decided well I had decided before but at five oclock in the morning I felt comfortable calling my exhusbands father my ex father inlaw to come get the two older kids
who were ten and nine at the time
and I didnt have my third one
so my two kids
and take them to his wife
and drive me to the hospital
which he did
and I spent from
they did alotof tests on me
they found out that I have one kidney
I was thirty one years old
and I had no idea I only had one kidney
but they looked for kidney stones
and they only saw one kidney which was huge
and they thought
whats going on
they looked for the other one
they never found it because I dont have another one
so I found out I didnt have another kidney
and I also found out I didnt have kidney stones
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis
and it was about to kill me
so Doctor Geiger came
he was the anesthesiologist
he introduced himself
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists
I said
yes
I was in alotof pain
because the pain medication they had given me
I couldnt have any more
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons
so I was in alotof pain
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things
and so Doctor Geiger put me under
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a
what are those things called
a ventilation tube down my throat
and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up
and they gave me some medication
and sent me home
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo
and now I have a third baby
the end
okay one time I was at
oh was it SeaWorld
it was SeaWorld in SanDiego
with three children
one of which was in a stroller
and I was walking
and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said
look
so I was looking
and then there was a man off to the right of the of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily
and I looked up at him and there was he was indicating to me something
and I looked to my right
and theres a woman there with a stroller
and shes fuming at me
and shes telling her husband six feet away to tell me that Im in her way
and I look over at the woman
and she looks at me like she wants to hit me
and shes yelling at her husband to tell me
so I looked at her husband
and I looked at her
and I said
she can talk to me
and the words excuse me work very well
and so I looked at her
and she continued to fume at me
didnt say a single thing to me until after her husband had told me to move
then she cussed at me and called me a name
and so I basically let her live her miserable life
and thats all I really did about it
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred and six degree temperature
so I took her to the emergency room
and she wouldnt take anything orally
she jus
and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard eventhough her temperature was a hundred and six was a good sign
so they gave her
whats the nice way to say this
a rectal fever reducer
and she eventually got better
we got her on antibiotics
but I was extremely afraid because it was my first child
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred and six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature
so I took her to the hospital
and she eventually got better
okay once upon a ti
it was raining very hard
but she hadta get home
and so she crossed the bridge
but the bridge wasnt very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was decaying the under girders
made that up
and so the bridge gave way
and the girl fell off of the bridge
for she was really riding a bike
and it was a rumbly bridge
and she fell into the water
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help
eventually someone heard her cries for help
and put on all the rescue necessary rescue gear
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her
and she was very grateful
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him
and he said
dont ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain
and be safe
the end
one day a bo
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball
and he kicked it into the air
and it crashed through a neighbors window
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window
but the boy ran away
and the man walked outside looking for the boy
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball
the man scolded him
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even
the end
one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain
and told him to take an umbrella
the boy said
no Ill be fine mom
and the mother was hesitant
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella
then the boy was walking to school
and it started to rain
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didnt have control over everything like he thought he did
and so he
and wetly came in the door saying nothing
but showing his mother that she was indeed right
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being
so she gave it to him
and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mothers love
the end
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella
I would guess
there was a little girl
and her father was widowed
and so he remarried
and the new stepmother had two daughters the girls age
and the stepmother was not very nice
and as the dad got outof the picture by an unfortunate series of events the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave
and turned her into basically a scullery maid
and made her clean out the fireplace
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I dont know what her name was before
and the one da
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mothers old dress
and the
lets just call her the wicked stepmother
the wicked stepmother was not interested in letting Cinderella go
so when Cinderella came downstairs she
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress
actually not Cinderella
she didnt do that at all
and they had taken things from the sisters
so the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderellas dress
Cinderella was very sad
but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle
and a
her rather plump fairy godmother came
and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown
turned the mice into coachmen and horses
and turned a pumpkin into a coach
and Cinderella went to the castle
the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her
what are the chances
and as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight the magic would wear off
and so when the crock
leaving one of her beautiful glass slipper
however
so
eventhough the prince had spent couple hours with her
and went looking for her using the glass slipper
and when the people came to the door of Cinderellas abode
the stepmother locked her in had locked her in because they didnt want her to find she didnt want him to find she didnt want them to find her
and so they
she raced downstairs
the shoe fit perfectly
they found Cinderella
and Cinderella went to the palace
married the prince
rode off in a coach
and they lived happily ever after
the end
one day a girl was out playing
and she had her do
and no she had a cat
and she and the cat were playing
and the a dog came by and chased the cat up the tree
the little girl couldnt reach the cat
so she called her dad
her dad came with a ladder
and climbed up the tree
but the ladder fell
the dog continued to bark
the dad was stuck
the cat contentedly sat at the end of the branch
and the little girl still couldnt reach the cat
so she called the fireman to come save the dad and the cat
and they brought their ladder
and saved them all
and sent the doggie home
and had a talk with the doggies owner about a leash law
the end
well I guess I can back up and say that the girl rode her bike to the place where she played with her cat
but that was a long time ago
and there was a bird singing happily in all the cacophony
the end

she was brought there because she was going to be their helper and clean their house and make them dinner
and she would live there for the rest of her life
the stepsisters were very mean to Cinderella
they actually picked at her made fun of her
and as she grew up a she always wondered as she looked out the window what it would be like to live in the palace
soon as she got older she she saw that there was an invitation to the grand ball to meet the prince
how exciting this would be to finally go and meet the prince and possibly one day be able to live in the palace
the stepsisters were all getting ready to go aswell
and the evil stepmother was ke was making sure that they were going to be greeted by the prince and have an invitation of their very own to meet him in person
oh
Cinderella thought
I wonder how I would get to the ball
so she opened up a chest and there she saw a beautiful pink gown that all the little mice that lived with her in the house decided that they were gonna help sew the dress back together and make it a beautiful dress for her to wear to the palace
soon the stepsisters found out that Cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the prince aswell
and they came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress
ohno
Cinderella thought
now what shall I do
how will I ever get to meet the prince and get away from my evil stepsisters
then outof nowhere a beautiful good witch showed up
and she granted Cinderella a wish
the wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city
that nothing would ever compare
she would also grant her a a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince
the only exception was that she would hafta be back by midnight or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin
oh this is so wonderful
Cinderella said
yes I hafta go
it is my chance to possibly be one of the princesses at the ball
then I shall grant you your wish
said the good witch
and there she was standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine
crystals and diamonds everywhere and the beautiful horse carriage
and off she went to the palace
there everyone stood in line to meet the prince
finally Cinderella got her turn
and there she was
ohno
she said
its almost twelve
I can not finish my dance with the prince
so she hurrily
and as she ran down the stairs one of her glass slippers fell off
the prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown
minutes later Cinderella turned back to her maid outfit in her rags and no riches anymore were on her
she went back to scrubbing the floors mopping wondering about her wish to become a princess one day
then soon there was a knock at the door
it was the prince
and he was wondering where which person the slipper belonged to of all the stepsisters
the stepsisters lined up and tried to squeeze their foot into the shoe but to their dismize
finally Cinderella noticed that they were all trying to figure out where which foot would fit in the glass slipper
and then she put her foot in
and there it was
the prince knew that this was the wonderful girl that she had met all along that he had met all along
he decided to make her the princess
and they lived happily ever after

I have a girlfriend thats German
and we were cleaning out a tack room
and I have a horse blankets in the tack room
and I asked her to get a big garbage bag so I could put the horse blanket in it for the winter
and kindof put it up for the winter
and she as I put it up on the shelf she couldnt understand how the horse blanket was gonna fit on the shelf where I keep the garbage bags
so she came back with garbage bags
and she had cleared off the shelf where I keep the garbage bags
but a horse blanket is is as big as this table
and the shelf I keep the garbage bags on is maybe six inches high
so she still brought me the garbage bags
and she just gave me a very puzzled look like she doesnt know what I was going to do with them
so I said
hold the bag out
let me get the blanket for you
and I fold up the blanket
and I put it in the garbage bag
and she said
how is this going to fit on the shelf
and I said
I wasnt gonna put in on the shelf

when I was in third grade I slept over my girlfriends house
her mom and dad were out for the night
and she had two older sisters
and Benita was the oldest sister
I dont know what happened to Alyssa
maybe she wasnt there
but Jennifer and I and Benita were home alone in the house
and we were playing hideandgoseek
Benita Benita could not have been that much older than us
maybe she was in junior high
we were in elementary school
and Benita hid in the closet in the guest room
and the closet door got stuck
and she couldnt get outof the closet door
and we started to panic
and she started to panic
she started to cry and bang on the door
and we couldnt get a hold of her mom at dinner
this is before cellphones
for trying to the mom didnt tell us what restaurant she went to
she didnt have a cellphone
think we ended up calling ke the fire department or the police department
we were really scared we werent gonna get Benita out
and she had no air in there
but the fire department came
and they hadta take
and she was just sobbing
we were all scared that she wasnt getting outof the closet
there was a flash flood in somewhere down south
and a little girl got swept away
one of the

and pulls her into safety
and she finds her family and everythings okay
theres a boy outside practicing soccer
and oops kicks the soccer ball through the front window of a neighbors house
ea breaks a lamp
and the neighbor grabs the ball and looks out the window to see who did it

and as he walks to school he gets stuck in the rain
and its coming down harder and harder
and he asks to go back home
and his moms upset that hes all wet and soggy
and she gives him the umbrella that he should have taken it in the first place
and then he walks happily back towards school
okay Cinderella was an only child
and she had a very generous dad
and the dad remarried and had a stepmother who had two children Anastasia and Druzella
and the dad passed away
and when he died the stepmother turned Cinderella into kindof a housemaid and used all the resources to give her two children fancy dresses and voice lessons and all the nicer things in life while Cinderella scrubbed the floors cleaned the fireplace
but Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life
and she became friends with all the animals in the house except Lucifer
he was a mean old cat
that was the stepmothers cat
but she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends
and she lived ups
and the prince
I think it was PrincePhilip
PrincePhilips father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife
so he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens sothat the prince could meet all the girls in the village
and the invitations get sent out
and the stepmother opens the invitation and says
oh its gonna be a grand ball
and all the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince
and Cinderella overhears her telling the story to stepsisters
and she says
oh I wanna go
Im an eligible maiden
and stepmother says
ofcourse you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done
so she makes up a bunch of chores for Cinderella to do
and she says
wash the floor
and Cinderella says
well I washed the floor yesterday
she says
well do it again
and she had her do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball
and as shes helping her sisters get ready she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons
and when theyre done she goes upstairs to the attic and finds a dress a i in an old trunk that useta be her mothers
and she shows the mice her beautiful dress
and shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away
and shes very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress
but the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready
so while shes away the mice help make the dress pretty
and Jasper and Gus decide to go out and get some more pretty things to add to the dress
and they grab a a pearl necklace
and the pearls go flying on the place
and both mice pick up all the pearls
and Lucifers watching them the cat
and they manage just to get the beads stuck on Jaspers tail and slide under the door
and theyre safe
and the birds help
and the mice help
and they get the dress made up real pretty
and they sing a song
we can do it we can do it then we can
and they get this song going
and they get the dress made
and Cinderella comes in the attic
and they surprise her with this beautiful dress
and shes so happy she can go to the ball
so she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and the her stepsisters to wait because she can go to the ball now because she has something to wear and shes finished all her chores
and the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks and her auti beautiful dress
and they see that the decorations are stuff that she
so they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back
and they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball
Cinderella goes running to the garden
and she starts crying because she wanted to go to the ball
and this fairy godmother appears and does this bippetyboppetyboo thing whips her up a real pretty white dress
and then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses
and she tells Cinderella go dance with the prince but she hasta be back by midnight or the spell will wear off
so Cinderella goes to the ball
and she meets the prince
and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with
and she hears the clock strike midnight
and she hasta go
and the prince is like
but wait
but wait
I dont even know your name
and she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach which was starting to be a pumpkin
and as shes running down the stairs one of her shoes falls off
and she gets in the coach
and the coach takes her home
and she arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin
and the horses turn back into the mice
and dog footman turns back into a dog
and the next day shes walking around in the house
and she hears the the duke come to the door and says
the prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride but he doesnt know who she is
so hes going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that this Cinderella has left this maidens left behind
so he ends up going to Cinderellas house
and she hears the Duke coming to the door
and she goes to her room
and the stepmother locks her in her room puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the Duke into the house
the Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small
and as the mother is sitting there the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rescue Cinderella
and again they run into the cat
but they escape the cat again
they go underneath the door
and they hand the key to Cinderella
and she unlocks the door
and as shes leaving the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister
and one stepsisters too small
the other ones foot was too big
and as hes leaving Cinderella runs down the stairs and says
but wait
I I wanna try this shoe on
and the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderellas the one the prince was dancing with
so as the Duke is walking over with the glass slipper on a pillow to go give it to Cinderella the stepmother trips him
and he falls
and the glass slipper breaks into a million pieces
and Cinderella says
well thats okay
and she pulls the other glass slipper outof her pocket and says
I have the other one
so
lets see
lets see Fido the dog was chasing Fluffy the kitty
and chased Fluffy the kitty up a tree
and Fluffys owner a little girls riding her bike
and she sees Fluffy up a tree
and she calls to him
but he wont come down
so she runs to the house and gets her dad
dad gets a ladder
and crawls up the tree to get Fluffy
but the dog knocks the ladder outof the way
so
and they come out to save the dad and Fluffy
theres a bird singing
okay
a little girl was playing outside in the yard with her kitty and her puppy
and suddenly she realized her kitty had gone up into the tree and was lounging on the branch
the birds were singing
so it must have been in the springtime
and she was very upset
shed been riding her tricycle also
and she was very upset
she went and got her dad
her dad came out
climbed up in the tree
but he got scared
couldnt the kitty was on a branch he couldnt reach
and so he was sitting there and didnt know how to get back down
the dog was barking at the dad
and someone mommy probably realized what was going on
she called the fire department
and the fire department came with a ladder
actually it looks like a ladder laying there
so dad probably climbed up on the ladder
and then the ladder fell down
and he couldnt get up get back down
okay you get two pieces of bread
and you get your peanut butter and your jelly
and first you put the peanut butter on one slice of bread
and then you put the jelly on the other slice of bread
and then you place the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and jelly touching each other
and then you slice it in half
well it was in
and it was April first
and I has was working
and I had been ill for a couple of months
going to the doctors different doctors and doing tests
and I wasnt getting any better
and I went to the doctor that day
and he took one look at me
and said
youre going to the hospital
and so the hospital was right next door
and I went next door
and they admitted me
and I called work to tell them where I was
and that I wasnt gonna be in
but I was so kindof outof it I didnt even know where I was
and they couldnt figure it out for quite awhile
and I was in the hospital for a week with them doing intraveneous
which Ive been on antibotics
and they did all kinds of tests
they couldnt find out what was wrong
but I was slowly dying
and they knew that
and that I was filled with infection
and they couldnt locate it
and so finally a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory
and I agreed because I knew that I was not gonna make it
and so they went in
and what had happened I had ke peritonitis
and Id had diverticulitis
and one of them burst
and that would have been peritonitis with the infection bu
and they it had sealed it except for a
that
and so I was I guess what they call septic
and so they did the surgery
and it was a long long surgery
and I ended up with a lo colonoscopy no colostomy colostomy
it was the bag
and then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that
and then six months later I was able to go back in the hospital because they had removed a section of my colon
went back in the hospital
and they resectioned
and I was able to not have the bag anymore
so I can remember all of that
and and it was life threatening
but and I knew that
and and thats why Im not afraid to die now because it was very peaceful
it wasnt it wasnt like a scary thing so
yes
well its still on going
my mother as I said is eighty eight
she has a pretty profound hearing loss
and has for probably atleast ten years
but she refuses ta
so we have hadta deal with this
so when I take her
and Im the one thats responsible for taking her to all of her doctors appointments
and when shes in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth
and so I hafta yell at her all the time
and its so rude and awful to be yelling at her
and even when I explain to the doctors they still turn and talk ta
and thats frustrating for her
and once I leave Im feeling really tense and frustrated because Ive been yelling
and our bodies when
and my mother also is getting some dementia
and so the combination what Ive realized is more to just allow her to talk
and not really have a conversation with her anymore
and thats very sad
its I guess its not that unusual
and Ive already told my boys
and Ive had my hearing test here that I wont do that to them
youknow its really really bad
yes
and right from the beginning so that youknow you dont hafta make that huge youknow
and and I dont think that it works as well when its done later on youknow
so anyway
Im sure there has been
well yeah obviously Ive got with two boys
theyre adults now
but with them growing up there was youknow always something going on
because they were getting into stuff different things
probably one of the times that was really scary that first comes to mind is my oldest boy
when he was maybe
and they were doing swim lessons and in the neighbors yard
er with the pool was next door
and the neighbor and the and the instructor would come out to the pool
so he was very familiar with the pool
and there was two friends there that
and so we were over there just as a at a party
and so he had been practicing going off the board
it was just a little board
but hed been practicing doing that and he wanted to do that
but then he got scared just as he started to jump off
and he jumped toward the side
and so he hit his chin
and it just opened it up
and ofcourse he was hysterical
and I was getting pretty scared
but it you could see the bone
Imean it was really really scary
and so we had ta
and he wasnt knocked out
so we took him to the hospital into emergency
and then they ofcourse they hadta do stitches
and yeah it was kindof scary
but they survive those things most of the time
""
there was a family that was going home
and there was some water in the road where they were going to cross
and the father decided to go ahead
and that they could make it
but as they got about half way across the water was too deep
and started washing the car away
the windows were down luckily
and they were all getting crawling out the window
and some people they had called nineoneone
and there was a s first responder that came
had on a life vest
and grabbed a hold of a limb of a tree
and was reaching out to save the little girl that was in the churning water that had gone under but then had come back up
and he was able to rescue her
there was a young man that was learning to play soccer
and he was on the soccer team
and he was excited
and he was practicing with his kicks in the front yard
and he kicked it really good
only thing he kicked it too hard
and wasnt careful about where he was aiming
and it hit the window
and he had kicked it so hard that it broke the window
his dad was sitting inside when the soccer ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp
and he jumped up and grabbed the soccer ball
and looked out the window
and saw that it was his son that was practicing
and so he understood
he was had been a boy before
and knew that it was just a window and it could be repaired
the little boy was getting ready ta
he had his backpack on
and Mom told him
it looks like and I had read in the paper that its going to rain today
heres your umbrella
no mom
he told her
I dont need an umbrella today
it looks beautiful outside
and so he went
she wasnt happy about it
but he started walking and was on his way ta
and suddenly it started sprinkling
and he was getting wet
and he went running back through the puddles and through the rain back to the house
and he was all wet
mom looked at him and said
I told you so
and so he got the umbrella
and then he was walking to school with the umbrella even though he was already wet
Cinderella and her father lived in a lovely home with her dog
and father brings home the stepmother and two stepdaughters
and introduces them to Cinderella
and shes very happy to meet them
and then very quickly the stepmother and the stepdaughters become mean
they start being mean to Cinderella and ordering her around
making her take care of them and do everything for them
and wash and clean the house and do all of the chores
and Cinderella feels sad
but she has her the little animals around the house

and she has on glass slippers
and the fairy godmother tells her to have a good time

and so Cinderella goes
and the prince falls in love with her
and they dance
and he thinks shes beautiful
and they have a good time
and the stepsisters and the stepmother are jealous
Cinderella suddenly realizes the clock is saying that its twelve oclock
and so she hurries down the stairs
and loses one of her glass slippers

and then the next day the groomsman of the prince comes around with the glass slipper to find who it fits
and it fits Cinderella

pretty much
today was little Johnnys birthday
hes four years old
now whats gonna happen for him today
well hes got friends are coming over to the birthday party
mom made him a nice cake and she frosted it and put four candles on top of it
but when she went back into the kitchen to make sure everything was cleaned up for the party their dog jumped up got on top of the table and started eating the birthday cake
when mom heard the commotion in the living room she grabbed a broom and chased the dog under the couch
just then the doorbell rang
the guests were arriving
and the cake was destroyed
mom was more worried about the cake than the little kids were though
they enjoyed the rest of the cake just fine and had a great time
when I was seven years old I went swimming at the NorthernMichigan university pool with a good friend of mine
I started feeling chills while I was swimming but I thought it was just because the water was cold
I went out and showered off afterwards
and the hot water felt really good
but I was getting stiffer and stiffer
when we left the sun was shining and it was about eighty degrees
and just standing still in the sun felt really good but moving was getting incredibly hard
since my friend only lived a couple of blocks away I sat down and said
Im just gonna sit here
can you go home and have your mom call my mom and have her come and pick me up
well my mom came to pick me up
she felt that I had a fever took me to the hospital and they found out that I had meningitis
and I was in the hospital for four days
oh it might have been five I cant remember
it it I was seven okay
and they gave me a spinal tap
and thats terrifying because they have you laying on your side
and here I was seven
ERROR
now dont move
thisll hurt but dont move you might end up paralyzed
well that certainly calmed me right down
but with the exception that they bring in the flavored pops whenever I wanted from the nursing station
the refrigerated ke fruit drink things that are frozen
that was okay
but they didnt turn the tv on for my room until the day I left
so I was in the hospital for four days with no tv
but Im
okay
my mom when I was twenty one had a brain tumor
and she went in for surgery
and when she came back out
this is in the late seventies
they did the surgery
they got the tumor out
but at the same time it caused some damage to her ability to speak well and to understand well
it it was difficult trying to develop lists of things that she wanted done around the house
but we managed to work out a pretty good system of youknow
shed write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper which she always kept with her
and that seemed to help alot because youknow she could remember something short term but an hour from now forget it
but just by carrying that pad around with her all the time she was able to make lists of things so when I came home I knew what she wanted done
and we were able to youknow bridge the gaps for awhile until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home
Ive had a stress free life
okay
when I was in high school I was out with some friends at PresqueIsle
theres no death in this story
and we were walking along
and its all rocks along the edge of LakeSuperior
its not a beach at that particular spot
and it was a big rock cliff on one side
and I looked over at it
and I thought I could climb it
and one of my friends said
I dont know
oh no
well I managed to climb
it was probably a sixty or seventy foot cliff
and I got up within about five ten feet to the top and then ran out of hand holds
and I was looking down
I didnt wanna look down anymore
it was way far down
but I was able to move off to one side
and there was a tree that was actually
and I was able to reach up with one hand
but at that point I was pretty darn scared because I didnt know how secure that tree was
but there was only one way to find out
and it was strong enough since Im here
this woman was walking
and allofasudden a flash flood came up and swept her down stream
fortunately she was lucky enough to grab on to a tree branch and hold on
and a rescue worker came along looking to see if there are any victims in the flood saw her out there begging for help
and he climbs out on a long branch to rescue her
and brings a belt sothat theyll be able to with a rope attached to it that sothat theyll be able to pull her back to shore safely
and boy she looks cold
little boy is getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella
he says
no Mom
I dont need an umbrella
its not raining
once again she asks him
you really oughta take your umbrella with you today
no no no Mom Im just fine
he walks out the door and starts walking to school when all of a sudden it starts to rain
it starts raining harder and harder
he turns around runs back and runs into the house
hes soaking wet
his hairs plastered down
his shirt is soaked
his mom looks at him and says
now didnt I ask you if you needed that umbrella
so he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school again
theres a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can
the ball sails quite a ways
infact it sails so far it sails right through the neighbors plate glass window in his living room
when it comes through the glass after breaking a window it even knocks over a lamp in the living room
the man whos sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through jumps up grabs the ball and looks out the window
but the boys run away
there once was a young girl called Cinderella
she had three ugly stepsisters
and her family didnt like her very much and made her do all
she hadta scru
and she hadta cle
and she hadta cook and sew and everything all by herself while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun
one day the prince was gonna have a big ball
and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear
looking around buying e new dresses checking out how they looked
but Cinderella couldnt go
when allofasudden her fairy godmother appears and says
whats wrong Cinderella
why are you so depressed
Cinderella says
I cant go to the ball that the prince is having but my stepsisters get to go instead
and the fairy godmother says
well nonsense
and she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears
and she says
well youre gonna need a horse or horses and a coach to ride
so she snatches up some mice that were playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage
and she gives her gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball
but the stepmother said or the fairy godmother says
be sure youre home by midnight
the magics only good for one day
at the stroke of midnight all of this will disappear
so Cinderella goes to the ball
and she has a wonderful time
shes dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince
he just wants to dance with her all night
when she allofasudden looks up at the clock and realizes its five minutes to midnight
ohgoodness
so she turns and races outof the ball
and in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers
falls off of her foot
hops into her carriage
and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight the horses change back into mice
the carriage changes back into a pumpkin
and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen
she sneaks into the house
and all her stepsisters a were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady
he tries to find her
and all he hasta go by is the one glass slipper that she lost behind her
he goes around
he tries every girl is town to see whose foot the slipper will fit on
the three ep stepsisters all try to squeeze their feet into that glass slipper as hard as they can
but they cant make them fit
when the prince looks over at the what he thinks is just the maid and says
why dont you try it on
oh shes just the maid
it couldnt possibly be her
well wouldnt you know he tries it on her and it fits perfectly
and they lived happily ever after
there was a cat that was walking outside when allofasudden a dog came along and chased the cat right up a tree
a little girl on her tricycle saw that her cat was up the tree
and started crying that her cat wouldnt come back down
dad ci came out to see what all the commotion was about
and saw that he could get the cat back down by grabbing a ladder from his garage and climbing up the tree to get the cat
unfortunately once he got up the tree the ladder fell down
and now dad was trapped up the tree with the cat while the dog was still barking
somebody called the fire department
they came over to rescue the cat and dad from the tree

okay
it was a spring day in BluefieldWestVirginia
and my best friend Grace and I were at the SevenEleven which was new to town
enjoying a Slurpee because every Friday we got to go to SevenEleven to get a Slurpee
my mom decides to cross the road
and fill up her gas tank
Grace and I decide we got our Slurpees so quickly wed go across and meet her at the gas station
we cross one lane no problem
get across to the other side
Grace decides to cross back because she doesnt like the traffic going across the next road
I stay
and theres alotof traffic
and I decide to cross
sure enough I cross
theres a blind side
Im hit by a car
flipped
and we find out later my leg is broken
it happened so fast I didnt remember any of it
my mom unfortunately got to witness the entire thing
and called an ambulance
they took me to the hospital
set my leg
I had a cast up to my hip
I went home
and was homeschooled for about three weeks
but all in all it was very comfortable
friends came to see me
and it turned out it was a student teacher at our school that hit me
that was kindof an odd coincidence in our town
but I healed very well
and thats my story
can you imagine how the poor
I take a class
and at the class I noticed a
and then I heard him speak to the teacher
and
it was slightly impaired
but you could understand him
but it was very kind of nasal in the back of his throat
this is a tap class
so we dance
and I was amazed to find out later that he actually was deaf
and he wears heavy duty
I dont know much detail about it
but yet he can feel the rhythm
and he can tap dance
but to understand him I just hafta look at him
and listen very closely
and I can understand him completely
hes a responsible adult
holds a job
and it hasnt affected him negatively in any other way
it just you just hafta take time
and listen carefully
and watch him
and thats how weve overcome it
okay
my friends and I decided to go for a hike
one is especially adventurous
his name is Leo
and my roommate Suzette and the man I was dating at the time was named Lee
we took off on a hike
well equipped with backpacks full of snacks waters
it was an beautiful day
coo
and we planned to spend the whole day
alotof it our plans were based on Leo
he was more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy
so we went not knowing where we were going
we just trusted him
we got along
had a snack
and been gone about two and a half hours
and nex
ready to head back to our destination
and were lost
three of us have absolutely no clue no concept of where we are
were surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look
so there really was no direction
and we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend Leo
Leo doesnt panic
I started to feel alittle panicked because I had twisted my knee a little bit
so I had alittle compromised gait
and it was alittle tender
but I didnt wanna complain
and I knew theres nothing we could do about it
we just hadta get back home
so for the first time I really felt quite afraid that we might not make it
and what to do about my knee
we persevered
we trusted Leo
he he went off on a couple wrong paths
but he got us back on track
got us back to the car
my leg was fine
and it all ended very well
it was a great memory
we laughed about it
and I wont go hiking with Leo again
the end
it had been raining for days and days
and everyone knew the river was rising
residents in the area were warned to leave town
and to find shelter elsewhere elsewhere until the river river waters went down
one family the Jones would not leave
they were not afraid
theyd seen the river ride for many many many years
and never felt like they were threatened
well this day the river rose up
and came up to the bottom level of their house
they decide to move upstairs
and the water was still rising
the rain was still coming down
it was becoming r nighttime
they moved up to the top of their house where they were able to sit on the roof
and Mister and Missus Jones looked around
and they didnt see their daughter
their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddybear
and the water had already risen that high
so she had been swept away by the river
the parents suddenly realized
they heard a yelling and a screaming
they looked from the rooftop
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river
luckily with our technology the Jones had a cellphone
they dialed nineoneone and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out
they threw out a line across the river
it was secure
he climbed out clinging to the rope
and saw the Jones daughter
he reached down
grabbed her
she grabbed ahold of his arm
he wrapped a device around her waist to secure her body to his
and climbed back across the rope back to the riverside
Jessica was safe
the family were delighted to see that she was okay
but they learned a lesson
next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home
the end
alright
its a beautiful summer day and Sam was glad school was finally out
he did it what he loves most was was to play soccer
he took his ball out
and was kicking it along
walking along down his neighborhood street
when suddenly one swift kick
and crash the ball came crashing through his neighbors window
the neighbor is taken by surprise when the ball comes sailing in
and lands on his lap as hes relaxing on the couch
he picks up the ball
walks over to the window
and looks out
who couldve kicked that ball
he couldnt see anyone
must be that neighbor boy thats always out in the yard with his soccer ball
must be him
Im gonna call his parents immediately
first Im going to pick up my o pick up the glass off this couch
and get it cleaned up
and then Ill call them
and find out whats going on

Jl Rl

and Mister Smith says
ah yes

yes I found it in my living room
it came right through my glass
Mister Smith said
Ill take care of it
he calls his son
and says
James Rob are you missing your soccer ball
James said
no I have I have about ten soccer balls
if Im missing one I wouldnt really notice it
and his dad says
well our neighbor found one on his lap
it had sailed through his window
and he is livid because it broke his window
could that possibly be your ball
well no Dad
that couldnt possibly be my ball
I I I was out kicking the ball today
but I didnt dont remember it going through anybodys window
and he said
well thats a shame because they your initials are marked on the ball in the Sharpie
remember I reminded you to do that so you wouldnt lose them
and your initials are on the ball
oh oh well I was too afraid to tell anybody Dad
Im sorry
what can what should we do
and he said
well the first thing you needta do is to get some money from your piggy bank
and take it over
and offer to pay for his window
and then I think that you better apologize
and never kick the ball out near his yard again
okay Dad
thats what Ill do
sorry Dad
he said
well youve learned a lesson
next time an accident happens come straight to me and tell me
and well take care of it
but dont ever hide from your responsibilities
okay Dad

so the next day they went over to the neighbor or that evening excuse me they went over to the neighbors house
JamesRob brought his piggybank
and he said he was willing to pay for the broken window
and said how sorry he was
neighbor said

my homeowners socia my homeowners insurance covers it
I know it was an accident
I appreciate your honesty and your integrity for coming forth
by the way whens your next soccer game
Id really like to come see
youve got quite a kick
so all ended well for the family and the neighbor
the end

its eighty percent chance
no Mom Im not gonna take it
Jim decides to take off
hes not afraid of a little rain
he walks to school
drip drip drip
ohno mom was right

the rain got harder and harder
so Jim runs right back home
his mother is displeased because now hes going to be late for school
and he is soaking wet
Im not driving you to school

and you explain to the principal why youre late
so James takes his umbrella
walks on to school
ready to face the consequences of not listening to the good advice of his mother
the end
okay
there was a young woman and her father
and they lived in a town all alone
her mother had died
the father was lonely
and one day he met another woman
and decided to marry
make a new family
the woman had two daughters
and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created
well sadly the father died
leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and the two her two halfsisters
the stepmother was not happy about this
and she did not see Cinderella as her own
so she made her more of a house servant than a daughter
and she made her wait on her her two daughters
and clean house
and take care of them
Cinderella was not happy about this
but she felt like that was her destiny
so she cleaned and cooked and did everything that she was told to do
Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart
she made friends with the animals
they were her only friends
she was so busy
she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends
Cinderellas gentle heart would carry her a long way
she
lets see
lets back up a little bit
I aint
on the other side of of the town e was a castle
and throat the town was ruled by a king
the n this king had a son
and the son was of age to be married
they needed when he they needed a new heir to the throne
and if he wasnt married he could not become king
so the the th the king decided to throw a ball inviting all eligible young women
so he would have a large large number to pick from for his future bride
the invitations were delivered
and certainly the stepsisters were invited
infact every young eligible woman was invited
Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation
but the stepmother was not about to let her go
so she was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses
and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives
once in a lifetime opportunity
but she was unable to go
so off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball
and Cinderella stayed at home very sad very lonely
when suddenly some magical event appeared occurred
and the or her fairy godmother appeared
and said
do not cry
you can go to the ball
and Cinderella was very concerned about her dress
and the stepmother
and turned a pumpkin into a carriage
and the mice into horses
and Cinderella had was ready to go to the ball
but one warning she was given was
if you dont return before midnight everything all the magic wears off
your dress will become rags again
and your carriage will become a pumpkin again
and she said
dont worry stepmother s
I will
so she goes to the ball
has a wonderful time dancing with the prince
and he is entirely taken with her
noone knows who she is because shes never been dressed this way
the stepsisters didnt even recognize her
well its getting close to midnight
and Cinderella knows she must say goodbye
and the clock starts to strike
one two three four
all the way up until its almost twelve
and she flees
she tells the prince she hasta leave she hasta leave
she takes off
and as shes running away her clothes begin to change
yet one of her glash
she gets back to her house
and finds that she still has one of the glass slippers left
but she had a wonderful time
it was a wonderful memory
so magical she can hardly believe it happened
well the next day the king set out to n the king realized that his son said
I cannot I dont know who this young maiden is
Ill I dont know her from our town
Ive got to be able to find her
and so they sent out
I dont know what you would call them
sent out couriers to find out where this princess must live
she must live in the community
and the only way they know theyll know if shes the one is if the remaining glass slipper that was left on the stairwell would fit her
so the the princes men take the slipper and visit from house to house in the town
they come upon Cinderellas home
yet the stepmother in no way is going to allow Cinderella to try on the slipper
only she only wants her two stepdaughters
because she wants one of them to marry the prince
well both stepdaughters try on the the shoe
and ofcourse theyre trying to force it
but it does not fit them
Cinderella is able to escape from the locked room
and comes down
and they try on the the slipper
and ofcourse it fits
so the prince finds his princess
and they live happily ever after
ohgee
its a beautiful spring day
and the Carlson family are at home enjoying themselves
and suddenly they hear a meowing

okay well I had appendicitis
I felt really crappy the whole day
just thought it was stress
and left work early
it was a long drive home
by the time I got home I was in so much pain that I I just I couldnt handle it
my husband hadta go to work
fortunately for me I had a sixteen year old daughter who could drive
and she took me to urgent care
at urgent care they decided I had appendicitis
and admitted me to the hospital
they gave me something for the pain
gave me a little cup for the just in case for the nauseousness
and when and lets see they took some blood work
the next day they took more blood work
they decided
yep it was appendicitis
theyre taking my appendix out
they knocked me out cold thank goodness
took my appendix
and went home the next day
and I recouped for two weeks
and it is so good ta
yes
when I was a child a friend of the family was deaf
now as a kid you dont know too much
but we always made sure that we looked at him when we spoke to him because he read lips
and he had for school he had a big hearing aid thing
back then they were very big
subsequently after I moved down here I found out that he was able to have an operation
and get his hearing back
heard he went on to medical school
yeah
yes
yes
at the beginning
it was a regular night
we lived in a house that had an Arizona room
we got had the children in bed
and it was time for us to go to bed
through miscommunication I thought my husband locked the back door
from the Arizona room to the outdoors
he thought I had
wed gone to bed
and I woke up
I heard my husband whispering
I thought maybe he was talking in his sleep
but he grabbed my leg
and then I heard him say
yes hes in the house now
I heard that
and I got really scared
then he squeezed my leg even harder
this is while we lived in Tempe
right by the il ten over in the Peterson neighborhood
the Tempe police department were very prompt
not only did they have people in our
they had both sides
in a matter of minutes they also had a canine unit
and this man after having robbed us on a he was on a bicycle
the the canine took a bite outof crime
so they caught him
this was his third
and so we were good
it was youknow everything was most of the stuff was recovered
I hadta wait for some of it
but after that I think was when I was more scared because he went through our house
he looked in our childrens bedrooms
that was what if my kids would have woke up
youknow that was the scary part
what if theyd have woken up
what would he have done
but he wasnt a very smart
like I said on a bicycle
and then a couple of days later after talking to my neighbors he was going through the neighborhood
youknow
so from that day forward every every door in the house even after weve moved
and this has been a good nineteen years
yeah were still checking doors
there is a man and a woman
it looks as if the man is hanging on to a branch to rescue this young lady that is caught in the snow
possibly from an avalanche
the end
alright there is a little boy playing soccer
hes practicing
he practices his kicks
and the ball goes right into a window
breaks through the window
knocks over a lamp thats sitting on a table next to a man sitting in a chair
the man stands up holding the soccer ball and looks out the broken window
the end
a little boy is leaving the house with his backpack
and his mother is going to give him an umbrella
but he declines the umbrella
tells his mother
bye
starts to rain
doesnt have an umbrella
now its really raining
hes all wet
he comes home
and mother is looking very cross at her very wet son
and he gets the umbrella
and now hes drier
the end
story of Cinderella
Cinderella lived with her father and her dog
one day he brings home a new wife and her two daughters
now the father hasta go away and leave the stepmother in charge
her daughters the stepsisters are evil and mean
and the stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry
they get a notice because the prince hasta get married
and the king is just beside himself
he must find a wife
so theyre going to have a ball sothat he can pick out a wife
and Cinderella says
oh may I go too
well if you get all of your chores done
and then help your sisters get ready
then if you have any time you can go with us
so they give her all kinds of work to do
in meantime her little friends the mice help with getting her dress ready
now the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they dont want
theyre no good
so they take them and make her dress
she has this pretty little dress
and shes ready on time
the evil stepsisters take the the necklace and the ribbon and they just rip it right off of her dress
and off they go to the ball
Cinderella is very very sad
sitting outside crying to her mice friends and her dog
when her fairy godmother comes
and says
well you get to go to ball
and she puts her in this very pretty dress by magic
and turns the dog and the horse and the mice into a carriage and a footman and pretty horses
and takes her over to the ball
she looks very nice
she dances with PrinceCharming
they have a wonderful time
but she hasta be at back by midnight
so when the clock strikes twelve
she runs down the stairs but she loses a slipper
one of her glass slippers
she gets home just in time
but she hasta walk because the pumpkin the the carriage turned back into a pumpkin
the the horses turned back into mice
and the dog r the footman turned back into a dog
so then the I guess the the duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in this shoe
and asking all the maidens throughout the village
so they get to Cinderellas house
and the evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom sothat she cant try it on ju
and the oldest stepdaughter stepsister tries on the shoe and its too small
so they put it on the other stepsister and its too small
its like
this is the last house
we dont know what were gonna
in the meantime the mice get the key from the stepmother
and unlock the door
and Cinderella comes downstairs
and says
may I try
so she tries on the slipper
and ofcourse it fits
and she marries i PrinceCharming
and they live happily ever after
the end
mom had planned a birthday party
it was gonna be the fourth birthday party for her her youngest boy
she had set out a the most beautiful cake
well the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake
so he got himself a big mouthful
and got his paws into it too
and ran and hid underneath the sofa sothat the mom couldnt get at him with the broom
the little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined
and his mom was trying to hit his dog
in the meantime the guest started showing up at the door carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on
you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking two pieces of bread
you on one side you spread the peanut butter
and on the other side you spread the jelly
and then you put the two together
ohmy in about nineteen eighty four eighty five
its been a long time
I had my four
I had as a precaution I was taking a really large dose of penicillin sothat I wouldnt get an infection
because when I was seven years old I had rheumatic fever
youknow and they always told me
well your immune system isnt gonna be near as strong so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery including oral surgery
so I did that
and a that evening I early evening my throat swelled up
dont know if it was from the penicillin or what but I ended up back at the dentists office
and they ended up having to take some epinephrine
they gave me shots of epinephrine
I think two of them
and they also took a syringe
shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called g
they called it then angioneurotic edema but its since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called hereditary angioedema
the difference between
hereditary angioedema cannot
it hasta be the only thing that until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that during an episode was the epinephrine
during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up
just outof the clear blue
I went to urgent care
in urgent care they started an iv on me
and the doctor
I dont know if she was a doctor or a pa
anyway she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline
and anybody thats
it goes intermuscular
because it takes within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty beats a minute
in my case I think I went over two hundred
and I remember my it felt like
youknow at the base of my skull
just from so much pressure
and Id
Ive been knocked out once youknow playing football but I never passed out
and I knew I was gonna pass out
and I told the doctor that
and she said
okay lay back
so I I looked at her and said
I cant I cant
I dont dare
so she put her hands behind me
and at that point I dont know what was going on externally but internally I was fishing with my grandfather
and he was it was at a favorite fishing place that I that I had when I was growing up
and he was walking up the the stream bank wanting ta
and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him
and I said
I wanna go
I wanna go
no its not your time to go fishing with me
go home
so I woke up and later was told that
I I can recall actually I dont I dont know if this is something you want on tape or not but
I I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was ke looking at myself and looking at the doctor and youknow watching what they were doing
and it was like
jeez what are you doing to me
and then it hit me that
oh yeah theyre doing it to me
my wife hasta fill in the details youknow of other stuff that happened
but apparently they brought in the crash cart
and I guess youknow zapped me atleast once
I did come back
overall I was out for seven minutes
not breathing for seven minutes
and to this day have had little if any effects youknow aftereffects from that
youknow they they say seven minutes your brain is dead
well I have no idea why but it didnt affect me
not Im sure sometimes it effects me youknow in some of my memory but that could be aging too so
that is very vivid to me
the probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee who was actually hired for me
he came in as I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe and needed an assistant
the assistant was brought in
and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kindof looked at each other and said
what did he just say
hes Filipino
hes he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog
I dont know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently
theres alotof people that wouldnt give him the chance
and youknow I actually was doing some interpreting for him ca youknow at one time or another because I understood what he was saying
and that was to me it was probably the most difficult one that I hadta deal with
not because I didnt understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him
but I also spent some time in Mexico
and theres people down there that speak no English
so Ive youknow hadta adapt
and Ive learned to speak a little bit of Spanish
enough to get by
things like
gustans
or
dondes
youknow the important stuff youknow
the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico
and we were at the time wed been discussing this
and we were just standing in line at the movie theater
and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see
youknow to go to the the island of Cozumel and youknow travel around there a little bit
because theres some ruins there and its a really nice place
well the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there apparently was an ex marine or something
he was just perfectly built
and he had they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab theyd gotten near the port
I think they were doing one of the PrincessCruises or something
so theyd come into port and had been spent the day there
and then they hadta get back to the ship
so they hired a cab
well the cab starts going the other direction
and he kept telling him
no no no no youre going the wrong way
the ports over here
youknow
you needta go back this way
and he wouldnt stop
and he kept saying
not to worry
I know short cut
its okay
and he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop
and he and his wife just jumped outof the vehicle as it was moving
and people in the neighborhood that they were that they had jumped outof into started screaming about youknow at yelling for the federaless
so here we are
maybe a month away not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this
we get there to Cozumel
and soon as you get off the ferry theres all these cab drivers there
and wanting to youknow take you around the city or around the island
so this one n youknow kindof I dont know it was kindof like hey pick me
and and so we went over to him
and he says that oh yeah hed be glad to take us
and he says
Ill even give you a tour of the whole island
youknow
you can spend however long you want with me today
says youknow and he told us how much
and I cant even remember the amount
we get in the vehicle and
youknow we made the contract
we got in the vehicle
and right off the bat he takes off into the middle of town
dont worry
its okay
I just hafta stop and let the owner of the cab know where were going
so here I am with my wife and my sister inlaw
the three of us
and were sitting there
the sister inlaw is just in Lalaland like
hey this is just great
youknow this is fantastic
we paid this much money which was nothing for a cab for all day
and were gonna go see this youknow this island
and this guy goes in into its basically a bar
and my wife and I are going
ohmygod
this is it
were gonna were either gonna be abducted or were gonna be killed right here
well come to find out the guy was just going in to tell the cab the owner of the cab because apparently they owned it it was coownership
so he went in to tell the other guy that
hey dont worry about using the cab because Im using it for the day
and he was a very good tour guide
very good to us all day
but it was like I said it it was scary there for quite awhile
well it was the great flood of nineteen eighty
and people were doing such foolish things
but in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people
putting their lives on the line
we have a firefighter that jumped in the water to save a little girl who was about to drown
and he held onto her until other help could get there to help get her outofthe the water the swirling water
surely she would have died if he hadnt been there to help her out
well Danny was out playing soccer in the front yard
and hed been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well
so he gave it a boot one time
and he actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it
and it went over and hit the window of the the house nearby
and broke the window
and fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair
the father of the house
when they when he approached when it fell on his lap he was startled
and got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from
but ofcourse the little boy had run away
well it was a cloudy day
and mother had watched the or heard the news the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day
so when I was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella
and I said
oh mom its not gonna rain today
I have my backpack
if anything happens I can hold it over my head
and I wont get as wet
so Im not gonna take the umbrella
Ill be fine
I no sooner got down the road then wouldnt you know loandbehold it started to rain
the rain turned into a torrent
and I was actually getting very soak soaked from head to toe
my backpack was wet
my shoes were even wet
I got back to my to the house
and my mom looked at me and didnt say a word
but she knew
after changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack I headed out again on my way to school
this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain
the story of Cinderella
once upon a time in a land far far away
there was a young girl whose parents had died
she had an aunt but her aunt was a very bitter person
so she and the children her children her daughters were living in the house
but Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid
she hadta keep the house cleaned up no matter what
as she grew older she grew more and more beautiful
but even as beautiful as she was she was still just the housemaid
the other girls grew up
they werent near as beautiful as she was
in the meantime the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married
and to do that he wanted ta
he sent out invitations to all the the influential people within the land that they would could attend the ball
Cinderellas mother
and had decided to send her two daughters
Cinderella said
well can I also go
and they and her mother said
no you cant
youre to stay here and keep this place clean
so while she was doing that she was became a little bit disconcerted
and her all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball
because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her
and she asked what she really wanted
and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball
so her fairy godmother waved her wand
and gave her the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear
to take her off to the ball she hadta have a coach
so she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin
she turned the pumpkin into the coach
and the mice who were friends of and playmates of Cinderella were there to draw the coach
and the cat was there to to guide the coach
they get to the ball
and Cinderella meets the prince

and the prince doesnt wanna see anyone else
he is enjoying himself so much
but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight you will become the same Cinderella that you were before
no matter where you are you needta be you needta come home
so as this clock was striking d the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince
on her way out she lost her slipper one of her glass slippers
she got to her coach
and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin
and turned and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat
she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again
as it turned
the prince was so excited about this pretty young women that he wanted to meet her
he had kept the the glass slipper
and knew that he hadta see her again
so he sent out a decree to look for the young woman whose who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper
that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her
all of their all of the women the young women decided to go and try the slipper but none of them could make it fit
including her sisters
so eventually she was able to go and see the prince
and try on the slipper
and the prince announced that he this was the woman that he would marry
and they all lived happily ever after
www
well at the very beginning there was a bird that was hopping around in the yard

and the neighbors dog chased the cat up the tree
the bird was in the tree
the cat was in the tree
the little girl called for her father
and he came over with a ladder
and got up in the tree to try and get the cat down

okay the first thing you do is find a spot to make it by the sink thats clean
second thing is you get a a towel
or a dish
youknow youknow a hand towel
then the third thing you do is you go out you get a knife from the drawer
have that there
then you go to refrigerator
choose bring out take out the loaf of bread
take out the butter or Oleo whatever it may be
take the bread and Oleo over there
and then you take then you go to your cupboard
get the peanut butter
and maybe you want jelly so you bring jelly along also
but you didnt ask for jelly
so anyway you then you then take a piece of bread outof the outof the bag
put in on the plate or on a paper towel
I use a paper towel
you then open a butter
I use its like butter
its a bucket kind of thing
open open it up
take the knife
however if youre very conscious of your lo cholesterol and so forth you dont use butter
but I dont care
you put it on the bread
then you take some peanut butter
you take the lid off the peanut butter jar
and you then put peanut bunner
fold it in half and eat it
when youre done youre gonna put the lid back on the peanut butter
you put the lid back on the butter
put the peanut butter away
you put the butter away in the refrigerator
put the bread away in the refrigerator
and you take the the towel or the dish whichever you whatever you put the you made the sandwich on
and you dump the crumbs in the fri in the sink
put the dish you wash the dish off
you wash the knife off
you dry them and put them back where they were
a flower in a garden
okay the first thing you do is go buy a flower
in order to plant one you hafta have buy
so you go to HomeDepot
you buy a flower
but as youre buying a flower you wanna also buy some mulch sothat
because when you put a flower in
youre gonna put the you dig a hole in the in the dirt
and the dirt depending on where you live
if you live in Arizona dirt is hard around here so you want the dirt to be soft and you want it to be irrigated so to speak so you wanna mix the dirt you wanna mix mulch with the dirt
so you take the
and you wanna make sure you have a a shovel to dig a hole
so you take all that equipment home with you
you find a spot where you wanna put the flower
and you dig the hole
you pour the mulch in
you mix the dirt with the with the mulch
make sure its mixed well
then you then you dig a hole dig take part of that out
and you you
well some people would just dig dig the hole and put the plant in there and then fill the fill it with mulch around there
and thatd be the other way to do it is just dig the hole and put the plant in the hole
and fill it with mulch
and then and then put the dirt on top of that
take a hose or take some water
put water in there
and then put the rest of dult
put the rest of the dirt dirt in there
and then wash off the tool
put it back put it away
and thats it
okay this is this is a story about a the fact that Im gonna have a party for my children
and Ive and Ive cleaned the house and decorated the house and and got everything set up
and the people start to arrive
so and the as they come in I notice that the cake has got a piece outof it
and loandbehold the dog is there underneath
and Im giving the dog what what for
and Steven Steven is my son is is telling me that theres guests have arrived
but Im so focused on the dog I could care less because he ruined my setup and ruined my cake
you wanna hear it
well theres
but the one Ill tell you is the is
I was at church
I help at at church giving out daily mass of Catholic
and I am Im a minister plus I I set up the altar and everything for the priest
and on AshWednesday about three years ago I set up and I was giving communion
and I held a pat
and my arm just dropped
and somebody was there to fortunately catch it
and it turns out that I found out I had AL ALS
I have ALS here to here
and Im not able to hold anything in my arm like this
I have a very difficult time
so thats thats what happened
okay
tu what the situation was hadta do with my wife my second wife
shes lovely absolutely lovely woman
and we got we ended up getting a divorce
however after my divorce I went to a a thing at a seminar at a place called LandmarkEducation
and I learned about
it was a weekend seminar started on Friday Friday morning and went through Sunday night
there was about a hundred and twenty five of us there
there was about fifteen men and a hundred some odd women
mostly maybe not exactly that but it was that kind of proportion
and I was I was Id felt very very kindof down after my divorce
and I had prayed and this was kindof a the Lord leading me to this session
so I listened
and I listened alot
and the conversation dealt with abandonment
and it turns out that in summary I think most women I think its fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do
and and I learned very significant things about the abandonment and how people feel and learned that you hafta forgive an abandonment
but I also learned that what you
this was reinforced
Id been I was told by a priest back in the seventies that when your wife speaks to you just listen
and when you what you remember is one or two things is whats important
dont solve every problem
well this reinforced that
and its very p
women have a
thats why if you go back to that story I mightve said this
women have a a need more
men do too but they dont they dont verbalize it
but women verbalize it alot more an
when things build up after a day they have a needta come home and dump
they do
and they need somebody to listen
they dont need any of the dialogue on it or not but they need somebody to listen
so I learned to to just sit and listen
and what I remembered from it is to then afterwards after partners finished what you remember one or two things you you talk about that
and then your partner is is pleased because then you that shows that youve listened to them
and thats makes more effective communication
hope you listened
okay when I was I believe around seven years old maybe it was five or six I m this this
what happened in this occurrence has affected my life because I ended up being claustrophobic
and when I was when I was six or seven I had the doctor said I hadta have my tonsils out
so I went to this place
and I forget where
but I remember laying on the on the table and then doctor coming in with the masks
and I and I fought the whole thing
and my tonsils came out
everything worked out alright
but I Ive came to realization that of that when I tried to do scuba diving and I couldnt do it
I couldnt handle it the mask and the underneath

in this particular situation theyre playing soccer
and the boy kicks the soccer ball
and it obvious sometimes the ball doesnt go where he wants it to go
and this one flew into a persons house into his window

and he looked outside to find who did it
and by definition he was gone
this one deals with a a little boy going off to school
its a cloudy day
hes got his backpack on
and and his mother wants him to take the umbrella in case it rains
he says

she is touched by a fairy godmother
and and while theyre at the at the
everybody leaves to the ball
while theyre at the ball shes touched by the fairy godmother

and the fantasy comes back
and shes all dressed up

this picture is centered around the fact that the family cat went up to the tree
and dad wanted to get the cat down from the tree
so he gets the ladder
put it up in the tree
and goes starts goes up in the tree after the cat
loandbehold the dog the family dog is comes out

the cat is stuck in the tree
and mom went and called the fire department
they arrived with their ladder and their truck their truck and their ladder
and theyre gonna come theyre gonna end up going in the tree saving saving dad giving and probably bringing the cat down
okay
it looked like this little girl was out riding a bicycle
and she happened to look up and see a cat in the tree
now the cat might have been up at the tree because he saw
but thats what hafta be happening
and I guess the father came by with a short ladder and tried to help
and he got up in the tree
the ladder fell over
and he was stuck there
and the little dog who happened to be out walking with the father at the time is at the tree barking to help his father
and the two firemen came to the scene
and they have a better ladder
and theyre going to go up and rescue the cat
and the little girl can then go on and continue her bicycle ride
and get the father down off the tree
and he can continue his walk with the dog

it looks like the river as was frequent at this time of the year has risen above its banks
and in one section this little girl got trapped
she was probably with her mommy or her daddy in the car or with a friend playing on the banks and fell in
and the river is with a xxx coming down
and she managed to hang onto a branch a little thicket
and while she hung onto that branch people had noticed her
and they called the fireman
now the fireman with great great courage went out into the water to save the young girl
came out to the branch
picked her up
tied them to tied a rescue line
put a safety jacket on her
as you can see
the harness that will go on her with her safety jacket
tied a rope to it
and then they pulled both the fireman and the young girl to safety
young boy was out practicing his soccer balls and kicks and everything else and
like anything else that happens with a young boy and a pane of glass and a sports object you know the pane of glass is gonna get broken
and bam there it goes
it not only breaks the ball when he kicks it not only breaks the window
it also knocks over the lamp
and disturbs the father
or worse yet it could be the neighbor next door who wasnt a very nice person
but they pick up the ball
and he says
Im going out and straighten this mess out
young boy is on his way off to school
and hes now hes in second grade

well the story starts with Cinderella being into with her father there
and I guess the mean old aunt came in
with the two horrible two beyond despicable daughters
they were terrible
they just looking at her as a downgrade
and eventually while the fathers away the aunts running the house
and Cinderella then becomes a servant
she hasta cater to them feed them clean the house wash their things

she cant do nothing about it because Daddys gone
and theres nothing we can do about that
and then allofasudden the aunt gets an invitation to the great ball
or the king was saying to the before that time the king was saying to the son
you hafta have this ball
and you should find your princess that were looking forward to all your life
you get to be an old man
and he sent out invitations to all eligible ladies to attend the ball
so they sent out the invitations
and the aunt read the invitation
and heres Cinderella thinking that shes gonna become going to the ball
and she found this old dress and laid it out
and reading about the ball and everything else like that
and all of the friends that she got to know being in the house the mices and the meeses
they all got together
and they fixed the dress up adorable
and they
and the princess tried it on

and they took the jewelery
and they took the dress
and they says

and when she went to the ball and the prince saw her he was so taken with her that he spent the whole night dancing with her and having such a wonderful time
and unbeknownst to her but those two sisters or cousins or whatever they were stepsisters
they were so upset and depressed
and theyre squawking and everything else like that
and being that shes having a wonderful time
she forgot to notice the thing
and then allofasudden the clock strikes twelve
the first tick goes off
and she says
oh I must go
and the prince says

and she runs down this great staircase of red velvet carpet
it was wonderful
but she lost one of her slippers one of the glass slippers
and she ran home
and when she got home the only thing she had left was one slipper
but it will always be the memory that she was there
and she did this thing
and it was so great
but then the king yeah the young prince realized that this slipper belonged to the woman he wanted to marry and to be his princess forever
so he says
we will go scour the valley
and get everyone who was invited to the ball
and whosever foot fits this slipper becomes the queen
and he comes on
and he tries it onto the other big footed stepsister
and she was nowheres near it

and theres the slipper on her

today is Timmys birthday
a very large party has been planned
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy
and good friends were invited over
well somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after of the cake after climbing up onto the table
mom sees this and is very very upset
very frustrated
and grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy
to see this cake having much much less than its sposta have
first you
lightly toast them
bring the peanut butter and jelly to the table
apply jelly to one side
and peanut butter
and then bringing them together sothat the jelly and the peanut butter meet
put them together
and eat it
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the px
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck was kept up
and there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible
but this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck
and as I left by kicking my left leg up and over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed of the truck
I was lightly tupped
because I had only been moved about a an inch and a half
if I had had this awareness it wouldve been much easier for me to push away from the truck and sustain less injury than I had
as that my left leg was kicked up and about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries Ive ever had
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate
then falling down further the back of the bed
then the bumper
and in my attention anyhow almost eons later after I had thought that the last of the contusions were occurring the same spot on the under side of my left calf hit the the r the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle
the bed of the of the vehicle itself just
and coming down underneath
well this hit in the same spot one two three four
and I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries
at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle
and their discretion chose to take me to the hospital
and theyre my drill sergeants so I let them do that instead of saying its just a sprained ankle
and finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop
well I immediately went into shock
and being in basic training there is much suggestion to do as one is told
and a myriad manner of forms directly and indirectly
so my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and damage that I had just gone through
I actually hadta walk the next morning to the clinic on a very very swollen calf
so swollen infact that I was unable to take the bdus which are the battle dress uniform
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants from being able to be lifted up
my calf was so swollen
unfortunately that was the major holiday of that whole fort
combination of its anniversary and FourthofJuly
so the crew at the clinic on that Saturday
which then being a Saturday busses never ran so I hadta walk about two and a half miles on that condition
did a very cursory and less than effective look at my injury
and described me as rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches
the next and without and
the next day because it was a holiday and through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given kp duty
and the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing kp because everyone else had been working
and I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself
I was in shock continually this entire time
so I never volunteered for any of the kp duties
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and sprained almost knee
well regardless to say as I got back on Monday the staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physicians assistant
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms
and pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies
and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic
yes
actually I
for the last year Ive been a life coach for a developmentally disabled man where I live
and his developmental disablement has come about because of actual large set of circumstance
traumatic psychological and physiological experiences have pretty much left him with the mental state a mental emotional state of a very high strung five year old
and various communication miscues
and the lack of my focus to make sure
and to to better his activities has created a a very large
and at this moment I have hadta disconnect from being a life coach for this individual
in the past reiterations and nonreactive acceptance of whatever form of communication this individual has relayed
and then full discourse about the perspectives and the the missing pieces of the the sides of the total experiences happening
repeatedly and calmly delivered to this gentleman has helped
though current situations and my own revealing of larger circumstance has led me to necessitively
yes
the only only thing thats coming up to my mind right now was a trip to HooverDam when I was young
and I had at that time my st my youngest sister
she was about four and a half
well there was this this very r we went on a tour in HooverDam
and and saw all all the insides
well when we got back up as I as I looked out across the bridge and saw the very very deep hole
when the water gets too high
I got an immediate sensation of fear
prolly
and I immediately saw my sister
and I just felt horrible of about potential of her being drug down
and then spit out the side
because this thing this thing is about a a good hundred yards wide and very very very deep
and it just gave me this ominous sense of of lack and and grief
there was much much rain
so much more than ever before that a flood occurred
and began sweeping away houses and people
a young girl was trapped in this flood
and she caught on to part of a tree
and held on for dear life
rescue workers came
and one man with a lifejacket and silver harnesses was dropped from a helicopter into the flood reaching the girl
but then helped her to put the harness on
and be brought back away from the flood itself to safety
a young boy was outside practicing soccer
unfortunately he made a very large mistake and kicked the ball too hard
the ball flew into the neighbors yard
breaking the window
knocking over a lamp
and very very much scaring the man sitting inside watching the television
the man grabs the soccer ball
goes to the window
and looks out to see the little boy is gone
a young boy is on his way to to school
and his mother offers him an umbrella which he refuses
she is clearly troubled that he has refused but lets him go
as he walks out oh down the road it starts to rain
he realizes his mistake covers his head and runs back to the house
mother sees him and tells him
and gives him the umbrella
which then he uses to walk to school staying after he has been dried dry

without bothering to stop them at all
Cinderella is distraught with grief
and as the stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball she runs out to the garden

and sh
and is something else than a magnificent woman of elegance

youll probably laugh because this is kindof a unique story
I I once owned two blacktailed prairie dogs
and we some friends of ours liked our prairie dogs so much that two
so we had
and then one of them was going outof the country and needed us to watch their m their prairie dogs
and so we did
and one of them was a male
and he was alittle aggressive
and he didnt like me very much
and so I was trying to
and so I was trying to pet him
and I was rubbing his chin
and he was getting all
and I really didnt read the warning sign very much
and he bit me
and took out a good chunk of my
so so Im actually home alone
and I
and I can see
its pretty good bite
and I realize well
I should probably not I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it
and I I dont always do well with the sight of my own blood
ke I have no
but I got
and then like
ohboy what do I do
so ironically or
so I hadta wrap
and interrupt her class
and to get her
and so I was standing there when she
youknow Im standing there
Im like
the prairie dog bit me
can you drive me to the urgent care
and shes like
okay
so she hasta
and then I get to urgent care for stitches
and prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona
I had bought it in Texas
and you can also buy them in Washington state
but theyre theyre considered restricted wildlife here
and so I hadta completely lie about the entire
because they ask you how you got the bite and was it an animal and whatever
and I hadta
they probably would have come and taken the prairie dogs away
so allofasudden it became a like I think I said a a ferret
because youre allowed to have ferrets here
a ferret bite
anyway thats my experience
my grandmother whos almost eighty is in a nursing home
and shes slowly been losing her mental
and Im actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama
and so every time I visit her Im never quite sure what mental state shell be in whether she recognizes me
she she usually she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year
and those people that she doesnt
so usually sometimes Im me her grandson
but other times Im other grandsons who see her more often
and so so you just hafta sortof its easier to just sorta
and get her youknow sortof force her to realize who you really are
so youre so you just sortof play along
and you basically just ask her how shes doing
and she kindof makes stuff up or doesnt make alotof sense
although Imean you can under you can she
and you can understand what shes saying
its just that the its not coherent sometimes
and so you just kindof hafta take it as it goes and stay for about ten fifteen minutes
and then then you leave
and its kindof sad
but I think she atleast is somewhat happy to have a visitor
so theres some solace in that
this is when my parents were still married
and we were I was a little
I was probably like seven
and we were all camping at a lake in north of Dallas
and wed all gone to bed for the night
and were
and a really bad storm came
we were camping
ke in
and a really bad storm came that night
and the winds really picked up
and blew the tent started to blow the tent
off its
and actually started rolling all the way
so we were all in the tent
and it was ke rolling
and as it broke
and
and and my moms screaming
and my dads freaking out
and
I probably would have handled it different now as an adult
but as a kid its really traumatic when you dont know
and everythings
and and it stopped
it ke
and my dad was able
luckily we never got in the water
and he was able
but then but then everything
but we couldnt really leave that night
and there was some
so my dad sat up all night just to
and and it was just a really bad camping experience
and luckily I we kept going and I had better experiences so Im not afraid of camping anymore
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid
Im going to assume Ill Ill say this is this takes place in Arizona
and unfortunately Imean it was in monsoon season
and there was a huge storm
and caused what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent
and this poor woman decided that while she had gone that way home every day
and she really needed to get home to
and she was determined to get there across the wash that she crosses every day
but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash
and didnt make it but a few feet
and the water started surrounding her car and pushing it around and flooding her car
and she
she couldnt go reverse to get back
and started to tumble the car
and she managed to get her window down
and get on top of the car
and waved to some people that were on the bank to call nineoneone and
a rescue crew came out
and she was able to well she got right as they got there the water got higher
and she got swept off the top of her car
and it was floating downstream
and they were able to shimmy out on a a limb
and she was able to get close enough to him
and they were able to grab her and pull her to safety
and she was okay
Bobby is home from school

today is Johnnys eighth birthday
and all of his friends from school are coming over to sing happy birthday and have a piece of birthday cake with him
as when mommy and Johnny stepped outof the kitchen they walk back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake taken chunk there was a big bite taken outof the cake
and they looked to see that the prints led right to the dog under the couch
mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnnys guests arrive
and Johnny cried
the guests as the guests walked in they said
ohmy
what are we gonna do now
but the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything
so the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home
in fourth grade I was outside during recess in NewYork
and as you may or may not know they have we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city
we dont have a playground
so they put up the barriers
and all the cars are there and everything and youre playing in the street
so I was standing against one of the cars
and a friend of mine ran right into me
and my wrist went right around the the rear view mirror and broke
so they called my mom
and my mom came
and I was just crying
and she rushed me to the doctor
we took I think we took the bus because she didnt wanna pay for an ambulance
so Im in pain on the bus
Im crying
Im trying to keep it still
and we got to the hospital and they hadta put a cast on me
and that was my first time having a cast
and got back to school and all my friends signed it
and so that was cool
and the part that I didnt like so much was when it itched inside
and so I remember one time my mom used ke one of the straws from the broom to try and itch
and it broke in there
so then that was even more annoying because I couldnt get to to it
and that was about all I remember about that
and I
oh and then I remember using it as a weapon too
if somebody bothered me Id hit them with it
but then I would feel it too
so
yeah that was my first experience with a cast
as far as language barriers or
Im sure I have
I cant think of anything off the top of my head though
language yes
sure
well most recently youknow when we call to pay a phone bill or something we get somebody in another country
and so alotof times ke they cant pronounce our names
so well be like are you first we hafta figure out if theyre calling the right house
and then youknow after they say it a few times then we do understand
and just to switch really quick
actually when weve called to get help with ke computer service or something thats when it becomes a really it becomes difficult because were trying to first understand what theyre saying and then do what theyre saying and trying to figure out if they understand what were asking what for we need
so yeah thats a interesting experience
plenty
scared

mhm

I grew up in NewYork the first part of my life
and so in NewYork it was like youknow you dont trust anybody you dont go with any strangers youknow everybodys bad in NewYork
we had the completely different view of California
California was like this fantasy land youknow awesome place to be you can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody
so when we moved here or when we moved to California from NewYork I would sometimes walk home from the babysitters or what have you
and one time this man stopped
and he was like
do you need a ride
and I was like it was one of those days where it was the evening was coming and bats were ke flying around
and I was like
ohmygosh
Im so scared

so it was like a godsend when he stopped youknow
I was like
oh okay

I dont hafta deal with these bats
and Im thinking
well every and everybody in were Im in California so this person cant possibly do me wrong
so I get in the car
and Im driving
and its like
how are you and youknow whats your name and where do you live
and then it then it just started getting weird when I said

and he said
well Im gonna make a left
and Im like

and so I just prayed at that point ke that he would go right go towards my house
and he was like

and so he turned right
and then I said
heres my street

and I anything I didnt know what was gonna happen at that point
he pulled up in front of my house
and he was still kindof rolling
and I just kindof opened the door and just kindof jumped outof the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house
and nobody was home
so then Im knocking on the door
and the suns going down
and Im like
ohgosh what if hes ke just still ke right there waiting for me
and so when I thought he was gone I ran over to my neighbors house which is my youknow my best friends house at the time and stayed there until I knew my mom was home

Cinderella was a little girl who became an orphan at a young age
her uncle decided to take her to live with who later became her stepmother and two stepsisters
as the years went on Cinderella was treated poorly by her stepsisters and her stepmom
they would make her clean wash all the dishes clean the floors wash their clothes scrub the floors do everything that they didnt wanna do and treat her badly
then they got an invitation to go to the ball
and Cinderella and her mom her stepmom and stepsisters were all invited
and so right away all her little friends the little animals decided to sew her a beautiful gown
and the Cinderella was so excited about it and going to the ball
and then her stepmom dropped the bomb and said
and youre going to cook and youre going to clean and youre going to make sure that this house is spotless by the time we get back
so Cinderellas spirits were down immediately
she was really looking forward to going
and she was sitting there crying
she was sitting there crying and then along comes the fairy godmother to save the day
and she touches Cinderella with her wand and shes in a beautiful gown
and then she touches the pumpkin and it turns into a beautiful chariot with horses
and off Cinderella goes to the ball
unbeknownst to her stepmother and sisters Cinderellas at the ball dancing and having a ball having fun and dancing with the prince
and then she turns around
and the clock strikes twelve or one
I cant remember
and she says
so she runs out the door and she loses a slipper but she still has one on
so she gets home
and shes thinking about how wonderful the ball was
and then a knock comes at the door
and they say
and we dont know who it belongs to
so were going around town letting all the ladies try them on to see who it belongs to because that will be who the prince marries
and so Cinderellas listening
and shes hoping that she gets to try the shoe on
and her stepmom is like
she wasnt there
and so they try it on her

they took the book the boy and his two friends and the mothers out to the amusement park for the day and were planning to come back home to celebrate later
in order to prepare for the party the mother had baked a three layer cake and was really excited that that the the boy would like it
however when they came home from the park they found a bad surprise
the dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing and the crumbs all through the house
so when they got home the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with a broom
youre not gonna believe me
but anyway two weeks ago I was Saturday night two weeks ago on a Saturday evening about six pm I started feeling a stomach ache I thought or like a side stitch
throat ironically enough the pain started to travel down my back
I could feel it moving
it wasnt a muscle I could
Im Im much a sportsman enough to know that it wasnt a muscle
it wasnt a bone
something was really weird and it was moving
they were kidney stones eventually I found out
but I remember thinking
I dont have yet insurance here
and Ive just moved back
and I havent been to a hospital here in twenty years
this is going to be really horrible
and and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where throat I had a fever of a hundred and one or something and just was doubled over and couldnt even and couldnt even really stand as this thing was making its way down
so we went to the hospital
and the first thing I walked in and I said
Im sorry bring you a bad news
and the woman said
why
did my husband die
thats the receptionist
I said
thats a good joke
but anyway I dont have insurance
and she said
thats no problem
thats youre gonna get a come on in
and I remember thinking
okay this is gonna be alright
three hours later after some medicine and vomiting atleast forty times because of the intense pain the most intense pain Ive ever had in my life
just imagine ke stones going through that little opening
sorry
and whew
suddenly and I was having to use a little strainer thing and seeing them come out
and oh
and then for about a day the blood and everything else
but I was amazed the body and how
and once and once they told me what it was I read a little bit about and realized its not such a simple thing and how often we dont realize it
so water
people drink colas and
coffees colas bubble gas drinks are the worst
and then red meat is another bad one because they dont end up being digested
so I learned
and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasnt even vomit I thought
my my throats going to come out because of the convulsions were so strong
and I just remember thinking
my wife and son are coming next week
and ohmygod here I am in the hospital
so I was really I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it
except for the first time in my life ever
not death but enough to the point where something seriously wrong here
that that was the point of my story
I Ive never had that
at forty eight years old Im too young for this
in nineteen ninety six I was living in Japan
and I was contacted by a local city
a city named Uwajima which is very near where my wifes traditional home town is in the mountains of a small village area
their local high school fishing cooperative ship kindof like the sail USA or go around the world
up the submarine came up
this went on for months
and the Japanese government demanded an apology
the US government didnt wanna apologize nor the xxx of the US Navy
at the end of the day they didnt know what to do
at the local government some friends of a friend of a friend of a friend found me and said
we are not able to communicate with them
can you please explain to me what the difference is to an American of Im sorry
what does excuse me mean
I am talking about having a meeting with the secretary of the Japanese selfdefense
so kindof a secretary of defense who I would never normally meet
and the mayor two congress people or parliament members
sorry
and about forty very very very pissed off Japanese parents who had lost children wanting demanding to understand what the English concept or the western concept was Im sorry
I hadta prepare a presentation for this
and then I thought
how am I going to explain what is Im sorry
its like movies and songs we use this so often
yet it it has very very traditional deep meanings and depending on the level of the insult sh perceived or injury perceived or not there are different ways to apologize in Japanese and all cultures
as we we have levels of formality
anyway my next job was then I was to go to the US Navy representative through the US Embassy to ask could they apologize
Im not a diplomat and I dont pretend to be
but I was also in the US Navy
so one thing led to another and I met with the people
I was flown over to Hawaii with several of these Japanese to act as an intermediary watching these two groups try to communicate over a week period over something that was just the most absolutely dreadful topic for them
dead school children
clearly a mistake by one an accident
and how do you get beyond it
all they wouldve been happy with if that captain of the US Navy had l if the US Navy had allowed the captain to do what he wanted
he wanted to apologize but he was not allowed
he was prohibited
US government policy
thats fine
but because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing the communication never developed
two years after the man was fired
the captain
he came back to that area by himself his wife and his children and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the US government even more angry
so I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends the Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends but what was caught in the middle were some families and a truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble
stupid
""
when my wife was seven months pregnant we got news from her family that her mother inlaw was dying of intestinal cancer
we were living away from them at the time
we were living in Japan
excuse me
we were living in Germany but they were back home in Japan
the my wifes pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy
and it was her first child
so I hadta go back to represent her in the Japanese mind anyway for my wife and I to see the mother inlaw
in a period of three months I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about
the biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die
I talked to the doctor
but the father didnt know
they kept that information from the father
they didnt wanna tell him
Ive never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying
the mother didnt know she was dying
so I was afraid that my wife couldnt get home
the sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary
and I will never be able to answer that question of what if
so that to me is a scared situation that I clearly remember
okay
after a series of unusually late spring excuse me late winter early spring storms and a very quick warm warming period the rivers and and the local area overflowed
there were flash floods and several people were trapped or swept away
in this case the a young woman was trapped in the river and holding on to a tree for probably a very long time
she looks tired and very nervous and distressed
and it looks as though that the rescue services or fire technician or whomever seemed to have arrived
its obviously very industrial
and there is two of them
and also the color of the vest
and that this man risked his life in order to save this womans life
okay
the boy is is on his has put on his backpack and is on his way out the door to school as usual
and his his mother is suggesting very strongly
please take the umbrella today
that I watched the news and I saw that there will be rain showers later
and the boys saying
no thankyou
its not going to rain
he then goes out the door and turns to say goodbye to his mother but shes reminding him one more time
are you sure
and hes
no
see you later
goodbye
well sure enough mother knows best
just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour
and the boy was running back home to get his umbrella
when he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him
I told you
and he then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school
nothing that any other boy probably hadnt done in their life
the young boys in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window
well in the tradition of good old story books once upon a time there was a huh what landowner well well endowed family who adopted a little girl
the little girl came into a family in which the mother and the two sisters the two daughters pardon me did not really appreciate having her around
and as she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse
but she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself
throat one day after
excuse me
the in the in the castle there was a prince and a king
and the king was adamant that his son get married and had been insisting and insisting
and in order to help the son decide who might be a f an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a dance
invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom
one day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that I mentioned
and the mother and the evil sisters were all happy to realize and think
heres our chance
one of us we can get married to this handsome prince
and so they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would go to the party
and meanwhile Cinderella had been listening and thinking
oh thats too bad
she was very sad about herself
but and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book
and throat one thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help Cinderella realize her dreams
she tried to create a dress and give hope to Cinderella that she too could have a better life
unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what Cinderella had been hoping
and they ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others
so Cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made Cinderella to be a very very attractive woman
on the eve of the on the night of the dance Cinderella attended the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person
noone could recognize that it was Cinderella because indeed she had changed so much
however the fairy godmother had reminded Cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because thats when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be revert to their original shape or character
so at the stroke of midnight Cillarella
he then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman mystery woman
he carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom
when he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where Cinderella lived he ofcourse wanted to have everyone try it on
and ofcourse the mother tried but it didnt fit
and the sisters tried and the shoe didnt fit
and Cinderella tried and it fit
and from then on love took over
and they lived happily ever after
yesterday I was watching the news when I saw this crazy story
turned out that this man was going to help his cat that was stuck up in the tree
so he took the ladder out
and the daughter was very happy that they were gonna be able to save the cat
but once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down
and the girl started panicking
so she ran and called her mother
and the mother called the fire department
and the fire department came to help him down
well its birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old
and maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite outof cake which he obviously knew he wasnt sposta do because hes hiding under the couch
and the boys crying
and the mother is waving the broom threateningly
and the guests are looking alittle startled
and thats the end of that
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich
get hafta get two pieces of bread
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top
and put them together
well this is fairly minor but many years ago I was when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was cleaning a glass
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand
and it it started to bleed all over the place
but I was also pregnant at the time
and I dont know if that had something to do with it
but I had this weirdest feeling
and my husband came in and I just passed out
it was the first and last and only time Ive ever done that
I guess the most the time the most of the instances Ive had with people that have trouble communicating its usually more of a language barrier
I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man who had a stutter
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too
but youknow I found it so hard to to talk to him that I tended to avoid him in a way
so I cant say that I really otherthan saying hi Julio how are you I never really went much beyond that
and plus at the time I couldnt excuse me I couldnt hear well
so I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway
so
thats about it
one time I was just moseying down the street in a car and was preparing to turn left
and I thought I had my signal on
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough
but then somebody else who I dont even know where he came from I think he was walking outof the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something
thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didnt youknow wasnt upset
he just said
oh I ran into you
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness
oh apparently this girl has fallen into some water thats maybe theres a flood or a storm
and a man is trying to rescue her
apparently shes been holding onto a tree branch
and hes trying to get a hold of her
but she wont let go of the tree branch probably
about all I can say
well hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window
its really improbable
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp
but obviously the boy has ran away because the man cant see him when he goes in at the window
this is kindof improbable too
the mother wants to give the the boy an an umbrella
he doesnt want it
so he goes off and gets wet
this is the improbable part
he doesnt like getting wet
he runs back to his mom whos mad
and hes wet so he takes the umbrella
now my son would love getting wet
looking at that I can hear the music from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old
Cinderella is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother
wicked and stepmother always go together
she has two ugly st two ugly stepsisters
I cant remember their names
one of them is Drizella or something equally ugly
anyway Cinderella is forced forced to work like a drudge for the the rest of the family who are cruel to her
but an edict comes from the
I think Im spinning tales here
an edict comes from the prince that theyre going to have a ball
and every maiden is eligible to go to the ball
but Cinderellas mother stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready
and at last the girls drive away in their carriage and Cinderellas left behind crying in the cinders
then the little mice come to her aid and start
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working
and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because yeah they didnt want her to go
so then the fairy godmother enters the picture
this is not in sequence at all
and ofcourse she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the the pumpkin carriage
oh yeah
and she goes off to the ball where ofcourse she is the bell of the ball meets the prince
the prince falls in love with her on sight
but at twelve oclock she hasta run off
she leaves her slipper
I guess that story goes all the way to the end
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they dont fit
so he find m
heres one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree
and then this the the father has climbed up to rescue the cat
and now he needs to be rescued
for some reason the ladder is on the ground
and nobody has put it up there
so here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad
thats all
yeah well get your slice of bread whether wheat or white
what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first
get a knife
take it outof open up the jar
put the knife into the peanut butter
take out a take out a scoops
spread it over the bread
and then I open up a
and I usually use a spoon for that
put that on the other slice of bread
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter
spread it over the bread
and put the two slices together
a little girl was riding through the neighborhood on her bike
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree
her father came along
and said
what is it dear
she says
Dad my cats in the tree
well I can get the cat out
let me go get my ladder
father went and got the ladder
climbed up the tree
and then a neighborhood dog came by
and noticed a man up in a tree
and started barking at the man up the tree
and accidentally knocked down the ladder
so the man was stuck in the ladder along with the cat
and the fire department hadta be called to rescue them both
it was about I guess about seven years ago I really hurt my back
theres this family that I go and visit that has a little child
and from the time that child was born as a little boy I always picked him up and swung him around
but as this boy was getting older as I was getting older I I guess I cant do some of the things that that I normally do
this particular time I picked the boy up
and I was swinging him around
swinging picking him up by the arms
and I spread my legs wide open
and I was swinging him backwards and forwards
and I felt something snap in my back
I was in excruciating pain
I almost dropped the kid
I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids
but this was pain like I have never felt before
because even just to walk or or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms its all tied into the back
it would be like a knife was twisting so
thats thats the injury
and it put me outof commission for a couple of weeks
and the thing that comes to the to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating with someone else
its the family that I described earlier with a child
theyre Hispanic
and their English is not very good
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school
but whenever oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want
I help them with their homework
my wife she speaks Spanish
so its alright when she goes over there
but when it comes to me trying to convey my thoughts
and trying to convey my wants and desires
and also me trying to listen to theirs
I dont always understand what theyre talking about
or and then and they dont understand what Im talking about
yeah in high school a friend of mine myself and a friend of mine we ditched class sothat we could climb CamelbackMountain
neither one of us had ever climbed CamelbackMountain
so we didnt realize exactly youknow where to go or where to start
we just picked a spot on the northern side of the mountain
youknow walked in between some of those very expensive homes
and started climbing
little did we know we really had gotten ourselves in in alotof trouble doing that
there were times where we were actually hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs youknow just to just to get from one point to another
about halfway up were sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot
and I said to him I says
man theres no way we can go back the same way we came
and he says
I know
and I said
Im serious
he goes
so am I
and so we knew the only way the only thing we we figured what we hadta do is make it to the top
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side
but then we would still hafta hike all the way back around the mountain to get to our car
to make a long story short
youknow we were all scuffed scuffed up
we were tired scratched up lor clothes torn
but we could finally see we were kindof getting to the top
as we were approaching the top we saw more people up there
and older people younger people
we couldnt believe it that youknow these people all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time
so when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we we asked them
howd you get up here
they said
oh we took this trail youknow down here on the other side
and we couldnt believe that there was a trail
so after that experience youknow I thank God for helping us through it
because it it really it really made me understand why people hadta be rescued from CamelbackMountain
and I understand how people can get stuck
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges
but prior to that experience I I I couldnt understand how could people get to a certain place and not get back down the same way
a couple decided they would go white water rafting
and so they were white water rafting
the man told his girlfriend to put on her vest
and she said
I can swim
I dont needta put on a vest
and he goes
well Im gonna put mine on because I think thats just a safe thing to do
so as theyre white water rafting the further down they got the rougher the water became
and as as they continued to go down the water got so rough that her life vest her life vest fell outof the boat
and seconds later the boat tipped over
so both of them are are are are in the water with the rapids in the in the rapids hitting rocks with the heavy flow of the stream going going by them
fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to to stay afloat and last long enough to to float to the edge and grab a branch
his girlfriend was coming quickly behind him
and as hes hanging onto the branch hes reaching for her
early one morning its time for little Johnny to go to school
little Johnnys about to walk out the door
but mom stops him
and says
Johnny you better take this umbrella with you because I heard the forecast
and I think its gonna rain
Johnny says
oh Mom
I dont need an umbrella
umbrellas are for sissies
and besides a little bit of rain isnt going to hurt me
she says
I think you should take it
no I dont need it
Ill see you later Mom
so as Johnny is walking to school it starts to rain
at first a little bit and then harder and harder
and as Johnny is walking hes putting his hands over his head trying to stop all the wetness from falling on his face
and hes hating himself for not having to for not having to get that umbrella
so he races back home youknow he races back home
and when his mom opens the door hes soaking wet
and his mom looks at him disappointedly
and said
see youre all wet because you didnt take the umbrella
maybe next time youll listen to me
so Johnny took the umbrella
and went outside while it was still raining
and this time he used it
and he figured
hey I guess umbrellas arent for sissies after all
Bobby loves to play soccer
he loves playing soccer so much he can even play by himself
he was outside in his front yard one day just practicing kicking the ball
he kicked it so hard boomo
it went right through his neighbors window
and when it went through the window it went right into the neighbors living room
knocked over a lamp close to where a man was sitting
it startled the man
the man picked up the ball
and looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from
okay
there was once a girl called Cinderella
she didnt have any parents
and she lived in an orphanage
so but there was a she lived in an orphanage
and the orphanage was looking for a family to take her
so they put out a notice
a mother that had that had two daughters showed up at the orphanage to see Cinderella to take her in
they saw Cinderella
the orphanage director introduced ll Cinderella
she Cinderella did a curtsy
said
pleasure to meet you
and they took Cinderella away
once they got Cinderella home she u found out Cinderella found out that the stepmother was really mean and so were the stepsisters
all they made her do was chores all day long
nothing but work work work
Cinderella do this
Cinderella do that
Cinderella get my food
Cinderella do the laundry
Cinderella feed the animals the cats the dog the horses
all Cinderella could do was just work work work all the time
all in the later later that evening a invitation came to the house from the king inviting all the girls all the unmarried ladies to the princes ball sothat perhaps the prince could find somebody to marry
and so everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball
and and so was Cinderella
she thought she would be going too
Cinderella went into a bed i while she was cleaning she went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress
and so she went ahead and tried the dress on
however when the stepmothers and stepsisters came in and saw her with the with the dress and also the jewelry she was wearing she says
what are you doing
what are you doing
Cinderella says
well Im going weve all been invited to the ball
Cinderel and the evil stepsisters and the stepmother said
youre not going
youre ugly
youre staying here
nobodys gonna wanna marry you
and they snatched the jewelry off of her
and they snatched the dress off of her
and says
youre not going anywhere
were going to the ball
and one of us will marry the prince
but youve got to stay home because nobody wants to marry you anyway
and so off to the ball they went
Cinderella stayed at home
and she was crying
and before you knew it she was crying so hard allofasudden she started hearing bells
and theres twinkling all around
and a fairy godmother appeared
and Cinderella says
who are you
Im your fairy godmother
and Im here to to grant your wish to go to the ball
and Cinderella says
well I cant go because I dont have a dress
and I dont have a way to get there
so fairy mother
and and created a dress for her
she says
oh the dress is beautiful
but I dont have any shoes
she may waved her magic wand again and and there was some glass slippers for her
so she put on the glass slippers
so now she was truly a beautiful a beautiful beautiful young lady
so they walked outside
and Cinderella said that
I dont have a way to get there
and the fairy godmother says
well get that pumpkin and those mice
theyre your friends
tell them to come over here
and the dog seems to like you too
so fairy godmother waved her magic wand
and the pumpkin turned into a carriage
and the mice turned into horses
and the dog turned into a chauffeur
so they all or so so Cinderella now was able to go to the ball
she got into the carriage
and off to the ball they went
when Cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty
they couldnt believe how incredible she looked
ah but she tried to remember as much fun as Cinderella was having she tried to remember one thing that her fairy godmother had told her
she says she needed to be back by midnight
she says if she wasnt back by midnight the pumpkin was gonna turn back in or the carriage was gonna turn back into a pumpkin
and that the horses were gonna turn back into mice
and that the chauffeur chauffeur was gonna turn back into the dog
so Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then
she was having so much fun she lost track the time
and when she looked up at the clock she noticed that it was almost twelve oclock
and while she was dancing with the prince she quickly broke away from him and says
I gotta go I gotta go
and she and the prince says
no you cant go
I think I found my true love
Cinderella continued to run
I got to go
I must go
and as Cinderella was running out she left a shoe behind
she hesitated for a second to get it but realized she didnt have enough time
so she quickly hopped into the carriage
the carriage drove drove off
and got her home just in time
the clothes turned to rags
the carriage turned into a pumpkin
the horse turned into mice
and the chauffeur turned into the dog
back at the palace the prince while he was chasing Cinderella noticed that there was a glass slipper that was still there
so he picked up the glass slipper and said
I must find this woman
whosever foot can whosever womans foot can fit into this shoe thats the person that Im going to marry
so so the prince went from house to house looking for females to fit that shoe
how one house after another
none of the females foot would fit into the glass slipper
and so finally he came to Cinderellas house
as the prince arrived the mother and the evil stepsisters they locked Cinderella into the closet
where she couldnt get out
and so the prince came in
and the two daughters tried on the shoes with all of their might the shoe with all their might
and they could not put their feet into it
however her friends the little mice noticed that that the prince was there
and so they found a key to the room
and they gave it to Cinderella sothat she could open the door
and the prince could see that there was another woman in the house
so the prince asked her to try on the shoe
and she did
and magically youknow she transformed back into the lady that he saw that night
and and the prince realized
scuse
the prince realized that he had found the love of his life
so they got together
they they drove back to the palace
got married
and live happily ever after

the request kindof begs the question
our family was in a major accident while at a hotel in southwestern Virginia while at a resort in southwestern Virginia
we went on a horse and buggy ride in a visavis carriage
our kids were in the back of the carriage facing forward
we were in the front of the carriage facing back
the carriage starting going up a hill
the horse was balking
I without without really thinking and moving as quickly as I could I picked up the kids and got them off the carriage and suggested to my wife that we dive off the carriage which I did onto the ground
and she tried to step down and got her foot caught and was dragged
I hit my head and dislocated both knees was unconscious for a few minutes when the kids were hovering around me telling me that mommy was dead
and I told them I told the kids to go for help since the driver of the carriage was attending to the horse and not to the passengers
the kids ran for help
and I tried to get my legs back together
we all my wife was flown to Roanoke hospital
I went I drove with the kids to the hospital where I was treated for dislocated for dislocated knees
and my daughter was treated for a head injury
my son was treated for a mild pneumothorax
and it was and we hadta stay there for weeks while my wife recovered
and all in all it was a nightmare
okay
at first I would be short and curt with people and not work with them to to communicate
I wouldnt be very pa pathe excuse me empathetic
but having lived through this I realized the problems in communicating
and I noticed that alot alotof people who have difficulty communicating are aware of their difficulty communicating which makes them extremely anxious and makes the situation worse
so I try to put them at ease saying youknow
take your time
dont worry about it
I have problems myself
and try to try to relax
and youknow if you dont if you wanna share something with me and tell me something fine
if you dont its okay too

okay a soon to be wicked stepmother is living with her daughters when somebody brings a little girl to stay with them
the little girl is very polite curtsies to the family and thinks that shes going to be spending time on an equal footing with the rest of the family
however while the mother and daughters are busy primping themselves and having a good time shes left to work with the farm animals and gets to know them and takes care of them
shes spends her time sometimes looking outof the window at the faroff castle in the distance wondering what life would be like in the big castle
turning to the castle the king is very upset because his son has not taken a bride
and he brings his top advisor to to develop a strategy to find a wife for his son because he doesnt wanna linq die and relinquish his crown to his son without a wife to carry on the line
they decide to put an announcement out to all the all all the eligible all the families with eligible young women
a bulletin which ends up at the house of the wicked stepmother and her daughters
they read the notice
Cinderella listens and finds out about it goes up into the bedroom and moans and longs to put on a beautiful dress that she sees there wanting to go to the ball herself
the family gets ready and apparently they buy the sisters all all stuff to get them up to go to the ball
and Cinderella is left alone when allofasudden her fairy godmother appears and says
Cinderella you are in luck
I am your fairy godmother and I am gonna take care of everything you want
I know you wanna go to the ball
we can do it
she plunks her magic wand and suddenly the mice turn into horses
a pumpkin turns into a a coach
and she makes up a pair of glass slippers and a dress for Cinderella plunks her magic wand again fixes Cinderellas hair
Cinderella in her glass slippers gets up into the carriage and goes to the ball arriving at the ball in style with the carriage man who was I think a cat
Im not sure
but in any event she forgets the fairy godmothers warning that she must be back by midnight
shes having such a good time with the prince dancing
the prince is obviously madly in love with her or the glass slippers
I think its the glass slippers
anyway he decides that this is the girl for him and shes swept off her feet when allofasudden she hears the gonging of the bell tower and realizes that its midnight
she rushes off to get back into the carriage runs down the steps of the castle tripping losing one of her glass slippers hobbles onto the carriage
carriage goes off
and just in the nick of time the carriage turns back into a pumpkin the horse into mice
and Cinderella is left weeping in her shed with the animals and looking at the glass slipper remembering the great time she had at the ball and realizing that its all for naught
meanwhile the prince has told his father he has found the woman of his dreams
she has lost a glass slipper behind her
and if he goes around if he has his the kings advisors go around and try on have different women try on the glass slipper hell find his beloved who must fit the slipper
not realizing that eighty women in the in the in the kingdom or a hundred and eighty women in the kingdom all are a size five slipper he is he c accidently goes his his fathers advisor goes to the house of Cinderella first where they all try on where all the girls try on the glass slipper trying to get into it
they cannot
and they see Cinderella
they ask her to try on the glass slipper
sure enough it fits
and shes brought back to the castle where she weds the prince
they get married lived happily ever after have three children
two two boys who end up fighting over the kingdom thirty years later
the country breaks the kingdom breaks out into civil war
and is destroyed under its own weight of greed
first I get the bread outof the refrigerator
then I get the peanut butter outof the cupboard
then I get the jelly outof the refrigerator
and then I put the bread on a plate
and I spread the bread with peanut butter after getting out a knife

and then I put the other piece of bread on top of the peanut butter and jelly spread over the bread
well Joshua the cat was stuck in a tree
and Mary was panicking

and in the meantime the ladder fell
and the dad was stuck in the tree with the cat
but they werent close enough to to rescue eachother

and life would be back to normal
my sister had a stroke if you wouldnt mind
I sprained my back which took a couple of years to heal
and all I did was bend over to get something outof a drawer
and I felt like the left side of my body just rip
and I went to the doctor who told me it would only take a couple weeks to heal
this is sports medicine doctor
and immediately stretched started stretching my legs which was nskuieu
but in actuality so I went back to work actually after about four or five days thinking
and I had a pretty physical job doing visual merchandising at the time display for stores
thinking that I would be fine
and the experience pulled me after ke about four hours of standing pulled me down to the ground
I couldnt I couldnt I would pass out if I continued to stand
so I hadta ke lie flat on my back until I could get up and leave
and then go home and ke lie flat on my back for youknow until I could get up
so it was it was a a really incredible experience
it it it had me it xxx
so there the doctor really didnt do much
I ended up going to physical therapy which made it worse before it got better
and but that was just because they hadta massage the muscles
they say that sometimes a sprain is worse than a break
so that whole experience took about a year and a half
and and then my back finally healed
I and the depression that set in
not knowing quite what to do about it
I went to different people
different doctors and didnt know didnt didnt see any way outof the pain
so it finally ended and
ERROR
ERROR
in speech or in actuality
well yes I have a hearing loss
ERROR
I thought I Im a swimmer
so I thought my ears were just temporarily plugged from water
this n went on for years
called denial
and finally people started to tell me that the doorbell was ringing and I couldnt at work because I
and I worked in a a photographers studio at that point in time
and people useta ring the doorbell when they come in
and then I couldnt hear the doorbell
and people started pointing out that I was not hearing things
so then then I thought that if it was everybody elses problem because their speech was not distinct
youknow when they were talking to me I I couldnt I could hear ke tone and volume but I could not hear the distinction
so I youknow I kept thinking
well why dont these people talk a little bit clearer
whats
so that was the beginning of youknow finding out that I had a hearing loss
and now I have hearing aids
and its still a little difficult to actually get o the distinction sometime
youknow
yes
alright
Ill tell you the my my prison story
Im terrified
I found a little I went out on my patio one day and found a little ke cone shape structure attached to my wu
and so I was talking to my boyfriend about it
I said youknow
what is that
he said
oh thats just like a little wasps nest
and he happens to be a Native American person that is like not into killing anything
ke into Native American culture I should say
so so he said
they they wont hurtcha
those are just thats just a little wasps nest
a they dont have stingers
so then one morning I started watching this wasp
and it kept coming every morning ke for three days in a row
ke to a particular point on my doorway
so I finally checked out my doorway
and I realize that there was another wasps nest
but this one was a lil
so then I noticed that I had like two more wasps nests in my patio all in the same area around my doors
so so fear took over
and I I went I I called an exterminator
I said youknow
can I do this
or do I need you
and he said
you can do this
just go buy some wasp and hornet spray and break up the nests
well Ive Ive been spraying the nests for like four days now
but Im terrified of breaking up the nest
because Im Im afraid that Ill get stung
that theyll be youknow all these little bees will come out and attack me
so Im still at that point
I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about breaking up these wasps nests
in total terror
thats it
here I dont quite get it
it it looks like there are two people that were rafting and fell outof the boat
and caught up in a whirlpool
one of one of the the girl caught up in a whirlpool
and the guy was hanging onto a branch
and
he he looks more fearful than she does
she looks like shes more concerned than he is
so the story is that one of them is trying to rescue the other one
ERROR
she looks more concerned about him
and he looks a little bit petrified
but hes got the lifejacket on so hes probably the one that cant swim

it was raining
and we were in the desert
and there was a flash flood
and I went out to go swimming in this this creek of rushing water

and my blood sugar was like five hundred and ten
and I was ke losing my eyesight
youknow my eyes were real blurry
and thats youknow by the time I got to the doctor he told me that Id probably have some cognitive and memory problems
because my blood sugar was so high for so many for so long
youknow atleast several months if not a couple of years
and so
I kindof forgot what the question was
okay
okay yeah I was pretty I was really sick
I was I hadta go buy glasses because I couldnt even see the tv
it was all blurry like five feet in front of me
and so anyways I went and got on medication and changed my diet
and things are much better now

www
okay theres a mother and a a little boy

and he says
I dont need it
its fine outside
and they argue a little bit
she gives in
and he so he leaves
and hes walking down the road
and he sees that it starts to rain
so and it starts raining really hard so he rushes back to the house
hes covering his head
hes getting all wet
and he goes back into the house
and sees his mother
and hes soaking wet
and she looks at him as if ta
I told you so
and so then he gets the umbrella and uses it
and goes back out and uses the umbrella and starts walking down the road again
okay Cinderellas father married a woman which was became her stepmother
and the stepmother had two daughters
and so they all moved in together
and then the father died
and so Cinderella was left in the care of the wicked stepmother
and she was very mean to her
and made her work very hard and do all the chores
and they the stepsisters were very mean also
and I think called her names and made her do all their chores aswell
and so she she made friends with all the animals
and because she was lonely
and and then and then an announcement came
someone came to the door and announced that there was gonna be a ball
and so they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball
and since Cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters the mother didnt want her to go
because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince
so she locked Cinderella in the tower
and they went to the ball
and so
oh ohwell this was before the animals made Cinderella a dress
and it was real pretty
and thats what infuriated the stepmother
and she tore up the dress
and then locked her in the room
and then Cinderella was crying
and then she then the fairy godmother came
and let her outof the room
and with the magical wave of her wand made her a beautiful gown and glass slippers
and fixed her hair all up nice
and turned a pumpkin into a coach
turned mice into white horses
and the dog into a coachman
and and so she was able to go to the ball
and she met the prince danced with him
and the fairy godmother told her that she hadta leave by midnight or she everything would return as it was
and so
and the clock started to strike midnight
and she said
I hafta go
and he didnt want her to leave
but she started to run away
and she lost one of the glass slippers
clicks and she ran and ran and got back in the coach
and they started going down the road
and then every ding when the clock struck twelve turned back to the way it was
and she was very sad but she had a good time
and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers
and so clicks she went home
and then the next day
and the prince really liked her so
and he had this glass slipper so
so he sent out a decree to find this woman with the glass slipper
and so they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyones foot
and it wouldnt fit anybody
and he finally came to Cinderellas house
and they tried the slippers on the stepsisters and and it wouldnt fit
and then n they were gonna try it on Cinderella
and the stepmother tripped the the the little guy with the slipper
and and he tripped and fell and broke the slipper
and so the stepmother was like
oh well the slippers broken
and you cant try it on Cinderella
and then Cinderella said
but I have the other slipper
and so right then and there the prince knew that she was the one
and they were happy and got married and lived happily ever after
a little girl has taken her not neccesarily taken but a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree
and the apparently a man has brought has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder
and hes attempted to get the cat down
and he himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down
a dog may well have accompanied him
there was a dog there
and the fire department has also arrived with their ladder
and they are approaching the scene
and they are certainly going to get the cat down and well along with the man more than likely
and everything will be just fine
the first step is to assemble the items you need
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread
and you would how I would go about doing it I was I would put spread jelly on on one slice of bread
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread
and I would put the two of them together
and then eat the sandwich
my recollection I havent ever been seriously injured but one of the the typical but more unusual things Ive encountered would be chicken pox
not that thats unusual but for me a seriousness
and I dont recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience
not excruciating pain but but quite a bit of c discomforts
ERROR
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didnt obey mothers advice fully of not picking at the scabs
so thats my recollection of chicken pox
the person who Ive had the most difficulty communicating with was my father
and I in part due to he suffered from a some type of ataxia
and and he was well I was I was born when he was in his forties so Imean he was by the time I was he was quite elderly by the time not quite elderly but up there in years by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so
but he in part I he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of his failing his failing ability to walk adequately and
but he was very very little bit short tempered Id say
and just wanting he badly wanted to do things himself
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind of thing
but he couldnt do it
so hed ask for help
and then youd try to help
and he would put his hands in the in the project
and it was just more trouble
and when you tried to say youknow
I hafta do this myself
he would get frustrated
and it was just very difficult time trying to communicate that we both cant do this
so and just just an overall difficulty
occasionally it would brew into an argument
and there would be some walking away because its either you do this or I do this
and we both cant do this
and youknow I know youd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but
its you you just try to remain calm
and and just explain the situation as best you can
and and try to resolve it
and ofcourse there were good days and bad days
youknow days where hed be more tolerant of of that kind of thing
but but just it was more of a communication issue that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do
so eventhough he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied assistance because it was more
I wanna be able to do this
so
the not too long ago maybe a couple of years ago
my girlfriend and I had taken a trip to Flagstaff to go into the lava tubes
there was something there called the lava tubes
its a its its near Flagstaff
and its its just an underground well it was produced by volcanic activity
and its a very large crevice in the ground
kindof a a tunnel
and we had gone in it then
I believe it was a Sunday afternoon
and it was rather late in the day
and by the time the
and in the center of this this thing
its basically a straight tunnel
ERROR
its not really a pole but its its
the the tunnel splits off in the center and goes around another chunk of rock
so you have it it splits into a wide fork
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel
well we didnt look at the map adequately
and we got in there
and and the the flashlight started to dim
and we were r we had gone all the way to the end
and we turned around
and we were unaware of this thing in the middle
and happened to be turning around it in circles
and the flashlights were going dim
and by that time the other people who had visited had left
so we were in there alone
and at that point going in circles in the dark or the dim lights
youre kindof like youknow how do you get outof this place
and it became quite quite fearful
not I wouldnt say terror but the the belief that maybe well be spending the night in here
and obviously its youknow you dont think youre gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes
but its certainly you dont have food you dont have
so
I cannot be certain of what happened
this is a photograph
but clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water
it may be a creek a stream a river or just an extreme extreme area flood
but thats really irrelevant
she is in trouble
and someone has either noticed a passerby or has
or she alerted somebody that of her her situation
and the authorities were alerted because it appears that a a professional is attempting to rescue her
he has on rescue equipment
and I really cannot give an end to the story because I dont know what the outcome of the situation was
I assume she was saved
but theres no telling based on this photograph
there is a boy and a young boy
hes outside
and hes kicking about a soccer ball
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house
shatters a window
lands inside
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it
he is quite startled
we then see him with the ball in his hand
hes looking out the broken window
he I cant tell that hes glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption
and hes certainly not happy
Im not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother removed it from his hand
and he is still asking for it
and she is reluctant to give it to him
hes then outside with
well he has a backpack on so I assume hes headed off to school but not necessarily
and hes outside
and hes walking
and he sees raindrops falling
and the rain picks up
and he is getting soaked
and it appears hes turned around
and hes returned home
his mother is looking at his his drenched body
and then he was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain
okay the story of Cinderella
well Cinderella is shes one of three sisters
and two of them are rather in modern terms stuck up
and and well theyre high on themselves
and they their mother is somewhat the same way
and she as the story progresses there is a one of the wealthy gentleman
the uppity ups in in the area
he is trying to I believe marry off his son
and there is a ball being held
and Cinderella is not invited because she she has been rather outcast by the family as just the the servant girl
and and shes to wait on everybody else
so shes rather lower class in the family
and it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the the ability to go to the ball I suppose youd say
and she goes there in this fancy fancy vehicle
and shes shes wearing glass slippers
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the son of the the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son
so shes shes dancing with the son and it it turns out that the son is is rather enamored by her
so but the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by I believe it was midnight something
or else she turns into a pumpkin something like that
Im not exactly sure what the the gist of it was
but regardless she it gets close to midnight
she realizes this
and she darts off
and leaves the the prince or the son of the wealthy landowner whoever he was kindof depressed that she hadta leave early
and she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers
and these glass slippers are magical
and then she the prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her her foot
so and then hes again youknow theyre together again
and hes happy to have found her
and the the other sisters are who had planned on one of them getting the the guy theyre kindof left in the dark
and and everyone kindof gets their their comeuppance
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after
well you go to the cabinet
get the peanut butter and the jelly
the jellys usually in the refrigerator
and a slice of bread
and put the jelly and the peanut butter on the bread
and fold it over
and eat it
the cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog
and the dad said
well
to the little girl because she was crying her cat was out in the tree
I will get the cat down for you
so the dad got up on the ladder to get up get up the tree to get the cat
but the ladder fell down
and so here the dog the dog is barking at the tree to get the cat
the dad is caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down
so the police the firemen have been called
and theyre coming in to bring another ladder to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy
and there is a bird singing in the tree
so the bird is happy
so it all ends when the firemen get the dad and the cat down
okay I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had GuillainBarre syndrome
and thats a type of paralyzing
its kindof its I think it was called French polio because the men were from France
and I was on a vacation out over in SanDiego with friends
and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet
and I was stumbling
I was having a hard time walking
and I knew something was wrong
and I just I really kindof thought it was fate
I thought maybe Id a brain tumor or something really pretty serious
but my daughter was with me
and we had planned on going to UniversalStudios
and I wasnt in pain
so but I was just having a hard time walking
GuillainBarre starts at your fingers and toes
and then works works in
so I cant I can remember this going to UniversalStudios in a wheelchair
so by that evening by the time we all go back to our hotel I was really quite concerned
I did sleep
and the next morning they took me to ScrippsMedicalCenter in the SanDiego area
and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because GuillainBarre affects its its a autoimmune disease
and he asked me if I had had the flu recently
and I had
and so the the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system
and this was what was happening
so they told first they wanted to admit me to the hospital
and I said
no way
I I was going back ta
oh and they did r they asked me to ke shuffle a deck of cards
I couldnt do that
and snap
I couldnt do that
so got back in the car with my friends
and my daughter was with us
and he said
if you have trouble breathing
because it can go all the way in
its youknow affects your s affects your muscles
to find the nearest hospital
but I got back home
and it took me about oh six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery
for about six weeks I couldnt drive the car
I couldnt I could feed myself but I couldnt cut
I could shower but I couldnt
I had no strength in my hands or my feet
I couldnt stand on my toes
any of that kind of thing
so then I started it wherever it goes youknow
and then it stops and its just your body stops starts healing again
then it was a slow recovery
I would start walking just out around the block a little bit
but I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister
she was living with us at the time
and I just felt like an old lady
and this was over twenty years ago
so I was in my forties
and I was just holding
and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over
but it I recovered
I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands
I I can occasionally have a hand tremor
but I feel like Im ninety nine percent better
so that was it
yeah
oh yes
well okay
my mother who I lost about a year and a half ago had Alzheimers
so we went through this process
and she was oh about eighty when we first
and it was kindof interesting
my daughter
like I said my kids come just every other year for Christmas
and my daughter from California was home
and within two hours
they were all at my house
Susie came up to me and said
Mother something is wrong with Grandma
and we had noticed a little bit
but it it just got worse and worse
and then then my mom and dad were in assisted living out in FountainHills
then we lost dad
so we put mom into a a nursing home up in Flagstaff where my sister lives
and she was up there for four years
and at first she could talk
she went through all the different stations ay stations of youknow aggression and meanness
and she would call me or dad would actually because she couldnt really dial
but dad would call
and shed grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes
and she was much thinner than I was so
or taking money
dad would call and hiding in the garage and this mother whos k maybe a hundred and ten pounds at the most youknow
he was kindof frightened of her because she got really mean
but then she got back into a very calm state
and slowly began to really make no sense whatsoever
but Ive I learned
and and Dad and I went to a Alzheimers support group which really really helped us
especially dad
and because my mom had done everything
Imean she had been the one to do all the shopping send out the cards
and I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards
but finally there was a point where when dad died that she needed full care
so and the last six months she she couldnt talk or do anything
and she broke her hip had a fall
and the saddest thing was that up until the last year she was very physically very healthy
so she died at age eighty seven
ERROR
so
I guess a long time ago
xxx
tell me the story start from the beginning
I was in an earthquake in California
and one of the major ones
this was in the fifties
and it was it it was we were visiting my dads aunt or my dads sister my aunt out in California
and it happened in the middle of the night
and it was it its listed
I think it was maybe a seven pointer something
Imean it the house was definitely moving
the bed was moving
I was sharing a bed with my cousin
and when I woke up at first I just thought she was shaking the bed around
but it was dark
it was early early morning
and so there was alotof flashing because the transformers going off
and my aunt and uncle had a a doorbell chime
the kinds that two hang
and
so we were up for the rest of the morning
this probably happened oh five oclock in the morning something like that
there were alotof tremors afterwards
and I remember back then in the fifties the newspapers useta do extras
and there was an extra out that day on the earthquake
so it was it was alittle frightening at the time because you just dont know whats going on
so it scared me
but I havent had too much to frighten me in my life
yeah
well there was a flash flood in the deserts of Arizona which happens frequently
and people are alittle careless
and they think they can drive their car out through this dry wash bed that allofasudden has a trickle of water
and they get their car out there
and the trickle becomes a flood
and they hafta get outof their car
and they are standing on the roof
and the paramedics the or the firemen come
the rescue people come
and the little girl falls off of the car into the raging flood waters
and shes holding onto a branch
and the firemen come out and rescue her
shes extremely scared
the boy is playing soccer out at his yard
and he kicks the ball
and it breaks one of the windows
and it lands in the living room where the dad is sitting
it breaks the window
but it also breaks the lamp
and the dad gets up
and holds the soccer ball
and looks out the window
and is yelling out to the boy
get in here right away
the little boy is going off to school
he walks to school
and his mother says
well it looks like it might rain today
you better take the umbrella
and he said
oh no I dont need an umbrella
I I I dont think its going to rain
so off he goes with his backpack
and sure enough it starts raining
and he gets soaking wet
its raining very very hard
and he runs back to the house
and and looks at his mother
and he is soaking wet
and the mother is alittle disgruntled at him for not taking the umbrella
but she gives him the umbrella
and back out he goes to school with the umbrella keeping him dry
okay this is the story of Cinderella
and Cinderella lost her mother
and her father married a new person a a woman
a and so Cinderella had a stepmother
but the stepmother also had two girls
so they came in and were living with Cinderella
the father didnt realize this but the stepmother was really treating Cinderella mean
and he she had her cleaning and washing while her daughters were being treated very very nicely
and Cinderella felt very sad
well there was a prince in the land
there was the the castle
and the king and the queen wanted their prince to get married
and they were looking for the best wife for for him
and they were going to have a ball to introduce him to all the single ladies in the kingdom
and Cinderella wanted to go
but the stepmother said
no way
you dont have the right kind of clothes
your hair isnt done right
none of that
so the the stepsisters were getting ready
and Cinderella was very very sad
and the book talks about her going up in the attic or down in the basement finding this chest with a book
this part I dont know but anyway
she calls on a fairy godmother to come and and help her
and the fairy godmother gives her this beautiful dress
does up her hair
and she has a coach
and off she goes to the ball
but she is being told that everything is going to go back to the way it was at the stroke of midnight
so her coachmen are going to turn into mice
and her coach is going to turn into a pumpkin
but off she goes
and she dances with the prince
and she falls in love with him
but then she hears the clock stuhtriking
and she knows that this is all going to just collapse
so off she goes running down the stairs out to the coach
and about that time it ri the clock strikes midnight
and shes back to her ragged clothes
but she has lost one of her slippers on the stairway as she ran down from the castle
so the prince wants to find this beautiful young lady
and he says whoever can fit into this slipper will be my new princess
and he they search high and low
and they go into the house of the stepmother and the and the daughters and the and Cinderella
and they try on the shoes
and they wont fit
but Cinderella tries on the shoe
and it fits perfect
so the prince knows that this is his princess
and they live happily ever after
the end
pretty easy
well you get the ingredients out
you get the the bread that youd wanna use
I would first take a paper plate and put the two slices of bread on the plate
and then either before or after Id go get the jelly and the peanut butter
and if they were already open theyd probably be in the refrigerator
and then I would take two knives because I dont wanna adulterate one or the other
and I would I would probably put the butter on first
and I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly
and I would the put the butter on the one side
probably the right side just because its thats where its at in my mind
and I would put it on evenly
but I would put it on very over the whole area
not this area because I hate that
an
Id probably use alittle less jelly than the the peanut butter because Id rather have more peanut butter
and then I would put the two I would probably take the in the left hand take the one with the jelly and put it over the one with the peanut butter
so the two surfaces that have stuff on it face each other
and I would put them so the top of the loaf is where the youknow the top of the piece is where it has a symmetrical
and then I would cut it in half probably this way ri horizontally
and then I would know what Id eat it
I dont know if you wanna know that so
and at some point Id probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife wouldnt yell at me
looks like there is a kitty got up into the branch of a tree
and it looks like the father climbed up on the tree with a ladder
and somehow the ladder fell down
and the father is stuck in the tree
theres a girl up there reaching up for probably her cat
and theres a tricycle next to her
and theres a ladder there thats quite a ways from the tree
so I dont understand how it got that far away
but maybe it tipped over backwards
and then theres a dog probably their dog barking up the tree
and youknow why I have no idea what dogs do
and then theres a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree
and then smack evidently somebody called a fire department
and theres a firetruck
and theres a couple fireman carrying a ladder towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there
but maybe its not a good enough one
and thats pretty much it
so evidently the father climbed up the tree to get the cat out
and for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down
and somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the fire department
and theyre responding
an
looks like its low enough he can just jump down so
the thing was is that I never had a heart attack
and otherthan having a very little chest pain
it was kindof somewhat of a surprise so
I had went and had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician
and he said that was alright
which they dont show anything
so now he suggested a stress echo
so I I had a stress echo
and I went to it
and and I failed it
youknow I was kindof shocked
and I was gonna do things afterwards
and I just called my wife
and and talked to her
and then I went home
and smack and then they did a cardiac catharization
smack and between the first day and the second day they gave me nitroglycerine
and then I just didnt do anything because I didnt wanna have a heart attack
and I had a cardiac catharization
and I didnt know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was older and past his prime wouldnt have done anything if if if
and he wouldnt even put it in a stent
because which I wouldnt have used him if I would have known that
make a long story short I had three main
one was blocked a hundred percent
one was blocked ninety eight percent
and one was blocked eighty percent
so I was very fortunate that I didnt either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that
and I had surgery
and I had surgery by a a cardiac surgeon that was considered by the nurses and people in general one of the better ones
I went to ScottsdaleHealthcareOsborn
and before I went I called and asked them how many procedures they did the previous year
and based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance you had a better success
so they were even better than at Mayo
at the time Mayo was at Scottsdale Shea
and it was like oh three or four hours there
I to this day I dont know because what my wife told me and what she now says is different
so it doesnt matter
smack and when I got done
its its very intrusive
you dont know what the
and they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked really bad
but I was calm
and well my brother just had it a couple weeks ago
and his wife said he didnt look that bad
so I dont know what that means
well smack when I saw my mob
but she did r she recovered very rapidly
and shes still alive
and thats about fifteen years ago
smack and then I just remember that it it took a long time to recover
and then one day I went to the cardiologist and he said youknow
go back to work
which when I went back to work I had problems because it really was too soon
I should have said youknow
well Im not really ready
and my wife has always said that after that I acted like an old man
I was I was fifty five at the time
that must have been ten years ago
and the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems
and I would go from one room to the other to find out to get something
by the time I got there I forgot that
and they said that that was go away in six months
it never did
I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long
and at that time they didnt have a filter in there that filters out the little particles or whatever that causes your problem
and Ive never really been the same since then
and youknow thats the pretty much the end of the thing
the story
ERROR
and one day it it was a very very little right here
and just to be on the safe side youknow the other pharmacist said youknow
oh you should call your doctor
ke I got in right away
ERROR
an
the cardiac
and Thursday I have the surgery
so and
yeah well well I
ERROR
but the thing was they did five bypasses
and they took out
both of what they identified as a stroke
and and they it was very difficult to communicate with them
I had an aunt that had was very old
in the nineties and had Alzheimers
and and she didnt even know
she was a aunt that was very near and dear to me
and was always very nice
thats probably my favorite aunt so
and sometimes I have problems communicating with my wife
we both dont hear that well
and wed start talking and walk away
and and alotof people if you pay attention they just speak alot
like my Ive got a son that is an engineer
and I think hes just stressed out from work because hes overworked
and hes theyre pushing him into management
and he for a young guy thats really pretty sharp
all my kids are pretty sharp
he he misspeaks
so
wow yeah like in adulthood or child or what
ERROR
I was probably
you could figure it out
I was in ke in in junior high
not yeah junior high
thats ke seven and eighth grade
okay
I dont know if thats the right term
and it was ke eighth grade
and we were moving from one location to another because my dads place of employment moved
and we were carrying some stuff on a a big long trailer that he was pulling with his nineteen fifty five Buick
and it was a rented Uhaul
and we were driving down the two lane highway and
probably going about forty forty five
ERROR
I didnt know what happened at the time
but subsequently I found out that one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch
because it was put in upside down
it came undone and it fell out
and because of that it the trailer caused the car to go like this
and the car was going like this
and I had a big round mirror that was above the dresser
and I had it in my in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side
because youknow so it didnt get broken
and the car whipped around
an
and to make a long story short
the trailer caused the car to spin all the way around
and the end of the trailer hit a big tree that was literally that big in diameter
and damaged the trailer
and the tree a little bit
and if he woulda
and and then I remember getting outof the car with my dad
and looking at the trailer and all that
and that was pretty
and then youknow it wasnt it didnt take a long time for all this to happen
but that kindof sticks in my memory
it youknow that youknow for the grace of God
or or my dads ability or something
otherthan having a damaged trailer
and I dont know cant remember if he hadta pay for it or it was covered under insurance or
but the mirror was not broken
and I dont think anything or much was damaged
and it was very but it was big long trailer
a double tandem youknow
tandem
two wheels
so that was that was I dont know if that was real scary but it it certainly left an impression on me so
well looks like theres a
oh
okay
I didnt get what this was to begin with
okay
looks like there was a young girl
or maybe a young woman
I dont know
probably in the teens or maybe oh I cant tell really tell the age
looks like that she was in a an area where there was rocky or stony or cliff type things
and she evidently fell in the into the xxx
it looks like xxx on the t
I cant really see that xxx
its not that good a picture
and she evidently got fell in
and she hanged onto a a dead trees branch outof the rocks
and looks like theres probably some man
by the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person
in a red lifejacket
and hes got a belt that I dont know if thats connected to a rope or not
I cant really see that
smack youknow looks like that the
oh I see what it is
hes got a belt hes gonna probably put around her
okay I didnt see that
similar to his
and it looks like hes just got to the point where hes up by next to her and hes gonna when he gets a chance put the belt around the girl and rescue her
probably paramedics or police
and looks like hes in well shape
hes got a a gigantic bicept
and the girl doesnt look really that she looks a little scared
Imean she looks alittle shocked out too or something
so I would assume it had a happy ending
so I I dont know about that
well theres well theres a boy playing with a I guess thats a soccer ball
when there little different sections
and hes in a probably a grassy area with some shrubs behind him
and hes got a baseball cap on
and he kicks it and it appears to go through a window
and it breaks the window
it lands inside a house
and it knocks a lamp off a a table
and theres a man that was evidently sitting in there
and I think it looks like it maybe startled him or something
and he picked up the ball
and hes looking out the window
and doesnt youknow cant see his expression on his face
but he probably in the either in the stages of finding out youknow who did it or whatever
and then hes probably gonna react to it one way or the other
well looks like theres a mother offering to a child
maybe a girl
I dont know
kindof hard to no
its probably a boy
unbrella
and he goes out
and walks with his backpack in the rain
and hes starting to get wet
and he
so he comes back
and hes all wet
and his mother seems to not that be happy about it either
and so then the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now
and hes youknow using it the proper way
that hes getting most of the rain not go on his upper upper body
and doesnt say if they he was dried out before that or not
but he doesnt seem to be wet from the picture
so I no
thats just speculation
well Id like to say that being a European I was not brought up to enjoy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
but I have learned to make them for various visits that I have from my grandchildren
I would get two slices of wheat bread which I enjoy very much
I first I would get the peanut butter jar outof the cupboard
not the fridge because you dont needta put peanut butter in the fridge
and I would take a knife outof the drawer
I would put
put the jelly
clap it together
and
okay the little girls
and
and she suddenly saw her cat in the tree
and she called her father
the dog
the mother in in meantime had obviously called
and
and he
we were living in LA
and we lost our house in an earthquake
and in which time we decided to move to Arizona
shortly after we arrived in Arizona I was diagnosed with breast cancer
it was a very hard time for me because I knew noone here
I had no friends
luckily I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me
and put me on a drug which I hadta take called Tamoxifen
I live in the LakesinTempe which is a very pleasant place to live
and over the years over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication I got to know very many friends who were extremely good very supportive to me
and I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time
and also grateful for the knowledge that its been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer
and up until now touch wood
I could remember when I
I was I was an actress for many years in London and in SydneyAustralia
and when I left with my German husband
when I left Australia to come back to Germany my my my German my gift to the German land which is not very large
and I already had one child who was born in Australia
and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home
and I hadta do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could which wasnt very easy because I had a sister inlaw who was not very kind at that time
and every time I made a mistake in Germany she useta she useta laugh and make fun of me
and I useta be very resentful about that
but because I was I guess so ambitious at that time and because I was good at dialects
and I I think this has something to do with musical ability because Im able to hear
I learned I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year I would say
and thats thats all I could say about language difficulties
very much so
I was four years old when the second world war started
and I was living in Cardiff that time which is the capital of Wales
and we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit
and my parents had decided to send me to
and about two days before I was due to depart to to live with my grandparents our house was flattened
luckily we were in the garden at that time in what they
and we heard obviously what was going on outside
and I I cant remember being terribly scared at that time because I was with my parents
however when our house was destroyed in an earthquake in LA in two in
and I had a nervous breakdown at that time
place in
this story took place in NewOrleans at the time of Katrina
when the whole city of NewOrleans was flooded this little girl was washed away by the the the water that had come through the dikes
and this
and grabbed
and with that he was able to help the little girl on land
and both their lives were saved at that time
little Johnny had been warned by his father not to play with the football close to the house
and he promises dad he wouldnt do that
however he got so taken away by his new football that he was kicking it
and it threw it flew the ball flew through the window
and made a big hole in the window
and bounced right next to dad
dad ofcourse was not pleased
and shouted through the window
I told you not to do that
it was time for little Johnny to go to school
and because the weather was looking gray and cloudy outside his mom said
Johnny do take an umbrella with you
no
he says
so off he walks
and hed only been gone a few minutes before the rain started
ofcourse he was feeling very guilty
and he ran back home
and his mum said
Johnny I wish youd listen to what I am telling you
and he said
I will in the future mum
so he walked off with his umbrella
and went back to school again
little Cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died
after which her father married a second time to a a middleaged woman who he fell in love with who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters
poor little Cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother her stepmother and the daughters
she did all the ironing the cleaning and everything else
and because she was such a nice person she did it willingly because she had a good heart
one day the old king approached his son and said
its about time you got married
Im going to throw a ball
and you I hope will find your future wife at the ball
the the prince wasnt too keen on the idea but finally he agreed
when the the stepmother and the and the ugly sisters found out about this ball they they tried their level best to make themselves look aswellas they could
they they bought new clothes
they they did their hair
they they made themselves as presentable as they could
Cinderella in the meantime was looked outof her window
and saw the the castle where the where the big ball was taking place
and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball
she was helped by her little friends the mice and and the owl
and they all said
oh Cinderella why dont you try and contact your fairy godmother
she might be able to help you
well Cinderella said
I dont know how to do that
and they said
well look look in the trunk
theres a book in the trunk
if you read how to find your fairy godmother she might turn up and be able to help you
and she did that
and whan
and said
Cinderella you shall go to the ball
and she suddenly with with her magic was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made outof a pumpkin
and coachmen she changed the mice into coachmen
and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress
and she said
you go and you have a good time my child but remember one thing
when the clock strikes midnight you must already have returned from the ball
so Cinderella promised to do that
she went to the ball
the prince fell madly in love with her and she with him
and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock r twelve
so she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could
and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step
that was the only thing that the prince hadta identify her with
shortly after that the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman
he who had no idea who she was
the only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper
so he sent a courtier around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper
and said
anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her
and ofcourse the courtier arrived at Cinderellas house
and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and ofcourse couldnt do that until Cinderella said
I would like to try
and she did
and ofcourse the slipper fit
and the prince was delighted to have found her again
and they married and lived happily ever after
apparently a birthday celebration is planned
and there is a cake with four candles on the table
we see on the right two women one already in in the room the other entering through the doorway
and each has a child
the women already inside has a little boy
and the women just entering is with a little girl
both of both children who are entering have wrapped presents presumably for the party
when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it a pretty good size portion of it
and there are pieces of cake on the table
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to what we percieve what we see as a dog sortof hiding underneath the sofa
and the hostess apparently the women whos giving the party is standing there facing the dog
she has a broom in her hand
she appears to be very angry
and the the birthday boy we cant tell what hes doing
he seems to be
I cant tell weather hes wiping his eyes
his u his mouth is wide open apparently to call or do something
and looks as though the woman the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom
oh my favorite food
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
my way or the common way
well we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all
but use a good bread
sometimes its nice to toast it first
on the other hand its not necessary
its whatever you feel like at the time
well having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it
it works better
spread spread the
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread
well after that a little bit of butter
not too much but some
tends to help make the thing a little bit more moist than usual
and on top of that goes the jelly
now having done so what alotof people fail to have ever learned is youknow regardless of how much bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth
well theres an easy way around that
most people dont know my special secret
my special secret is lettuce
nice leaves of iceberg lettuce
just a couple is just right to do it
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had
I got alot of them but I can tell you Ill tell you this one
when the KoreanWar started I was twenty one and Onea
and in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself in a in in a stinky rice paddy shooting people I arranged or I I applied for the Airforces Aviation Cadet program
and I was I was appointed
I finally got an appointment to an air air cadet class
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia
and in those times
well I never did do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid
in the I was still in the in the within the very first I guess it was just the first phase of of training
I had already had some flying instruction
and I awoke one Saturday morning
no actually it was a Sunday morning
I awoke feeling hungover
I knew the hungover feeling
but I had not had I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then
I was only in my twenties
and I thought
boyohboy this is terrible
so I kindof stayed youknow just I hung back all day
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover
well I knew that I didnt feel well enough to fly
I was not safe
so I put myself into sick call
well this was this was a civilian contract flying school
and they had a infirmary but only a youknow it wasnt it wasnt a hospital
so I found myself in the infirmary
well I wasnt feeling too good but I wasnt feeling quite as bad as I had
youknow little by little it sortof left
and it got to the point where youknow the doctors would come in theyd looked at me and theyd say
well you dont have any jaundice but your liver and your spleen are enlarged
and we know there is something very very wrong going on internally
we dont know what it is
well story
we even I I I I felt good enough at or for after awhile that I you could even played a little bit of wheelchair football
but then one of the medics came in and he said
okay
he says
Isd
and I said
no youre not
he said
yes I am
he says
dont worry sir
he says
I givesd
and I thought
oh not another one
well he did
didnt seem to make very much difference
upshot of it all was that they gave up
they didnt they couldnt begin to imagine
they had never seen a situation like this with an with a an enlarged and palpable liver palpable spleen and no jaundice
it wasnt anything they had ever seen before
next thing you know I was sitting in the back of a of a staff car being driven from there down to the Tyndall Air Force Base in Tallahassee Florida
well they put me in there
they still didnt know
youknow lotsof poking around but finally they just said
okay you are you are confined to just bed rest
dont get outof bed
except to go to the bathroom
okay
well it got pretty boring
and I was feeling pretty good
so Id wander around at night
and youknow Id have the buddies over in the next ward or something like that
wed have visit
or Id get the nurses to give me icecream or something like that
well one morning the flight surgeon came around
didnt find me in my bed
he was very disappointed
and when I returned from wandering around visiting my buddies I was feeling pretty good
he said
if you get
he says
if ever I catch you outof bed again
he says
thats court marshal
thats the story
well it turned out that there was a new disease that they nobody knew anything about
the year would have been nineteen fifty one
and the disease is called infectious mononucleosis
you get it from kissing
that was that girlfriend I had back in town
back up there in Moltrey
thats what it was
okay that was the adventure
however end of the story
one year later a little over a year later I found myself in Korea
and I was I I I felt the needta go to the flight surgeon for another slight malady known as crabs
you get them from toilet seats over there
this is in Korea
loandbehold it was the same flight surgeon who I met the year before
and we had a good laugh
thats the story
yes
I think I already have
not at all
I have a hearing problem
and you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU gave a a workshop over time it was several weeks where we come over and wed learn all about hearing loss
well it ended up with me being a regular patient here
and what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss
well even now I find that many people particularly young women theyve been taught to talk through their nose real fast
and thats what they do
and I hafta say to them
excuseme I have a hearing problem
its not your problem its mine
and after several times of asking them to repeat what they said Ive had I I explain that
I have a hearing problem
I dont understand what you just said
now if you would be kind enough please to speak alittle more slowly and perhaps put some space between your words then Ill not hafta then Ill not hafta ask you continually to repeat yourself
okay
thats how I handle that
you bet I have
the beginning is this occured in this occurred in Louisiana
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana
and we were then flying
I was a fighter pilot
we were then flying the the swept wing version of the Fl eighty four known as the Fl eighty four Fl
and we were we had been out or on a youknow a series of missions
and we were just returning to the base
well actually I was by myself
I was flying solo not in formation with anybody
it was it was just a just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane
and also proficiency
just practice
practice this practice that
well in those times we we had a a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at three hundred and forty knots air speed
when directly over the air when we were directly over the end of the runway wed cut our power back
and that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees
after that the airplane is slow enough sothat we would we would have not have touched the throttle
in other words it cut power completely
and just bring it on around
well the the the legs of the of a of the pattern are called the approach
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind
ninety degrees from that is the base
and following that is the final
so its just el if
well here I am on the base leg with no power
all the garbage is out
we call it garbage
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear
and allofasudden Im about I dont know three four hundred feet off the ground
no more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet
something like that
Im not really sure
the airplane started to shutter
shuttering is the sign of a stall
that means the air when an when an airplane stalls it means its falling outof the sky
and I knew immediately people do not survive these a situation like this
and yet I automatically didnt even I I almost didnt have time to think
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway
I didnt want that to happen
well what did I do
I gave it full power which did not catch in time
I pulled in the the landing gear
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone
well with low rpm there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down
I overshot the runway
but I wouldnt I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side
and the Fl eighty four Fl has a a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left
you cant predict it but it will do that
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe because its a jet
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward
well pretty soon there came the ground
in retrospect I can remember very well that the the horizon was jumping up and down
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction
it yawed
and as I say I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on
well eventually it did it did come to rest
it had the it had yawed to the right sothat at full power the engine was or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in a which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people dont land wheels up
well they about panicked
well at which I followed the proper procedures
I cut all power turned everything off
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I I I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing
Im happy to report that the airplane flew again
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels
and it it did fly again
so did I ofcourse
but in this this moment of panic was it it was only a a youknow only a quick flash
it was the the thought was
Ill do whats I know what I needta do but people dont dont walk away from these things
I walked away
it was later determined that while I was I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone
and hes he was his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating
but he could tell that he was overtaking me
so obviously it was an air speed problem
from what I see I havent the foggiest idea of what it what is really going on
I see a man who appears to be lying possibly lying on his back
I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch
he is over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish
so possibly shes there to help him and doesnt know what to
youknow I dont know if she even knows what to do
I dont know any more than that
Imean I can tell you what I see which is some kind of a belt which he has around his left arm
he appears to be quite cu muscular
she appears to be very concerned
thats as much as I can tell you
a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks
it goes into the air
it encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it
a man sitting in a chair looks like an easy chair is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp
he then stands picks up the soccer ball looks out the window to see
lets see how did it get here
thats the story
a little boy is ready to go to school
apparently the weather is somewhat threatening
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella
well he refuses
he is going to be very brave
nothings gonna stop him
he doesnt need an umbrella
thats for sissies
out he goes into the weather
its raining
its raining hard
its raining so hard that hes stepping in puddles
hes getting soaked
his hair is dripping
he returns home much to the conversation
well apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella
well this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disneys thats for sure
Cinderella was a good girl
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters
and they were pampered spoiled and they were nasty
and Cinderella was called Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace
she hadta take out the take out the cinders and do things like that
so it was pretty dirty
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother got an got invitations to go
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home
but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared outof nowhere and said to her
look you deserve to go
we could arrange this but there are conditions
first of all there will be a coach for you pulled by horses
and there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers
and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter whats occurring at at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be outof there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin
Cinderella went to the ball
the prince could not take his eyes of
and she had a wonderful time
but allofasudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve
she knew she hadta get the heck outof there really fast
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers
but it didnt make any difference
she got out she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home
well the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away
but that didnt matter because he wanted her
he was he was so struck by what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was
so he decreed that there would a search would occur over the over the kingdom until until the until Cinderella was until the woman was found
now why was this why was this such a thing
well Cinderella had tiny feet
and the glass slipper was so tiny that very few people very few grownups could fit into it
so he he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who who whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one
well loandbehold in his search his search was successful
they did find they did find Cinderella as the one who whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper
and they were married and lived happily ever after
we see here a tree
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs holding on to it sortof so to speak and barking
in a branch in in the in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of rescuing a cat who is on one of the smaller branches
under directly underneath of which is a little girl who who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down
she has a tricycle in front of her
and we see near the little girl a ladder on the ground which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains as I say remains on the ground
thats thats what we thats what we thats what we see to the left left side of the trunk of a tree
on the right side is another branch which had a few leaves on it
and one of on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing
at the same time we see in the in the distance directly to the right of the truck a firetruck and two what appear to be two firemen each each carrying an end of a ladder which presumably is going to be they will use to climb the tree rescue the man and probably the cat aswell
okay it looks like they have problems with their pets
and I have a cat
so I know that cats climb anywhere
and allofasudden its in a high tree
and it doesnt look like the cat is stressed
but the kids are or the little girl is stressed
so Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat
but I dont think hes able to
so he calls the firemen
and the firemen look like theyre going to get the cat down
and Im just gonna assume that they got the cat down
and the little kid is gonna be so excited
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down
and they live happily ever after
okay you take the the loaf of bread
and you open the bag
and take two slices out
you get your peanut butter jar
you unscrew it
and you get your knife
and take out the peanut butter
and put peanut butter on both sides of the e I mean on one side
sothat both
and then you get your favorite jelly
and you do the same thing
and then you put them together
and serve it
and eat happily ever after
well I
and when I found out I had breast cancer
which runs very prominently in my family
my husband said
were gonna whip this thing
and so I had a mastectomy
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours
and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said
were going off to war again
and were gonna beat it
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband
and my husband was trying to be strong for me
so we always had a positive attitude
and we we never thought negatively
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors
yes
okay well my mother was eighty nine when she had her breast cancer
and she came through that fine
but then after that a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes
and so she herself said
I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab
and she was living by herself at the time
and so she
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in near my sister in Dallas
and so then I went there once a month to visit her
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well
she she would start sentences
and never be able to finish them
and she would say
would you
and then she wouldnt be able to to finish the sentence
so it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted us to do
but we didnt really know what to do
so the only thing my sister and I did was we just smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf
so we talked slowly and loudly
and we always had a big smile on our faces
and we just showed her that we cared
and we would always read her mail to her
and we knew two favorite people of hers
so we would always read those more than once
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her
okay throat when I was working for this man he was the he was a member of YoungPresidentsOrganization
and it was made up of presidents from around the world
and they had a not a seminar but a they called it a university
and it was ke a week long
and it would always be one would be in the UnitedStates
and the second one of the year would be outside the UnitedStates
and this year it was going to be in SanFrancisco
and itll be twenty years ago next month
and my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did alot of the background work
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working week
and so Don stayed here
and my sister from Dallas flew in
and that was the week that they had the SanFrancisco earthquake
and so we were at FishermansWharf because that was our one evening that we had free
and we were waiting to go on the trolley cart back to SaintFrancis the WestinSaintFrancis
and as were waiting in line the earthquake hit
and its really funny because weve never been in anything like that
and so my sister just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down
and she said
that was probably a two or three
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didnt know
but that was just her way of saying its a minor thing
well the electricity was off so nothing worked
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel
and in SanFrancisco youknow its pretty hilly
and so Imean it was it was quite a jog back there
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel
so we sat outside this big park area for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in
and the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there
and we wanted to also call our two husbands
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news
she doesnt like to hear the bad news
and theres hardly any good news thats told
so we knew that she probably wouldnt be watching and know
but my sister said
mother what are you doing
and she said
well Im watching the news because soandso told me that there was a big earthquake in SanFrancisco
so this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco
so it was alotof fear at the beginning
we were on the nineteenth floor
so we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor
and then walk down with our luggage
so it was just the fear of the unknown
and not knowing if were gonna be able to fly out because maybe the the airline canceled the flight or whatever
but both of our flights were fine
and we made it home okay
and our families were okay
www
okay
first of all it looks like there has been a weather change
and so whatever the girl was doing at the beginning I would say she was
I cant tell if its a young girl or if its a young lady
so Im whatever she was doing I think its
she was riding her bicycle
Im going to say its a young girl riding a bicycle
and she the weather came up quickly
and it looks like it is flooding the roadway
and perhaps she was Im just gonna say a on a bicycle
and so it washed her haway
and shes very frightened and concerned and scared and all other emotions negative emotions
and this one
it might be a firefighter or whatever rescuer is coming
it looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb
and he is hes got his lifejacket on
and so he is coming to rescue the little girl
and being that hes a professional rescuer of one way or another
the family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land
www
okay
this young boy is practicing soccer
and as happens most of the time or many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood
whether its baseball or or golf or a soccer ball
it goes in a way that it shouldnt have gone
so hes kicking this soccer ball
and it accidently crashes through a window
Im going to say its a neighbors window
and allofasudden it
the neighbor is sitting in a chair
and this ball comes through
and knocks over a lamp
and then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window
and is looking outside the broken window to the young man
and being that its a neighbor I think that he knows that accidents do happen
and hes not happy what happened
but hes understandable understanding that it was just an accident
and is not going to be upset with the boy
but is just going to tell him
just be careful the next time
www
well little boy is is with his mom
and his mom is sortof insisting that he eventhough its not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast
and he should take this umbrella
theyd rather have the rain probably and play in the rain
but hes insisting that he does not wanna take the umbrella
so as hes walking
looks like to school because hes got a backpack on
it starts raining
its okay at the very beginning because its just drizzling
but then allofasudden it is really coming down
so hes you can see the puddles on the ground
so hes trying to cover his head with his hand
and hes turned around to go back home
and he comes in
and hes very sad because hes soaked
and his mother looks at him
and is disappointed that he didnt take the umbrella
but now he realizes that his mother was right
and he shouldve taken the umbrella
and he goes out using the umbrella
and though its pouring down rain hes now keeping dry
okay the story of Cinderella
Ive forgotten some of it but anyway
its a story of a family that has mother that has three daughters
two seem to be mean sisters to their one sister who is Cinderella
they always have fun
and they dress up
they go places
she is left Cinderella is left to do the chores the hard work
feeding the animals cooking cleaning the house
then they get an invitation to a ball
the prince has invited everybody to come to the ball
and so theyre all excited because theyre gonna go to the ball
well Cinderella gets dressed
and her sisters get dressed
and they take some of their things that she was going to wear for themselves
and so now Cinderella really doesnt wanna go because she doesnt look pretty
and so the other two sisters go to the ball
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother comes
and says
youre going to the ball
and waves her magic wand
and Cinderella looks beautiful
and so she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball
and she has on beautiful silver slippers
and so allofasudden she gets to the ball
and the prince dances with her
and she says allofasudden its midnight
and if she doesnt get out by midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin
so she runs away from the prince
and gets into the carriage
and somehow she lost her one shoe
the prince finds the shoe
and they try to find the person that this shoe fits
and he has help
other people are helping him
and so finally they they try to fit the shoe on the two mean sisters
but then they said
there was one other person here
and Cinderella it fit Cinderella
and so the prince takes Cinderella
and lives happily ever after
Leah Leah little Leah
and birds
and
and the dog
this man
and he
but allofasudden
bring down the man
get the cat
pet the dog
and give Leah a sucker and tell her shes a good girl
a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
ERROR
and I would bring my tea with me
and I would go to the refrigerator
and I would get the jelly out
then I would go into the pantry
and I would get the bread a
and then I would go to the drawer
I would put
I would put jelly on one side
then I would put all the stuff back because Id get in trouble if I didnt
in nineteen ninety nine on PearlHarborDay I was in a restaurant with my cousin that was here from Indianapolis
and we were visiting
and I had to go to the bathroom
and I got up and stepped on a wet spot
shattered
and I remember laying there
it hurt
and I remember the firemen coming a
and had surgery on it
put an
a
ah
okay I been in construction management
and I was project manager on a couple substantial projects
and one of the assistant project managers for the general contractor had a bad lisp
and he was very hard to understand
and if he got excited he would even have a harder time
so it was very difficult
but if you were very nice and talked calmly he would calm down
and you could you were able ta
but you hadta be very patient and very caring with him to do that
it was hard
it was a cold
it was night
it was winter
and it was raining
and I was walking home from a friends house
and the rain was really coming down
and all of sudden the lightning started crashing nearby
and I couldnt move fast enough because of that lightning striking so close by
it was very scary
Leah
and it was one of the monsoons
and it was a torrential downpour
and suddenly she got caught in one of these washes that were full
and it was rushing so fast that she was the car was swamped
she could just barely
and she got out
and luckily fortunately there was
and them a they lowered
and they tied
and they lifted her up
but the car didnt make it
little Louie
and he got carried away
and kicked one too hard
and went
Fred was sitting
and he said
Louie we needta talk about this broken window
we needta see if we can do something for you to pay for all the damage
Louies getting ready to go to school
its cloudy outside
so mom says
here Louie take an umbrella
ya
Louie says
no its okay
I dont need the umbrella Mom
thankyou very much
so he goes out
and he gets about halfway to school
and it starts raining
and it starts raining harder and harder
he just turns around
and runs back to the house
and goes in
Mom Mom look Im all wet
mom says
I told you Louie to take this umbrella
now now will you take it
and he says
give me the umbrella Mom
thankyou Im sorry
so off he goes
and hes all nice and happy now because hes dry
and the umbrellas protecting him from the rain
as I can remember
once upon a time back in the good old days Cinderella lived with her father
and nder Cinderellas father met this lady that had two daughters
and they moved in with Cinderella and her dad
and they werent nice
they didnt like Cinderella at all
and they kindof made her into a a a maid sorta
to take care of the dogs and the horses and the cats and everything
and to be kindof a maid for the ugly two mean ladies mean daughters
and Cinderella would look at the castle
and dream and think of her PrinceCharming
and in that castle they decided to have a ball to see if they could find a girlfriend for the for PrinceCharming
so they sent out invitations
and they Cinderella got one
but their her stepsisters wouldnt let her go
they were gonna go instead
but Cinderella called on a fairy godmother
and she dressed Cinderella just so beautiful
and the mice and the birds all helped
and Cinderella looked beautiful in her glass slippers
and but the fairy godmother says
you better be careful because at midnight all this goes away
you you go back to being Cinderella
so you hafta get everything done by midnight
so sure enough she met PrinceCharming
and PrinceCharming just went head over heels over this lovely Cinderella with
and they danced
and they danced
and they danced
and bango twelve oclock came
and Cinderella hadta run and leave because shed turn back to whatever she was before
and she was afraid PrinceCharming would not like that
so she ran away
and as she was running away she drops one of her glass slippers
and leaves it laying there
but she goes back
and suddenly she becomes Cinderella again
and the PrinceCharming is so sad that his lovely Cinderella was gone and he couldnt find her
so he assigns a bunch of people with
and try on this glass slipper to find the girl that it fit
and so first he went and went
and they searched and searched and couldnt go
and they went to Cinderellas house
and they tried the glass slipper on both of his
and they tried
and it didnt fit
and they saw Cinderella over there in the corner
and they said
come over
so she goes over there
and it fits
and everything goes great
PrinceCharming is happy
Cinderellas happy
and they live happily ever after
smack Ill get two slices of bread
preferably whole wheat
because thats the most healthy
and a jar of peanut butter
I will get a knife to spread the peanut butter
and I will also get a knife to spread the jelly along with the jar of jelly
I will first put the peanut butter on one slic
I will either put
well it looks like the little girls kitten got stuck up in a tree
and dad went up to help her out and get it down
and then he got stuck in the tree
so they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down outof the tree
okay Im going to tell you about the time that I had cancer and began my treatment
I was thirty seven years old
an
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my
I had a modified radical mastectomy
a
so within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo
smack they worry alot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects ofcourse
so I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two
I did not
and so after that first initial treatment
they told me not to eat lightly on the days of my treatment
throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat normally
and
so evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses
smack the person that I that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the conditions getting worse is my husbands mother
smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have
so it did affect her ability to communicate because she cant hear what youre saying to her most of the time
smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her
speak directly to her
I think shes become very adept at reading lips and figuring out what youre saying without hearing it
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation
so that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad
she now has the beginnings of basically Alzheimers of the dementia type
smack so
and you can see her now and see her again in thirty minutes and she wont remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually as a normal rule
she does recognize us youknow and is able to communicate
but basically
otherwise youre youre having to repeat everything so many times
you dont know if shes heard you or not
so thats about all you can do with that
is just make sure you have
well let me think
lots of them
but how frightened or how scared
thats the trick
okay I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young girl
and throat my parents had a v we lived on a farm
and my sister and I slept in the bedroom that was farthest
and between the main part of the house and our bedroom was a long
so at night when we would go to bed we had
and I would lay there and try to go to sleep
but then I would go to sleep
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the stairs
and since the
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was next to the main part of the house
and there was no way to get there except going by
smack so I I lived several years in fear
I
and eventually the we
and
and
so I hadta sleep next to the door
and I hadta protect my little sister
so that was probably the most frightened that I ever was that I can remember
okay
this girl has fallen into the river from somewhere
Im not sure if shes had a car accident and got outof the car or if she just fell into the river or the was walking swimming in the river and it swept her away
it looks like theres a rescue person
I dont know if its a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the limb to try to get her outof the water
at this point I think hes talking to her trying to get her outof the water
and she has her head outof the water
so Im assuming shes not in the process of being sucked down
I think theyre trying to figure out a way to f safely get both of them back to shore
okay

a father throat smack met a woman that he liked
they got married
and he had a daughter by previous wife
and she had two daughters by previous husband
the stepmother to his daughter didnt want her in the sa
so basically turned her into a scullery maid to do housework
the father along the way had after a few years had died in the meantime
so mom really took that to extremes and basically turned her into a servant to wait on her and the two sisters
smack smack it came about that the king and queen had a son
a prince if you will who was celebrating his twenty first birthday
and they decided to have a huge ball and invite all of the eligible girls in the country to come to the ball
so naturally the stepmother of Cinderella who was by then given this name by her mother and sisters since since she tended all the cinders from the fireplace smack to come to this ball
mom decided that her daughters were going and wearing the finest clothes possible
so she got them their gowns and got them all set up to go
Cinderella was very sad because she couldnt go
and she really wanted to go
she never got to do anything
she happened to stumble upon some clothes in an old chest and found that she actually had some friends in the in the animal kingdom that came to her rescue and helped her make a beautiful ball gown
smack she also had a fairy godmother that she never knew about who suddenly appeared and helped make everything right sothat Cinderella could go to the ball
she had a beautiful gown
she had a coach to ride in with footmen and everything that she needed
the only stipulation was she hadta be home by midnight because everything would go back to what it had been before
smack so Cinderella went to the ball was having a wonderful time and forgot about the time until she heard the clock striking midnight
she ran down the stairs to try to get away and in the process lost one of her slippers which was a beautiful glass slipper
smack she did make it home on her own
and noone ever found out
but in the meantime the prince had become so smitten with this beautiful girl at the ball that he was determined to find out who lost their glass slipper on his staircase
so he went door to door in the country with his helpers trying to find who
noones had so far
but when he came to the home of Cinderella her two sisters ofcourse hadta try it on
and Cinderella happened to overhear smack a
and the prince had found his princess
and they got married and lived happily ever after

between the lack of teeth
so I was river rafting in West Virginia
and theres this part when you get outof a raft and jump into a hydro
which is like a whirlpool that sucks you to the bottom
if you jump into the whirlpool
even with the lifejacket on
itll suck you down to the bottom of the river
normally it spits you up five to ten feet after it sucks you down
if you hit if just perfectly you can ride the hydro the entire length of the hydro
and it takes you up about fifty feet
well I was about the fifth person to do it
the first four people jumped in and popped up ten feet later
I jumped in
hit it perfect
and it carried me down to the bottom
dragged me along
started to pop me up about ten feet
and sucked me back down
an
thought I was coming back down
I was about foot from the surface
could see the light
and I got sucked all the way back to the bottom for about another forty feet
I thought I was gonna drowned
had a lifejacket on
it sucked me to the bottom
so there was a girl who got caught in a river
doesnt look like a flood
looks like she maybe fell in a river because theyre not taking boats or anything
and theres what looks like either a cop or a fireman
hes got a harness to safety equipment to safety lines
and hes wearing a lifejacket
and hes trying to get out into the river to rescue the girl

get really good bread not the cheap factory bread

ohmy looks like a familys having another picnic

anyways they went out to the country
and theyre hanging out underneath the tree
and looks like the cat

Lindsey the cat climbs up the tree
and ofcourse everyones worried about the cat
so even the dog is worried about the cat
hes trying to kit

and they all go for ice cream and live happily ever after
well the last time I was hospitalized I was five
so what Ill do instead is Ill tell you about swine flu
so about a month ago oh lets see was I was out to dinner with friends
and was kindof tired
so anyways I went home about eleven oclock
and then Sunday kindof was all achy and just slept all day pretty much
I think I was ke not sleeping for two hours
but for some reason I just didnt
youknow I Im oblivious to these things
ke when youre not married you dont have a wife that tells ya
go to the doctor
so went to work on Monday
and ended up drink noticed I drank must have like fifteen cups of tea
and it was like
yeah youre probably sick
but yeah youre not
so you stayed all day
and then Tuesday I woke up feeling totally crap
in bed all day
stayed home from work
same thing Wednesday
and then Thursday morning I Wednesday actually I called made an appointment for the doctor
and Thursday I canceled the doctor appointment thinking
we
and went to work
and then by Thursday afternoon was sick again
had really bad sore throat Thursday night
went to the doctor Friday
and the doctor sa
yeah you got swine flu probably
but since youve had it for a week theres nothing we do about it
so just go home and drink liquids and chicken soup and whatever
bad sore throat Friday night
slept all day Saturday
slept all day Sunday
a
went to work Monda
and then still kindof felt tired the rest of the rest of the week
and that was swine flu
so it wasnt as traumatic as I thought it would be
but still felt like crap
frightened or scared
ERROR
and this is why probably I pass out when I have blood tests
when I was five
and that was actually the second from last time was in the hospital
I was six was the last time I was in the hospital
when I was five I went to the hospital for an eye operation
look in the camera
anyway thee
who youknow asked the questions
and then she said
were gonna poke your finger
and take a blood test
and she reached around her neck
and attached to the cross was a needle
and she rubbed it with alcohol
and jabbed
and then took
and I just thought youknow thinking back
that is the most bizarre thing that can ever happen
Imean it can turn you off to
so theres my fear story
since that day I do not do blood tests
I havent had a blood test since I think I was six
yup my mom
she had CBGD I think it is
well it was progressive
she started out she said she noticed it when she was ke in her mid forties
she was ke an office manager secretary and
but youknow whatever
she just kindof got on with it
and over over time she just kindof talked a little bit slower
and would use youknow shorter sentences
and course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic
so
but eventually youknow it was
they didnt really diagnosis it for awhile
and then she went to UniversityofMichigan where they have this neurology or aphasia center
some type of where they do alotof research in it
thing is she didnt like the doctor
and she told him to fuck off
so didnt really get the whole research thing on it
but over time she youknow just got less and less communicative
they thought she was having mini strokes for awhile
a
it was actually the evening of her sisters funeral
they went out to dinner
and she passed out
and they rushed her to the hospital
and the doctor
well the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital
after she woke up that evening she was talking perfectly normal
Imean it it youknow had gone away
she could full sentences and as if if shed nothing happened
ke take
she went to bed that night
she woke up
and then she was back to where she was before it happened
so noone could figure that one out
but meanwhile the doctor pulled her drivers license because she passed out
and youknow considered a seizure or something
and that really pissed her off
then she took her my dad hadta take away the keys
she actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up
and we actually kept her car until she died
she we couldnt sell her car because youknow
when you get better Mom you can have your car back
but eventually she ended up losing muscle control
and youknow she was working with a walker
and then within a year after that she was in a wheelchair
she was in the nursing home for about the last year and a half
and when she went in the nursing home she could still speak three or four sentence or three or four word sentences
and towards the end she could get youknow one or two words out
but the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time
and then eventually she died
she just decided she was not gonna eat
and she didnt eat
and the last that was it
up no its its youknow kindof brought the whole family together
Imean theres funny stories about it
I knew she had decided not to eat
and youknow ke one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge massive breakfast because she useta love to eat
and youknow we hadta tell her
nope Jeans decided shes not eating today
so Imean it was all kinds of stories about it
but so thats my story about that
b Cinderella
well there was this little girl named Cinderella who is like really cute little girl
an
I think she went to the the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years
and so Cinderella hadta go move in with her evil stepmother
and and her evil stepmother had two other daughters
and the evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but didnt like Cinderella
so Cinderella and youknow theyre just this this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house
shes gotta clean the floors and vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff
so anyways youknow the mom and the stepgirls theyre kindof reading the mail
a
ke the prince is ke this totally hot dude
where Cinder
its like he is ke on television all the time
and she knows what he looks like
and is like really wants to dance with him and stuff
but the evil stepmother says
no youre not getting a dress
youknow its like youknow
youre a cleaning girl
and you stay home
and youknow clean the attic and stuff
while me and your stepsisters were gonna go to the ball
so shey
and they get a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelery and new shoes and everything
and they go out to get ready to go to the ball
meanwhile poor Cinderella shes up in the attic
and shes crying while theyre all going away
and shes kindof just wishing
wish I could go to the mall or to the ball
and allofasudden her fairy godmother appears
and Brunhilda the fairy godmother says
whats whats the deal uh Cinderella
what are you so upset about
and Cinderella says
I wish I could go to the ball because I really like this prince guy
and I like to dance
and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff
but that evil stepmother of mine wont let me go
so anyways theres the the the fairy godmother youknow gets out the wand and touches Cinderella
and allofasudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty gown ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking
and then they go out in the garden
and they dig up a pumpkin
and she kindof does the pumpkin
and turns the pumpkin into a carriage
and then she turns the nasty old horse theyve got in the barn into these really cool horses that pulls the h carriage
and because you hafta pull up the castle in a carriage or they wont let you into the ball
so anyways they get into the h she gets into the pumpkin
and the fairy godmother even put some ke air freshener in there so it didnt smell like a pumpkin
and they went to the ball
and they got to the castle
and they were able to sneak in
an
and youknow the fairy dmo the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters
theyre kindof on the other side of the room and dont really notice her
and even when they see her they dont even think its her because shes so pretty
anyways the prince comes in
and youknow they have the dance
and theyre all dancing around
and he sees Cinderella kindof hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says
I dont know who you are
who you
and she
well Im Cinderella
and he says
well would you like to dance
and she says
well I dont not sure Im not sure I know how to dance but Id love to try
but she doesnt really know that the stepmother the fairy godmother put a spell on the shoes
so anyone in the shoes can ke dance like magic
ke and on top of that the shoes will only fit Cinderella
so ke Cinderella dances really well
and ofcourse the prince falls in love with her
and youknow they talk schmoozy things
and theyre already talking about having kids
and youknow kind of car should they get
and whats she gonna to when she turns queen and stuff
and theyre gonna get married
but then Cinderella finally remembers that the fairy godmother warned her that all the stuff turns back to what it useta be at midnight
except for the shoes for some reason but they never told her that
but the pumpkin turns into a pumpkin
and the horse turns into an ugly horse
and the dress turns into rags at midnight
and the clock starts chiming so they go running away
or she runs the downstairs
and runs home
and she gets ke around the corner just in time when all her clothes turn to rags
and the prince is ke totally dumbfounded
its like
whoa this babe was for me
and allofasudden shes gone
so hes ke in a total state of depression
meanwhile his fathers ke saying
you gotta marry one of these other two
because youknow shes got lots of money
and the prince says
no way
Im gonna go look for her
so anyways he finds one one of her shoes
and goes to every house in the village
and makes all the girls try it on
hes a prince so he can make people do things like that youknow
so anyways he finds Cinderella
knocks on the door and
actually Cinderella doesnt answer the door the sisters do
an
well well try it on
and it turns out ke one sister wears ke a size fifteen
and the other sister has shoes so big that they hafta be custom made
and then the mom even or the stepmom even tries to try them on
and course her feet have got big corns so she cant try them on
then Cinderella shes ke hiding in the back
kindof quivering while the youknow this is all going on
and the prince sees her and says
you look kindof like her except you look kindof dumpy today
looks like your dress is gone
but why dont you try this on
and she comes out
and the stepmother says
no get back there
and the prince says
no shes trying it on or youre going to jail lady
so just shut up
so Cinderella tries the schipper
and then when she turns the slipper on
this is me adlibbing
its not part of the story
but allofasudden the dress comes back on
the prince sees her
and they hug and kiss
and they get married in the cathedral in the big city
and they live happily ever after
okay lets well lets see if we can throw some humor into this tragedy here
we had oh it looks like we had two people that were going for a drive
and they saw a wash
and they decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it
because theyre really cool
and they can do these things
and ofcourse the four wheel drive got run over
and they got washed off the truck and into the flood
and fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck
so they grab that on
and it ooks
and she is holding on to him
and hopefully the police are gonna come and rescue them
or it could be that this guys actually a fireman trying to rescue her
and she was the one that drove the truck into the wash
cant say for sure but
looks like theyre hanging on to the tree
and youknow maybe theyre going to make it maybe theyre not
but well lets assume that they do
they do make it
and they Sheriff Joe arrests them for five thousand dollar fine for doing the stupid driver law
driving through a middle of a wash
but after that they live happily ever after
okay it looks like
lets get a name for this stupid looking kid here
Reginald
Reginald decides hes gonna go out to play
so he goes out in the front garden
and hes playing with his football
soccers what they call it in America
and hes not very skilled because hes an American
and hes not ke British or German or anything
and he kicks it in the window of his neighbor
and kids actually pretty
well doesnt dont see the kid anywhere
looks like the kid ran away
so looks like the neighbors really pissed off because the window it not only came through his window
broke his lamp
and hes looking out the window to seeing if the kid is going to confess up to it or run away
and well we just dont know what happened
whether that happened
lets assume the worst
and lets say that the
and stecide
and calls the cop in
lets get Sheriff Joe in this again
and the kid come
Sheriff Doe
turns out the kids an illegal immigrant and gets deported
lifes hard but thats it is
well it looks like
oh lets get a kid for this name for this stupid looking little kid here
oh well name him after my nephew Eric
looks like Eric is gonna go to school
and his mom ofcourse is saying
you know what
I think its time that you take the umbrella
because Im guessing its gonna rain out
and he says
no Mom I dont want the umbrella
anyways somehow he gets outof the house
mom forces him to take the umbrella
but then he hides it underneath the the the car
and he goes off to school
and guess what
ofcourse mom is right
and it starts raining
and so he kindof ke gets halfway to school
and then he comes running home to mom crying because hes all wet
and mom kindof gives him a lecture
and doesnt let him have
youknow she actually reaches into his backpack and takes out the brownie shed given him take for dessert at lunch and says
no you cant have any brownies you naughty little kid
and gives him the umbrella
and makes him go back to school
and poor Eric then hasta go to school without any brownies because he didnt listen
h
and wouldnt come down
and so the man climbed up the tree to help
and I guess sothat then the man couldnt come down
so somebody call the fire department
fire departments gonna rescue everybody
okay I guess the reason the mans up in the tree is because the ladder fell down
take a slice of bread
an
and I put jelly on it
and enjoy all the grease and sugar you shouldnt have
Id had atrial fribulation
and during those times I got real dizzy and hadta get down in a hurry so I wouldnt fall down
and and a bright light appeared under my eyes
and I couldnt detect any pulse
so I knew my heart had stopped
so I performed a cardial
or defribrulated
I learned how in MensHealthMagazine
and I saved my life several times doing that
because this is a recurring problem with yi me
and the last time I had atrial fibrillation was Sunday morning
and it was so bad I couldnt
so I woke up my wife
shes a very sound sleeper
I woke her up and told her
and she come running around and pounced on it about a dozen times leal
and I knew to every time she come down I exhale
because it works better if my lungs are empty when she pumps my heart
and that brought me around real quick
so I dont think Ill ever let my wife travel without me from now on
shes the only shes the best defibrillator Ive got
""
the scariest thing I had ever had is when I I couldnt get my heart restarted
when I got arrhythmia youknow I can feel the
and they come more frequently than say two beats a second or something like that
and but when when you have atrial fibulation
whats happened was that your pump esn your heart doesnt pump blood
it just flutters
yes
my wife has a seventy percent hearing loss
she doesnt wear a hearing aid because its uncomfortable
and she should
she got no excuse
youknow I I go to SamsClub
I buy her a whole cart full
twenty four for twelve ninety five
and a battery lasts about three or four days
oh the rescuer and a girl about to be rescued is trapped in some brush in a swift swift water flood water
thats what you call a swift water rescue
the man in the flotation jacket is trying to rescue her
and it looks like theyre both in trouble
tangled up in the brush
trapped by the brush in a swift current
well a man a boy has kicked soccer ball through a window
the soccer ball nen
knocks it off the table
the man is getting outof his easy chair
and holding the soccer ball to see where it came from
I guess looking out the broken window
oh the boy wants to go out
and its raining out
so the mothers giving the boy an umbrella
s
he doesnt think its raining hard enough
e then it starts raining harder
and he comes in
all soaking wet
now hes went went to school again with a backpack on his back
this time hes happy because hes got an umbrella
well Cinderella was a beautiful young woman
single woman
that lived with her mother
and her single sisters that were not so pretty
the nicest way I could say it
and Cinderella wanted to go out dancing
but she didnt have a way to get there I guess
so her fairy godmother come to the rescue
and presented her with a carriage pulled by white horses
and to take her to the palace
where the prince was having a party
she was the belle of the ball
and but she hadta leave because she hadta be her fairy godmother told her she hadta be back home by midnight
or her carriage would turn into a pumpkin
and well she had a beautiful time at the party
and when it was midnight she hadta jump out in her she jumped out in her carriage
and it was taken home
shoon
and her carriage turned into a pumpkin
and so she went home
but when she ran outof the palace she lost one of her slippers
and some time later a knock on the door came
and here was the prince come to try the slipper on her foot
and her foot was the only one that fit
it wouldnt fit her
so so he wanted her as a i bride
so she
and her and the prince lived happily ever after
smack well at our house we take the bread outof the freezer
and toast the bread
and then put about a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter
the chunky kind
on the peanut butter sandwich smack
on one side
then on the other side
and smooth it clear across
and then we smack
the two pieces of bread
cut it in half
and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts
but if were gonna eat it we eat it with the crust
thats about how to make a peanut butter sandwich
the dog and the cat were fighting
and the cat climbed up the tree
and the do
and the little girl happened upon the scene
and realized that the cat was in the tree and shes gonna need her dad
so she got her dad
and her dad got the ladder
and they were trying to get the cat outof the tree
but the ladder fell down
but just in the nick of time the firemen who were called by the neighbors came
and helped get the cat and the dad outof the tree
smack
well yes I remember being hospitalized
the most recent one was in NewYorkCity
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at RooseveltHospital
and my right lung had filled up with fluid
and so they kept me
I realized how important it is to have someone with you when youre in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked
the towels were like sandpaper
you were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower
they didnt come
so I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel
I have veins that are very difficult to get blood
so Id always say kiddingly to the people
are ya really good at this
and one man named JoeL told me
hed hed shay
Ive
after about twenty pokes in my hand I said
could you find someone else to draw blood because were not getting it done here
and smack it was really all I could do to get better so I could get outof the place
because its too bad that the staff is so overworked
and probably underpaid
and that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need
I could also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night
ofcourse I wasnt breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things
and she couldnt find the bathroom
so she just used whatever facilities she could find
and when I said something to the nurses that Id like to be moved they just said
well youll probably hafta go on with a cancer patient thats dying
so I was so unaccustomed to hospitals
and Im probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because Im going back to Iowa thinking
and I was sortof on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get outof there
so that was my experience
thats probably the worst experience Ive ever had in a hospital
because everything else is always been won done very well
it was crazy
if you know Roosevelt Hospital
and it just felt I did I did learn though
when I was at RooseveltHospital I was watching Jeopardy on television
and they ask
who was the first SupremeCourt justice
and I looked out the window
and I saw the school at FordhamUniversity
and the first SupremeCourt justice was named for the one that is named in that school as the law school
smack
""
smack Im not sure if I was frightened or scared in this situation
but I was frightened for my daughter
in September of net September two thousand six
on the nineteenth day
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom
that her husband had threatened to kill her
and within twenty hours I was in RomeItaly
and my husband and I decided that one of us should go to help her
and to help her with her husband
and I arrived hoping that I could do something to get them counseling whatever
within twenty four hours he had called the police of Rome
I was alone with him in the house
and I had no help
but I didnt know how to get ahold of my daughter
and the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail
and I immediately thought
smack wonder if I can take my pillow
or should I take my Sudoku game
because if I hafta sit in that police with the police in jail what am I going to do
so I sortof youknow
and then I started trying to call my daughters friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan
and I kept dialing
because I think when youre nervous you dial the wrong thing
I finally got ahold of my daughter
and she came
and we called the carabinieris
and the carabinieris
and Im not sure if I was afraid
I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth to make it happen
and I since then we were trailed
our phone was tapped
the computer was oh the computer was compromised
we we wrote to each other sitting on the sofa
and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time
and Im not sure if I was really afraid
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening
but that was probably the most resourceful that I ever hadta be to protect my daughter and grandson
smack so Im not sure I share that with everyone
but if you wanna know when I was really drawn to action
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating
smack
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it
I think its not so much communicating it as it is understanding
because when I was in Italy trying to communicate with people I used my hands
I used any kind of framework I could think of
another language
smack to communicate with anybody
so I learned street Italian
smack I became pretty clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me
and I learned the words that I needed to use
but I think communication is so vital
and when you dont know the language of someone else its hard to communicate
do you want us to be creative with it
do whatever
well this could easily have happened in Iowa
the DesMoinesRiver was rising in nineteen ninety three
and also in two thousand eight
and people were warned not to be near the river
but people do that

and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it
it went through the window

because he was sitting there
and it knocked over his lamp
and then Im not sure what hes doing in the last picture
but hes looking at the window
the man is looking at the window
and it looks like hes holding something
but maybe hes making a telephone call
I dont know
well typically little boys and umbrellas dont really wanna
because the little boy would be much rather be much happier if he doesnt
but his mother says
you gotta take an umbrella
and at the last minute he said
and he runs outside
and hes in the rain
and hes not so happy
and he goes back home
and he says to mom
I guess
and then he takes the umbrella and leaves
once upon a time
there was a woman with two ugly girls
and a father with a beautiful daughter
and they got married the the man and the woman
so the families were united
and the wicked stepmother with her two daughters made the little girl
who was the fathers daughter

and by the way her name was Cinderella
smack and she worked and she scrubbed
and she had so many things to do all day long
while the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do
but one night there was a special party that the prince was giving
because you see these girls have grown up
and they were teenagers and they were older
and the prince was looking for a princess
smack well the two ugly stepsisters they were getting dresses
and they were gonna get to go to the party
smack but the poor little stepdasister
so off
and two mice came and said to Cinderella
were gonna make it so you can go too
smack and Cinderella they did their magic
and Cinderella got a beautiful dress
and she got a carriage
and she took off
and she danced with the prince all night long
but as the the mice had told her
at the stroke of midnight you hafta be home
so at the stroke of midnight she realized she hadta leave
so she ran
and she ran away
and she left her shoe
and the prince found her shoe
and then she got back home
and they went a and the wicked s stepsisters came back
smack then the prince was looking for the owner of the shoe
so he went out all across
and trying on the shoe
and they came to Cinderellas house
and at Cinderellas house the wicked stepsisters were
and they tried and tried to wear the shoe
but Cinderella wasnt given the chance until at the last they saw Cinderella
and the shoe fit perfectly
and Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the first thing you hafta do is go to the freezer and get the bread outof the freezer
and you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesnt dry out
and if theres only two of you in the house you dont go through a loaf of bread a day so its important to keep it fresh
so you keep the bread in the freezer
so ya go to the freezer
grab the loaf of bread
smack take it out
take out two slices of bread
grab a plate outof the cupboard
and get a knife outof the
smack now go over to the cabinet and get the peanut butter
smack bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter
go to the refrigerator and grab the jar of jelly
smack put the jar of jelly on the counter
and take a knife
grab some peanut butter on the knife
spread it on the bread
put the put the peanut butter o
smack then put the lid back on the peanut butter
open up the jar of jelly
smack take the knife and take the oth
you never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter because it just slides around and its really difficult to work with
so put the put the jelly on the other slice of bread
and youll find that because the bread is frozen its easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly
smack after youve spread the peanut butter and the jelly smack
you can cut on the diagonal
you can cut cross wise
you can cut vertical
you can cut them into as many pieces as you want
if you have a five year ol
after youve cut it well you gotta put the peanut butter back in the cupboard
put the jelly back in the refrigerator
and put the knife in the dishwasher
and now go get a glass
pour yourself a glass of milk
take the
sit down at the table
and have a nice lunch
smack we have a crisis on our hands folks
if this was the evening news it would be reported by
we have a cat thats up in the tree and the cat belongs to a little girl
and dad whos gone up in the tree to try to get the cat down climbed up on the ladder
something happened
the ladder fell down
now weve got the cat and the dad up in the tree
the dog is helping by standing at the bottom of the of the tree barking alot
noise always helps
somher
and theyve got a ladder
and theyre gonna come over
and set the ladder up
get dad outof the tree
and theyll probably get the cat outof the tree too
and then dad will be happy
the cat will be happy
the little girl will be especially happy
and the dog will stop barking
smack okay smack what Im gonna describe is an acoustic neuroma and a craniotomy for acoustic neuroma
smack I discovered this
it was a fairly long phone call
I get a stiff neck
smack
I
so I figured theres something wrong with the ear
my left ear is not hearing the way it should
anyway went to the ENT specialist
and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma smack which is a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull
we did some research
found a surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery
went out had the surgery performed
for the surgery itself smack first thing they do is shave
I had I got a haircut before I went out so it would be short so it wouldnt look like I had
I remember the prep
I remember the shaving
smack then youre under
youre totally outof it
I didnt wake up and have consciousness until
they keep you out because they dont want you moving around
the surgery involves
get the tumor taken off of it
afterwards it was a recovery
it took smack oh
smack I had a nice
and they put Steritape on it to kindof hide it
keep it sterile
the nice part about heading back was
and Id sit in the chair
and Id Id sit sothat that side of my head was
and my wife would go over to the ticket counter and shed say
my husbands had some brain surgery and hes not feeling very good
and is there any possibility that we could move up to first class
and everybody would take a look at me
we got moved up to first class on every flight
kindof neat
but my wife is clever and she does things like that
smack probably but I dont
click nothing comes to mind
I dont remember any specific incident
oh yeah okay
I was listening to
I ate Wheaties for years
Jack Armstrong was some place
I have no idea where he was
I dont remember that episode that well
smack but the neat thing about radio was that it allowed you to use your imagination
television takes away your imagination because you have both the video and the audio
but back in the heydays of radio only you had was the audio
and you could create
and Jack Armstrong was someplace
mighta been ke in SouthAmerica or CentralAmerica
and he was in a cave or a tunnel
and it was very frightening
and it just scared the beejeebers
and thats the last episode that I ever listened to
how old was I
I dont know
six seven someplace along in there maybe
thats thats the one incident I can think of that was a frightening incident
I was scared
smack frequently
no I just I just know that people in general seem to h alotof people have trouble communicating what they really mean
""
alotof times its clear that they know what theyre talking about but they cant find the right word to
smack try to ask questions to get it clarified
sometimes people get alittle short tempered because they want h
if I say to you youknow
well its right there
well where is there
well right there
okay
how far away
you hafta try to draw people out through to ask them some questions sothat they can identify what it is theyre talking about
mkay
Arizona has this thing they call what is the
the dumb driver law
anyway the law basically says if you drive into a gully or a wash after its rained and your car becomes stranded you gotta pay to have somebody come and pull you out
thats what this pictures about
we have a situation here where smack a girl has
theres alotof water
its a flood situation
theres alotof water moving
its moving rapidly
shes been washed downstream
shes gotten to a branch thats sticking up outof the water
shes managed to hang on there for a minute
and one of the guys paramedics or firemen threw on lifejacket
and hes jumped in
and hes gotten to where she is
hes gonna get a hold of her
and theyre gonna get her out okay
and hopefully she wasnt a dumb driver
probably since its a young girl it was probably an accident that she fell in
and were lucky that she got to the point where she could grab a hold of something
and somebody would know where she is and get the paramedics called
and they could get there and rescue her
so yeah I predict theyre gonna rescue her
and theyre both gonna be on the evening news
and hes gonna get an award
smack heres a nice young boy whos out playing soccer
hes practicing because he wants to get ready for the soccer game
and he kicks the ball in the wrong direction as sometimes happens

just startles the heck outof him
knocks over his lamp
breaks the lamp when it hits the floor
the guy picks up the soccer ball goes over looks out the window and says
Kid you aint getting this back
Im teaching you a lesson
youll never do this again to somebody else
what a guy

but Tommy went back
so now moms angry with him
and shes in this I told you so mood
so she gives him the umbrella
and Tommy puts up the umbrella
and walks off to school happy as a clam

but nothing
so they followed me as far as exams went
and three years later I went to the radiologist
and in his examination he said
my goodness I feel a lump
its just where the other one was
so he was in the same building as the surgeon
so I they called up
and the surgeon could see me
so he looked at and he said
ohmygoodness
so I guess within three or four days I had a mastectomy
and that was outpatient
and what they decided to do after that was put me on smack oh its a drug they dont use any Tamoxifen
so I was on Tamoxifen for five years
and I was glad
and since then I have had no signs

in this kingdom there was a family who a mother died
and they had one child called Cinderella
father remarried and the stepmother had two daughters
maybe three
and Cinderella came to live with them
to make one family outof two when the husband remarried
well it wasnt working too well
the stepdaughters and stepmother did not like Cinderella
and they treated her like a maid
she hadta do all the work
and one day a letter came in the mail announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom smack sothat the prince could find a suitable wife
well you can imagine how much excitement this called
and the stepdaughters started thinking about
what will I wear
and preparing their clothes for this occasion
and Cinderella went up and found an dress in a smack chest that held her belongings
and she came down
and was starting to work on making this dress
and the step daughters looked at her and they said
well youre not going
youre not the kind of person that could go to this ball and be the kings the princes
and they even tore the scarf off of her dress the waistband
and smack it was bad
and it made the u Cinderella very
and she smack didnt know what to do
but smack she did have a she went outside and was crying
and the a fairy appeared to her
it turned out to be her fairy godmother that she hadnt known anything about
and the godmother said

so the day of the ball came
and the stepmother and stepdaughters went off in their fancy clothes in a fancy smack horse and carriage
and the godmother did her magic

she turned mice into horses
and she used her magic powers and her wand to dress Cinderella in a beautiful ball ground
and see saw that Cinderella got into the carriage
and went off to the
her only admonition was

and was panicked
and ran away as fast
she did get outof the palace and the palace grounds before the clocks had its last stroke
but her clothes were gone
and she was there in her old tattered clothes
and made her way home
and the magic was gone
she was back to being just a poor little stepdaughter
but the prince found a silver slipper that he knew had been on his loved ones feet
and so he thought
well Ill make a match
Ill go around the kingdom and I can certainly find the person whose foot fits in this
so he did that
smack and when he got to Cinderellas house the stepdaughters tried to cram their feet into the shoe
but it didnt
and Cinderella was peeking around the corner
and wanted to try on the shoe
and stepmother and daughters didnt acknowledge her
but the prince saw her and said
oh would you try on this shoe
and loandbehold it was a perfect fit
and Cinderella had loved the prince too
so they got married and lived happily ever after

it turned out that I had pneumonia
I called down to have them call for my husband who was playing slot machine

and I was caught as as part of the yard there were chickens
and I was caught in the end in the corner by the fence
and I was attacked by a very fierce to me

and smack autistic children mainly or retarded children
and although that was not my specialty when I observed them in other classrooms or when I had encounters with them
we had a neighbor who was autistic
I found it very frustrating because at that point I knew I I could never work with nonverbal children
that was a determinant for me
smack this is a rescue situation
the woman has been s
shes definitely having a problem
and theres a rescuer there
and hes got the rigging to hold on to her and pull her out

so we have lovely little Cinderella who was given terrible jobs
shes with the farm animals
shes cleaning
and her ugly sisters get to have a good time with beautiful clothes
and Cinderella has all the menial tasks around the house
and the little mice in the house seem to be her friends and they help her
and one day someone came to the house I should say castle and said
theres going to be a party
ofcourse the stepsisters were invited
and Cinderella in her torn dress really wanted to go
suddenly her fairy godmother appeared and said
would you like this beautiful dress
and Cinderella said
oh yes
so the fairy godmother touched her with a wand
and Cinderella was the most beautiful person at the ball
and at the ball she danced with the prince
and the clock struck twelve
smack and everything returned as it was
so Cinderella wasnt in her beautiful dress
her beautiful carriage had turned into a pumpkin
and she lost her glass slipper because she left the ball
and lateron smack the prince came by saying whoever belonged to that glass slipper would be his bride
and he tried it on Cinderella
it fit her
it didnt fit her ugly stepsisters
so she got to marry the prince
now heres a little girl

and I looked at her face
and I went to the sink
and I put it youknow in

I says
worst she can do is throw it at me
so I give her the glass of water and she drank it

okay so this is a time when I was in highschool
smack and a girlfriend and I were out to see a movie
smack and her father worked in the movie theater
so
every weekend we could get into the movies for free
well this happened to be a winter night
and it was snowy and slushy
and it was slippery
we were early for the movie
and so we were walking
and having fun
somebody lost their hat in the street
so we were just kicking
but it was
so it landed
and I went to kick it
but I
my foot was right at the edge of the hat
so I
and I didnt realize it
but it didnt go anywhere because I was holding the hat
so the only one who went somewhere was me
so I went skidding
landed
ended up sitting with it in a
and its like
man this is getting swelled this is getting swelled
and when I got home it was like
and my parents were like
yeah it looks alittle swelled

but then I got to have fun because I wore a sling
and I didnt hafta carry any books
but I could still write
yes
this was again when I was little
it was one of the first theme parks one of the first rides that I had ever been on
and my dad took me on this ride
and I I think it was one of those where theres the two rockets
I was actually little enough that I remember the feeling
but I dont remember the ride
but I think it was one of those rockets
one on either side
and theyre going around in circles
and all I remember was being so scared that I was just paralyzed
and my dad is like
go ahead and scream
its okay
scream
and all I was going was
and I
and I I was so glad to be off that ride
yes
smack probably the most obvious example was my mother inlaw who had a stroke
and after she had her stroke she did have a speech therapist but only for about six weeks
and after that she sortof tried to communicate
but then after about a year or two
and alotof times in order to relieve my father inlaw
the rest of the family
just to keep youknow obviously she couldnt stay alone
smack so youknow just to give them a break from each other
and youknow I would look at her old picture books
and ask her questions
and she had a book of the history of the town that she grew up in
so I was asking her questions about it one day
and I kindof ran out of material
smack so youknow we were just sitting there
and she had the tv on
and
and about a half an hour after I asked her the question
she came out with probably a fifteen or eighteen word sentence that described the picture
smack and with her it was just patience
yeah
okay this little gi
it was springtime
and she lived near a creek
because it was springtime there was alotof rains
and the creek near her house flooded
she went over to look at it but slipped in
luckily enough she got caught by a branch that she could hang on to
there was alotof people around
somebody called for help
the fireman did go in to save her
luckily he was strong
could grab her
pulled her outof the creek
and she was fine
oka
practicing with his soccer ball
kicking it around the yard
oops

in it goes
right through the window
and lands in dads lap
after it hits the lamp

I better go home and get the umbrella
he gets home and mom says

so he dries off
takes the umbrella
and heads back to school
okay
once upon a time there was a family
smack a
the father in the family left died went away somehow
leaving the sttepmother
smack the one daughter was the stepdaughter
thats right the one daughter
and then she had
smack well ofcourse she never liked the stepdaughter
so as they were growing up the stepdaughter which ofcourse
so she lived life this way
they grew up
and smack one day when they were all young women
the king and queen decided to have a ball in their town
sothat the prince could meet all the lovely young ladies in the town
because he was quite the eligible bachelor in town
well ofcourse they were all thrilled
well ofcourse Cinderella wanted to go too
but she had no beautiful clothes to wear
and was afraid that her stepmother wouldnt even let her go
smack well she decided that she was just gonna pretend that she was going to the ball
so she made herself a beautiful dress
and decided well maybe she could go to the ball after all
shed after all made herself a dress
smack but when her stepsisters found out about it
they made fun of her
they said
oh look you cant go in that ugly dress
and they
and then ofcourse Cinderella cried
smack the two stepsisters went off to the ball
while Cinderella was crying her fairy godmother shows up
and the fairy godmother says
Cinderella why are you crying
you can go to the ball
and with her magic wand
she makes Cinderella a beautiful new dress
she makes the mice into horses
the pumpkin into a carriage
and they can all transport Cinderella magically to the ball
smack well Cinderella gets to the ball only to be reminded by the fairy godmother that she must leave by the stroke of midnight
because everything is going to turn back into the mice and the pumpkin
and shell be stuck
so Cinderella goes to the ball
nobody knows who this lovely young woman is
everybodys
wow look shes so beautiful
and ofcourse the prince is just awestruck
and he dances with her all night
leaving everybody else just
smack so they dance all night
and the prince just falls in love with her
and Cinderella notices
ohno
the clock
I hafta go
and the prince is like
no no
but Cinderellas like
no no
so she runs
and shes going to meet her pumpkin coach to take her home
but as shes running down the stairs she loses a shoe
the glass slipper
well she has no time
so she leaves it there
the prince chases her
finds the glass shoe
so he he decides
the only way Im gonna find her is to find out which young lady in my kingdom fits this glass slipper
so he goes into the kingdom over the next several days trying the glass slipper on e
and its not fitting anybody
finally smack they get to Cinderellas house
and he tries the slipper on the stepmother
no
smack he tries it on the oldest stepsister
ohmygoodness I can only fit it on your big toe
its not you
he tries it on the next
cant fit it there
you sure
this is the last house in town
are you sure theres no other women in your house
well we have our little slave girl
but youknow she wasnt
alright well comeon lets try it anyway
smack so
and loandbehold it fits just perfectly
and the prince looks
it is you
so he takes her home
and they live happily ever after
the cats stuck in the tree
the dad tried to get the cat outof the tree
but he doesnt look like he was successful
and his ladder fell down
and the little girls standing under the cat crying
and the dogs barking at the man up the tree
and the firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder
and theres also a bird in the tree
well you take two slices of bread
and you put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other one
and you put them together
and that makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
well not on camera but Ive already told you that five years ago I had cancer
I had surgery
I had radiation
I had chemotherapy which lasted well into three months
all my hair fell out
it grew back in
my eyelashes didnt
but
actually my eyelashes came back
I lost thirty pounds
and that was not from being sick
because I was
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo
I I lost it because something in the chemotherapy gave me a very bad taste in my mouth
it tasted like I was chewing on pennies
you ever when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth and felt that taste
thats what everything tasted like to me no matter what it was
and so food just didnt really have much of an appeal
but Im diabetic so I hadta eat
but I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check
so I lost thirty pounds which was not a bad thing
I wish I coulda kept it off
unfortunately as I once we got the the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation
it took about two and a half years
but I gained all the weight back
and I go in two weeks back to my oncologist for my five year checkup
and at that time if all sims
so thats thats
yes
well lets see
when it came to to me probably the most frightening thing I ever had was when somebody somebody a PeepingTom was standing at my window
and I just happened to look up and stared him right in the eye
scared me to death
but on a even deeper level the thing that scared me the most I think
I lived in Japan
and my daughters were one and two
and I had them my husband was in the field and I had them both in high chairs
and I was making hot chocolate for them
and it was the kind where you put
and then you pour the hot water
and my oldest girl was not in a high chair
she was at the table
and I had the powder in both in the cups
and I went
and as I did she was so anxious she decided to get up at the table as
and her fingers hit the
and flipped the cup
and scared me to death
what scared me was she didnt cry
she rtun it was winter and she had
and I hurried up and got that off of her
and got in my car
and you couldnt call nineoneone then
its this is fifty years ago
so I got in my car to take her to the dispensary which was a good ways away
and I had my neighbor I gave the baby
and
and started to the s the dispensary
and as I went through the
and honked the horn like crazy
and he came over
and I told him what had happened
and he said
move over
and he got
and the guy in the jeep in the MP jeep led the way with his siren on
the other MP drove my car
and we went over to the base to the the to the dispensary
and they took her right in
and while I was sitting there she passed out I thought
and the doctor said to me
talk to her
keep talking to her
and so I kept talking
Marianne its Mommy
Marianne talk to me Marianne
and Id watch
the next day he told me that her heart s had stopped
that she had gone into shock
and that it was only
but it scared me
Imean I wasnt even aware of how bad it was
he didnt wanna tell me
I said to him the next day when I took her back to him
I said
why didnt you tell me what was happening
he said
because I didnt need two patients
I only needed one
and you were the only one
it was your voice was the only thing that was gonna bring her back
so thats probably
yes
I worked as a speech therapist I told you this in El Paso Texas at the cerebral palsy clinic there
and alot of the people that I worked with had
they were children for the most part
and I loved working with kids
so that was it was fun for me
but they had all different kinds of problems
ERROR
we didnt know at the time
the diagnosis wasnt thrown around like it is now because this was fifty years ago
and some of them were autistic
the one little girl had had spinal meningitis
and had was now blind
and had a hard time hearing
and couldnt
she was nine
but she they hadta start all over with her like she was a baby to teach her
and they said eventually she was gonna be okay
and I only worked with her for a year or so
I dont know but I did speech therapy with her
the one patient that they sent me to see
Imean I had no business doing any of this
I had no background
but they
and the one patient was a woman who had had a stroke
and had aphasia
and
and she was talking about her cake
but
and I dont think I accomplished a thing with her
I I really dont
but that was before they placed so much value on early work with stroke people
and I
otherthan that I had a daughter
I have a daughter who is has a genetic shes missing part of a chromosome
and didnt talk at all til she was about two and a half
never
and then started off very slowly
and now I cant shut her up
shes fifty five
and has the ntal
well its
she would test probably at about ten years old
she reads
shes a sports fanatic
but it it was a long time coming and working with her trying
to express herself in any way really was difficult
otherthan that I dont think so
its a picture of two people stuck in a flood
and hes hanging on for dear life to a
a tree limb
but he also seems to be wearing a lifevest
so maybe he is a paramedic or fireman or something
I see nothing like that on her
so I guess hes in there to rescue her
yeah I think thats about all I can tell you
I wouldnt wanna be either one of them thankyou
""
okay
the little boy is kicking a soccer ball around
and it goes through somebodys window
into a room where it knocks a lamp down
and theres a man sitting
and he gets up and looks out takes the ball and looks out the window
I dont really see theres an end to that story
he winds up with the ball
but Im sure it didnt end there
thats about the best I can tell you on that one
mkay
okay
little boys going out the door with his backpack
apparently hes going to school or something
and mother wants him to take an umbrella
and he tells her
its not gonna rain
he doesnt want an umbrella
and he goes out
and pretty soon its raining
and he goes running home through the puddles with his hands trying to keep the water off his head
and shes standing there waiting for him because she knew hed be back or drown one or the other
and he goes off again with an umbrella
a man has a daughter
and apparently is a widower
and marries a woman who has two daughters
and but he must travel alot because hes never around in the rest of the story
the stepmother doesnt like the the stepdaughter
and turns her into a maid for her two daughters and for herself
and shes the one that hasta clean and wait on them
and and shes very good with the anima
and and theyre her friends because she really has no other friends
and the meanwhile at the castle the king decides hes going to throw a ball for the prince because the prince should get married
and hes not showing any signs of being interested in anybody
so they put out the word that theres gonna be a ball
and they send out invitations
and the stepmother gets the invitation and sets to making ready her two daughters
and Cinderella who they dont even consider as part of the family goes into the trunks of things that o probably were her mothers
and makes herself a dress
which they totally destroy and tell her shes going nowhere
and and she cries
and shes all upset
and her fairy godmother comes
and dresses her in this beautiful dress
and turns her mice into footmen
and her horses into the horses for this beautiful carriage
and sends her off to the ball
but tells her that she hasta be home before midnight
so she goes to the ball
and ofcourse the prince falls in love at first sight
and shes all hes interested in
while stepmama and stepdaughters are just dont know what to do with themselves
and at five to twelve allofasudden Cinderella realizes she better get home
so she goes tearing out
and as she runs away loses one of her glass slippers
and goes home and everything
the coach the everything the beautiful dress
and all she has left is the other glass slipper
so the prince is beside himself
he decides he hasta find her
so he sends this one of his people out to find her with the slipper
and they everybody in the realm hasta try this slipper on
and ofcourse it doesnt fit anybody because obvious she she had very tiny feet
and finally they find her
she tries the slipper on
and the prince marries her
and they live happily ever after

to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients
that would include two slices of bread
smack or one slice that youd fold in half
peanut butter and jelly
with butter or margarine being optional
depending upon the individuals taste
lets assume that you have two slices of bread
smack you then hafta make a decision as to whether or not youre going to
or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly
some people prefer a to put the peanut butter on the bread first because they dont like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth
so trying to satisfy as many people as possible were going to take a knife
and well spread the peanut butter on the bread
one slice or two
depending upon how much you wanna fill the bread
and then well put the jelly on top of the peanut butter
put the two pieces of bread together
and you are finished
after putting it on a plate and finding a napkin

and to your cat
and someonell be there to help right away
well she was just out there talking for just a minute when she heard the siren
and a fire big fire truck pulled up in front of her house
and those wonderful firemen who not only put out fires
but they help kids and dads and cats and everyone
came running with a different ladder
and they put the ladder up against the tree
and Daddy was able to get the Minnie the cat
and come down the ladder
and everyone was safe
and everyone was happy again
smack I have been fortunate to have had excellent health
I have not been hospitalized since having my tonsils out when I was in fourth grade
I do remember that
and know most people remember the great difficulty of swallowing
what I remember was the aftertaste of the ether that was used for anesthetic in those days
and the nightmares that were prompted because of the anesthetic
with recurring dreams about giant pythons and jungle creatures
but smack otherthan that my life has been pretty free of physical difficulties
""
nothing prolonged
probably the first thing that I came to mind was maybe seeing our son when he was maybe four or five years old go down a f
and hitting a cement floor on the on on on the bottom
that kindof stopped our hearts momentarily
but both of us were trained in rescue procedures
and so therefore we didnt particularly panic
we just dealt with him by the prescribed nna manner we learned from our emergency medical services training
and it all turned out well
but it was quite frightening at the moment
smack my experience has been very very limited with that
being that weve not had people in our family who have been physically challenged
and in our acquaintance group most of them are been very very healthy
I do have one rather humorous incident of a good friend of mine who had a slight stroke
and smack complained about it that his his mind was going a thousand miles an hour as usual but his mouth only went about twenty five
and he was very frustrated about that
this story smack takes place in Arizona
during the monsoon season
in which one of Arizonas drivers did not heed the warning signs about
do not enter when flooded
and drove her car down into a low area
and found that her car was quickly filling up with water
that the motor had conked out
and that the the car was actually being pushed off the road
she was eventually q forced to crawl out the window and crawl up to the top of the car
and try to to wait there until some help would be arrive
she did have her cellphone with her
was able to call nineoneone
and the sheriffs department dispatched both their helicopter and the paramedics and rescue squad crew
the the car eventually from the force great force of the water was tipped over onto its side
and and the lady in distress was washed down the fast flowing stream
where she caught on to a branch
and eventually hung and clung on to the branch until such time as a helicopter
which was hovering overhead
was able to lower one of the smack paramedic technicians by rope down to be able to rescue her
and to retrieve her back to safety
her life was saved
eventhough she put the paramedics into great danger
the car was lost
and she paid her ten thousand dollar fine for dispatching the helicopter
Billy liked his new soccer ball
which he had just gotten for his birthday
and he was practicing kicking it
when the ball slipped off the side of his foot and went right through the picture window of his neighbors house
and landed in the lap of his neighbor
smack knocking over the lamp shade
and breaking the window
smack his neighbor
who was the soccer coach
would probably have been more angry
but he knew about the skill and he knew that accidents happen
so
youknow I think what we needta do is to be able to fix your directional kicking
and so they went to the playground
and to the ball field
and the coach soccer gave some direction to the ball player
and it all turned out well
hows that for a positive spin
a mother was reminding her son that it was
the weather forecast looked like it was going to be rain today
and she handed her son an umbrella
smack smack and he said
no no no
it wont rain today
and I dont wanna
thats really twinkie
and and I dont wanna have my friends laughing at me for carrying an umbrella
so off he went to school with his backpack on
and he got halfway there almost when it started to pour rain
and he didnt wanna go to school
and he didnt wanna face his mom
so he hadta choose between two bad choices
smack and he returned home
where he changed clothes
mom handed him his umbrella
and off he went to school
on his second trip that day
but was late
tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can
smack there was a smack man and a woman got married
and the woman had two little girls young girls by her first marriage
and the man had a little girl by his first marriage
and so they combined their families
and the two stepsisters I think were not very nice to the new stepsister
and they were alittle older
and they ordered her around
and and they were really really mean to her
so she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her new stepsisters or siblings
in the land that they lived there was a and they and the girls grew up and to become young ladies
and with Cinderella virtually becoming the the personal servant of her two stepsisters
in the land that they lived there was a a king
who who had a son
who would take his place
but the king was concerned that his son was unmarried
and they needed to socialize
and decided that they would have a ball
in which they would invite all the young eligible young ladies in the kingdom to come and to enjoy a a marvelous ball at the royal palace
and the invitation came in the mail
and the two ps stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to go to the ball and dance and maybe find the the young prince to be of interest
but they planned and schemed that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend and and was excluded
and when it came time to leave for the ball Cinderella was left behind
but was visited by a a a fairy prince
who knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella
said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella
and turned her into this beautiful young lady
and provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin
and told her that she wud
which she did but that she hadta leave
and be home by midnight
at which time she would be restored to her her normal self
so Cinderella went to the ball
and much to the chagrin of the stepsisters and the other young ladies in attendance
was immediately noticed by the prince
who was captivated by her
and the prince and Cinderella danced and danced
until almost the stroke of twelve when Cinderella remembered that she hadta back into her pumpkin coach
and ran outof the palace
and jumped into her pumpkin coach to return to her home
but in her haste one of her slippers that I think was made of glass or something would had fallen off
and she returned home
well the prince who was in hot pursuit
was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin
smack drawn by these horses
but did find the slipper
and commanded his his helpers to search throughout the realm for a young lady thats foot would fit in that slipper
and so the h
and eventually came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters
and try as they may the stepsisters could not put their large feet into the glass s
but the smack the attendant tried the glass slipper on Cinderella
and Cinderellas foot fit perfectly
and so the attendant knew that Cinderella was the the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball
and took her with him back to the back to the royal palace
where she and the prince were united
and became a couple
and were married
and lived happily ever after
or something like that
well youve got to get the bread someplace
and then you place the bread on the table or wherever you wanna put it
you take one slice and put the peanut butter on the bread
then you go to the other slice of bread and you put the jelly on it
then you fold them together and enjoy
a story about people or animals in distress
the birds up there for some reason
I dunno what hes doing up there
that dog must have chased him up there
as he did the cat
the girl got off her bike to try to save the cat
looks like the man went up there on a ladder to save the cat
and the ladder fell down
I dont know how it fell down but it fell down somehow
now the firemans coming over
two of them
in order to get the guy down from the tree
the birds still singing there
""
I dont see any more to talk about
theres a fire engine
when I was in the army like went in the when I was nineteen years old
and after month and a half I caught pneumonia
I went into the hospital
come back out after f
I spent three days in the barracks and got double pneumonia
went back in
almost died
and then I come back outof the hospital
and after a few days or a few weeks
I finished my basic training
and went out on with life
I useta work at the steel mill
and before the steel mill closed down they constantly made your they
demoting you constantly
until I got another job where I hadta cut a bail of wire in a hurry
which I dont
consequently I caught I I caught the tip of my finger pulling the wire into the blades
inadvertently my finger got stuck and I cut off the tip of my finger
oh what else
oh so theres so many things
ERROR
my wife and I went out for breakfast
we came home
and she got severely
I didnt know what it was
she was vomiting and moving
I hadta call nineoneone to get her into the hospital
consequently she spent ten weeks in the hospital
she had a blood clot on her lung and her leg
almost died
come very r very close
I hadta call the daughter in
and that was about the scaredest
shes home now and doing well
but I didnt think she was going to
yes
they dont seem to let their emotions out
and Im
I just
and I try to kid around with them to get them to come
if thats if thats what it is
to help them break loose
alright
now
this picture it appears to be a fireman or somebody of a rescue nature
and a girl
in what appears to be a creek or a river
especially fast moving water
the gentleman I say gentleman because hes all muscular and looks like hes got a moustache
is hanging from a tree branch
which is either coming up outof the water
or going into the water
it looks as though its coming outof the water
s
to keep herself from floating down the stream or river
whatever
he has a a leather belt which he I presume hes gonna put around her
and maybe a helicopter or a another set of rescue people will pull her in from the precarious area shes located at now
looks like everythings gonna turn out okay
that is probably of the end of the story
alright
now
the beginning of the story is a picture of a boy kicking a volleyball
he seems to be having a good time
but negligent in the fact that he doesnt know where hes kicking it
now hes kicked it into the window of a home
and by some reason hes kicked it through the window
the ball has knocked the lamp off the table
a f
theres also theres stuff laying on the floor
the man now gets up
looks out the window which yeah hes closer so the window would it the hole will look open more
hes got the ball in his hand looking out I guess who to blame or seeing where it came from
hopefully the the story ends good where realizes he was a kid one time
okay
this looks like a story between a a mother and a child
because its raining outside
and hell need it
the kid as most kids are says
no I dont need it
its not going to rain
Ill be okay
as he goes outside it starts raining
I dont know how far he got but it looks like he got pretty far
because now theres water all over the ground where hes walking
looks like his heads getting wet and everything else
so finally he hasta go in and face mother
admit that hes wrong
mother looks very upset with him
she should be
he gets the umbrella
goes back outside and continues on his journey wherever he was going
looks alot happier
okay
theres a thing about that
they they useta run a skit on that on on tv one time
Ill tell you later
the story opens up with
and it looks to be a charge or whatever you call them guys
and the dog is sitting beside Cinderella
through the whole story
the king or duke or whoever he is
tells his servant make arrangements for the prince to meet with all the fairest maidens in the land
and sends out tith notices that a a partys gonna be held
meanwhile Cinderella gets smack her dress out
and all her nice clothes
gets all dolled up
and is getting ready to to go to the ball with mother stepmother and and the stepsisters
enraged the stepsisters tear her dress
and just trash her out
and the stepmother seems to be enjoyed enjoying the whole thing
smack after that the Cinderella looks at the castle
and oh no that was before she was dreaming about meeting some PrinceCharming
now she has no dress or nothing to go to the ball with
and turns a pumpkin into a coach
a dog and a horse
I forgot about that part of the story
the dog and the horse into a to the horses and the to the to the guys or charges whatever you wanna call them guys
and the mice into the horses thatll pull Cinderella to the ball
they all get to the ball
and Cinderella ofcourse takes nc or the prince takes fancy to Cinderella over the rest of them
Cinderella was told that that everything would turn into back the way it was at the stroke of midnight
as the princess prince
the hour of twelve approaches
Cinderella says
its time to get outof here
in her haste and running she drops her glass slipper
takes off with the pumpkin coach and her cohorts
and she gets back to where she she began
and everything turns back into way it was
the prince despondent that the girl ran away tells his servants
announcements were sent all over the land to try
the girls the two si sisters tried on the slipper
they were not a match
and eventually Cinderella tried on the slipper and
an
thats the end of the story
I would take two pieces of white bread
smack with a crust
and I get out the peanut butter jar
and take a knife
and spread peanut butter on one side
get the jelly
it hasta be cold jelly
and put jelly on the other side
and put them together
and then probably cut

they wanted to send me to a nursing home for rehab because one of the last things I had was pancreatic cysts

I was working at the time
and I had like fifteen years in
and smack it just
so for him to
he lived with us for a short time and then he went into nursing home care
but it was you did what you
mhm
mhm

or maybe it was some kind of disaster
that put her into some flooding
where she was washed away from her home or fell off of a cliff or something
and a gentleman with a waterproof vest is hanging on a tree or in some kind of harness to try and rescue her
to get her to grab onto the same thing
smack looks like he has a belt around himself
but I cannot tell if she has a belt around her or not
and theres rushing water all around them
mhm
smack a child was playing soccer or kickball
smack and accidentally kicked the ball into a window
shattered the window
and it landed in a living room perhaps
where a gentleman was sitting

and the gentleman greets the lady with her two daughters
the lady is holding a cass
the man has his daughter to his side
and shes curtseying
the cat is in the womans arms
smack the next picture shows two grown sisters stepsisters maybe
with Cinderella blonde carrying a tray
looks like a tea kettle and maybe a cup or two
and then the mother or stepmother or whatever this lady with the dark hair or gray hair is
is reading something
perhaps about a ball
smack and the girls her girls are very excited
and Cinderella was looking forward to going
with a beautiful pink and white dress with bows
and the mice were all excited for her and everything
and smack Cinderella got to the ball
and smack the girls or maybe wasnt when she was at the ball
maybe it was before
the mother and her girls were standing there
and the girls took part of Cinderellas dress
a ribbon off crisscross
and smack the
maybe a fairy godmother
that had a magic wand
and there was a gentleman with ke a whitish color pumpkin
and three or four horses that were not acting normal
and she was giving Cinderella a white dress to take to this ball
smack and Cinderella had this white dress on
and she was dancing with the prince
smack and she noticed the time was close to twelve oclock
just a few minutes before
smack and she hadta run
and in the middle of her running she lost a glass slipper
smack and smack a gentleman was calling out to her about the slipper
and she continued to go back
a gentleman came to the house
the stepmother or whatever she was used her cane to trip the gentleman
another gentleman came and was trying the slipper on
and the mother or stepmother and the two girls were shocked when the glass slipper fit
so she at the end she and the prince were in the pumpkin carriage
and the two mice at the end were dressed up in some kind of drum major majorette costume
and appeared excited that they were together
the end
okay we have a little girl looks like whos cat climbed up on the tree
and the father who climbed into tree on a ladder to retrieve the cat
and the ladder fell down
so they hadta call the fire department
to rescue the father
in the meantime the dog is barking at the father or the cat
and the little girl is calling to the cat
which she rode a tricycle to get to
smack and thats about it that I can think
you take two pieces of bread or two slices of bread
you get a jar of peanut butter
and you spread one side of each slice of bread with the peanut butter
then you take a jar of jam
you take a spoon
and you take it and you spread the jam on each side of the bread on each on each slice of bread
then you close the two slices of bread together
then you can cut it in half or do what you want or eat it
bad kitty
poor little kitty ran up the tree
and the and her little I see the girl over there over there the sister oh was crying
my poor little kitty
what should I do
she calls for her farther
and dog is barking because hes worried about the father
I donno
and theyre all worried that the kitty is
and so someone called the fire department who came to their rescue
and I hope everything is gonna be fine
they would get the kitty down
an
and the little darling daughter will be happy and be able to ride her bicycle
howcome the father didnt use the ladder to get the kitty down himself instead of climbing up the tree
well see if the kitty is going to be saved

and he he lives about a block away
and he came over
and he saw me bleeding
and I thought he was gonna drop dead
I wrapped myself in a towel
and I said
drive me to the hospital
and I went the
and I went to the emergency room

where it should be up against a tree
when I had my heart attack we lived up at RooseveltLake
and I knew I was having something
when I was out in the garage putting our stuff away we had brought back from Alpine
and I was storing it in the garage
and I went in
and my left side was just felt like it was gonna explode
and I told my wife I said
call nineoneone
so she did
and it just luck would have it
the ambulance was only five minutes away
so they got there and started work
and they were
and I heard the doctor say
dont try to bring him in a ambulance
were sending a helicopter out
so they says
do you got a good place
so you meet it on top of the hi
so they said
okay
so they loaded me in the ambulance
and it was only about a half a mile to the top of the hill
and they h just had got there when the helicopter landed
and they loaded me on the helicopter
and flew me into Globe
and they stabilized me in at Globe
and my family doctor was there
and he asked me he said
do you have a cardiologist
I Id
said
okay
he said
Ill get one
so he
wait just a minute
he went back and he called this cardiologist
and made an appointment for him to meet the helicopter at the emergency room door when they landed
and when they unloaded me off the helicopter at GoodSamaritanHospital
well he was there and he said
okay well take him from here
so they took me in
and started checking me over and I heard him say
yes he has a a major heart attack
and they started to performing angioplastic surgery on me
so they could put a stint in the block
so they went up both sides
and as theys going up
I heard the anesthesiologist say
weve lost him
and thats
because
and they put
and it felt like they crushed
but they finally brought me to again
they went ahead and put three stints in
and then they put me in a private room
and hadta watch over me all night
so the next morning I was feeling great
and wanted to know when I was gonna go home
if I was gonna go home right then
about that time the assistant come in and checked
and I I said to llw
when you gonna let me go home
she said
in about five days
so they kept me there for
and it was an experience that I will never forget
because
so
and it was even greater
yes
when I looked out the porthole
and I saw a plane go over
and it had the emblem of the rising sun
I just felt the hair
because
I looked over
and saw in the first explosion was on a destroyer
it was at dry dock
and then the battleships
this one after another
started exploding
and then about that time a five hundred pound bomb blew up on the hanger deck of my ship
and that was really scary
the
and I heard them yelling
hes coming in hes coming in
what was doing was a kamikaze
trying to hit
but he missed it
and he crashed
and that
yes
well was mainly we went to the sign language
just motions
wes looking
wes on the beach
I nudn
and we couldnt get ow back to get any food
so the natives was looking at us and
so I finally took this
and he nodded his head
so they give us something to eat
and I still dont know what it was
but it was pretty good anyway
and thats the only time that Ive ever been that in that situation
throat well it looks like the girl is stranded on a a bush in the water
and the guy is trying to rescue her
hes trying to put a lifebelt on her
and and also a recovery rope
so they can pull her out
and hes got one
and and that looks as though were
""
and he kicks the soccer ball
and it goes through the window
and bounces in the guys bed that was inside
and broke the big window
and then he takes the ball
and hes standing there
looking out to see if hes gonna come and get the ball
so
""
and mother s
you gonna take your umbrella with you
so
why oh yes
he said hes gonna take it
but he gets to school
and he starts home
and he forgot his umbrella
and its pouring down rain
so he decides hes gonna go back and get it
and he forgot his before
and he went on home without it
so then he went back and got it
after hes all wet
and
well it started out as a wicked witch and her two daughters
was very
and she was taken to live with them
and they made a slave outof her
and they put her in every kind of a bad n circumstance that they could
and she went ahead and did the work very jolly
and then she got to
so she wanted to
a
and the fairy godmother waved a wand
and got a coach uh outof a pumpkin with a handsome prince in it
so he had a pair of glass slippers for her to wear
and if she wasnt back home by midnight well the coach would turn back to a pumpkin
and the prince would leave too
so
she ran off and lost one of the slippers
so the old man he found it
and he went around trying to find who it was that who had the slippers on
so he finally tried the wicked witch
and her feet was way too big
and her two daughters ugly daughters
they couldnt fit into it
and they had her locked in the basement
and the two mice got the ke
went underneath and gave it to her
so she was able to get out and go up

well I been pretty lucky all my life
I about the worst thing I can think of is I had a knee replacement
and I was in the hospital for six days
and had alotof therapy
lots of therapy
my husband gave me therapy
and and
and my knee is fine
but thats and but it it was painful
but he gave me alotof therapy
and and I got it in the hospital
therapy in there
and
just just
and and thats just about the only thing
I had my tonsils out
its been a long time ago
many many years ago
but I been real fortunate
when I was frightened or scared
oh from the beginning
well when I was little my dad was a barber
and he he his barber shop was right next to a grocery store
and a and a so my s a friend of myself and me we went to the went in there
and I decided I was gonna charge some candy to my daddy
he had account there
so I went in
and I bought some candy
and my mother found it out
and after my mother found it out
then she told my dad
he was very good
my mother did
and she gave me a really a good one
and that scared me
and thats one of the things
I can still remember that
she had a little switch
and she just switched my legs real good
wasnt wasnt
but but
and and I cried and cried and cried
but thats one thing I can remember long time ago
and lets see anything else that scared me
now when Kenneth had a heart attack it scared me
and he said
you should call nineoneone
and I did that
and a its in early in the morning
and I dont know
that was about ten years or twelve years ago
and I was
and then not long ago he broke two ribs
and one day and about two days later
he fell
broke them
and about two days later he came in one morning
and he
thats the recently
ERROR
you better call nineoneone
I think Im having a heart attack
so I call nineoneone all scared again
I was kindof calm
but I was pretty scared
and we went to the hospital
and doctor they took tests and they just for that day
and then that evening that afternoon evening his own doctor came in
he looked at him real good and
real real good
he said
Ken you
youve got two broken ribs
well we were very relieved
but it was scared me in the beginning
I dont know I dont know of anybody that
I I
I cant remember anybody
I cant
well it looks
thats water isnt it
thats water
looks like a little girl fell into the creek or in the river river where there was branches or logs or or branches from trees there and twigs
she fell in there
and I guess she was hollering and scared hollering
and perhaps the people
wait I cant see that
maybe it was in a a boat or on the bank or something with them lifejackets on
and they jumped into the water
and I dont know what that is there
jumped into the water
and saved the little girl
she hadta hold onto the branch to save the little girl
but theres really dangerous
but evidently she was saved xxx
well well the little boy was out
you ready
the little boy was out playing with the basketball I guess soccer ball
kicking it and playing
and it it went right he kicked it right through a window and broke the window
and inside of the house was probably his father sitting there
it knocked over broke the window
it knocked over a lamp
and his dad looked very surprised
the last picture he looked at the window
the father was just o
he has the ball
and just looking at the window
and thats it
thats what I can see
the little boy was going to school I guess
he was going to school
and it was ready ready to rain
his mother wanted to give him the umbrella
and
so she was giving the umbrella
and he wouldnt take it
he said
bye bye
hes going on to school
so when he got out there it started raining real hard
he ran back to the house in the rain
and his mother told his mother
she gave him an umbrella
and he went on to school
once a
there was once upon a time a a tha ugly mother and her two ugly r and her two ugly girls daughters
and they were very selfish children
and evidently the
I dont know who it was
but it brought it brought the other Cinderella to her home to take care of
she hadta take care of the the Cinderella
well Cinderella was a very beautiful little girl
and they the stepmother and daughters treated her terribly
so she just went try to do the best she could
she hadta do all the work for them
and one day she looked in a trunk
and there was a beautiful dress in there
so she hung this
and I and then the fairy godmother came and to her and was talking to her
so then the evidently the fairy godmother must have talked to her
then the the th the ugly mother received a invitation to the a ball for them all
and Cinderella wanted to go
and the fairy godmother was there for her
and she put on I think she put on this pretty pink dress
and then there was then when she then the fairy godmother evidently ordered a pumpkin with four horses and a fellow to to take her in there
and she was dressed up
then they had put beautiful clothes on her
beautiful clothes
and she danced all evening
then when the clock struck twelve she hadta leave
she had this glass slipper on
beautiful clothes
she had this glass slipper on
and she was leaving she dropped it
and they looked all over for the slipper and where the little girl was
because the prince was very enchanted with her
well I guess the jester or the footman or somebody had tried the i the slippers on all the other daughters and the mother
wouldnt fit
but it fit the little girl Cinderella
then nder then I guess the footman went back to the prince and told him
and the prince went to her and fitted her foot with the shoe
and they lived happily ever after xxx

and I would sit up alot
and in the morning when I got up my wife Angela said that she had called the doctor and made an appointment because I had been saying no no theres nothing wrong
its just my allergies
and she was tired of hearing me up all night
so not very happily I left and went to the doctor and actually the doctor practitioner
and she checked me out
and she said shes leaving for a minute and came back with another doctor
and they said well you have congestive heart failure
we needta put you in the hospital
so I spent the next three days in the hospital being treated
that was it
Ill go back to when our youngest was probably thirteen fourteen years old
and it was winter time
and she had gone to the school dance with one of her friends
and the two girls had left the house and headed for the dance
and we were just relaxing at home
and the phone rang and said this is the Valley Medical Center emergency room

and she was found in a snowbank
and shes in hypothermia
were trying to warm her up
and at that moment I just went totally faint
and I couldnt think of anything
and we went down
and the doctor came out
and he says well weve got her stable
and shes warming up fine
but her and her girlfriend or her girlfriend when she came had a coke can full of her fathers vodka
and the two girls drank it
and they didnt fare too well
thats it
times hard times communicating
what come back to try to figure out just one I cant think of a specific
Im sure in travels weve been looking at things and wanna buy them and asking questions they cant
so you just hand and foot and motioning
and you get things across
I dont know thats hard
theres a young lady shes out on a nice afternoon walk
its alittle stormy and rainy
but shes having a nice time
and she sees something
she goes down by the river and accidentally falls in
and shes going down the river
she gets ahold of a branch
and the aid people are called out
and a fireman rescuer goes out on a harness and gets her
and they pull her in
and everythings fine after they check her out
little Johnny looks like hes getting ready to go to school
moms telling him heres the umbrella

its just fine
so he Johnny heads for school
and he gets partway
and it starts raining

and he gets changed and dried up
and he takes his umbrella and heads for school just happy as can be

and all ends well
they get the picture window fixed
and everybodys happy
this is a story about Cinderella
her father gets married and shows her stepmother and stepsisters
well its not so happy for Cinderella because the stepsisters are like old princesses
her stepmother is a wicked old lady
and Cinderella hasta be a servant to them all
and but shes very happy out with the animals in the barnyard
and she stands in the her room looking out the window at the castle and dreaming
within herself shes very happy
and the king in the castle he wants the prince to find a wife
and so they send out an announcement of a upcoming ball that they might introduce all the young ladies to the prince

and a pumpkin in the garden turns into a pumpkin carriage
the old nag is a beautiful horse
and the mice become foot men for the carriage
Cinderella is in a beautiful white flowing gown when she goes to the party
and shes just the highlight of the party
everybody notices her
and shes having a good time
the prince is dancing with her
and she noticed the time
and she had been told that this spell goes away at midnight
and so she runs off outof the dance
while running she drops one of the glass slippers
and the next thing shes sitting on the pumpkin
the old nag is there
and the four mice theyre just sitting
well the king wants to know who this girl was
and nobody comes forward nobody

and she goes to try on the slipper
and the stepmother tries everything to keep her from it
but finally she tries the slipper on
and so shes the one
and the prince and Cinderella are married and live happily ever after
depending on the requirements of the eater you may cut off the crusts or not
you butter the bread in my opinion
then you put on peanut butter
and then you put on the jam
and then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top
and cut it in any way you so desire
ri
al
we have a man stranded in a tree
because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat
because a little girl was crying because a cat was up in the tree
and smack after the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down
a dog came along and is barking up the tree
and the firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man
and Im assuming everything ends up okay
the end
well the most recent episode is a broken bone
but it was
I had been having pai
the more I walked the more it hurt
but I really just kindof ignored it
I was more concerned about my right foot with the toe nail looking like it was lifting off the bed
and I didnt quite know what to do about this
so I made a appointment with the foot doctor
but my foot doctor is in Waukegan smack Illinois
and lets see
how did that work
ohboy
we came we came directly from we had been on a a cruise
and we had visited our children in in Orlando
and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan so I could see the foot doctor
smack a
but anyway when I finally got to the foot doctor she just explained that the
so she just
took half a
that was done
and then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting
an
an
and that led to xrays
which showed there was a small broken bone
which led to my having to wear a boot for a month
and then come back for more xrays
so
then I turned arou
more xrays
and the stupid thing is not healed yet which is usual for me
because this whole scenario happened once before
and she says
another month with the boot
smack an
and I forgot to do it
no I did it yesterday
and smack she also told me that when I came when I would be coming back the end of this month she would not be there because her husband was taking a job somewhere else
and ofcourse shes following him
smack and nice thing about the visit is I really like that foot doctor as a person
and shes pregnant
and shes gonna have her second child
and I thought that was real nice
but anyway I said
well since youre not gonna be here in a month I will get a foot doctor in Arizona
so thats where I am now
Im waiting for this stupid foot to heal
the end
ohmy
lets see
right
first I hafta think frightened or scared
smack
smack we had in the bathroom was a crawl not a crawl space was a a a cubicle
I dont know how to describe it
you had your linen closet
and then underneath the linen linen closet was an open area
which had a area inside of it to get to the plumbing in the bathtub
and we used that open area for a dirty clothes
except there
and for a reason I dont remember smack the children told me that there was a big animal looking outof this area
so
well
but nevertheless I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldnt get out
and then we we went outside
and we saw
Im not sure
with its
looking out at us from the air vents I guess you call those that are in the foundation of the house
smack and that really scared me
I thought
if that thing gets in the house or gets out it could bite the kids
and it might be b rabid
so I called the animal shelter I think it was
smack and they told me that they everybody was on lunch
smack and so they wouldnt be there for an hour
which
because if someone gets bit I will sue the city
smack so
and the men were not happy to see this
because he really looked
and they took off the vent
and somehow they caught him
smack and then they discovered I believe this is they discovered a nest of baby opossums
which all looked very cute
when theyre babies theyre all kinds of babies look cute
so anyway they took the opossum and babies away
and the story ended happily ever after
okay
well my mother had a stroke
and but thank the good lord that he
so I was able youknow we were able to communicate with no problem
but I remember one time again living in my own home in in Waukegan
my neighbor who who was going to be my husband
but ofcourse
he he rents out a I call it a garage
it was
so anyway he rents out the garage and theres Spanish speaking couple there
smack smack and the lady comes over to my house and somehow communicated to me that she had locked herself outof her house
smack an
smack so
and I dont I didnt have any children that would
and I dont even remember if the kids were home
but then I took her
and spoke Spanish
smack and so then we found out for sure what the problem wa
and I volunteered to take the lady to work
and that wouldnt wasnt feasible
because she hadta have her id
which was locked in the house
so then we went down the street further where I knew a
and we got this asked this child to help
but ofcourse he answered the door very cautiously
and told us that he couldnt come outof the house
because hes not allowed to come outof the house when mom and dad arent home
well when mom gets home come and see us
so wasnt too long mom came home
he comes up the street
he climbs in her
and end of story again
smack well Im ready
this this looks like a a a picture of a flood
smack and of a girl I would say rather than a young woman kindof trapped in the in the flood
and a fireman or some kind other kind of rescue personnel is going to try to rescue her
hes hanging on for dear life to a limb
and hes got what looks like a belt over an arm
perhaps to put around the smack girl to rescue her
and this looks like it could be an actual picture of a real happening
smack the end
okay
Im ready
smack we have a boy playing outside with what looks like a soccer ball
and he kicks the soccer ball
which goes through a window ofcourse breaking the window
knocks over a lamp
which startles a man who is sitting in a chair
and the man gets u
an
and hes looking out through the broken window
and thats the end of this story
oh
okay
smack we have a child a mother holding an umbrella and a child who I would guess is going to school
because it looks like hes got a backpack on
and hes telling her
and moms not too happy about this
but she lets him go
and he waves
and he goes outside
and ofcourse it starts raining
smack and hes running back home through the puddles
and getting all wet
and hes holding his head
and he goes in the house
and mothers not happy
smack because hes standing there dripping
and then the next picture shows him back outside with an umbrella
and he has miracasly
the end
smack well ofcourse I know the Cinderella story
we start out with Cinderellas father remarrying to a woman who turns out to be oh a mean stepmother
and she has two daughters who she dotes on
and they also are mean
and smack a father goes off on a business trip or something or other
and he
he doesnt return
so Cinderella is stuck with Stepmother and two mean stepsisters
and she waits on the stepsisters
and no matter what she does it isnt right
and smack she looks Cinderella can look out her window and see the castle where the prince and I assume the king and queen live
and smack the
because hes getting up in age
and he hasnt married
and theyre telling him
so they
smack and invitations are sent to every every house
and Stepmother and Stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that theyre going to go to
and Cinderella gets a a lovely dress outof a trunk
and the stepsisters get all dressed
and Cinderellas helping them with everything
atleast in this book she gets a dress outof the trunk
but
but anyway she helps s the girls the ladies get dressed
and smack she ofcourse is planning on going
but Stepmother and Stepsister say
no way
you cannot go
an
and Cinderella is in tears
and shes sitting by the fireplace and the cinders and so forth
and FairyGodmother comes along and tells us asks Cinderella if she would like to go to the ball
and ofcourse Cinderella says
yes
but she hasnt got any way to go
and and she was told to stay home
but FairyGodmother does her magic
and smack Cinderella has another
and the fairy godmother turn
and mice into horses
I think its mice into horses
and somebody turns into I guess whatcha would call a coachman
and they
and shes the belle of the ball
smack and the prince is taken with her
and theyre dancing and so forth
and then allofasudden its almost midnight
which is when the fairy godmother told Cinderella she hadta be back home
becau
and the coach would disappear
and all that kind of thing
so she goes
and as shes running away she drops a glass slipper
smack and she gets home
and then the prince and his footmen are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits
and the wicked
well Im not sure if they were wicked
but they sure were mean
ERROR
and ofcourse it didnt fit
and s
and he tries the slipper on her
and it fits
and they get married
and they live happily ever after
spread peanut butter on the bread
spread the jelly on it
put the bread together
cut it in half
okay well a guy climbed up a tree to get a cat
and apparently he got himself stuck there too
and so the fire department comes to get him down
I sprained my ankle playing tennis a few years back
I was just actually I was in between points
and I was just kinda like like trot towards the ball as it was rolling off the the tennis court
and my ankle just went out from underneath me
it was really black and blue
it was a pretty bad sprain so about the worst injury Ive had
yeah I guess so
well Imean how frightened
how scared
Imean what do you mean
just like
nothings really coming to mind
Im sure youknow
oh I almost got into a car accident once
that was scary as it was about to happen
let me see
there was a time I remember ke a car accident next to me that was really scary
allofasudden there was youknow just this crunch of metal laying next to me
so youknow it was startling
both both drivers seemed to be alright
and I just drove off afterwards
my lane was stopped at a light
and just it was time to drive on
and I just drove on
nobody was ke hurt on the side or anything youknow so
yeah ke some of my coworkers English isnt their first language
and one of them he kinda his Imean his English is pretty good
but he he ke mumbles
he cant really enunciate very well
and so I just ask him I just ask to repeat what he said when I dont understand it
it works
okay so a girl got caught in a flood
and a guy came to rescue her
hes got ke rescue harness kindof stuff and is having some trouble getting her outof the water into the harness because of a tree in the way
so thats where we are
hes kindof struggling to get to her there
okay a kids playing with a soccer ball
and he accidentally kicks it through a window
and so it knocks goes through a window and knocks over a lamp where this guys sitting
and so he picks it up and hes looking out the window for youknow what happened
okay a moms sending her kid off to school
and she tries to give him an umbrella
and he doesnt want the umbrella
and then it starts raining on him
and its raining really hard
so he turns around and goes back home
and hes all wet and gets the umbrella
and now hes happy walking in the rain
okay so Cinderella moves in with her her stepsisters
and she makes friends with a bunch of little animals
and looks like shes like the maid and cleaning the house and stuff
and theres a ball thats happening
and the little animals get a dress for her and stuff
but her st stepsisters ruin it
but then her fairy godmother comes in and uhuh gets her a dress and a and a carriage and and glass slippers
so she goes off to the ball
but then she hasta run off
and the carriage turns into a pumpkin
and and so she winds up back home
but the prince at the ball liked her and has one slipper from when she ran off
and so he ke finds her and ke sees that she fits the slipper
and so then they run off together
alright peanut butter and jelly sandwich
youd start with two pieces of bread
and youd get out your peanut butter and jelly and a butter knife
and you put peanut butter on one piece of bread
and then you put jelly
then you put the pieces together and cut it in half
okay Ive been pretty lucky that I have not had a whole lot of problems
but when I was thirteen right before ke the end of the school year I went to a pool party
and I got hit into the face with one of those
and somebody
and and it landed right here
and I hadta go to the emergency room
and
luckily nothing was broken
but I ended up going to a plastic surgeon and having
and I had two enormous
so
absolutely
okay this is actually I like this story
Imean now I like this story
so my husband and I had gone to WashingtonDC and we were visiting a friend
and we had gone to a bar and played pool and met up with some of my friends friends
and he was walking his date back to her car and we were waiting at the top of the hill for him
he got about halfway up the hill
and two guys ke ran across the street and just started beating up on him
so my husband and I we go running down there
I am on the phone with nineoneone
my husband kinda jumps in ends up getting hit
but my husbands incredibly calm and collected

smack my mother had a stroke five years ago
and with her stroke she
and so her communication is very very different than it ever was before
and so she will say
most of the time we can fill in the blanks for her
and figure out what shes saying
but there are many many times where she will start talking
and we have no idea what shes saying
and its very frustrating for us
which leads me to believe
but weve tried really hard to figure out what shes trying to say
I dont know if we have it right half the time
but shes fairly agreeable to what we say so
smack okay this looks like two young people that decided to go on some kind of a raft trip
and they were equipped with life preservers
although I dont see one on the girl
and it has overturned in rapids
and the young man was able to catch a tree and hold on
but it looks like the young woman has not been able to grab on to anything
otherthan him hopefully
and it is a very scary situation
the ending is
she grabbed his leg
smack and he held on to her she held on to him
and help was called
and they were saved
smack okay a young boy is outside playing soccer
kicking the ball around
practicing for making for his tryouts for his team
unfortunately the ball gets kicked through a window
where a man is sitting
it knocks over a lamp
and completely surprises this man
and scares him
he jumps up with the ball
his first instinct is to look out the window to see who kicked the ball
he
the young boy apologizes
the man takes him back to his home
and they make a resolution for the young boy to pay for the window that needs to be fixed
and the lamp probably
smack well little Danny is going off to school
an
I think youre going to need your
so she offers him the umbrella
and Danny says
Mom smack I dont need this umbrella
its a beautiful day outside
so he starts out on his way to school with his backpack on
and it starts to drip drop
fairly s
the sky opens up
and it is pouring
at which point little Danny turns around
and goes home
he walks back in the door totally dripping wet
mom is looking at him saying

and Danny picks up the umbrella
goes back out the door
and goes to school
smack okay
there was a nice young man who
was very sad
had a little girl that was just as precious as can be
and he kne
so
smack with two daughters
and they decided to marry
so now little Cinderella his daughter
they grow up in the house together
but they are very very different children
the two stepsisters are very vain
very selfish
a
instead of them helping out
and the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen
so Cinderella because she works so hard has no friends
and except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house
and they befriend her
she sees the
and often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle
as a princess
throat meanwhile in that castle theres a prince
and the princes father is very frustrated
because his so
and the king is definitely ready for his son to get married
so he decides to host a ball
an
and so he sends out invitations
and when Cinderellas stepmom gets the invitations
the girls are very very excited
because now they can see themselves married to
smack and Cinderella also shares in this dream
however Cinderellas stepmother says
oh no
because you have
and forces Cinderella to do even more chores
because she knows in her heart that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters
and does not want that competition for her daughters
smack so
and Cinderella goes through all her chores
but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also
so they help her with the chores
but then she realizes that she cannot
and so in
her
I will help you Cinderella
so she smack makes a beautiful dress appear
with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball
that is made outof a pumpkin
and the mice she maves
and makes into fine horses
that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball
so in the meantime
just before Cinderella takes off for the ball though she says
remember
and after midnight
and your little the horses will turn back into your little friends again
so make sure youre outof there by midnight
so Cinderella goes to the ball
and nobody recognizes her
because shes dressed beautifully
shes clean
she smells good
and the prince is so taken with her
he cannot believe his luck
that he has found this beautiful young woman
and falls in love with her instantly
love at first sight
but as theyre k taking one of their last dances
she hears the gong from the clock tower
and knows that it is midnight
and she knows
but he doesnt want her to leave
and he holds her back
and she says
no I must go
and she runs outof his arms
runs down the stairs
trips just a little bit before she gets into her coach
as she trips she leaves behind one of the glass slippers
that the fairy godmother had put on her feet
but she has no
so she continues
and just as the fairy godmother promised
at midnight the coach turned back
and the horses were her little mouse friends again
and her gown is gone
and shes back into the rags
that she usually is in
smack well the prince is heartbroken
he cannot believe
and hes lost her
he doesnt even really know her name
smack so he decides that hes got to find her
he runs after her
and loandbehold he finds the glass slipper
so he decides to go door to door to find out whos foot will fit into the glass slipper
and when he finds her hell know that thats the woman that he was dancing with
and the woman of his dreams
smack so they go from place to place place to place
hes very tired
he knocks on the stepmothers door
and she pushes her ep u or her daughters into the forefront
and both of these girls try to cram their huge gigantic feet into this tiny delicate slipper
they will not fit at all
and he says to her
do you have any other daughters
is there anyone else that this might fit
and ofcourse she says
no
but Cinderella comes from somewhere appears and says
could I try on the slipper
her foot slides very easily into the slipper
the prince has found his princess
and they marry
and live happily ever after

well this a story of smack a cat that climbed the tree
and apparently didnt wanna get down or couldnt get down
and so the little girl asked the dad to climb up the tree to get the cat
and and I when he got up the tree
because the dog is is barking
and he is ke hes wanting to climb the tree
so theyre stuck
youve got the father in the tree
smack hes stuck in the tree now because theres no ladder for him to get down
and the cat seems to be content up in the tree
does not wanna get down
and so somehow I dont know who called but the fire department is here
and theyre here to rescue the dad and the
well Ive Ive had very good health
and I have not had any major
which put me about fifty three
so Ive been really healthy
bu
I ha
it was the sl one
and smack the pain was so severe that I was on around the clock smack medication
Oxycontin
smack smack Morphinesulfate did not relieve my pain at all
I either hadta get Dilaudid
or get a shot
or smack or be on my Oxycontin
because I could not walk
it was the most severe pain Ive ever had in my whole life
an
smack and I had two options
I could either smack try some kind of therappeutic
and I opted for surgery
and so a week later I went in to have a discectomy on on my sl one
its between my ll five and my sl one
and its been about two and a half years now
and the pain has gone away
but I still have side effects that probably will stay with me
however I would rather have those side effects than the severe pain and not be able to function
so there
okay
on
and so my daughter took him in
and we found out through several tests mris ct scans that that he had a tumor
and this tumor had wrapped around the kidney and had pushed out the liver
and thats how we found out that he had he had a tumor
smack so we went to
and it was diagnosed that he had a rare form of kidney cancer which is called clear cell sarcoma
which only one in about twenty children a year get
and it was it was diagnosed as stage three cancer
which means that it had well smack it had metastasized to
however it was in contained to the lymph nodes hopefully
and so that was a scary situation in my family
youknow not knowing exactly what the outcome was
and having to with my daughter youknow it was it was a very hard situation to know that your daughter is in this with her little boy
and you cant say
yes
everything will be fine
a hundred percent sure
and so it was scary becau
and number two it was such a a little little child that you didnt know what the results or the aftereffects of
and so that was a scary time in our family
okay
I am a a school nurse
and I have a program in my school
and its called SMD which is severely mentally disabled children
and these children have traumanic
or theyre severely disabled where theyre they barely can function
theyre usually in they are in wheelchairs
all their ADLs are done for them
they are they dont communicate at all verbally
and so basically the only way that you can communicate with them alot is
by the way maybe
or if theyre
the way that you touch them
smack maybe just communicating
some of them well smack I have several classes
theres another class thats MOMD which is alittle more
and so in that class we communicate by sign language
ke this
or youknow something like
so sometimes we do sign language with those kids
and we m communicate with them that way
okay
the beginning of the story it looks like there is this little gir
and somehow I dont know how she got into a raging river
but it looks really cold
smack and the fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her
and he has all his equipment on
and basically he hasta go out into this raging river
and hes grabbing on to some kind of
and then hes got some kind of a belt or something to
but hes also out there in in danger in his life too
smack okay
theres this little boy probably ten twelve years ol
and hes out playing soccer just having a really fun time
and the ball goes through possibly maybe the neighbors window
or maybe its his own front window
and smack the ball n knocks over a lamp
so actually it breaks the
and the man was sitting in a chair
and then he picks up the ball
and he looks out the window
and thats all in those pictures
so I dont know what the end of the story is
I dont know what the little boy does
okay
I love this one because this is typical typical of kids and mothers okay
so the little boy is getting ready to go to school
he has a backpack o
and his mom says
I think its gonna rain today
will you take the umbrethar
smack and the little boy goes
no
Im not gonna take it
its not gonna rain
trust me
okay
kids think theyre smarter than the parents
but theyre not
and the mom says
you need the umbrella
but
so what happens
he goes outside
and it starts to rain
hahaha
and so the little boy
and hes hes soaking wet
and he comes back in
and his mother is alittle upset with him
because in her mind
and hes sopping wet
and so he takes the umbrella
and he goes to school
and I hope he learned a lesson to always listen to your mom
once upon a time smack there was a little girl named Cinderella
and she lived with her dad
her mom had died years ago

and they were a family again with a new mom and and two stepsisters
but then Cinderellas dad died
and the stepmom smack was not a very nice mom
and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella
and so they made Cinderella do all the chores
they made her do the dishes
and scrub the floor
and make the beds
and make the food
and they would not let Cinderella be part of the family
and they made Cinderella smack sleep upstairs in the addict
and so all her all the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there
and she would look out her window
and she could see far beyond the city the castle
and she would sit and watch and wonder
oh what a beautiful place that she maybe some day would wanna go and see
smack well meanwhile there was the prince
and the prince wasnt married yet
and the princes father wanted him to get married
because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom
smack and so they decided to make a do a ball

and invite all the single girls in the town come to the ball
and so the prince could pick one of the sisters or one of the

and every home got an invitation for this big dance
and everybody was invited
and so the stepmother and the two stepsisters they were so excited to go to this dance
and they were gonna dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go

and the stepmother said
Cinderella nobody wants you
youre shabby
and you dont have any clothes to wear
and the stepmother said
if you do all your chores you can go
smack and oh Cinderella was so excited that she was able to go to the ball
and so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball
and so they made her a dress
and it oh it looked so pretty
so the night of the ball smack Cinderellas stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball
and they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done
and here comes Cinderella
and she comes down the stairs
and she goes
oh wait for me
I can go too
smack and the stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her
and they were appalled
they could not believe that she was able to find something so pretty to wear
and they were very jealous
and so they ripped the clothes off of her
and they go
Cinderella you cant go
look at you
you look like smack you look like a little merchant
and no prince would ever wanna look at you
and so they said you they were off to the ball
and
and she began to cry
smack and then her fairy godmother appeared to her and said
Cinderella you can go to the dance

and Im gonna grant you this wish
smack and so she
and Cinderella had the most beau
and her hair was made just like smack a beautiful princess
and Cinderella was so happy
she goes

but how am I gonna get to the ball
and so the fairy godmother wished her wand
smack and outof a pumpkin became a coach
and outof some pumpkin mice was the coach and the driver
and then she made some horses appear

and off to the ball she went
and when she went to the smack castle and she came down the stairs ev
because she was the most beau
and everybody there whispered and said

I dont know her
nobody knew her
but she was so beautiful
smack and the prince caught eye on her
and fell in love with her
and thats the only girl that he danced with with for the rest of the night
and she had the most beautiful time dancing
and everybody there was kindof jealous
because the prince would not pay any attention to Cinderella I mean to smack them only to Cinderella
and then allofasudden the clock turned twelve and Cinderella or was striking twelve
and Cinderella said
I must go

but the prince said

and one of her slippers smack fell off
and she ran back to get it

so she ran off without it
smack and at the stroke of midnight she turned back to her ol
and her pumpkin coach turned back to just a pumpkin

but she kept one thing from the dance
and that was that one

and I dont know who it is
I am gonna go through the whole village or the whole countryside
and Im gonna find out which girl smack that shoe fits

and so he came to the last house
and that was Cinderellas house
well Cinderella smack was up in her bedroom
her mom had had locked her in

and the prince would never never find his true love
but Cinderella had the other shoe in her pocket
and so she pulled the shoe out
and she said

it started when I was pregnant with Jenny whos almost twenty three
so
so we actually and when the girls where in highschool took sign language
they did it as concurrent students
so they got college credit aswellas their high school two year deal
so we we took sign language and tried to teach my husband stuff
but and then that kindof maybe
this is rushing
it its got to be a flash flood because the water is so muddy
and the young man looks quite strong
hes got muscles
hes got a lifejacket and some other belts
I cant quite figure out what hes doing
but hes trying to I would say rescue the little girl who doesnt have on a lifejacket
and hes hanging on to branches
""
but Imean he
but yeah I know Id like to hear how this story ends
well Im gonna say somehow he grabs onto her
she must have the branch down at the bottom
its just really hard to tell from this picture
but youknow hopefully they all they all get safe and get outof there

looks out the window
and sees its his favorite little neighbor kid
so hes not gonna be too hard on him

throat looks like mom and her son are having an argument about who gets to take the umbrella

and then it starts raining harder
so he turns around

Cinderella
Walt Disneys Cinderella
there once was a little girl a beautiful little girl whose mother had died
and her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her
smack unfortunately he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom
and she had two spoiled rotten little girls
and then unfortunately he also passed away
so the the mom and the stepsisters made little Cinderella do all the work
all the cleaning
all the cooking
all the sewing
and she didnt have anyone to talk to
so she made friends with the animals
shed go out and feed them
and theyd talk together
and just they were her companions
one day the the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife
so he sent out an invitation to all the il eligible young women in the land
and smack the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it
and her daughters were so happy
and they said
youknow okay sure Cinderella you can go
but you dont have anything to wear
so the little animals made her a dress
they made it look beautiful
they sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way shed be able to get it done and go to the ball
smack so when it was time to leave she came down
and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be
and they said
oh Cinderella thats my scarf and my my necklace
and they ripped the things off because they s
so now she really does have nothing to wear
and they take off
and shes in the garden crying
who
and and turns a pumpkin into a carriage
and her little friends into horses
and a
the guy that opens
and makes her a beautiful gown prettier than what the animals made
she goes off to the palace
and the prince sees her when she comes in
and he stops dancing with all the other fair maidens in the land
and the stepmother and the stepsisters think theyve seen this beautiful girl before
but he dances with her the rest of the night
and he falls in love with her
the stroke of midnight which is when the fairlry
she hears it striking
and starts running down the steps
she loses one of her shoes but cant go back because she doesnt want the prince to know that shes just poor little poor little girl
and she doesnt want him to see her in rags
she gets home
and her little mice friends arent horses anymore
but she does get to keep the shoe
well the prince is devastated
hes got to find her
so he gives his I dont know what you call them right hand man the shoe
and has him try it on every fair maiden in the land
doesnt fit the stepsisters
but he they see Cinderella
and they have her try it on
and she magically transforms back into her beautiful self
and they get married
and live happily ever after
okay
first of all I pull out the bread
then I hafta go in the cupboard and get the peanut butter
and we keep our jelly in the refrigerator
so I hafta open up the refrigerator pull out the jelly
spread the peanut butter onto the one slice of the bread
actually I like alotof peanut butter
so I usually would put it on both slices of the bread
and then just put the jelly in the center of it
and close it up
put the bread away into the cupboard
and put the other items away ofcourse
yeah
the family pet the girls pet which is a cat got stuck up in a tree
the father tells his daughter that he will get the cat down out of the tree
climbs up into the tree
and the loses the ladder that he got up into the tree
so now the cat and the father are both stuck up in the tree
the dog is ofcourse barking and barking
but thats just to see whats going on
because the dog probably is the one that chased the cat up in the tree to begin with
and then somebody called the fire department ofcourse to get everybody outof the tree
I got I
I have a back problem
I guess thats my worst problem right now
and I have pains
and I have appointment with the neurosurgeon in March to see what its all about
but they think what it is its a pinched nerve
I have
and I have bone spurs and things like that up there
so Im sure they probably are gonna be doing a surgery of some sort
because I right now I hafta take pain pills to get to sleep at night
thats my only problem
it doesnt bother me too much in the day time
because its not that great of pain
I can I can deal with it
just at night I cant
because it hurts too much
the pain does
so I hafta take a pain pill right now at night
which I dont like to do
because I dont really like to take any kind of pills
the only any kind of pills I take at all are for high cholesterol
but so I dont like that at all
but I do take those at night
so I can least sleep halfway decent
and but thats about all
I dont really I been
ERROR
I never smoked and and only really drink at like Christmas and special occasions and stuff like that
so I didnt drink alot
the reason I dont do that is because my mother died from drinking
and my father was German
so he drank alot
so maybe thats why I dont drink
but so I been living a healthy life
and youknow I just
sorry
""
yeah
I was the the other night
""
okay
for the first time in my life we went out to eat infact at Ihop right over here
because I didnt pull out anything for dinner
and so we decided to go and eat at Ihop
we went over there
and and oh it was about it wasnt too late
it was about four thirty in the afternoon
smack I have a thing where I dont eat anything anything with sugar in it like snacks or anything after six or seven oclock
because I found out for whatever reason I wake up in the next morning with a headache if I if I have sugars in the evening
but anyways we had I we both had a cup of cocoa
and then I just had a hamburger
so cant believe it was the hamburger
so we figured it was the cocoa
but anyways came back
smack and I started feeling queasy in my stomach
and and I just just was like I was it I was ke having anxiety attack
my whole stomach was going all over the place
and we usually go to bed around ten oclock
so I went to bed
Donna stayed up read a book for awhile
and I
I couldnt
I had allofasudden I was sweating like a stuffed pig
didnt seem like my heart was racing
so and dont think it was any kind of an attack of any kind
but I was sweating
then allofasudden I pulled all the covers off
and then I was cold
and and so I got up
an
and about one oclock in the morning finally finally went back to bed
but in the meantime I was just
and I was sick to my stomach
and it was just a
but if I ever had one I think that wouldve been it
and
and ofcourse I went to sleep
but I was scared
because I was I didnt think it was a heart attack or I was having
I just youknow we just come to the conclusion it was just too much sugar or whatever it was
but it was so early in the evening
we couldnt figure
but I just couldnt figure out what else it was at
but
I just kept going over in my mind
oh what what if something happens
or ate I maybe that was it
and then I just youknow I just just uneasy
ERROR
it was bad
but anyways that was it
have you ever had any experience with people who have had a difficult time communicating
like talking
you mean communicating
ERROR
a friend of Donnas is shes
and so this was awhile ago when we first got here
and so she made friends with her
her name is Janine
and she made friends with her
and so she learned to do sign language
be so she could communicate with her
but I ofcourse I dont
its too deep for me to learn
so I didnt learn it
but anyway she did
so she can communicate
but I would I went over there quite a bit to their house and everything
and it was an experience because you hafta
she could read lips as long as you talk directly to her
smack and so I went over there alotof times because if she had problems with her computer I would help her out
because I know quite a bit about computers
and then if she had any problems
ke she had problems with her telephone company one time
so I called the telephone company for her
because its so hard for her to communicate with anybody
because she hasta go through that TDY thing that youknow that you have on the telephones
but that was quite an experience
because you you just its just not a normal thing
because you hafta for sure
youknow youre so useta just taking to people
ERROR
ERROR
but it it was a good experience
and I really enjoyed it
and youknow I guess got alot outof it
because you youre so thankful then of
and and you dont have things like that and everything else
but anyways that was that
looks to me like a couple are are tied up in a flood rapids
and theyre washing them down stream probably
he they finally hung up on a tree
and hes got a belt around
I guess it must have came off of her because hes still got his belt on
anyways it looks like they they got a belt tied around something
and looks like hopefully theyre looking up
because hopefully the the rescue people are in helicopter above them
and are about to lower a line down
and rescue these two people who are tied up in this situation
this little boys out playing with his soccer ball
smack and he kicks it up in the air
and lord behold it goes throu
dont know
hopefully its his parents window
which would be alot better eventhough it went through a window
but anyways it goes through the window
and and lands in the living room where this man is sitting
knocks over a lamp
smack the man gets up
and looks out the window to see who threw the ball ofcourse
and hopefully he doesnt get too mad at the little boy that kicked the ball through the window
his mother the little boy is gonna go be going to school
and the mother wants the boy to take an umbrella along
because its sposta be raining that day
but ofcourse most of the time the kids think they know it all
and he says

I dont wanna take the umbrella
Im alright
sure enough on the way to school it starts raining
he hasta run back home
ofcourse by the time he gets home he
the mother is very very angry at him ofcourse
because he didnt take the umbrella
but all in all in the end the boy is happy now
because he has the umbrella

and it looks like with a
okay
l Cinderella was brought into the family as a stepchild
and there were two other sisters in the in the family
and ofcourse they did not along with the mother did not like Cinderella
they used her as basically a maid smack to do all the chores and and all the cleaning and everything else around the house
in the meantime Cinderella made friends with the animal
because they wanted to make her happy
an invitation came to the family for the the sisters to go
and they ofcourse had their dresses ma
and and smack they went to the ball in hopes of meeting the prince
an
in the meantime Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball
and her dress was made by mice
and and the animals basically made her dress
and the fairy godmother she met a ir
no no no no no no she had her dress made
smack and when their mother saw her dress it was more beautiful than her sisters was
so consequently they ripped it apar
she then ofcourse got very sa
the fairy godmother appeared to Cinderella and told her that she would be able to go to the ba
she would have her dress for he
and they had a carriage which was ofcourse a pumpkin
but the only thing was that Cinderella would hafta leave by twelve oclock be from the ball
because if she didnt she would turn back into her normal or her regular self again
so she went to the ball
and all and she was the most beautiful person there
smack the prince noticed her and really liked her
and it got to be twelve oclock
and she finally figured out that she hadta lea
so running outof the castle the clock struck twelve
and in the meantime while running outof the castle she lost her shoe
and as after she got back home the prince found the shoe
and wanted to know who that beautiful woman was that belonged to the shoe
and went around to the who
because he really was in love with that the person who fitted the shoe

smack anyways the mice found the key
let her outof the let her outof the room
the the not the prince but the butler tried on the shoe
it fit Cinderella
smack and smack basically she got married to the prince
and they lived happily ever after
okay
you first of all you put peanut butter on both sides
and bread in the middle
but not really
you get I would get rye bread
and I would put on the counter
and I would get the peanut butter
and I would spread the peanut butter on
I put it on thick for myself
and then I put the jelly on
and then the top
and cut it
and serve it
the girl is playing outside riding her bike
and she has her cat with her
her dog the neighbor dog comes outside and chases the cat up the tree
so the little girl is upset and calls her daddy
and her daddy comes by
and he brings a ladder to l to climb up to get the cat out of the tree
so the ladder falls down
the dog is berk
and the little girl runs to tell her mommy to call to come and help her
mommy knows what to do
so mommy calls nineoneone
and the firemen come
and theyre gonna rescue the cat and the and the dad
but I dont know in what order
so when the cat is rescued and the dad comes down from the tree everybody is happy
and they go home
one time a long time ago when we lived in Colorado we had a little dog
we called her Heidi
and I had three boys then and the dog and a husband
and we played in the yard
when I I was running with Heidi and just chasing her
and my left foot bent
I heard it crack
and it made a snapping sound
and I knew that was not a good thing to hear
so I went down on the ground
sat down immediately
and got off my foot
I dont remember where Heidi went
the dogs name was Heidi
and she was there
but I went I got up the stairs because it was
the yard stairs went into the backyard going
so I hadta go up the stairs that my husband build this porch
it was a patio porch and with stairs
and we would sit out there and have our barbeque and that
so I climbed up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kindof dragging it
I would not step on the other foot that was broken
so I got upstairs and went onto the couch
and I layed down
and I it was wasnt hurting
and when my middle son came home from school he said
what happened to you
and I said
well I think I broke my foot because I heard this snapping noise while I was playing with Heidi
he said
well you had better get to the hospital
and I said
oh no
Im okay
I dont hafta go to the hospital
he said
oh yes you do
he must have been in about fifth grade
say
you hafta go to the hospital
no I no I dont
and he said
well Im going next door to talk to Steve
his wife is a nurse
so he went
and he told Steve
and Steve told his wife the nurse what happened
since I wouldnt do what my son told me to do he ran off to find out some other advice
so the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor
so then I called my husband
and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious
nurse would know what to do not me or not my son
but obviously he did know what to do
so when I went to the doctor he they xrayed my foot
I had broken my fifth metatarsal or think thats how you say it
and its the the bone thats on the side of your foot
so he they xrayed it
and they saw that was broken
and that being a the foot has so many bones in it you cannot put a cast on it
so the doctor suggested instructed me to buy a pair of heavy hard shoe hard tie up shoes hard toed tied up shoes
and to get to get to the shoe to fit is to fit it in your good foot
and then to stick your
I could lift my foot up and down
but I couldnt I couldnt move my
so I did get the shoes
I still have them and havent worn them
theyre brand new
and I wore the shoe like he told me
and the
and I was so proud of my son for helping me
yes
I worked I was sixteen a teenager and I worked in a hospital
and we were walking oh me were walking home another girl were walking to the bus
and we had a friend there
he was a older man
he would joke with us
and he would talk with us
and he was friendly
hes a very nice man
and he was off alittle earlier than us
so he stood behind a tree
and by the time us girls got walking up close to him he jumped out in front of the tree to scare us
and we just ke stood there in a shock
and you could feel your body go into holding your breath and adrendaline
it would go flow through your body
not fall from the inside
and you just stood there stunned for a minute
he saw what he had done and was so sorry that he scared the dickens outof us
it was obvious also it was dark
it was late at night
maybe seven by that time was would be late for us because it was dark and in the wintertime which would be is doesnt matter what time late was
it was dark was dark
and so that was it
not really
have I haver
sometimes you have a little trouble explaining something to yourself to your children what you want them to do
well you tell them I would tell the children or my son what to do
and if he didnt do it he would get the belt
well they went on he went on
and he did it again
so cant remember what he did
he maybe he was
must have been pretty good to get the belt
so I told him
okay
you did it
youre gonna get the belt
so I would put said
put your hands on the bed
so he put his hands on the bed
gave him one one whopo with the belt
so then it would be next week
so I said
okay
if you dont stop doing it youre gonna get two belts
so he kept doing it
so he got two belt swats
so he hadta put his hands on the bed again
so went on again
and then he did it again
so I guess he wasnt getting the communication part
or I wasnt communicating to him very well with the belt
so I said
youre gonna get three belts
this was the time when you probably would nobody knew what was happening
so you wouldnt get hauled off to to jail for whopping your son with the belt
so he got three l three swats with the belt
and he must have stop because I dont remember having to hit him anymore
I remember after that it was like
okay Im not gonna do this this way anymore
and just sit down
start taking privileges away
though they get the message
I think that you can whoop them a little time little bit
they get alittle more afraid of you
and do what you told them because youre threatening them with their their life
I let them live
okay

he told me it was gonna hurt
and he gave me exercises to do with weights

I woke up
well the first time was when that police officer was asking me questions
asking me what my name was where was I where was I coming from and where was I going

it starts out where the boy is playing with his soccer ball
hes kicking it up practicing
and then accidentally one of the times he kicked the ball he hit the window
and it broke through the window
his father was inside the house and wondering
what is going on here
and he sees the ball come into the house

it was time for him to go to school
and his mother was telling him to take the umbrella because it might rain
so the little boy waves to her and says no he doesnt need it

but then they finally called me
and they had me lay down
and they took the doctor came back with an xray and said I hadta have my appendix out within the next hour because they were about to burst
so I was in the hospital for a week because I had an infection

Cinderella is about a king and his daughter
and the king hasta leave the daughter with some relative of his who have
so when the young lady Cinderella gets there they treat her really really bad
they treat her really mean
they make her do all sorts of cleaning outside with the animals and taking care of the house and cooking and sewing and stuff like that

the whole house is beautiful except her room where its up ke in the dungeon
and one day they get a invitation

and the two stepsisters are really really happy about attending the ball
and Cinderella really really wants to go
and she knows she cant go
but then there comes the fairy godmother who grants her some wishes
and shes able to go shes able to go
and but she doesnt have anything to wear
so the fairy godmother gives her the three wishes
and one of thems a dress
and one of thems a chariot to go
and I cant remember what the other wish is
and then the stepsisters find out that shes able to go
and somehow or another youknow they break her rip her dress or something like that
or they
well anyway they all the stepsisters get to go
and the the mother of the house is still really mean to Cinderella
and the night of the ball Cinderella goes in a big beautiful white gown and a chariot with a horse
the wish the the fairy godmother makes the chariot out of a pumpkin I think and the mouse
and then they get to the ball
and she gets there alittle late
but when she walks in there she makes an impression
and she the king want the kings son wants to dance with her
so they dance
but she hasta know that she hasta be outof there by midnight because shes gonna turn back into the rags clothes that she had
so as soon as the clock as soon as the clock makes that noise that its gonna be twelve she runs off
but then she trips and she loses her shoe
and she gets back home
and the prince never finds out where she lives who shes from
so he goes around the whole area and looks to see if anybodys foot fits into the shoe
and then finally somehow or another he gets to that house and doesnt see her
but then he gets later on he gets to see her and can foot fits the shoe
and they live happily ever after
of bread
jelly on the other
and then you combine them
about what
this girl her cat got stuck in the top of the tree

it was the middle of the day
my mom ke just went to the store
and I was just watching tv
and I thought I heard somebody at the front door

mhm
one of my friends is deaf

ke his English is like or just communicating is ke super bad
so he writes alot
and ke you just learn a little bit of sign language or you just kindof learn from ke body movements and stuff
ke I definitely dont know sign language so it f youknow it does make a problem
ke he can I can talk to him
and hell know whats going on
but itll take ke a little bit for him to communicate with me mostly ke just through through ke body language really
its like
I just its not that hard
okay so this kids playing football
and he accidentally hits ke kicks the ball too hard
and it goes through his neighbors window
and the guy sees it
and at first hes upset
but then he realizes hes playing football
and hes like
oh I wanna go play with him
okay Im ready
okay
so a mom is telling her son that he its gonna rain today so he needs to take an umbrella
and he says he doesnt wanna take it because it doesnt look cool
so he starts walking to school
and it starts to downpour
so he runs back to his house
and he tells his mom hes like

I need an umbrella
so she gives him one and he walks to school
okay so Cinderella starts
theres three sisters
I dont know if theyre all three sisters
but I know theres three girls that live under one house
two of them the mother f
and the other one they make her ke do all the chores
so they make her I think they make her live downstairs
and she makes friends with m
oh stepsisters
theyre stepsisters
and
I know ke one day theres ke a party
ke the prince is having a party
and he invites everybody but doesnt invite
or he invites everybody but they dont tell Cinderella about this party
and the evil stepsisters go because they wanna marry him
and then her fairy godmother pops up and says
you can go to this party
all you hafta do is be back by midnight
so she gives her a pumpkin that she turns into a coach
and she turns the mice into horses I think
and so they all go
the prince falls in love with her at the party
but she hasta leave by midnight because then she turns back into ke her normal self
and it turns into a pumpkin
as shes running away she loses her glass slipper on one of the steps
so she goes home
okay and he doesnt know who she is
and then he ke puts a decree out
he wants to find all the girls in the ke the area who fit this glass slipper
so he goes house to house
and hes I think the two other sisters try on the glass slipper and doesnt fit
but then she comes out and they try it on
and then she turns into the princess again
and they get married
and live happily every after
I think thats how it goes
was out riding her tricycle along with her cat when a dog came racing up to them and scared the cat
the cat ran up in the tree and the little girl couldnt get him down
so she called for her dad
he came rushing out to see what the excitement was about and realized that his daughters cat was up in a tree
so he got his ladder and went over to the tree climbed up the ladder and got on to the first branch
then the dog got excited and ran over and knocked the ladder down
so now her father was stuck up in the tree with the cat
luckily a neighbor had seen what was going on and had called the fire department
so two firemen came rushing to the rescue with their own ladder
they set the ladder up against the tree and got both the father and the cat down
and everybody was happy
the end

this was about two years ago
and I was having pain in my left hip
and Id had a car accident earlier that year
so I thought maybe it was related to that
but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an xray
and they found out that the bone the joint was actually dying because I had what was called avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didnt join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off
so
so we set up the appointment
or the the specialist set up the appointment youknow with the hospital for the date of surgery
and I went into the hospital
and
Ive never really been sick or anything in my life
so they put me under
and I actually kindof woke up before they were completely finished
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldnt feel anything from the waist down
but they were finishing up
and I was ke looking around
and the doctor was kinda surprised
he was like
oh just be calm
were almost done
and so then after that they wheeled me into the recovery room where youknow I kinda came more outof the anesthetic
and then I spent two days in the hospital before they were before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home
and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work
and then it was a year before they said I was completely healed
but yeah that was the the only time Ive ever really been in the hospital
no it was really kindof strange because I youknow I trusted the doctors
and I thought I would be afraid youknow especially when they were putting me under
but I really wasnt frightened or or scared
oh yeah definitely
sure
alright this was gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager
and my family we lived in Anchorage and wed always every weekend we would go down to the KenaiPeninsula to either the KenaiRiver or the RussianRiver to go salmon fishing because the salmon would run
and so I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite
and I was wearing
everybody wears waders
so anyway I was
and Im walking along
and I hear something
and I look over to my right
and I see a little baby moose
and Im like
oh how cute a baby moose
well I hear something
and I look over and its the mother moose
and it freaked me out
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby
and I had this huge thing of fish
and I was like I I didnt wanna drop the fish because I thought that would make noise
so I was trying to ke tiptoe as fast as I could through that area
and I was able to get past that
I dont know how I was able to get through there
I dont know how the the mother moose didnt hear me because they have good hearing
they dont see very well
but apparently
I dont know
but yeah I was ke scared for my life there for a little bit until I got past that area and back to camp
theyre huge
and they look so goofy and
but they can be really dangerous
yeah actually my grandmother on my dads side youknow as she got older
shed had a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks in her life
but as she got older her memory started to go
and it was I think she
I dont know if it was Alzheimers that she had or dementia or what
but we would go to see her youknow from time to time
and youknow sometimes she would be really youknow with it
she could remember lots of things
and other times you would kindof hafta tell her who you who you were and talk really slowly
and youknow she would keep repeating
and shed be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother
and so
no
you hafta say
no Grandma its Rich
and shes
oh Richie
and so then youknow she would remember who I was for awhile
and then shed kinda fade out again
so it was difficult to communicate
it was kindof hard emotionally too youknow because I remember her from when she was younger
and she was ke my favorite grandmother
and she was really alotof fun
and then to see her in that situation where shes just kindof a shadow of her former self was was upsetting
so
well I would hold her hand youknow and just be youknow modulate my tone of voice
youknow just repeat it if if she couldnt understand
youknow just be there for her really
sometimes she couldnt understand
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didnt
youknow you would talk to her and she may not understand
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm
okay
Joey had just joined the soccer team and he was very excited
so he was on his way home with the soccer ball kicking it around as he went trying to make sure that he would be ready for the big soccer match next weekend
unfortunately he got alittle too enthusiastic with his kicks
and the soccer ball went through a window in his neighborhood
MisterMoss was sitting calmly in his chair watching tv when all of a sudden the soccer ball came crashing through his window in the living room and hit a lamp and knocked it over
he jumped outof the chair grabbed the soccer ball and looked out the window
but he couldnt see anybody because Joey had hidden in the bushes
and he was perplexed as to who had done this and what he was going to do about it
the end whispering
okay
one day a little boy was getting ready to go to school
and his mother said that he had better take a rain
the little boy said
it never rains when they say its going to rain so I dont need the umbrella
Im just gonna go without it
its something I dont needta carry along with my backpack
well hed barely gotten outof the outof the house and down the street when allofasudden it didnt just start raining
it started pouring
so he ran back to the house as fast as he could totally annoyed at himself for not taking the umbrella
he got inside the house where his mother was also not very happy with him because he was soaking wet
and she was afraid he was gonna catch a cold
he he took the umbrella this time and then walked and went back outside and headed on to school where he made it safely and dry
the end whispering
okay
once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella
and unfortunately her father passed away
and she was sent to live with her stepmother and stepsisters who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm
one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that somebody was would be able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king
so couriers went across the land and delivered the message or delivered invitations to all the eligible bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom
and the the stepsisters were very excited
and Cinderella was excited too
but then they laughed at her saying
you cant go to the ball
you dont have a dress
youre just a scrub girl
and Cinderella was very sad about that
but her friends the animals made a dress for her so so she could go to the ball
unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball
so they ripped the dress up
and Cinderella was sent down to the to the cellar
and she cried
and then allofasudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying
and she told her story to the fairy godmother
and the fairy godmother waved her wand
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with with glass slippers
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin
and it turned into a beautiful carriage
and she waved her wand over the mice
and the mice turned into horses
so Cinderella arrived at the at the royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress
she met the prince
and they danced the night away
but the Cin but the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight
so Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away
and the prince tried to catch her because he was so enchanted with her
but he couldnt catch up with her
she Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden ip or one of her glass slippers on the stairs
she made it to the carriage and got home just in time
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin
and the mice turned or the horses turned back into mice
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because he was his heart belonged to her now
so he sent couriers across the land again with the the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper
and then he would know who who was the beautiful woman at the ball
so when the courier got to Cinderellas house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting to try the slippers on
but unfortunately they the slippers didnt fit either one of them
and Cinderella came outof the cellar and sat down
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle
and she and the prince lived happily ever after
oh youll need
youll need a jar of
youll need a jar of jelly
I prefer seedless raspberry
you need a knife
you will open the package of bread
you will take out two slices of bread
you will lay them face up onto the counter
you will take the knife and
you will
you will spread it down
either is fine
you will then fold the two pieces together
you may choose to slice it into triangles
so little Amina went outside to play with her cat
and her cat got excited and scared because the dog started to chase it
which is what the neighbors dog always does
his very annoying dog
and the neighbors just dont keep it in his yard like theyre sposta
and so the cat ran up the tree
but it got stuck because it went
and Aminas father came and said
no problem
Ill go up
Ill rescue the cat
and he climbed up
but then the ladder fell over
and he got stuck
so then the neighbors eventhough theyre very bad with their dog they were also very kind neighbors
and they noticed he was stuck in the tree
and they called the fire department which is kindof an overreaction because they couldve just fixed the ladder themselves
and the and the bird was singing very contentedly over this entire scene
the end
I did trail riding recreational trail riding on horses in NorthernCalifornia in college and most weekends
and I went out with the other riders
and I actually fell off the horse and got a concussion
and in the midst of that got back up onto the horse
fell
Imean very tall horse actually
Quasar was ke sixteen hands or something
and fell right
I lost consciousness for a few minutes
and then when I came back to the college campus I went to the health clinic
and they sent me to the hospital to get a cat
and they kept me overnight
I remember I remember one of the girls at the end of the hall
I think it was ke Thanksgiving weekend or something
it was some holiday weekend
there werent alotof people around
and so Katie of all people happened to be around
not a close friend but someone I knew
and she was so nice
she took me to the hospital
and it was the emergency room
and it was just ke crowded
and I think it was maybe even a Saturday night
and there were police bringing in ke people with cocaine in their stomachs
Imean it was an interesting
it was like one of those ke tv movie situations where there are all these things going on
I think there was ke some gunshot wound youknow
and here I am just sitting here with ke
and they needed to keep me overnight
they did the cat
they kept me overnight
I remember I just really really wanted to go home and take a shower
and the person I was sharing a room with I think was having some sort of family difficulty
or she was very unhappy and possibly very sick or in pain or something
and so she was having a hard time and
I remember that my friends came the next day to pick me up
and they forgot to bring clothes with them
so I was wearing a hospital gown with a a
basically thats the time I was in the hospital
certainly
Im going to recall yeah
frightened or scared whispering
oh
last spring right before summer vacation I was in my house small apartment complex small apartment just doing some schoolwork or something
and I suddenly started hearing this
and I
and I went into the kitchen
and I notice theres a bee in my inside my house which I dont understand how
because its absolutely closed all the time
screens on the window
theres no way
so I thought that was odd youknow trying to get out the window
and I captured it
and I put it outside
and I noticed there were some bees flying around outside
I go into the bathroom
and my bathroom my shower stall has been invaded by about fifty bees
Im telling you it was like a horror movie
it was the sound of
yes
and Im not overly phobic of bees
I like them in their place
Im not like someone who runs away from them
but alotof them in my house in my bathroom
and that feeling of going in
and it was like a horror movie like
so
and theyre all trying to get out the window which was good
they were focused on the window
so yeah I I freaked
I
I actually got a dirty towel and ke
because you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes
and gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying
you needta get here now
we needta figure this out
whats going on
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole
they were looking for a new place to start a hive
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting
we hadta get someone
youknow were they going in everywhere
how were they getting in
they hadta call a bee expert
so then but yeah that was a freaky moment
and I was very creeped out
I remember going into my closet and ke
and Imean they were very focused on the windows
but it was alittle creepy to think that ke it might be
that was creepy for sure
youknow and the bathroom is the last place you need anything
yeah youre vulnerable enough
lets be honest
ke you just dont need anything coming at you with a stinger
so yes that was that was that was scary
certainly
Im trying to think of specific examples in the moment whispering
its interesting whispering
Im trying to think of
certainly while teaching sometimes having students particular students who really are struggling
and you feel like theres not clear communication
its not a coherent reason for why its not working and a resolution kind of thing
and youre struggling to understand
certainly sending emails to find out
taking a moment saying
I wanna talk with you
Im feeling youknow this this is this is these are my concerns
how can I better support you
is there anything going on that you wish to share with me
like those trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy and whatever theyd be interested in
asking them
youknow I think it really helps to just start with youknow
these are my concerns
ie missing work or behavior in class or something like that
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of where to go next with that
Im trying to think
Ive had Ive had some really difficult situations with students of youknow basically just really disagreeing over the the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences
and oh Im trying to think specifically
Imean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because then its not just you and the other person
is it just in this situation
or is it a broader picture problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers
and those are things I can think of
mhm
""
one day after schoo
and he did an amazing kick that kicked so well that the ball went all the way through the window of his house and right into his dads lap

youll never go the palace
so one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big a very big dance because the king was
seriously
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day hes going to be the king
and he needed to have children
and he needed to have a wife
so they were gonna have a big ball
so they were having a ball
and Cinderellas ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go
and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes
and Cinderella really really wanted to go
she was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds
and they knew how to sew
and they knew how to accessorize
and they knew how to design dresses apparently
so they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella
and she was so surprised and so excited
I wonder what was next whispering
then she
and at the ball she met the prince
and it was just love at first sight
the way it should be
he loved her and she loved him
and they had a wonderful time dancing
and then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there
and they were pulling her dress
and they were tearing her scarves
and they chased her away and made her go home
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry
and so he sent out a message to
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldnt let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper
so the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out
and then the prince did find her
and then they got married
and then the king was happy
and we dont really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters
the end
open the fridge
and I get out the peanut butter and the jelly and the bread
and then I put it on the counter
and I get out a plate from the cupboard
and I take I open up the bread container
I dont know what its called
bread bag I guess
and I take out two slices of bread
and I put it on the plate
and I take out a knife
and I open up the peanut butter jar
and I
and I
then I get out a spoon
and I open up the jelly
and I take out some jelly
and I spread it on the bread
and then I put the two
and then I cut them
and thats it
it looks like little Susies cat had gotten stuck in the tree
so
the dad climbed up the tree to get the cat and now is stuck in the tree
the dog is trying to help out the situation
in the meantime the mother inside has called the firemen to come and get the cat out cat and the man outof the tree
Ive only ever had one major injury
and that was when I was probably twenty twenty one
and I broke my ankle all the way around
we were just outside where Im from in Michigan
and I fell in a hole
and it
and I heard a crack
and it was not fun
it was not a good FourthofJuly
yeah they they took me to the hospital
and the the doctor just said youknow he just said
Im gonna put your
so he said
on the count of three
and one two three
and then
so yeah
but he told me I was tough
so I liked that
Ive just traveled alot internationally since I was a little girl because my dad worked overseas and just different countries
I think we were in Korea
and we were standing outside
yeah we were in Korea
we were in SeoulKorea because we were all outside
and we were sortof getting into
like the like this picnic story
everybody was loading into a cab
and I they wanted my dad wanted me to get in the front
and so I stepped outof the car
and the cab took off
and it was Imean I was like eight years old
and the cab just took off
and Imean Im standing there
Im like
ohmygod
but I guess my dad was like
turn around
was gonna hit the guy and everything
so they came back like five minutes later
but yeah that was pretty scary
definitely
oh it was I I was in shock
Imean I I didnt know
everything is running through your head like
whats gonna happen to me
plus I was eight
so youknow in retrospect
but I just was I knew I was all alone
and I was all alone
and I was white
and everybody was ch youknow Korean around me
and nobody looked like me
and I was yeah it was very it was very scary
okay
I have the gift of gab
I like to talk alot
and I have alotof comedy gifts too
so even if somebody doesnt speak English I I can make them laugh eventhough
so Ive kinda been able to communicate without speaking
so that thats always made me feel good that I can communicate with somebody who doesnt doesnt understand English
but they always end up youknow feeling happy
so I havent really ever frustrated anyone
but yeah sounds like seems like comedy is sometimes is the way to communicate with people if they dont speak the same language as you
okay so little Tommy is outside playing soccer
and he gets alittle outof control
and he kicks a soccer ball through the neighbors window
the neighbors inside sitting there watching tv on his couch
and here comes the ball
and he grabs the ball
and he looks outside
and hes contemplating what hes gonna say to little Tommy outside
so little Bobbys mom is telling him on his way to school that its its about to rain and he needs his umbrella
but little Bobby says to his mom
you know what
so he doesnt take the umbrella
but on the way to school it starts raining as hes walking
and hes just freaking out
he cant even believe he he didnt take the umbrella
but he goes back
and he says to his mom
you know what
Im really sorry
I need the umbrella
and so he takes it
and he walks to school
and all is well
okay Cinderella is a girl who goes to live
oh no
Cinderella goes to live with with her evil stepmother and her two evil stepsisters
one is named Esmeralda
I dont remember the other ones name
but theyre just nasty nasty three nasty women
the the the stepmother and the two sisters are just really nasty
and they force Cinderella to become their maid and take care of the house
and they just they just are mean to her that she has no friends
and so she befriends all the the the little creatures
and she theres a big ball thats happening where the prince is going to find his
he needs to find somebody that he wants to marry to inherit the kingdom
and so behind every behind her familys back she goes to the ball
nobody knows her name
and she meets her
I dont know what the what her what
its the
oh her fairy godmother
and the fairy godmother says to her
Im gonna make you
Im gonna let you go to the ball
and she kinda
and so she goes to the ball
and she meets PrinceCharming
and they dance
and there theres just sparks fly
and then she realizes that if she doesnt get back in time
she hasta be back by the stroke of midnight
if she doesnt get back in time then shell turn into a pumpkin
but as shes leaving she drops her shoe
but she doesnt realize it
so she goes home
and then the next day the prince is beside himself because he feels like he met his soulmate
and so he he orders his his people to go around and find the woman whose shoe fits whose whose whose feet whose foot fits the shoe
and so they go to the house
and its her its her shoe
and then everybody lives happily ever after
okay
first you get some bread outof the pantry
and then you go to the refrigerator
and you get a jar of jelly
and then you hafta
and you
you open up
you open up
and then you open up the bag of bread
you take two slices of the bread out
and you get a butter knife from the drawer
and you take out
and you smear it
and then you take that same knife and use it to
and spread that
and then you
hadta think about that
I was like
wow how
so little Sally was playing with her cat out in the front yard of the house
she was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them
the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree
and little Sally was worried about
so she went and found a ladder
she was gonna put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said
ohno no dont worry about it
at which point the dog came back and scared the man
and he ran up into the tree
little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree
so she hadta call the oli the firemen sothat they could come and rescue everybody
I will tell you about having my tonsils out at the at
I had had strep throat five times in one year
and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to hafta come out
which most people thought really was weird because Im an adult
and I still had them at all
so my sister came into town to stay with me
and I hadta go to Scottsdale
I think I went to ScottsdaleSamaritan to have it done
but it they did it ke on a day surgery
but what I remember about it most is al it hurt
but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning
but I couldnt have anything to eat or drink after midnight
so by the time I got in there I was ke a little bit dehydrated
so they couldnt find a vein
and they hadta stick me ke six times inorderto
and that was very very unpleasant
they they finally got it in
they had TheWall on for the music
and I was like
oh thats gonna be great
youre gonna gimme drugs
and Im listening to PinkFloyd
so this is gonna be a good day
so did that laid down on the gurney
they gave me
and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery
it was painful
I felt I wanted to cry
infact I did cry just because it was so unpleasant
and it hurt so bad
they were trying to give me ke some water to help kindof
and I couldnt swallow it
so it was coming back outof my nose
it was just it was a mess
it was horrible
but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out
but it was like
and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out
so I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to to feel better
the only thing I could eat were popsicles
youknow people were like
oh you always get ice cream
you get ice cream
but Im lactose intolerant so I cant have ice cream
so that made it that much worse
I couldnt eat anything really hot because it was hurt it was burning my throat
and it was probably it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that
and Ive had people ask me youknow
if you hadta do it all over again
I was like
Id have just Id just continue to have strep throat
thats what I would continue to do
I would not have had them out at my age
so
mhm
yes
and they were actually I spent alotof time in Iraq and Afghanistan
and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you
so its its collectively a scary situation all the time because youre in a country and kindof a situation where not everybody likes you
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just dont want you there
so when we would hafta go
any time youre on the road youre essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks
so youre constantly having to watch and look around
one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you dont stop on the road
you just you always keep going
you always keep going keep going keep going
and we were part of a convoy
it was like a
but I guess
or he didnt get the memo that you dont stop because it makes you a target
and he decided to stop for some cows
so he decided to stop
and we all lost our xxx
Imean we were like
what are you doing
but you dont wanna get out because that also makes you a target
so everybodys
get back in the vehicles
get back in the vehicles
and youre having to yell it
so it was a little bit of a of a crazy situation
the whole thing probably lasted maybe two minutes
maybe two minutes
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to to everything
so yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation
yes
this person they have dfklpu
Imean they have the ability to talk
they are dont have the skill base in talking with adults though
its a friend of mine who teaches at a
so she spends alotof time around
so when it comes time to
more its being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time
I think theres probably some selfesteem issues that go with that
so shes not out
shes not socializing
and then when she does go its like
its like
or if theres something thats bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like youknow
do you wanna talk
do you wanna talk
do you wanna talk
and you dont ever say anything
so eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as thats just part of that persons behavior
and thats how theyre theyre choosing not to communicate by
okay
so little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer
he had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him
but his dad said
no Im very busy
I hafta watch tv
so little Billy was kicking the ball around by himself
and then the ball went too far
and it went
and it smashed
little Billys dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said
guess I should have gone out there and played with him
and now I have dysfunctional family stories
so
okay
one morning little Billy was getting ready to go to school
his mom said
little Billy before you leave make sure you take an umbrella
and little Billy said
Mom I live in Arizona
it never rains here
I certainly wont need an umbrella
and mom said
okay suit yourself
so little Billy started walking to school
he got about halfway to school when it started to he started to feel raindrops on his head
and he said
but the longer it went on the harder it rained
so he ran all the way home
and he said
you know what Mom
you were right
I should have taken an umbrella
so she gave him the umbrella
and little Billy continued to walk in walk to school
and he thought to himself
boy Arizona weather changes from minute to minute kinda
so
okay
so Cinderella was living with her father
her mother had died a long time ago
and her father had decided
its time that you had a mother
and you need some brothers and sisters
so he went out
and he found a woman who he thought he could like
and he married her and brought her and her two daughters
here you go
heres your family
you now have a new mother
and you have new sisters to go along with it
well what the father didnt know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet
and they treated Cinderella horribly
they made her do all the cooking
they made her do all the cleaning while he was off
thats why he wasnt around
thats why he didnt know what was going on
so the
Cinderella is having to do all the housework
and shes taking care of everything
and the evil s stepsisters are just youknow bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do
so Cinderellas only friends were ke the animals that were there
and she would talk to them
and they would talk to her because they had that special communication
then one day from where Cinderella was at she when she would talking with the animals she could see ke
and off in the distance
and she always thought
wow it would be so neat if I could live in a castle
that would just be amazing
but Im Cinderella and that wont ever happen because I hafta make sure that I
meanwhile
and people in the town are
so hes a little bit worried about it
so he says
okay heres what well do
we will put this whole proclamation thing out
and we will get
and well let the prince pick one
youknow with all the women
so well bring them all here
so they send out a message to
they say
okay were having this big birthday party for the prince
bring your single daughters
and because he is going to be picking a wife
and the evil stepmother gets this message
and she says
well this is great
Im going to put my daughters because then we can get outof this hovel and move back in
and well be all rich and famous
and Cinderella thinks
wow that would be kinda cool
maybe I could get into this because Im pretty good at youknow sewing and everything
and Ive actually made a dress
so youknow I should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters
so she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room
and the
wow she looks alot better than we do
so we cant let that happen
so they rip up
and then they take her
and they ke
and then they take off
and Cinderella is really sad
and shes like
ohno this is really a bummer
and while shes upset she finds this book
and while flipping through the book she sees a reference to a fairy godmother
so she reads the reference and allofasudden poofo
and she says
well Cinderella Im here to help you out because youve been a very hard worker and you do good things
Im gonna grant you some wishes
and were gonna get you to
and so Cinderella says
okay well what are how do we make this happen
she said
well first we need the a way to get you there
so she takes Cinderellas little animal friends
and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her
she turns the mice into coachmen
and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into a big carriage
so she does all of this
and then she says
bingo
the catch is is that you gotta be back by midnight
and Cinderella says
midnight thats cool
I can live with that
so she goes over to the coach
and they get in there and they take her up
and shes escorted into the big ball party
and everybody is looking going
wow whos that amazing looking girl over there
weve never seen her before
but she must be new
so she comes in
and the stepsisters see her
and theyre like
she looks familiar but we cant quite place her
but somethings just not right
so the prince sees her and says
wow youre a pretty good looking girl
lets go dance
lets talk
so theyre dancing
and theyre talking
theyre having a great time
and hes like
wow this is amazing
I think I found the woman of my dreams
when she happens to look at the clock and says
oh I got to go and
and while shes running off to get back into the coach she loses a shoe
so she drops
but she
and at midnight bingo
and everything goes back to normal
but she still has the other glass slipper
so she says
oh this is a nice souvenir
so she holds on to that
and then the next day the prince is like
well I gotta find this girl because this is the woman of my dreams
so I have this shoe
itll fit whoever was wearing it
so Ill just go around to all
and I will try and put this shoe on them
and whoever fits is gonna be is the one is the woman Im looking for
so he goes from house to house to house
and some peoples feet are too big
and some peoples feet are too small
and some people just they dont have feet at all so they dont even get to wear it
and he finally comes to the evil stepsisters and the stepmothers house
and hes trying to
and theyre like
so they just dont fit
in the meantime Cinderella has been trapped back
shes shes stuck in a room because the stepmother doesnt want her to be seen by the prince
not because she thinks its her or anything
so so the mice realize
hey we got to get Cinderella out because this is her really chance to to excel and shine
so they smuggle the key in
and she unlocks the door
and she comes out
and shes like
hey I think you found my shoe
and he went
well let me see your foot
so he puts it on
and loandbehold the shoe fits
and hes like
this is the woman of my dreams
and the evil stepmothers like
you no no no
and hes like
and says
nope
taking her off
and Im
and
and they were happily vlu
