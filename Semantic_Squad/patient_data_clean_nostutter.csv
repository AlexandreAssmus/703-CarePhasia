laughing
my speech is alright
its just that I have trouble getting some of the words out
I know what I wanna say
I know everything about it
but like right now Im talking clearly
and that I always did
even the doctors always said
youknow they know every word that Im saying
but the words
now try work I hafta work for it
what I was doing that day
before
I was outside working in the garden
and it was hot
it was in the beginning of June
and it was three years ago when it was in the nineties
but I love to work in the garden
and I was working in the garden
and allofasudden it was getting youknow I was getting a little not dizzy but I just wasnt feeling right
and I thought
so I cleaned up
I had a shower
and I went shopping
I was looking for curtains
and it was getting later because I always like to get home by three oclock to watch my program
so on my way home I was passing another store i which had curtains
so I thought
so I went in there
and as Im walking around all of sudden Im like the
nothing hurt
nothing hurt
but it was just getting weird
and I thought
so I thought
so I thought I better go home
Im driving and Im by myself
so I went home got ea cooled down and I had a something to eat
and then I sat and my story came on
and I dont remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything
but allofasudden my son who lives with me hes calling me
and he comes home about five oclock
and
and he says
he says
he says its
I says
and he says
he says
so between that time when the story was about to start and five oclock I was out
but I could talk
I could walk
I could nothing bothered me
but I got in the kitchen and I stood there
and I said to him
so I took a few more steps and I says
he says
we were making lambchops on the grill
and I had them marinated
and I says
so he told me
and I says
I didnt even know where they were
he says
and I didnt even know what a refrigerator was
and then I started to get not scared but I thought
but I didnt know anything that was going on
in my mind I did but I couldnt get them out
so he looked at me and he says
I says
so I have a daughter who lives in Vernon
and I said to him I says
and he looked
I said
so I couldnt get her name out
so he called her
he realized what I was trying to get
so I got her on
and I told her
I says
so she says
I says
so then allofasudden her name came
because its going through my mind
and I says
and I started to cry
so she says
then she got her other phone and she called the doctor
and the doctor said
so they took me up to the hospital
she called her husband who worked down this end
and he came and my son took me to the emergency room
and I was there for oh I guess about oh twelve hours thirteen hours
and they didnt know what was wrong with me
because every question they asked me I said right off correct
everything
and count backwards
went right back
and we were youknow talking and I was walking around
and I hadta go to the bathroom
and I knew where the bathroom was laughs in the hospital
and I went there
and we came out and we were talking and talking
and the one doctor said
so meantime I didnt realize that I didnt know the names of my all my other family
so they just kept me there
and allofasudden one doctor says
it was on a weekend which is a bad time
Februa Fridays
and he says
now when somebody doesnt feel sick and thinks theyre doing everything theyre not gonna say
especially on a weekend laughs
so we went home
so my son inlaw took me home to her
and I was there for the weekend
and they had gone away for the weekend
not the whole weekend just over overnight that one night
because originally I was sposta babysit for them anyway
so just by luck my daughter said to her husband
so because I had
so the father came up
and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart
I cried
and I just wouldnt stop crying
and then allofasudden Id sleep
Id sleep for hours
and I didnt realize it
and then we went the weekend we went to the doctors and
and I said
I says
so I ra I went home
I was
and about a week later they my doctors sent a neurologist to me
and when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me he says
he says
so thats how I knew I had a stroke
it was really weird
but I forgot so many things
ke in the morning every morning after I got my breakfast ready I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper
and
I looked at it and I couldnt get the words
I u I knew what they were but I could not say any of those words
and I what I did get to read I didnt understand
so I tried for a couple of days and like
after a couple more days Im sitting there and I thought
I started reading it
now I read a paper
and it didnt take me long but I worked hard at it
and every morning when I got up after I youknow into the bathroom and everything Id go back in bed and Id lay there
and Id think of my daughters family
theres four people in the family
theres two boys her husband and herself
I knew her name but I couldnt get his name out and the two boys
and I would just close my eyes and visualize it
and gradually allofasudden Id see their names
and gradually it would come
then I went with my oldest son with his family
it was tiring
and I did that at night too when I went to bed before I went to sleep
I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother were in all that
and it was a long time but it worked
it really worked
and I said to my daughter one day I says
I says
and I says
she says
I says
I says
she says
but it all came
its just now I have trouble every once in awhile to get my words out
and that and when I write
its getting better
sometimes when I write
and allofasudden I look at it and I thought
and the first time I saw that was when I made my first when I was going to the store
my little shopping thing
I needed mayonnaise
so laughs Im writing and writing
I get to the store and I came to that word
I couldnt figure out what it was
the
and I couldnt remember what it was
and by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back
then I knew what it was
it would come
Id forget it again but then in it but thats the way it goes
I know everything but I still hafta I forget alotof things
but everybody says
youknow and its fine because I laugh about it
because when Im with my friends and out I see people having trouble
they cant remember
and theres nothing wrong with them
so I think
but I have had so much pleasure here and learning
and so many people
I says
and I says
I said
and I said
but I says
and I says
and I says
and I says
and I says
yes it has really helped
still helps yeah
it is
for each one
alright the story is about a boy playing soccer
and he breaks a window in a house
and then
and the soccer ball coming through the window to hit him
and then he gets up and hes looking out the window holding the soccer ball
and thats about what he has for the whole story
but it more or less is a lesson for him that you dont do that kind of ball playing so close to buildings to houses
and
well theres one thing that I have been always happy about what happened to me
ke the fortunate stroke that I had that wasnt too bad was it was in nineteen seventy five I had cancer
and I had a s okay masectomy
and I came through it very well
and there was alot that was in there
but I got it through finally
so thats what about thirty some odd years already
and Im very proud of that
and I was the first one in the family to have cancer
and then allofasudden other members of my family
immediate youknow my living home family
they have come down with it
and theyre gone
and I have always been very thankful that I came through the way I did
and the doctors were amazed because it was so fast that I healed and everything
I didnt go home the way alotof people who have masectomies
and at that time it was about five years later when they started to come out with the
how do you call it
they made
the word is right there I can even see it
where they just do a
""
comeon brain move
oh I am really stuck
and my happy things were my children when they were born
and I had two boys and a girl
and theyre great kids
and I have finally got two great grandchildren this year
I didnt think I was ever gonna have another one have one but I got two at two great grandchildren
www
this is a story about
the weather apparently is gonna be rain
and
and
and hes covered up
www
well this is a picture of a cat that went up in to a tree and apparently
well cats usually jump down
but its up there and it wouldnt get down
and
and then allofasudden decided he was gonna up the tree to find to get the cat down
in the meantime the dog is barking up the tree
and
so what they did they went and called
and
and they
and
okay
well this apparently is during a flood
and during that flood
and it was very strong
the current was very strong
and she apparently couldnt get her out herself out
and somebody must have seen her or knew that she was having a problem
and they called the emergency group
and
and hes hanging on for dear life
and wants to help her
and it doesnt show that he did successfully but apparently I think he did
mhm
if I can remember all of it
Imean this I dont know what this is all about
www
it apparently this girls father remarried
this is how Im reading it
and his new wife had two girls
and so it made three girls in the family now
they werent very nice
they didnt like Cinderella
and they always made her do alotof work around the house cleaning up and doing stuff like that
and the other two they would go to parties and be with friends and everything
and then allofasudden one day the mother got a letter and from the princes its not a house the palace
and they were invited to go to the ball that he was having
and they told her that she couldnt go to that ball
so they were getting all dressed up and everything
and first she thought she was gonna go
and then they said no that the she couldnt go
so they got all dressed and ready to go
and then
and these little mice were friends of hers
I think they were mice
and so she took the dress and she decided that she was gonna go to the ball
and she got all dressed up and everything
and there was the fairy godmother
thats the one who said about the dress
and
and the horses will be the mice I think it was
so she did that
she got all dressed
she went to the ball
and the prince saw her and liked her very much
she was she looked beautiful and everything
and the she knows she knew that if she didnt get back by noon twelve oclock eryth
so allofasudden the clock rang for twelve
and she realized shes gotta run
and as she was running down the steps she lost her one shoe
and it was the good the pretty shoe that she had on
and she got home
and then allofasudden the prince was trying to find somebody who fits that shoe
and they came to her house
and the two stepsisters they thought
so they tried and they tried so hard to squeeze their feet into this little shoe
and it didnt work
and it turned out that Cinderella was the last one left to try it
and they teased her and everything you know that its no use of doing it
but she did and it fit perfect
and it end up that they fell in love
and they got married and lived happily ever after

okay
its fine
its much better than I was
youknow I can speak
before I did not
no
no not for two or three years
I have a good speech therapist
her name is JeanieLastname
my first stroke
Ive had two strokes didnt one on each side
the first stroke
when did you have that one
on in ninety four I think wait no two thousand four
and I forgot family friends husband everybody
I could I couldnt remember anybody
I didnt know how to drive
I started hitting cars because I thought I didnt know where I was going
I didnt even know how to start a car
and maybe like three years then I was able to start driving
and then my speech got better
I still have I have some difficulties still with numbers youknow
but I can speak alot better than I useta be than I was
well probably in the last year its gotten much better when I started at the aphasia
before I was very youknow unsure not confident
but youknow when I speak to people everybody talks to me I talk to them
and you get a nice rapport with them and you feel better
oh I speak English
I useta speak Spanish
no
when I had my first stroke I forgot all the Spanish because I needed to concentrate on the English
so it just went
I do a little Spanish now but its
youknow I do try but sometimes it just doesnt come out proper
if Im upset or something I start youknow the words dont come out
I just get more flustered
what else
I think the saddest day was probably when my father passed away
and that day I had gotten a raise from my job
and I was so depressed
six months later I had my stroke
and nobody really knows what happened
because now Im heavy
before I was very slim
and before I was youknow I was very happy
I was I would always be with my dad and my mom but theyre divorced
but he was youknow the light of my life
and so when he passed away I just couldnt take
it was just too much for me
and then I had my first stroke
and I then I would start thinking youknow
now I cant because hes not here
and I couldnt continue working
youknow because what I useta work at a legal office
and I useta hafta read land leases or sell sites
and
and I just couldnt read them especially when I had my first stroke
I like I said I couldnt even read
I still have trouble reading
so it was just it was probably the worst times of my life
the happiest time is probably when my husband bought me a dog a service dog
and he is the light of my life
he is great
I love him
he takes care of me and I take care of him
hes a big GermanShepherd
and hes just mine
okay
okay
""
www
okay
I think mom
and by the time
I think that
wait thats not it
and the
they were both youknow
not really doing anything
a fire
oh no not a fire escape
you just need
just thats just too much information
I didnt get that
looks like flooding
and someone is trying to grab
was she wasnt she like she had a pumpkin
okay
okay
www
okay
I think there was a stepmother and two sisters
and I cant recall if there was also a third sister
but the one that were m
they didnt look good
the two girls
however I dont know if it was a maid or a sister or a stepsister because they dont look the same
she was much prettier
and she went
and she hadta clean up everything for them
take youknow handle the trash the garbage the animals
and one day I think she was kindof down
and she wanted to go to a ball
loandbehold though the step the stepmother and the two sisters were going to the ball
and she was just youknow she wanted to youknow do something
she was bored
and so she was able to get a dress
and she also got
there was a woman an older woman
she
and sothat she can look like the belle of the ball
and then she got it was not a pumpkin its just it looks like a pumpkin
and she went alone
and when she went there she met a beautiful young man
they danced and danced until twelve oclock
twelve oclock youve got to come home
so as she was she wanted to speak with the guy but she was running late
she hadta hurry up
so as she was running to the coach her shoe fell off
and then he wanted to find where that shoe was sothat she
so there was a guy there that was showing all of the shoes to the sisters and the maid
and they did not fit until she tried it
and then
and then they
and that was happily ever after
thats as much as I can remember
okay

wow
www
well if I hadta youknow say I was a ten before the stroke Id say probably maybe a five or six youknow post stroke
oh yeah very well
yeah
and I went for a ride in my truck with my littlest my boy
he was about fifteen years old then
he was he had Downsyndrome so he wasnt fifteen probably like four or five youknow
and we went for a ride
and during the ride something youknow came over me
and youknow I couldnt think straight
and I Ill never forget
I was weakened on my right side my right hand
and as it turned out my speech was about two on a scale of one to ten maybe even a one
and then I was I came home
and I went in the house
and I sat down
it was about three oclock three thirty
and on my left I have a chair
and on the left I kept my phone
and it was my wife was sitting
and the phone rang
and I knew I had something wrong
so I grabbed the phone
I couldnt even get youknow anything more than youknow hello out
and the person on the phone I to this day I dont know who it was but she said
and I said
and she said
and but she was youknow she put me over to so she asked for my wife
I hadnt talked to my wife youknow because I didnt want her to know that I was youknow not feeling right
so I thought it would go away to youknow continue to go to work and everything like that
but so we went to the hospital xxx
we went to the hospital Monday
I tried going to work on Monday
and I drove my truck from Hadley Mass
its about eighty miles away
and on the way out it kept drifting to the right
youknow the rubber strips youknow on the interstate
and they I went off the road down in szbriu
and at that point there I decided I got something wrong with me youknow more than youknow a good nights sleep is gonna youknow ku
so I went home and thats
Sunday I didnt say anything
on Monday I told my wife
youknow and I went to the hospital
and youknow since it was already youknow a whole day youknow I found out that if you go to the doctors within three hours of youknow your stroke they have a chance to change the course or youknow reverse it whatever
anyways the horses are outof the barn by the time I said anything
and I took the mris
and youknow I went through speech therapy and youknow
theres two other types of
Im trying to think
but those lasted a very short time
but speech therapy youknow lasted like three or four months
and finally my therapist said youknow
and youknow I was released
and pretty much youknow she was right
it I plateaued youknow after six months
and now its six and a half years later and Im still
so I useta get like six hours sleep at night youknow when I was working
I probably went to nine hours youknow and with a nap in the afternoon for like a half an hour
I in my therapy youknow I told
and she tried to help me with that
and the only way I could really function I could use the cue cards
or I could have written on paper youknow like canned speech
but I was not able to really talk youknow like one on one like youre you and I are doing right now
youknow
just the best way I can describe things if I was a thirty five rpm record youknow I was trying to talk to a seventy eight rpm record youknow
I just couldnt get on the save
and it its not quite so bad youknow individually but when I talk to a bunch of people in a noisy room and just youknow noise from all directions I just wanna be outof the scene
very much like downstairs
its getting bigger
well I have had many things happen but Ill tell you one that involves my stroke xxx
and my fiscal year ended October first youknow for my selling and stuff
and anyways I said
well May June July s
I had like five months to go
and I was I had done all of my categories
so I won a trip to CaroSprings
and I had a stroke
and anyways my wife
but I took my oldest son
and
and thats another thing
I never useta cry
but youknow its just something that they say that added benefit or a loss whatever that came along with the stroke
yeah its crazy yeah
I can hear AmazingGrace at a funeral and
dont ask me why
because youknow Id be able to be cracking a joke for me or something during youknow the playing of AmazingGrace
but youknow it youknow its just very awkward
well it happens too often
and youknow watching a tv show youknow
it might be something stupid like the Bachelorette
if I come in and my wifes watching a show and youknow if they have a little n snmlu
and I dont like the show anyways but I just youknow I cant get over it youknow
its really its very dumb
well a bunch of my female friends said
whatever
yup
so now you know
alright
alright
well this comes right home to roost because I played soccer for Umass
and the first picture shows a young guy playing soccer
he kicks the ball
and he must be too close to the house because he put the ball right through the window
and as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed
and he knocked the window
so he did considerable damage I guess
and the last picture shows the homeowner youknow holding the soccer ball and looking out the at the guy
so I can only imagine what happened on the if the fifth picture if there was one
well I guess it shows a woman and probably her son
and he wants to go outside I guess
and she says
and hes he didnt wanna take it
and she offered it to him twice I guess
and he still didnt take it
he goes outside
and the third picture shows him getting drenched
and the fourth picture shows him getting drenched even worse youknow
so he comes back inside soaking wet
and the mother says
and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he shoulda had in the first place
alright
well evidently the cat climbed the tree
and as cats are prone to do it couldnt get down from the tree
and a homeowner or somebody youknow a male tried to get up the tree and he couldnt get the cat down either
the girls crying for her cat
oh the reason the guy cant get down is because his ladder fell down
so hes stuck in the tree
and the dog youknow bark
so I guess we know why the cat is up in the tree
and anyways way to the right it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy
this is this wanted
yeah
well my son watched Cinderella quite often
he watches
and I mean over and over again not once or twice I mean
forty fifty times yeah
I know most of them yeah
well I watched so many movies with him Cinderella might involve some other story too but
it wont take long
oh yeah
www
Im gonna give you my version and its gonna be very short
I think she has two sisters maybe
and shes the least favorite of the three eventhough shes the youknow the knockout of the three
her mothers even worse
youknow I compare her with the evil godmother
anyways dont laugh
anyways she wanted to go to the ball
and she couldnt go to the ball
but somehow she got it to go to the ball
and anyways at the ball there was a prince there
and I think he had a slipper
and he tried the slipper on the every girl there
and as luck would have it Cinderella youknow fit into the shoe
and anyways I hope Im telling it right
so I think youknow theyre happy ever after
the end
www
thats pretty easy
I would take the bread outof the icebox
and I use only Arnolds whole grain breads because thats healthier for my son
I can tell you this because Ive been making lunches for like six months now
and every Tuesday he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
but anyways I get him a whole piece of two pieces of whole grain bread
lay them on the
and on one I put the grape jelly
he loves grape
and then I put Skippy smooth spread on the other side
and I
and I cut him four pieces
and then I have little bags that I youknow put it in
and then I close the sandwich in the bag
and Im ready to go
yup
my speech is as Ive just said its probably youknow
if the goal like in a range of one to ten with ten being youknow prior to my stroke it probably ranges from like a three or four to a seven
and depending on youknow how much sleep I had and youknow what I did the day before and youknow how I feel and youknow it can vary like I say youknow on the high side like of like a seven or youknow down as low as a three or four
oh yeah
my stroke occurred on a Sunday April third I think it was
April third or April fourth in the afternoon
I was taking my son FirstnameK for a ride in the truck
and sometime during the ride about youknow an hour ride I didnt I just didnt feel very good
and when I say I didnt feel good I didnt feel up to snuff
and I knew something was wrong but I was hoping it was just temporary
so not to alarm my wife I didnt say anything to my wife the rest of Sunday
and youknow that night I went to bed early
and next mornings Monday
I went to work youknow like normal
and driving to work because my right side was affected
I had a left side stroke so my right side was affected
I kept drifting off the side of the road
I got on the MassPike from Springfield to NewYork state
and I kept going over the rumble strip
and then I didnt I knew I couldnt talk to anybody because they it like I knew it but just had something wrong with my speech and youknow my verbal thing
so I picked up some corn seed that I sold these two farmers
and I got the corn seed on my truck
forty bags
and then I came back
and then I got off in Westfield
and I drove down to Simsbury Connecticut
and the same thing happened down there
I was going
at that point I figured somethings really youknow drastically wrong
so I went home
and about two oclock I was home
and I was sitting in the sunroom
and the phone rang
and I was sitting like here
my wife was like
and I answered the phone
and I think I said helloq and maybe youknow one or two other words
and who other person was on the line said
I said
and the person on the other it was a it was a female a friend of my wifes
and she said
so she said
so I said youknow
so we went to the hospital
and youknow they determined I had a stroke
but it was youknow over three hours so the cat was already out of the bag
well I went to speech therapy and occupational therapy and physical therapy
and the pt and the occupational therapy probably went to like three or four sessions each
and they youknow they said
youknow I was throwing a ball
I remember the I was throwing a like a rubber ball
I was catching a ball better with my right hand
so she said youknow
and then the speech therapy must have gone to that for probably three months
but I like I kindof like plateaued
and thats that at that time there youknow my speech therapist LorieCorrs said youknow
youknow so I stopped going to therapy
she was right
yeah
it its better but I youknow I dont feel its youknow anywhere near youknow what it was before
it I was a salesman
and I was youknow able to tell jokes and stuff
and
youknow I was a pretty good salesman not to brag
but youknow I became project manager youknow with the company I worked for
and
Ill tell you after I had the stroke I continued to work its because my year ended in October first
and I went to a meeting out in New York state
I dont know
someplace out in western NewYork
I think in Bainbridge NewYork
and anyways they had like a class on corn seed youknow talking about youknow corn and youknow
and anyways the guy asked me a question
and I couldnt answer the question in front of all my peers youknow
and here I was sposta be the expert
and it just I Ill never forget that
it was really embarrassing
youknow I dont grasp as much as I as useta grasp youknow as far as youknow studying stuff
just the other day youknow like two weeks ago I bartend
and youknow I went with three people youknow that I work with
and youknow theyre done a long time before I was
and the funny thing is thats the third time Ive taken the test
and youknow some of those people that were there for the first time only
so its again its youknow its not the youknow the same as I was before
but youknow you just live with that
so
alright
Ill just tell you the first story that popped in my mind
when I was in second grade youknow a little kid so I was probably what eight years old seven years old I entered a contest sponsored by channel twenty two
anyways it was some kind of a contest put on by some western tv show
and anyways I won a trip for myself and my two parents to a frontier town youknow all expenses paid
and we went up there
and my father youknow we had a good time
but my father was like

youknow its kindof neat
like I said thats a long time ago though

and in youknow in going to the ball she took a carriage that was made outof a pumpkin youknow that was transformed somehow by some fairy or whatever
anyways how am I doing
anyways the pumpkin or the carriage returned to a back to a pumpkin at midnight
so Cinderella hadta make her time youknow
and anyways she took off from the ball before midnight so she wouldnt turn into a pumpkin again
and I guess she lost a slipper
and while she was there she was dancing with the handsome prince
and I always the prince youknow got a hold of the slipper

so he had a shoe fitting
whoever fit in the shoe would be Cinderella
and anyways Cinderella fit unto into the slipper

take two pieces of bread
and you lay them on the table
and you put Skippy peanut butter the smooth version because the crunchy stuff does not spread so well
so you lay on it
and thats one half
and then on the other half I use like raspberry e preserves because those make the best h peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
and then I just slap them together
and I cut it in half
and there you go
beautiful
pretty good
yes
youknow and sometimes when Im get hungry that I have a difficult time speaking and uns nsi annunciating my some of my words

mhm
yeah I had in two thousand nine I had a right temporal stroke
and I didnt know that I had one
woke up in the morning and had a headache
and my speech was difficult that in the morning for just a little bit
a half hour or maybe an hour
and I was driving my sisters along down at the Cape
I was driving my sisters around
and youknow doing everything like normal
seven
yeah so after that one I had when I got home I went to the my cardiologist to
and it did definitely
had a mri and it showed that I definitely had a right temporal stroke
so that and after that I had another one in
actually Im just gonna kinda skip a little bit because in a on ona krnldklu
I think at that I think that one was after that one I had a pta sptpu
but that was an occipital stroke
and then I had to go to the hospital and have heart surgery
and in two thousand ten I had
its like I actually had three strokes in two thousand nine and then three in
okay so I had a another one I had a in two thousand ten
thats when I had July the fifth that stroke
when I was sleeping youknow woke up
and I was vomiting
and then I went right to the hospital in Boston
and then they sent me home
then I had another one on the tenth of July
that was another cerebellum stroke
yes yeah and then after that I had another one
that one had one hafta be hadta be in August youknow August fifteenth time frame
and that was I think that once that one was the left mp temporal stroke
and then at that one in the hsptlu
and my surgeon was away but he came back and saw me and said
and I have also in two thousand nine that they found out that I have a genetic blood clotting disorder
its a proamnu
so it clot too much
and that was throwing clots causing all the strokes
so two thousand August twenty six two thousand ten I had the mechanical valve put in my heart
and since there then no more
I in the in two thousand nine at the hospital they had a speech therapist see me
and I but after that I didnt have any
actually I think I did start speech therapy with a speech therapist at Cooley s Dickson p
and the did the speech therapy speech language and
it was good
yeah I did more e therapy and kntduu
and then after that I finished my therapy in two thousand ten
and I do support groups

I feel that my speech is
that rm normal people might say well he had a r
what Im feeling
Im not able to communicate the way I useta
but Im still able to communicate good enough that I can get my point across to people
if not then we puck
but I feel fairly good
I remember
well it was in the morning
I was getting up to go to work
and I felt something I dont know what it was inside
and it felt
ke I couldnt quite get myself together pull myself together and get outof bed
and I my wife FirstnameL called the doctor
and we lived in an apartment in western in s in eastern Massachusetts outside Boston
and I said
and I got up and
then I got up and fell
and from that point I started
well then I guess it was a stroke
and then I just basically remember I was awake
I couldnt move
yeah
and she called the doctor
oh and they came
and doctors came
the ambulance
and xxx
I went from the third floor down downstairs in a stretcher and then went on to the hospital
and she followed in a car and went kinda crazy all that time
I remember bits and pieces but dont mem remember anything perse from that point
yeah
yeah I really dont remember a heck of alot
they cook
and I remember basically being there
couldnt speak and anything
it was
well remember the being up there in the er in the room
and trying to get me outa that room into another room
I was there two or three days in that one room
then they were favor then they were able to direct me to another room
to two rooms
two people in the same room
and I was in there
youknow and I say I getting more alittle better each day
and I transferred
and I remember I stayed in that room
and people come in and taking care of me
and they were looking to get me out and transferred to the rehabilitation center down there in Boston
and they did that
I forget the amount of time I was in that room but it wasnt that long
a short period of time
and then I got transferred out to that rehabilitation center
and from there things o were all better as they went on
I was dealing with speech
to get me speaking
to get me up and moving
everything
they wasnt it didnt have they wanted to come and talk to me about and work on it
so I deal with speech and how to swallow
eventually I had the stomach feeder capped off and then was feeding myself
yeah
yeah it was still feeding when I went in
and then it finally dropped off
and then I fed myself
that was nice
yeah I think I was in there probably about three months
like that
and I headed up there
well finally I getting to xxx myself or work with a person
getting outta outa bed and going to the bathroom
a
there I went to the apartment there in Waitgait and then right outside that area of Boston
we stayed there a little a short period and then moved back home here
yeah and then stayed here at home
so
Ive got one doctor I see down there
well I see my regular doctor is down there
we see that doctor every three to four months
and Ive got the doctor that is that did the bone marrow down
Im gonna go see him June July or August this year
and then get a read from him
this will be the second reading
the first one came out good
we can continue
mhm
when you say beginning middle end related to the story
well what was going on here this person was out and wanted to kick the soft
and unfortunately soft
they dont kick them on the ground
they kick up in the air
and what happened he kicked it here
and the first thing that it did was it fell through the window
and soft
now hard plastic doesnt give versus the window does give
especially if its a nonbreakable window
then itll break and thats what it happened to do
and it did broke through that window
and when it did it broke sothat the ball came in
and the guy that was living in the hou
the ball came down in his lap
right on top of him
that caused him feel a little bit upset about the situation
he stood up
and he stared out the window
and he looked at the ball
and he was kanu
and thats where it ended up
he never he had time to say anything
yeah
a story with a g a middle and an end
okay
looks like something I remember
it was back in time where it was a nice it was a good rainy day outside
and I looked around and being a man Im not about to use an umbrella
umbrella is for women and people girls and that sort of sttu
they wear s
the guys werent
so what I did is I took it
and the umbrellas sortof been offered by my mother
and offered by my mother a second time
and I just said
I dont use umbrellas
I walk
and I stepped outside
and I go to walk
and Im walking
and Im getting wet
and Im starting to think to myself
so I walk back to the house
I ask mom
and she said
she gave me umbrella
and I got out
and I walking to school
and I had walked there I had walked xxx yet
we
we tell them pretty good yeah
mhm
I see
well
well theres this day
its kind of a lazy day
and around the house not too much going on
except for the kinda day that I heard a cat crying in a tree
and I went
so Im looking out the window and I see the cat
and its sitting up the tree
and theres a bird sitting in the tree and
and I dont care about that bird
but Im worried about the cat
so I said

so I go
Ill get the Ill get the ladder out
and Ill put up against the tree
and Ill come and get the cat
so I get the ladder
and I get up to the first stem s
and I get ready to move over to the branch to the area that the cat is on
and the ladder falls down

and there comes the there comes these guys from the ladder from the fire engine fire station downtown
the neighbor had evidently called

and they dont care what happens to Cinderella as long as she get done with all her work first

I need a beginning
Cinderella shows up at this house
and they dont want know what to do with her
and she says
and she finds out her grandmas a wicked old witch
shes rea
and shes ver
very unnice to Cinderella
so Cinderella starts working around the house
and her sisters are
and the her little sisters are this they are all very mean to her
and so shes looking out the window
and she looks out and she sees the castle
and theres a flyer on there about a ball thats coming up
and
and shes thinking how wonderful that would be
and she and this is her grandma is talking to her sisters
Cinderella wipes up her tears and goes up the stairs and sees a nice dress and dressing
and shes puts
and she gets a
she goes downstairs
and her grandma says
and she took her to
and it and shes says
so her sisters go off
and shes all sad about that
and she runs into
she thinks about this great grandmother
and it turned out to be a good witch
now the good witch says
she goes
and so the witch she y frkszu
and she says
and wides
and the prince sees her and he says
and they danced and danced
and they were having a great time
and Cinderella looked up
she saw a great big clock
and the clock said one minute to midnight
its like
she says
and she tea
and the prince says
no and she runs out and takes off
and when shes running she leaves a slipper
and that was one of the slippers the golden prince had take given her
and he says
so he went to house
he went to finally got to great old grandmothers house
and he tried it on the three daughters
he tried it on grandmother xxx
she says
and it didnt fit her either
and then
he tries it on Cinderella because that would be not fair to not try it on
and it fits
and they lived happily ever after
yeah
yeah
it its meant to be
ohboy the sisters you were they were messed up
but she was pretty good
she was good about it
thatd be really good
take some homemade bread
Hagers is just like a oh about a mile and a half mile from our house
little farmers market
and go there and buy some homemade bread
and bring it home
and take out the homemade bread
and cut it in oh
so you got two slices

xxx with that
now take the other side

and you got the jelly on one side
Ill put them together
so you take it and go
put them both together
pick it up
and the peanut butters dripping off one side and the jelly off the other and omo
and eat it up
and its delicious
yep
mhm
I think it couldve been extended with the expansion of the words more than just twenty on the object and twenty subject its subject
after awhile that gets a lil
yeah atleast to me it did
to others probably not
knowing the depth of the group that you have
but to me it got really p after awhile I got tireding
bltu
so I like a small expansion with xxx words wouldve been nice
I dont know if you could do that with the group or with the coming group
it would it be pkblu
well it depends on probably where the person is
where the person sits in that group
if they reach a certain mark then Id then I said say
if they dont they stay on the same words
and they keep going through it youknow
and I doubt that some of the people would be able to take that kind of expansion
it wouldve been putting an awful lot of pressure on them
so that was good
but it got a little boring towards the end
I think it more severe at the beginning than it is now
but yeah when you say
it was true
I would agree that I dont fit into that group along that line
so
oh yeah it definitely helped me
I can speak now alot more fluent than I could at the beginning
mhm
beginning middle and the end ohboy
well here was little Johnny is off kicking the ball
and he likes to kick the ball
his father is a soccer player and so he gets a kick outof it

Cinderella
www
my version of Cinderella
Cinderella shes a goodie
well back in the days oh this is the days of your little houses or little she
and Cinderella was a girl of this time
and she lived in one of these sheds
and she had a grandparent or parent and three sisters
and she was kindof a poor little girl
and the three sisters were fairly they saw themselves as really above Cinderella
and shed walk around the house and do the chores
and the three sisters would kindof give her things to do
but Cinderella xxx
and so its there came a letter in the mail about a ball that was having at the castle
now the castle was big and very shiny
and it was run by the princess
and the letter invited the family
and the mother looked at the letter says
and Cinderella looked up and said
and looked at the side of the house and
and he
it was very nice but no she couldnt wear that
shes too little
and shes too small to wear that
and so she just went
and shes looking out the window and sees the castle all lit up and knows that her three sisters have gone there to date the princess
and shes talking to her friends who are xxx mice and the horse
and theyre saying
and shes kindof whining and crying when poofo along came the fairy godmother
she said
and she said the fairy godmother said
and shes
and she says
and says
and shes turned the horse into a carriage a beautiful carriage to carry princess
as bingo
she wore a had a beautiful white dress popped on there
and she had that on
and bingo
the wasu
and allofasudden she says
and she jumped in this carriage
and she rode along
and she got to the ball
and there the princess
a pair a beautiful white shoes
there were they were glass shoes
so the three fairies
the first one was
she fell out
it was too big too little for her
and the second princess
they was too little
and the third princess
and she jumped on
and she couldnt get in the thing either popped out and says
and the princess
and the princess
and she tried it on
and they fit
so her and the prince were dancing and making love all the way up until midnight
s and midnight was gonna hit
and the princess looked down and said
she said I hadta be gone by midnight
so she says
goodbye
and she tore out the door faster than anyone could lwtu
and the prince said
and she was gone
and she took off
and when she got home everything turned back the way it was
the mouse and the horse and everything became the same that it was
and it was all the same
and she was
and she got in the house
and the next day there come a knock on the door
and it was the princess
and the princess
xxx the princess s
and he says
and he looked at it
and the shoe was on
and because it was on he
and they went off and they got married
and they lived happy kvu
mhm
tell me how
well I havent done that lately
but it is really the best thing going
the what you do is you get the peanut butter and jelly all together
and you hafta kindof look at it and say
okay Ive got myself a loaf of bread
and Ive got a firm and a lighter loaf
and Ill choose the firm though because the peanut butter is gonna be sticky and when you spread it
especially with one hand left hand
thats gonna tear the bread
and so the lighter loaf cant do or youll end up with your bread all ripped up
so you take the thicker loaf and slice it down
and slice it into two slices each about inch
and took those and lay them down
and take the peanut butter first
and bread
and the bread wont tear
that bread stays the same
then you take the tlu
oh its good tasting jelly
so you dip
and you spread
and it is on top of the peanut butter because I guess because if you put that on first the jelly and then the peanut butter it would splatter all over
so you spread the peanut butter
so you got a loaf s
and you take your bare piece of bread thats not used
and you pick it up and put that on top of the whole thing
and itll press it down just enough that itll start the jelly falling of the edges
and then you pick it up
and you chomp it down
mhm
mhm
the day I had my stroke
so I was gonna be in the art of getting up and getting dressed and going to work
but I when I sat up in the bed

and it only took maybe fifteen twenty minutes to get there
and they took me and I dont know
I dont recall what all happened
and when I woke up I was up in some higher room
or it was I guess it was private
and I was hooked up to a tube
coming to my stomach there was a tube for feeding
a waste tube was added
a tube
and I just woke up
I couldnt speak
couldnt move anything
and so was
and the guy came in and said
and so it was very loving
and Brisky just stayed with me the rest of that day up until the evening
and then I went on to sleep
and I couldnt really couldnt move anything
xxx anything
so I was just completely outof it that first day
I was just nothing
lying in the bed staring out the window
and just tubes
well I what they said it was a stroke I didnt really comprehend all of it at that point
otherthan that it was serious
and they hadta he they had the blood transfer was going in
and xxx lost enough blood at during it
and they hadta feed me in the stomach
feed me through the tube
and bring me breathing
so when they were I realized it was really bad
and there wasnt too much I could do otherthan just kinda stay awake and do everything I could get to get up and turn the corner
and that took
I dont know how long I was there
and self
and I kindof cared s
they didnt take it the tubes out until atleast a week
and then probably I started removing the tubes and all of that
but it was serious

no doubt

well
I stopped at this in Petersan
and they were having they were having artwork there youknow
and I talked and when I went in when I went in there alot of the e one of the women I actually knew her
and t she actually ran for a representative
xxx she lost last year
and she also writes books
and Ive seen her talking about this
she wrote a book about this man that was in Worldwartwo
and he was caught in the baton s
when somebody when they die
a march
did I can I say that right
and that man when I was young when I was eighteen he would he talked to me
and he said who he who his name was and everything like that
and he told me that he was always in love with my art
in Worldwar this is in Worldwartwo
and but and he was his name was FirstnameP
and he wasnt he was about as tall as I was
and my aunt
and he asked her to marry him
and she said that no she wouldnt do it because she liked taller men
but he would tell me about this
but this woman that I was talking Sunday that she tried to be a she tried to run for as a representative
and she lost
she useta be a writer for a representative in Massachusetts
when she was young she useta did
this and anyway
so I know I knew her
so I talk to alot of these people
and I was doing very well except I got to a word
and I told them
and she said nobody had any idea there was wrong with me talking until that time
and so they were getting youknow it was eight it was six oclock
they were all ready to everybody was all done
and I bought the book
and I was outside talking to this other man
and he was probably our age
I was Imean I was his age
and he was h he was slender
and he said that he had migraine headaches every two or three days
and he said that he had extremely bad magrnu
and he youknow and but he said
Imean we shook hands and everything
and he talked quite about what his problems that he has
and he told me how he has he s he suffered from that
and I had read recently that there were some new drugs that might help out people that have that
and he said that he saw a doctor
and the doctor told him that it they gave him some of his drugs
and it didnt do him any good whats what not xxx
so that was so that was that
so I guess my little bit of story is I said this quite a bit before anybody knew there was anything wrong with me youknow
I guess the and I my feeling is that I dont think Im doing much better
people will say boy Firstname sounds hes alot better
and but Im afraid that Im not getting much better
thats one of my
I think Im probably a little bit better than I was
but I still dont think Im really well
youknow and Im always surprised when people tell me
youknow because to me it sounds horrible to me
this is how I feel about it
is that because I think that I was very good at speaking
and I knew so many different things
and I was witty and things like that
and so Im not h Im not depressed or anything like that
and Im hoping Im going to do better
its just that I dont think Im doing that
youknow okay
actually I dont think Ive had any problems
I think that I remember everything wonderfully
and as a matter of fact I wanted to tell you about
I was with FirstnameG
and I was driving
I was driving a van
and we were going at the HomeDepot
youknow and for year for a long time I could not say HomeDepot
so I admit that Im alot of the words Im doing alot better than I was
ke it took me maybe a month before I could say BaldwinHillRoad which is where I youknow where I live
and I actually I was probably since I was like one year old I lived in the same in the same house
so I actually knew how to say it
so when I was with it was like our it was our it was eight sixteen two thousand thirteen August
and I was driving
it was about nine oclock at night
and we had just left HomeDepot to buy
I was actually she had an apartment in her
the this lady who had lived there for twenty four years had died recently
and we were fixing up her apartment
and one of the things was that her the bath had an old steel tub
and we just bought a
and Im good at finding deals
and I found a nice new tug
and we were just bought it in my van
and so then we were gonna have a supper we were gonna go suppering now
so I was on route I was on BostonRoad
and I was driving
and this is about nine oclock at night
and she said
she said
and apparently what happened is that I had paralyzed
I was i
and on the she said that one of my eyes youknow I my I couldnt see on this side
its like this whole side
and I was driving
I managed to get the van on the side of the road
and it was right where we were going to the restaurant
and then I would just hold onto the steel
and I was so I was really lucky that FirstnameG was with me youknow
and the other thing that was that worked out well is that there were doctors
and there were there was two nurses and a doctor that just happened to be driving their cars
and they saw it what happened
and everybody got out
and they all got me we opened up the door
and they got me down on the ground
and they called up
what do you got that say it right
it starts with the truck
its not the right term for the truck but they took her to and they took it to Baystate
and while it when I was there
and during this time I started losing the color
I could still see my vision but it was like black and white
we got to we got to Baystate and their emergency
is it emergency
well anyway y it all came back to me
the color all came back
Imean I was on a diu
what do you call it
they carry people
dizu
dizu
I was on that
and they were taking me in on upstairs
I think I probably took I dont know if I xrays or something like that
or maybe it was like couldve been an mri or something perhaps
and then I finally made
it was almost like one oclock in the morning
I was in youknow there was like a nurse a young nurse
and FirstnameG was here
and I wanted to I knew everything was happening
youknow I was saying to myself
I said
and so I wanted to so then I wanted to I kept on trying to talk to FirstnameG about what was happening
and I couldnt say anything
and I said
so they think that theres probably something alot worse than me
because I think I understood everything that was happening during this whole thing that was happening
and so thats pretty good
okay well I was at I was at Baystate
and I was there for ke I think it was eight days
and then it was very not very far away
we went to Mercy
and I was there for ten days
and then I was talking I was there they tried to seem
they I said to her
and I could do everything
I had no trouble
youknow they started off youknow trying to move my youknow how I can move and stuff like that
and they actually after like two days they said
so I was actually talking I talked to this woman that was the speech therapist
and I talked with her for like nine days I think
and then the last day I was there I think the ninth day I think I they had this group of people
they had
that you would this one woman had I think you probably knew her because she was from Umass
and she was going at that time
shes still going atleast almost a year
she was going to be youknow helping at Umass
so we had this group of people that suffered from speaking well
and I listened to youknow I listened to what she was saying
actually the whole group of e of people
and apparently they do that every
I dont know if they come every month or something
and they talk to people about that
so and then after ten days I was there
we c decided that we went to in Amherst
and it was like rust
and youknow what happened is that the speech therapist would come
and she was there for like fifteen minutes
and shed do the same kind of testing that youve been doing
and is like the same thing
and youknow it was like I had seen it
and the next day another speech therapist
I think there was only a couple of people
and she started the whole thing all over again
right
and she wasnt here that long
and then the next day this other person came again
and we were doing the same thing
but none of them
it was only very short period of time youknow maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving
and so I think FirstnameG and I we actually went for a walk youknow because where she was isnt really that far away
so in the center of town we went to dinner
and we were talking
and she was saying
oh the other thing is the speech therapist had been there for like thirteen years in the same place
and she was and she was shes getting a new job
she was gonna lose she was gonna leave
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks
and now its getting youknow its the middle its the beginning
so I when would it was I just had I had a birthday there that week
and we were thinking that maybe we would stay
and I was gonna stay with FirstnameP and FirstnameYs house
I was gonna stay there
because I think what happened is that we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse
the nurse
and the thing is that this
and this is what
they wanted to youknow if I wanted to go to the to have my bath and stuff like that
they wanted to take me
all of the people that worked there
they youknow and when I was in I was in Mercy all of the they let me do it all by myself
and some of the nurses would let me do it at four oclock in the morning
I could go all by myself
I could they had like a room
I could take all my clothes off
I would Id take a nice bath
Id put everything back
and then I would even I would like with my razor I would youknow I would
what would you call that
not my beard but I would cut my beard and things like that
and I didnt have any problems when I was at Mercy
no problems whatsoever
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the NewYorkTimes
thats basically the only thing I hadta try to read
and I would say if I read something like one section of the NewYorkTimes it would probably take me maybe it would take me an hour just to read one
and then Id only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read youknow
ofcourse if it was maybe if it was an newspaper that was easier to read I might do better
but it was still the NewYorkTimes and the i editorials and things like that
I was having a hard time understanding it
but I had an ideara
so FirstnameG and I were going we were at we were having supper
and she said
what she should do
I said
so then she tried to find people in that area that would they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist
and this one woman came
and I really I thought she was quite good
but youknow what happened
I think they found one in Athol
and then I started to drive too
and if I could drive then you see you couldnt have a person that would come to my house
right
so what happened
I really liked this woman the speech therapist
but I hadta give her
and she had all of the she had all of this she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could I could probably learn with this
how do you say the right term
we I started doing that
youknow she would do things like writing a picture
thered be pictures or something like that
and wed be like
youknow and the clock would be wed be on like a twelve
and itd be on six
and itd be on three
it would be on youknow it would be on eight or something
and I would hafta write it down which one it was
so that was how I started doing with the speech therapist
but then I couldnt youknow I couldnt drive
youknow Id we cant let her keep on coming
and she knew I could drive
and its and Im gonna still Im gonna go Im going three times a week to see FirstnameE
and
yeah okay so thats basically it
okay
oh
and you remember you started you youknow you were starting to do some of the work with me
and you had like pictures
and I hadta ke try to say what the words were and stuff like that
yeah I remember that
I was remembering that
and I was and I remembered that I was having a hard time to say what the words were
and youknow and you in the beginning it was pretty easy
and then ofcourse the words got more difficult
and so Imean that was alot of the work that you did
and I think the reason why you were involved that you were involved with that is that we were worried that we couldnt even find a speech therapist
and I think thats how FirstnameY found you youknow
and then we finally then we did find someone to go down to Athol
so and then you were also telling me that because I had recently had that problem having trouble with the what had happened in that part that my then I needed everybody to ke to become
what do you what did I hafta say what it
my brain was still needed to be get better
I hadta get better before I could come over here to have you help
so we waited
we hadta wait
so do I wanna tell
you said you wanted another story
this is just a story about how I met you
how I met you
I thought that was pretty I thought that was pretty I thought that was very important that this was gonna help me
okay
yup
well this is a this is a boy
and hes kicking a
and I know what kind of like
its a ball
its a sklu
and she
and ofcourse what happened here is he kicked the ball
and he hit the a window
maybe its his neighbor
and or maybe it was his father
I can call it his father
his father is in the living room
and hes sitting there
and he actually kicked the ball
and it went on the other side
and it fruu
and it actually hit I guess it hit the lamp too next to his perhaps to his father or a r a neighbor
or maybe it was like a young man
I dont know who it is thats here
and youknow the problem over here is that he looks like hes standing up
and this fourth one is hard to tell exactly what this is
whether
this looks like this could be this could be
whether this is like a ball or whether this is his brain that got knocked outof it
I dont know
this looks like its opened here
I dont know what this is
this doesnt this isnt very
its hard to tell very much of this otherthan theres somebody standing up
I dont know what that person is holding onto
if its sposta be that it could be this
I dont know what it is
okay
thats all I can say
mhm
okay
I guess he wanted the
this thats what the
youknow I
the umbrella
okay the umbrella
finally I got to say umbrella
the little boy wanted the umbrella
and his mother had it
the mother doesnt look very happy
she doesnt actually its hard to tell anything about how she looks
she changes over here
so or he either that or he tried to grab it from her
Im not sure
because it looked like something happened
the second he looks like well hes going to leave
and shes gonna she still has the umbrella
so heres the little boy
hes actually getting wet
hes walking
and hes getting wet
and now hes really getting wet because its probably really coming out alot
you can see right here
its like this in pltu
well hes a pool s
pool s
hes on this pools on his shoes and stuff like that
so hes back in his house
and hes all covered with water
and his mother she doesnt look like this was a great decision on her part
she doesnt look happy
its hard to tell really but its kindof like the cartoon is
its hard to tell what she really looks
so I guess that she decided shell let him use the umbrella
and its still really raining
but he atleast hes dry with the umbrella
yeah
well this is pretty funny
well this is a little girl who has a cat
and the cat is up the tree
and I dont know if she was driving
she had her ci she was on a tricycle
so and heres a little the dog is up to is at the tree too
and hes barking
maybe thats what caused the cat was afraid or something and went up there
either that or theyre afraid of the sun
Ive always said that as a joke
so heres the ladder
now what it looks like the maybe the ladder was up there
and it fell over
and so now the this is funny because now the this man maybe its her father
because hes up there too
hes lost
he cant get down
and so what happened over here
a firemans over here
and hes gonna perhaps hes gonna save both the his
and then theres a bird up here who probably enjoys this whole thing
its not gonna run
now Im xxx
looks like its some looks like somebody draw a picture of a dog on here
yeah not years and years ago
nah I dont remember it
sure
www
well the first page is its on the lefthand side
it looks like maybe its could be it could be their mother and their two daughters
and they had like a little they had a little cat
and the little cat
they all look kindof like nervous to me
they didnt look like they were the little girl was the two little girls they look like they were dangerous people
and the cat looked like it was somebody that
the cat was like a funny looking cat too
and on this side there was a like a little girl
and she was very nice looking
and Im not sure who this guys sposta be
hes a man
and hes got like a beard
not a beard but what would you call that
mustache
and he seems like a nice person
and he was inviting them to come into their house
I dont know exactly what I could say about this whole thing
if I was a little girl I bet you I could remember all the details on this alot better than I could right
so then I think what you get to see this castle from the distance
and I think theres this young woman
and she looks like she works there
she probably works at the somebodys house
and she probably hadta like her job was to ke clean
and she was trying to help out
she probably wasnt rich
but I think they were looking
the major part of the story I think Im gonna continue with this is that they were looking for a young for a young man handsome man who was gonna get married
and they were and he was probably in the
what do you call that place again
I said it right but now Ive forgotten what to call it
the castle
they were gonna have like a dance there with music
and they had this glass shoe that they found the right one that would fit
that would be his that would be his wife
so alotof people came to the castle
and they had the they were dancing
and I think this young woman who was very good looking she was like she hadta work there
maybe it was her maybe it was the mother or something
but she had her two daughters older daughters werent very attractive
and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would somebody this handsome man was gonna marry her
so she was so mainly I think they went
Im not calling it a dance
I know Im sorry
and Im trying to think who the who this am this sweet lady whos like
shes a magical person
and shes gonna like
so this poor this u poor girl she needed to have a beautiful dress
but I dont think she had anything
but this
what did they call it
this that woman that could make things happen
I dont know what you call her
but she wound up going to the going to the dance in this beautiful dress
and what had happened is that she was gonna at the head of twelve she hadta run back home again because she would all of that magical dress and everything was gonna be was all gonna be gone
and shes gonna have her clothes that she just worked down in the cellar or in the floor or wherever she worked
to go back to work
so she was trying to run away from this beautiful man that wanted to marry her
and she lost this the glass shoe
so she managed to make it
youknow she ran away
she lost that the magical shoe that she was wearing
and so they what they did is they hadta find all the different women that perhaps would wanna marry him
if they had they hadta fit the right glass shoe
and I think they kindof they had it they had that they had the that they had the shoe
and they hadta decide
everyone was gonna come and try to put it on
and the only one that could put it on was the young woman that didnt have any money was poor
and she put it on
and then they decided that she was the one that was gonna that hes gonna marry her
I dont know
thats kindof like
how would I would do it
well the first thing I would have is a knife
and I would have a plate
and I would have some bread
and depends on what it is
if the bread was never uh if it was whole youd hafta take a knife
and youd hafta make two sights
I dont know what youd call it
when you have bread and you cut it into two pieces what do you call that
anyway I have the this
what Im gonna do is Im gonna have Im gonna open up the
see Im forgetting what the names of things are
and then the peanuts
and the other one starts with an
its kindof white
and it looks like
it starts with an fl
and what you do is you put them together in the bread
and then you could cut it in the half or something like that
and that would be your sandwich
but I cant think of what you call that funny name
that white thing that taste is probably tastes really good with the peanuts
Im sorry
yeah I was trying Im trying to think of what you
slights
is that Im close to it
the slight
yeah
closer
not exactly but slice
two thousand and one
yeah
I was at work
I was at work
and people came down
one of the women came down
and she said she was talking that her husband called the telephone called him
and one of the planes too
one plane hit
it was probably
what was it
it was eight fifty nine in the morning I think
and at first they thought it was like a small airplane
and it hit the it hit the Twintowers
but then they realized it was really it was north and
I think it was north and south
is that the different towers
and they thought that it really was a much bigger airplane
and anyway her husband said that he had heard that maybe theyre
this is later on that there was they were like
all around the country the other buildings were gonna get hit
and but basically we saw that there was really the pntnu
and the other plane
and then this is this was a number of I think there were four planes
the other one people that were riding got up and tried to like talk they got it to hit the ground
and lemme think what else happened
I think there was four planes
and okay yeah
so there were two there were two of the Twintowers
two h two different planes hit that
and then the Pentagon hit
and then the other plane they actually got it down
and the plane never hit anything
it hit the ground
okay
yeah
yeah
but it was funny because they thought that it was gonna that it was gonna
the her husband thought that it was gonna happen to alot more than that
where they got their information
they claimed that they could hear
I dont know what they did but they claimed that it might go everywhere around the country
but nothing yet we never ofcourse we realized that never happened
yeah okay
sure
no this is a story
like me to tell a story
okay the boy hit a ball
and he hit the window
and in the back actually it was his it was his house
and inside the house it couldve been an older man got hit by the ball
it hit the window on the outside
and on the inside it went through the window
and it hit the person that was sitting
and look like the person got up
and he l hold the held the ball
and he was out looking at a big hole in the window
and he was trying to see who actually hit him
I dont know thats
this is funny
Im gonna call this a heavy carousel
because if I took a little Ill if I spend more time Ill say what it is
anyway itll come up to me
I know what it is
Ive been practicing
where you were doing on the
I was
umbrella
okay umbrella
thats why I called it a heavy carousel
I thought that was kindof funny
I meant that I meant that to be funny
okay so anyway Ive been talking about this and I havent really been looking at this
sorry
I dont know what this means
is it its either the little boy was going to use that
or either that or his
I guess
is he heading is he in the beginning of it is the little boy talking to his mother that he wanted to use this
or he either that or he wanted it
and she said
Im not sure exactly how this is
so the little boy is still looking at his mother
and shes holding the heavy parasol
and anyway hes out the house
and its raining already
and now its really heavy rain
and so he came back
hes back to his house
and hes covered with water
and the rain was heavy
and his mother didnt look like shes very happy
and it doesnt say exactly what happened to the juslu
but he has it now
and hes back hes outside again
and hes not get his hes not get hes not get his hes not gonna on his head hes not gonna get hit by it
and he so hell be drier
I wasnt sure how that worked with the mother whether she really wanted him to use it or she wanted to keep it
Im not sure
okay
okay
oh okay
okay this is kindof a fun story
this is like the so ke theres a theres like a little girl
and she liked the cat
theres also a dog
now the dog could belong to the their family perhaps
or it could be somebody elses neighbor
and they had a dog
and the dog actually skedu
and the dog
and it was on the up there pretty high
so his
and the little girl probably was driving
I dont know what you call that it starts with a kl
its like a
anyways she still she really liked the cat
so somebody
it was either
theres also a theres also a bird up here
but I dont think that has anything involved with the cat
I dont think the cat is afraid of the bird
so you would think that the little girl if she was strong if she was older she could help lift up the ladder and put the father back on
but she cant
and I dont know
she doesnt look like shes involved that she has a small a telephone
and she could call up nineoneone or something sothat the fire people could come and put the ladder up and get his
and then and she also shes not gonna they like w birds so theyll they wont try to hurt the bird either
and they probably will get the
ofcourse the thing that would be kindof fun
if they were more interested in getting the cat theyd leave the father up there
I dont know
thats my little story
oh yeah I knew that was
I saw
I saw it
I saw it
sure
okay
www
my version
well the first page these there are little girls
and theres a h theres a mother
and they had like a little a cat
and the cat
so those so and then on the second page I dont know if its her husband
and theres like and theres another girl
its possible that they that the mother had three girls
and the two of them were kindof her pals
and maybe they were twins
Im not sure
but they werent very attractive
and the cat looked like it was alotof trouble too
it had a kindof it was almost like their mother
their mother didnt look like she was alotof fun either
and maybe perhaps it was her husband
and they had like a dog
and the dog looked like a nice dog
and little blonde girl was she was nice too
and the husband perhaps it was the husband
he seems like a nice person also
and the mother and her two little twin girls and that little and the cat are just trouble
so whats happening
theyre we can see that this happened in a much later period of time
and the three little girls got older
and two of them werent very attractive
and the mother was perhaps its her mother she much preferred the two twin sisters that werent very attractive
and so they actually if I remember correctly the they useta let the little the pretty little girl hadta do crappy work
and she wasnt treated she much preferred the twins if they were twins
so and I think the mother the young girl the at one time she was a blonde
I think her hair is u
she was looking at a beautiful dress
and she also looked out the window
and she saw this beautiful place where the
I hafta say how you call that right
it starts with a cl
its probably the head of the
if there was like there was a town
he is either something like the y the mayor or he was a important person
he had like a young he had this young man that perhaps was gonna be the king or something
Im not sure exactly how you say it
and its like
Im having a really hard time calling what the name of that place was
starts with a cl
castle
the castle
they saw the castle
okay
so were setting up here
we see the young the attractive young girl
shes our nice she had youknow she had shes older
she saw iz this very attractive dress
and she looked out the window
and she saw the castle
and this would be a nice
thats the area
so then the mother got a letter claiming that there was gonna be a big dance or a big area where people
I dont think hes the king or whatever he is were all gonna take a look at this
its gonna be around
it must be its a important area because people were going to theyre gonna dance with this young man
theyre gonna have music
theyre gonna have food perhaps
it seems like a great time
but the main reason was is that all those young girls all around the country they would decide which one the kings young son was gonna marry
hes gonna marry one of those women
and so I also I if I remember correctly the their the pretty girl couldnt really go to couldnt go to this interesting plriu
lemme see what you call it right
so theres a rr magic grandmother
and she decides that the little that the young woman this young woman could wear nice clothes
she could wear nice clothes too
youknow theres a beautiful white gown
and she would go
and she danced with the she danced with the young man who was gonna be the king in the future
and they seem like this is the one
and she had this there was a glassed
and alotof different people tried to put that on
and only one had the right feet that would be able to wear the glass shoes
and so the so they the young man was ofcourse quite happy
and but the problem was is that things are gonna change at twelve
theres a midnight time
and I think all of that
I dont know if this story says it rr was correctly that they were all in this beautiful place
this not a wagon
Im not saying the right term of what this thing is
but at twelve this thing that everybodys riding on turns into
you cant ride in it nicely
its
Im having a hard time when I was doing this
I it starts with a
that orange thing
it starts with a pl
and we were doing this when we were together
I couldnt say it right
and it starts with a
anyway thats it turns its got wheels and all of this
and at the when it turns twelve the whole things gonna ke turn into something else
and everybodys gone
and there the girl was xxx the actually the attractive young woman shes running away because its gonna turn twelve
and she still has one of the glass one of the glass shoe
so theyre looking the king is wondering what happened to the other glass shoe
and people are going around to all of the different places
and went over to the one house that the mother had the two twins that they never really liked very much
ofcourse she couldnt fit she didnt have one like that
so then the little blonde girl the little blonde woman had the other
oh I know what they did
they found one
they found one that
and they had like their
and the only one that could do it was the one that was like doing all she was a worker
and she wasnt treated as nice as the mother and they the twin sisters
and she wound up she could fit that
and they decided this is the one
and the thing ends that theyre gonna get married
Im sorry
peanut butter and jelly sandwich
how would I do it
I guess I would like Id prefer the type of bread
alotof people like white bread
and they also preferred small smooth peanuts
and if they had a choice of the
its peanut and jelly
the jelly
what it what could be made outof
it could be could it be made outof apple
it could be grace
Imean purple
what do you call purple
purple grease
anyway all these different types of
they could be made outof like oranges
mrbliu
and what was your question
how I would prefer to have it
oh well Id have two pieces of bread
and I would put on one side Id put a
and I prefer if I was gonna be preferred Id have peanut peanuts
Id have ke chunks in it
and I would I use apple l dvlu
I cant say it right
and one would be on one side and one on the another
I put it together
I take a knife
and I would cut it in half
and I would have that on a plate
oh I definitely think because when I first met you at FirstnameP and FirstnameYs house you were doing the same kind of testing
and I think most of them I couldnt say anything
Imean Id see the pictures
and I couldnt say an action thing like somebodys ke bending or something like that
Imean Id just look at the pictures
and Id see pictures of things
if I saw a peacock or an artichoke or something like that youknow it was I probably there was probably most things
maybe my I could say my glasses maybe or banana
I dont know if I said that at the time but
but most everything else Id just youknow Id just look at the I would just look at the pictures youknow
and Id I would be trying to say something but youknow I couldnt do it
so I think Im alot better now
and I think I did better in well
I havent seen Martha and Jacquie and you and myself were doing that for like a couple of weeks
and I think that Im better now than I was then
yeah
thats what Im saying
thats one of the
and then ofcourse that youknow when youre not doing it for like
its been awhile
I hadnt been thinking about for up until recently a couple of days ago
and I started thinking about everything else together
now youknow the saying stuff again
and alotof it was coming back perfectly fine
and then some of the some of them Ive added
Ive added that I really couldnt I wouldnt be able to do correctly
but I think Ive done a little bit better
like somethings planting youknow
it has planting in the ground or something like that
yeah
I dont know if theres anything else youd like me to say
yeah
yes
okay
yeah
a young man is kicking a ball
and hes really not looking where hes going to do it
and it comes over to a neighbors window
and the ball goes right through the window
and the its hard to tell whether thats its an old its an older its a
it could be a elder a young a old an older man not an older man thats sitting in the sofa
and the ball just knocked over the lamp
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp
and probably could hit the third this third person here
theyre sitting here
so the man stands up
and hes picking up the ball
and hes looking out the window to see who probably threw it
yeah
well this is an umbrella
remember I couldnt even say umbrella
so the mother is holding the umbrella
and the little boy is looking
and she probably saying goodbye
and she thinks
he said
but then hes out
and hes
you can see its even getting worse over here
and he hes back
comes so he runs back to his house
and the mothers there
and shes saying
theyre both looking
hes soaking wet
and the mothers looking at him
and shes gonna probably give him the umbrella
and hes going back
I dont know where hes going
hes probably going to school
and he has an umbrella
and now hes going back to school
yup
and
yup
well the little girls looking at the
theres a tree here
and now this thing probably was start I think this was started that the dog was running after a cow
and the cat ran up the tree into a
how do I say this
oh a breach
Im doing two with and Im not saying it right
anyway its the its part of the its part of the tree
so this is where the cat eventually got up was up here
so the little girl couldve been actually seeing the dog a chasing the cat
and but anyway she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down
she was probably riding a ic tricycle
so the probably her father put the ladder up on the limb and went up there
and the ladder fell
so the its pretty high up
and the cats up there
and the man is way up high
and he doesnt have a ladder
and his and by the looks of it his actually his daughters more interested in the cat than her father
or thats or its a man perhaps
and theres a bird on the in the tree also but I dont think theyre involved in
yeah and I dont think theyre afraid the cat or anything like that
so the firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going to first take the father down
and then theyre gonna get the cat
and the little girl will be happy
and the dog
who knows whats gonna happen to the dog
its gonna probably chase after her the cat again and find another tree
I dont know
Cinderella
oh yes
yup
www
okay
on
and theyre not very attractive
and theres a theres another girl whos a blonde and quite attractive
same age
but she hasta do things to ke do all the work
and the I think that the mother
and Im not sure whether that the mother the attractive one is part is shes part of the family or one of a younger woman
well with the with this mother
Im not sure how that works out
theres a handsome man too
Im not sure that thats her husband
and youknow and maybe youknow thats the reason why he has those two the other two woman that arent very attractive
so hes the young lady is looking over the window out into the city and sees the ss castle which Im sure that who whos probably the king of the of that area lives at the regular city
and the people live in a regular in the house regular house with the mother and the other the other three young women
and two of them
I dont even remember if theyre twins
Im not sure the they have ke dark hair and stuff like that
so shes the king wants to have a party for his young son
and itd be nice if he might if everybody in the city that are they get a letter
Im not sure everybodys gonna get one but theyre gonna have this dance
and theyll they could actually meet the this young man coming up
so the young girl the blonde lady is like down in the has her own room
or maybe it could be in the basement or something
and shes looking at a at the different ah the
what do you call that
the dress is not apparently its not perfectly beautiful in the
and the other
so theyre going when theyre going to the party
and actually three of the three of the girls the two twins
and shes going
and theyre not
I think part of that Im missing whats happened
well anyway what happens is that the young girl talks to the magical grand grandmother
I know Im not using it correctly
and she has a magical
I cant think what did I call it
anyway it turns her into a beautiful white dress
and she also has the her shoes are made outof glass
and shes dancing with a young with a handsome man
and they seem like theyre getting along
and ofcourse the women the other children theyre probably adults now arent really that happy about the fact that she has a beautiful gown and shes dancing and obviously the young gentleman prefers her
and they also know that all of that the beautiful dress and everything like that was given by the this magical grandmother
I know Im not using this right
knows that at twelve oclock everything will change
and shell hafta like shes gonna hafta run away
so right she realizes that its almost twelve that e that evening
and shes running away down the stairs
and she lost the glass shoe
and all of the she had a castle
not a castle
well she
Im having a difficult saying how this young woman was riding
but anyway at o at twelve oclock everything goes back to its original what it was
and so shes gone
shes back at the house
and the king found this beautiful glass shoe
and he wants to go all the way around the city and try to find this woman
www
and they came to that particular house
and they found they had the a the grass
and the young woman the blonde lady she actually shes the only one that will that can actually fit that glass shoe
and the everybodys really pleased about it
and they realized that the king
I guess hes a prince
the prince and this young woman are gonna get married
and thats how it ends
I forgot the part
youknow how they how she got to the party
was I think they have like everything is made outof ke
ke the horses are really mice and stuff like that
I dont know if it doesnt say that in there but
what
a peanut butter and jelly
how would I how would how I would make it
and I would use my knife
well if I was gonna make a sandwich with outof peanuts and some kind of futu
and I would buy it
and its really fresh
and I would and Id use the knife
and I would its it I hafta ke
Im trying to think of what the right term
slice
Im gonna slice the bread and make two pieces but whatever size I want it to be
and then I would open up the peanut butter
and I would use the knife
and I could put as much peanut butter I would want
and I would open up the fruit jelly the jelly
and I could put as much on that as I want
and I would cut it in half or even four pieces
and I could eat it
and it would be delicious
atleast thats what Im gonna say
the what
excuseme
what did I think of that
and the more I did that the better I could get at it
and I would say really at the end I would do if I was if I would if I would do twenty of each I would probably be nineteen or twenty youknow
I thought I was very close I was very good at that I thought
and then the last thing I did is I was doing ns I was writing nsin snssz
Im not saying it right
I was writing senses
I guess I cant say it can I
yes I was doing that
and I was trying to do I was trying to do much I was trying to do a better job
but Imean that and that would
and I dont know if you noticed in November and January in January and December I would take a long time to try to ke do a good job of doing
say if I was doing an object
if I was trying to write a sentence about it youknow
I was trying very difficult
youknow
and I think the Ipad is the really the thing that started me doing that youknow
I dont know if what Im if thats fine
yeah
yeah
sure
yeah I know what this one
I just walked in the door and I knew that
its not gonna be me
okay
well I think in the beginning there was the little girl
she really loved her cat
and the cat went up the tree
no its not
so she tried to get it down
so then I think that was probably her father
so shed say she said to the girl said to her father
so the father took a ladder
and he went up the tree
and maybe this is why the cat went up there though
I guess the dog caught the cat up the tree
so anyway the ladder fell down
and the father was caught up there
so and ofcourse years ago she would hafta go home and call up the fire the firemen to come but now she probably has a smartphone and she could call up the firemen
and theyre gonna come back
and theyre gonna get not only are they gonna get the her father
theyre also theyre gonna get the cat
and I think that theres a nice bird up here
and the bird is just looking up there
and its kindof like singing about
I dont know what its gonna be singing about but shes gonna be happy about it
I dont know
something like that
I tried to start in the beginning and you could see it progress
mhm
sure
oh okay
yup and
www
Im not good at telling this story
in the beginning I guess it was like an old town probably in Europe
and there were there was a mother with little girls
and the and then there was a blonde girl who when she was young I dont know what she was doing but she useta help she was helping
she didnt really do great work
Imean she wasnt part of the family
and I think that the mother with the two girls
and they had black hair
and they werent very attractive and when they were young
and the little girl when she was
I think they were probably nine or ten
and the little blonde girl looked she looked basically the same
when she got older she still was very attractive but she did she was doing she was just doing work down in youknow down in
she was doing work like washing clothes and cleaning the house and things like that
so anyway I Im not sure whether thats the king or the mayor or something thats gonna
theyre sending a letter to everyone that they were gonna have a dance or
I guess there was a castle in the background
and they were invited to go to see the her son who
and Im not ofcourse when I even when I was young I dont remember this story youknow to be honest with you
but I think that the young man wanted to get married
whether he was I dont know if he was going to be the king in the future or whether he was just an important person young important person or something
so they invited probably
I dont know if the people were probably had more money or something like that
but the mother she was kindof an evil person
and I think that the older those two little girls now that theyre older theyre I dont think that theyre not
youknow theyre not wonderful people either I dont think
so the little the blonde girl she was looking at beautiful a dress
no thats not a dress
if Im saying now xxx term dress
is that a dress
I guess its a dress
pictures of it and stuff like that
and she was thinking about she has the three mice and the cat and the horse
that was part of her jobs down in the youknow maybe its in a barn or something like that
and so I think what got things alot better is that the fairy godmother helped her out when she went to the dance
and so the there was a pumpkin turned into this
so the fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a
I dont know what I could call that
and the horse the I think maybe the three mice became theyre gonna carry this rri carriage
xxx its a carriage
they went to they went to the dance
and she looked gorgeous
she had a beautiful dress and she was a blonde and everything
and she danced with the prince
and but what would happen at the at noon at the not noon at twelve oclock the everything was gonna go was gonna return
so the three mice are gonna turn are gonna turn into theyre gonna go back to like mices
and the other horse or something like that was
theyre all gonna go back to the barn or something like that
so she says
she runs away
and she had like a glass slipper
and she was running away because it was gonna be right at
I keep on saying noontime but its like twelve oclock
she so anyway the king and his a
it was actually one of his like lieutenant or something like that went all around the city or the large town
and she
and the prince was hoping if she
so she
and she actually found the blonde this
I dont know if she was a maid or something
she was doing that kind of work
and she had a glass shoe that matches with the one that the king or the re mayor something
and they said
and all the other women would try to put on the glass slipper
and ofcourse youknow it would it wouldnt fit
and especially the this evil mother and her two daughters were not happy about it at all
so then at the end she had the glass slipper
and at the end you could see that the prince and that the blonde woman are gonna get married
I was trying to do it
sure
I think its August
and it was a Friday
it was about eight fifty nine
it was almost nine oclock
I was driving on the BostonRoad
I was driving a nineteen ninety three Ford van
we had just gone to a HomeDepot
and she brought
a bathroom s
a bathroom s
it was made outof fiberglass
and then I showed her a thirty foot long ladder that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less
and then I started driving
like I said on BostonRoad
and I was going to Yuno
and FirstnameG looked at me and she said
and I wasnt going very fast anyway
so I managed to ke not hit anything
and I managed to turn right
and I pulled off of the side of the road
and I put on the brakes
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that
I was holding on to the wheel
and then and that was
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor
and they all could see something was happening
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground
and then somebody with a smartphone called up an ambulance
and they said
and after that I it took me a long time before I could say Bay BayState or something like that
and youknow I was saying to myself I said
and then I tried to say something to FirstnameG
and then I couldnt say anything
and then I couldnt say the right words
Imean I knew what I could say but I couldnt say it
and thats when I realized that I probably had a stroke
I think thats
have I said that before
oh okay
uhhuh
uhhuh
well in the beginning theres a little girl
and theres a cat
and I think that the little girl loves the cat
its a good friend
I dont know if its male or female
and shed like she wanted to get have the cat off of a tree
its up on the trntu
I cant say
brntsu
brntszu
brntsu
okay so she asked her father if he could use a ladder and to go up to the tree and get the cat
and then a ladder fell down
maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get away to this far away as possible
either that or the dog wished the father hadnt fallen down the ladder
so then theres a bird
I dont know how what the bird is involved
its gonna its making a song perhaps
and theres another ladder thats involved with the firemen
and theyre trying to lift up the theyre gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his
if the cat was more important ofcourse the firemen would get the cat first and then the r the and then get the father down
is there anything else
yup
yeah youknow I
that thing about the grand that about the grandmother
Ive forgotten what I should call the right term to call the grandmother
yeah
oh I cant look at it
okay
www
okay the version
okay
in the very beginning theres a mother
there are two daughters
and Im not sure
theres another woman young girl
and shes a blonde
and she has blue eyes
and the two daughters have dark hair
and theyre young then
and then this continues in the future
time is going on
and the girls are much older
and the two daughters are not very attractive
and the blonde lady has her hairs now kindof light brown but her you can still see her blue eyes
and shes
in the beginning I have no idea why that young the blonde girl is there
whether shes an shes like
something happened to their family and theyre just taking you theyre gonna live
so anyway Im not sure about that
so anyway shes like her friends are all other mice
and the cat seems kindof evil to me
the cats alittle evil
theres a horse theres a horse there
there all these little there are three or four mice
and the they realize that theres that theyre going to theres a king
and he has a son
and they n theyd like to have a dance because they would like to marry the son whos probably a prince
and so they invite everybody in the town
I think
or just people that have alotof money and youknow the
so theres a litter
and they could go to a prawn
not a prawn
Im not using the right xxx
a dance
its gonna be a dance or something like that
and the on the brown haired the light brown haired blonde woman is like shes very excited too
she could probably go herself
and she had her she has a gown
its okay
and theyre going to the dance that evening
so thats gonna happen I think
so then theres this andau grand
not a grand lady
see the last time I said it I knew what her name was
its kindof like
and the first time I said it was a magical grandmother
but it isnt magical
its something else
and so anyway they said that with magic I could turn the horse and the pumpkin
I dont know
they didnt say anything about the pumpkin but I think I saw the movie a long time ago
a pumpkin became a
I dont know what they call that
its not a truck
anyway the mice are gonna be part of the on this group of people that are going to the dance
and the horse is beautiful
and the thing shes gonna carry and is very interesting
and then they go to the they go to the dance
its in the its in its getting its very its in the nine ten oclock at night
shes go shes dancing with the prince
and she has her shoes are glass shoes
and theyre very small
and she realizes that at twelve oclock that all of the magical stuff is gonna be gone
and shes gonna so she realizes that its almost twelve oclock
and she get she runs away from the dance or whatever it is
and she lost one of them one of the glasses shoes
and so shes back at her u shes back at the house
and where shes like us
she just helps out
and the part of the
the king found the grass
and they everybody tries to put their feet in it
and ofcourse the two daughters
ofcourse it doesnt say that but Im sure thats what happens
everybody in the town they cant theyre too they have theyre the glass shoe is all too their youknow their feet are too big
and then the young useta be a blonde blue hair
and they realized that shes really gonna be a princess
and then
and the other thing is that Im confused about when she goes to the dance she has a kindof a white pink dress
but then shes at the dance and shes got a much nicer its a gown perhaps
its a really its white very beautiful
and shes got the grass
and she runs away
I dont know what happened to the to that white gown
shes got the pink and white one
and shes back in her bathroom
and then youknow then she can fit the grass
she shes gonna be the one that the prince and the princess are gonna be married
thats kindof
oh yeah

and then also there was a
and some lady
her thing here whatever she was on
and it looks like there is
yeah
okay
www
and there was one more lady that hadta go with the ladies or girls sisters fake sisters not real sisters
she wanted to see those girls take care of everything with the sisters
and one sister was mean
one was both of them two of them they were mean
and the other girl was nice
and she hadta do all the work all the
she hadta clean everything
and all the other girls didnt do anything
and then these girls went to a ball
and one girl wanted to go to the blu
she cant go
and she really wanted to go
and she was helped to go to the ball
and she went and she met the prince
and she was talking to him and dancing to
everything was good
but then it was time for her to leave
and she was like
and she left
and she dropped her shoes
and she went she left
and when she left she got all her old clothes not her new clothes
and when she got there the ladder s
and she
and I wanna marry her
and they found one of the
they asked the two girls that were mean
and neither one of them could fit the shoes
the other one could fit the shoes
and they p they lived happily in the after
that was weird
well Im supposing that my speech is getting alittle better as time has gone by
I think that I can especially when Im at the beginning of the day I think I can speak fairly well at certain times
Ive been able in certain cases to discuss whole elaborate stories with other people
and sometimes they dont work quite aswell
sometimes I can get lost its talking to my brother or somebody like that and just hafta give up and stop
at other times I can just yack away with my natural bullship
so sometimes I really feel like I can still talk myself perfectly well
but then things foul get fouled and fouled up or they just start to getting snafuednv from time to time
but periodically I can surprise people by sounding pretty normal
it was actually very charming
I was just sitting around in my house
not I wasnt feeling very well because Id been about had about ten days of not feeling particularly great
and allofasudden every something seemed to be terribly wrong
I said
but first I called the ambulance immediately
then I went and got myself a little valise and gathered all my things together
and then I put a couple of things in my dresser like for example my wedding ring and stuff like that just to get them outof the way
and then I took I had an email I was I worked on
I got about four people little just little emails saying
and then I went out of that and stood outside waiting for the hospital
and the emt looked at it
and I said
and so and then I helped myself out to the place
and that was the last thing I saw
yeah no I was really very I was very
yeah I just got it all right
and the minute the emt came out that was the end
I was lost
I remember it at the beginning of
I cant remember the name of that stupid place
I it was
whats the name of that place
ugh I had three different rehabs
and I and they got me going away very quickly
where most of the time
alotof it was like talking but some of it was also just walking around
but then I cant remember anything about CooleyDick at all
I have no idea
and that was about seven weeks or something like that
I have no idea of anything of CooleyDick at all except for my last trip to CooleyDick
before that I have no idea
so my friends once in awhile theyll tell me all these ridiculous things that I did and silly things that I was trying to say and failing to say
but I had nothing
absolutely nothing
CooleyDick was just a i a void
yeah
it was very strange
and somehow I came to at this place in
I its terrible to forget the name of the place
but it was about twelve weeks
no
twelve days
twelve days
it was good
it was very good place
something that was meaningful
lets see if I had any meaningful days
lets think now
meaningful day
thats a toughie
I guess probably one meaningful day in my life mustve been my daughters birth and my daughters growth and development
and enjoying the amazingness of it as she was growing up
so that was something that was always changing and was always different
okay
okay
Pudd was out playing baseball
and when Pudd was kicking the ball at somewhere
Pudd then faded s
and smashed it through as MisterMcGilicuddy sat through with horror and disgust and stared out at Pudds foul ds Pudds foul break

I see
Angus was shouldve gotten ready for work
MissusMcGilicuddy whatever xxx her name is quickly espied that Pudd was getting wet and getting wetter and wetter as the day went by
so Pudd n went quickly off into moms place and said

dad tries to get there but dad ofcourse will wind up failing to do it because the dad is old like me and only get messed up
a little girl is screaming
and the dog ofcourse is barking n furiously
so and a bird is singing along
and here just in time when this disaster is transpiring here comes the firemen just in time to save ourselves
probably
I probably I may not be able to do this
I dont know
I cant vouch for this one
so I Im looking at it first
www
oh I hafta look at this one first
alright
Cinderella is a stepsister of two beastly creatures who are the
Cinderella is the step stepchild of two beastly creatures who are living in this castle s
and they treat her very badly
and she hasta to do all kinds of terrible chores while they who do nothing at all completely are sitting around and scowling at poor Cinderella who hasta do all the shit work
around that time
notice the how quickly this is gonna move
outof that rtel point the hideous epsis ep stepparents who are living in the house are were br bro xxx were invited to give a special feast for all of the nasty all of these the all of these fabulous creatures that were living in this in the magical place
now Cinderella really wouldve loved to go to the
Cinderella wouldve gladly come to with to be with all of the other creatures who got to be there in that wonderful place
but she ofcourse was not allowed to come
then her fairy godmother showed her a whole pile of Versace that she looked really good at
and for a little bit of awhile she was allowed to go with these creatures while all kinds of extraordinary kinds of extraordinary coachmen were riding through all of this place
the n the prince who was necessarily unhappy with the scabrous looking women that were hanging around in his house decided that Cinderella was really much more charming and wondrous than she had knew she had thought herself
and so she
but at that point the it became clear that the belle of the ball the
at that it
try it again
at that point it became clear that midnight was over and the magical creatures that were riding in her castle disappeared
and then the horrible creatures that were living in the place looked around and said
they had no idea who looked so wonderful in this Versace
when n and then at that point one of the
one of the curt courtiers came out with creatures looking for real for some kind of for some kind of a
the courtiers wanted to find Cinderella but they could not find her
so eventually the two scabrous and in heinous creatures who looked around the palace discovered that there that noone was available to them
they said
what whats that thing called
the magical Versace that shes in
and so they looked at her and said
youknow that she is the one that we were all looking for
and ofcourse the scabrous and nasty creatures were horrified that Cinderella would wouldve been the other person that they were that they were looking for
at that point the courtier ou brought Cinderella over
and she just she was she got h massive amounts of money for the rest of her life because she got to stay with the prince
is that good enough
yes it
that thrilling tale yeah
sure
well having just done one today I bet I could do that
I had some bread
and I took big pieces of two
alright lets try it again
next weve got two pieces of bread
some peanut butter
jelly thats slobbed s
and then lots of gooey peanut butter thats piled up
and then I take the two and put them together and squeeze them
and then I squeeze them together
and then I chop the first of them out
and I say
it was
it was really good actually
certainly
yes I think I was sposta I think I had dropped my
no thats a good question
I think I dropped my daughter
and I went home to SouthDeerfield
and FirstnameP was there
and I we had things we were gonna do later in the day
but allofasudden as I was driving I heard some chaos and commotion going off in the by the radio
and I went down and sat there and said
and then I went up to FirstnameP who was getting dressed
I said
so I went out and we had a to the tv and started looking at it
once it started it was like you just hadta stop and look at it
there was nsu
and my managing editor at the Review who at that time was living nearby came over too
so the three of us just sat around and watched
but I think nothing else happened that day
I think we just shut it all down and just sat there and began to try to deal with it a little bit
but it was an extraordinary day because that was when the two towers fell down one after another
and it was amazing to just sit there
then one of them the smoke would go over it and
and Ive spent I know what all that stuff is like and
that was pretty much it
I think we just sat there and the three of us
and we hadta just we had I hadta explain to her what how what happened
that was tough
mhm
okay
Otto was playing soccer and kicked the ball much harder than he expected
the ball broke the glass of MisterMcGregors house and kicked his and bumped his own his ball s
at this point MisterMcGregor came out very angry and upset by the destruction of his property
okay
Patricia told her daughter to
her son
I guess its a son
Patricia told her son to make sure to get an umbrella today because it might very well rain
however young Ants said
so Ants was on his way to school when eventually he began seeing the dribble drops of the rain as it proceeded
infact the rain got very heavy
and he hadta return to his house where his
whos she
his when his i when his daughter
then young Ants carried his carried himself with a nice umbrella to get to school in the morning
youre right
yeah thats it
its true
oh yeah this
it was a terribly busy day here in Woodbrook
the cat was had treedv itself in today in the early afternoon
and young Polly was trying very hard to get the cat treedv before it tried to get even farther into the tree itself
dad attempted to get the tree
and he couldnt get out get the he couldnt get the tree
he couldnt get the tree together for himself
so here the there was no point by of trying to get the ladder because dad just couldnt get it up
and there it was
the dog was ofcourse as dogs always do began to bark and bark furiously which ofcourse made the cat even more perturbed
by this time they hadta actually call a fireman to get the cat back
and the thing had a happy ending with a twittering bird
oh yeah
okay
www
once upon a time the children were astounded to see that there was a new child magically appearing from somewhere
though where she was she came from noone seemed to know
mother was very mom her mother was very angry with that idea and thought well I suppose that Cinderella can simply be a servant this for her for herself and for her own two daughters
and sure enough thats what Cinderella mostly did
she s she mostly worked terribly
and as she was and the other three daughters were ofcourse hideous and vicious
and they were of they were they really they didnt stay in the in they didnt sit stay in the
its not the apartment
anyway they had a quiet they had another spot a sortof servants quarters that they hadta keep
it was a it was a beautiful day
there was a there was a you could see the kings castle look looking kindof twinkling in everybodys eyes as they looked besides
but luckily there was something that helped Cinderella during this time
mostly some rodents that appeared n constantly in what wouldve been I guess a very needed wouldve needed a
oops cant do it never mind
lets forget that part
and also there was a horse lying around and I think maybe a dog aswell
at that point the two other daughters of their mother heard that there was going to be a special ball today presumably for the princes birthday or something like that
and there Cinderella thought
and she got the a little dress herself
and yet the two nasty daughters said
shes a servant youknow
and they are they were the hautesadj old bourgeoisiesn of the place
so they said
and there was just no point in her being here
fortunately for Cinderella who wouldve been no doubt weeping in for the misery of not being at the castle n Cinderella had a fairy godmothmother
and she said
I will get your I will get you a beautiful dress
here comes trouble
coach
a magic coach that you can ride
and sure enough there were also two beautiful horses that were not like the mangy old horses that Cinderella knew
they move then to the beginning of the ball
and allofasudden the princes
and she danced with him
and they danced the ball together happily for many time many hours
however Cinderella also hadta stop because the in the at the croak
no xxx
at the croak
and so she hadta walk back from the she had to walk she hadta drive back
but allofasudden but at that point she also no longer had her beautiful gown
at this point the king
this the prince said to the king
and they looked all around to try to discover her but she they couldnt or not readily
eventually they came up to the place where Cinderella
no sorry
where the two nasty creatures that normally bat inhabited the place would have their would have their missing slipper
and they tried each one
and the these nasty creatures were unable to fit with the were unable to fit the slipper
however Cinderella was
and they were delighted to be able to discover her
and they brought her back to the castle where she eventually lived there and married with the king
that was sloppy work
I shouldve done better with that really
yes
first I would get some bread
and then I would probably get some butter and slop the bread out
and then I would get some I would say probably jelly
Id slop the jelly in
Id bring it all back
then I will would cut the other portions of it
then Id eat it up
well I think that we were I was hoping that I would really just be able to get all of them all the time
and I think we were close to being able to do that
and maybe the little hiatus here has not been good because I should be thinking about this
but somehow I really found that I could really do it again
youknow Ive seen alot of that of those names and stuff so I didnt sit there thinking about it
perhaps that wouldve been a good thing to do
because its really not that one doesnt know these things
its more like just the its just like these are quick things that you hafta say quickly
and it does just allofasudden something off something oh kindof physical xxx
and thats it
youknow you cant really figure it out
so what did I think about that
I dont know
Imean all of these games are kindof fun
and they enable us I think to see these to see the these pictures are moving around
and I think from that point of view I think we can all imagine that as something that is a kindof a logical set of motions
but youknow its it seems like the difficulties with seeing those individual names they that seemed like it was a big deal
whereas sitting around working with the with youknow with a couple of games like
whats the name of that one again
see I cant even tell you the names of them
but even so I think there was we were making those things
youknow it was like looking at the youknow from the from those
its not my its not my day today
thats all I can tell you
no I really feel like Im really
oh yeah
its just all this stupid pain
yeah though I dont I just started that
so Ill be even worse now
yes
mhm
a nasty little boy who is not watching what he was doing kicked a ball right into the McGilicuddys driveway
said MisterMcGilicuddys MisterMcGilicuddy saying
so MisterMcGilicuddy looked in and at the at this terrible moment when he hadta see the his entire roof
hows that
mommy told us that we were it was gonna be a rainy day
and then we said
well poor Collin was out there
and suddenly the rain came back
and it came immediately
and poor Collin came racing down saying
said and said the mother angry and vitriolic
but now Collin has a an umbrella
and hes done extremely well
and noones yelling at him
and hes gonna be alright
oh yes here we go again
poor young Candace was horrified because her cat had strku
it strku
Candace was really appalled that she was unable to retrieve the cat
nor was her brother or her
lets see
this must be Daddy
Daddy also could not deal with this either
and dog made things even worse by barking ridiculously and loudly thereby taking the situation even more ao becoming even more chaotic ever
there was even a there was even a velocipede and a
its not a rope
its a
we know whats one thats one of those things
anyway that stuff was around
but luckily for them the bird became delighted with its twittering because here comes the firemen who are going to grab the kitty from at last its being its happy moment when it will be something or other
oh yeah
thats right again
okay
www
you want the NewJersey version or the Cinderella
well lets see
for some reason a young man who was living in his parents
its not his parents
the lets try it again
for some reason Cinderella was discovered living with the Galumpy Galumpky family of Sweden when allofasudden they discovered that this brand new kid in the house
somebody that they dont know before whos living there
the three horrible Galumpkys Gonoral and Ragen turned into the most awful ach creatures ever and began to make fun of them at these poor people while the thing was going on
then as it happened the Galumpkys were waiting to get the invitation for a beautiful wedding
not a its not a wedding sorry
when the theres going to be a big party of some kind or another
so they go out there and theyve got all their fancy clothes
but there is there are once again the these the Gonoral and Ragen are so awful and stern o droning and youknow
and eventually it looks like theres gonna be no fun for poor Cinderella at all
so shes she goes away
and she cant be voi invited for the rest of the party
so she goes over there
and suddenly shes been sitting around most of the time calling or talking to youknow barnyard animals which is what I guess you hafta just live with once youre if youre an orphan
and allofasudden they said
and here comes
what is her name
the this magical creature is gonna fix everything for you
and she has all the all of her clothing is wonderful
and a magical
wait a second
so then the fairy godmother is going to look at this and see how wonderful that these two women are
so they go
no his
sorry
his
nope its not working
lets try it again
Cinderella wanted to go to the ball but she couldnt
but now but with the
whats the name of that fantastic creature
with this fantastic creature who will deliver give her this beautiful new gown theres no reason to be worried about that because its gonna look absolutely beautiful for all time
so there the s
I guess hes a king or some such
no hes a prince
thats what it is
ofcourse hes a prince
and allofasudden the prince
so but youknow when the when its time for the clock to get
but when the clock strikes then Cinderella hasta to run away before that comes
so now theyre waiting on to see what happens
who is this new Cinderella this strange and wondrous person that thats with us
because weve never seen him
so the prince says
and so they look first at the at Gonoral and then Ragen and said
whereas suddenly when Cinderella is shown they say
and now she can go
and youknow with Im assuming that they can get married immediately for all of this
then the prince will be delighted with Cinderella
and they will live happily ever after
yes
well that shouldnt be that difficult because Ive known been known to have peanut butter and jelly sandwiches
first I get some bread
then I get some peanut butter over here
and then also its time to get some
its not butter
its jelly
now get the jelly out there xxx
and then bring them back
xxx
cut the cut them in half for daintiness
xxx
oh
mhm
thats an interesting question isnt it
well it seemed it probably presumably you could actually do this on a less high tech
but it is nice to have
and it has several different functions
one is the
what do you call that thing
know yourself
that the thing we always talk to together
the
thats one thing
then theres the stprwtu
and theres the basic media of the thing
so it has alotof different uses I think
so it I guess its probably exactly what you need for your
well Imean sure
because youknow something got t got better here through the whole operation I think
youknow it certainly seems thats that seems to be the case because I was really flailing there at the beginning
and then I flailed again when I was trying not to look at the letters
youknow just I would just push it
so that and that seems to have been the second way to help myself here
is because then I could get to the point where I could sortof write these things a little bit
and actually everyday this is getting a little better now
Im still using the whatchamacallit
the
yes
yeah the Ipads great actually
it works perfectly well
and I do really like a Ipads as a genre
goddamn this is like literature or something
ready
alright
girl has lost her kitten which is now going to the is now sitting in the tree
dad would like to get the kitty back but cant get it
and apparently also the ladder was no use in the in dad trying to get these things from the child
as if to make matters worth
a birds twittering
before things really got outof hand the fireman came and got the and were about to get the kitty back from the fire persons
not great but
its not Goethe youknow
oh that again
probably
mhm
okay
oh really
mhm
www
lets try to see
a young orphan was brought to the house to live with two there where two odious women were where two odious women were holding forth
when they began at the very beginning the Cinderella as her name would be known later was now just a kind of a servant waiting on these two women and their foul mother
Cinderella noticed the beautiful
try again
Cinderella saw that the princes castle gleaming in the distance
at last a party was at last the party was
the king had asked a party to be
no I cant do this
the king set a party
it sent
Ill try this again
the king had a party where the all of the beautiful women could be known to the prince who would be who would find himself a find himself a r person
where the young prince could meet all of the other women that were around in the valley
Cinderella would gladly have taken had gone to that party except she was not allowed
the two hideous women were all deck decked up looking their very best
but Cinderella was not allowed to go
at that point a fairy godmomother
here the two women who lived in the house were not very attractive
and the prince was not much interested in them
but in turn in time he discovered that Cinderella was really quite charming and delightful
and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit longer
but then came the stroke of midnight
and she got back her she got back to her room and had a wonderful time
the prince there would still had not found the perfect woman that he adored
so several people started looking around to see them and to decide which one was really Cinder was like n which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted
one after another several of these terrible creatures proved that she could not she could not fill fit the she couldnt fit the portions the could not fit the
lemme try it again
all of the other women in the castle were not were too big and could not be could not be could not get the size of the shoe that they were trying to find
but the shoe fit Cinderella perfectly
at that point the prince then was brought to the castle
and they were married immediately and lived happily ever after
why is that so hard
sortof
yeah
mhm
ah
oh okay
lets see if I can do that
I think mostly what happened was that I was sitting around in a perfectly nice day
and allofasudden everything seems screwed up
so I called the I called the ambulance
and then I and then I got I picked up all of the stuff that I wanted to keep together Im because I assumed that I was gonna be in the ambulance in the hospital
so I got all that stuff
and I lets see
I took my
what do you call that thing
I hid the
whats this thing called
its
it was my
oh
almost said it
""
anyway I hid the I hid something that was really valuable
I hid it
and I got rid of I got I had a bunch of emails
and I had all these emails saying that I was gonna hafta go to the hospital
and thats the last thing I ever remembered
and until I never saw another thing in CooleyDickinson at all
allofasudden I came to in l in
is that the name of it
Dalton yeah
and thats when I sortof began to figure things out a little bit
took awhile
uhoh
yes
uhhuh
okay
the little girl was really perturbed because the kitty cat wasnt me coming
so it just sat there
and dad was trying really hard to catch the cat but was unable to do it
meanwhile dad or dad was unable also to get the ladder
and the little doggy was miserable because he wanted to get he wanted to be part of this excitement
meanwhile as a bird was twittering here came the firemen who saved the little girl and eventually the kitty cat aswell
badumco
oy
Ill try
Ill try
www
well Cinderella was apparently adapted
and so they hadta to work all the time and hadta to deal with the hideous sisters while they were just having to get to be her work person
so at that point then there was a moment where the prince wanted to meet all of the eligible women in the town
and as Cinderella was thinking
but they said
only the only these the terrible creatures that were living in the house are the only ones that could really do this
then there came a
what do you call those creatures
its a magic personage
a
what do they call those e creatures
anyway this magic personage wanted to change all of the all of the things that Cinderella wanted to read to
she wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened
and it was the this magical creature that made that all possible
then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw the prince
and the prince s
whereas the horrible creatures that lived in the house no had no real particular interest in the prince
sooner or later then the prince was doing quite well
and but it was time for Cinderella to leave because she hadta do that
and eventually then this the wonderful time that they had disappeared
nevertheless the everybody wanted to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for
and yet that was not to be the case
then only and then only did Cinderella take all of her fancy clothes once again and sure enough was exactly the person that they were hoping for
then the prince went clomping back to the whatever they are to all these to all of the workers that they hafta deal with
and sure enough the prince did see her
and they decided to live happily ever after
beautiful
yeah

Cinderella had a ugly pt stepmother with two girls
and theyve been invited to go to a party
and the girls were going but the Cinderella couldnt go because she didnt have anything to wear
so the
god I cant think of her name
she had Cinderella they made she made Cinderella some clothes to wear
and the pumpkin and the horses and the
ohmygod I cant think of her name
well anyways said that she had hadta be home by twelve oclock
and well and at the dance the girls were mad and the ugly mother were mad
and somebody tripped
oh no
she hadta get home
and then they knocked
and the little mice got the key
and now the king is trying to find some the person who
oh and she lost her shoe running away ke to get back home
and she and whoever he is looked at each shoe and found that the shoe belongs to Cinderella
and the prince found her or they married and whatever
did I
yeah
I need you needta have two pieces of
well you can have crackers or whatever
but two pieces of bread
and I dont like white so it would hafta be another
probably oat
and I and Id have some people might put just butter but thats not very good
put peanut butter in one on slice and jelly on the other
and put them together
and then cut them and
I really enjoyed doing
Imean it was tiring but it was I enjoy it
I youknow I always like whats going on
and I dont find alotof fault on anything
but I thought it was good
yes
well number one is that I doing the right sentences or youknow smaller sentences and not getting in frustrated and whatever
that thats been a help for me I think
and I hafta stop
so I think thats that was helpful for me
well lemme see
I dont know what that
oh thats a ball
okay
so this is the whole beginning Imean a whole sequence
so its not like I hadta mix it up
this young boy was playing ball and kicked the ball then kicked the ball into the window picture window
and it broke the window
and the ball went right into the fellows lap
and he this man has the ball probably to throw back or to yell at this boy
so this is xxx
okay
and you want the beginning and the middle and the end
the beginning is for the h the mother is giving this little boy the umbrella
and he didnt want it
and allofasudden the
and he had told his mother that he didnt wanna do it
and it started to rain
and now hes getting really wet
and he got very wet
and the mothers annoyed
and he did get the umbrella
he hadta leave go and get his umbrella to go back in the out outdoors
yeah
this is a little the cat little girl
little girls w cat climbed into the tree
and the fire truck or fire department hadta rescue
well the dog barked
yeah lets see here
the ladder
the man tried to climb into the
so this is one of the reasons that
the dog was barking at the man who lost the ladder
because the dog was barking at him
I guess thats probably why
and then the little boy
thats not as nice as I shouldve said
yeah
yes
yup
www
the lady the prince the king ordered having ordered not d yeah to have a big dance
and the ugly children women were really not very nice to Cinderella
and the animals helped Cinderella Cindere helped Cinderella with her dress

Cinderellas fairy godmother ordered the pumpkins the horses to go to the dance
Cinderella and was swimming

not felt
the store

the shoe didnt it should fit Cinderella
and the prince and the and Cinderella lived happily after that
youve gotta have two slices of bread
on one side you can and you well probably have butter
and then you might have peanut butter on one side
and on the other side of the
theres two slices
and the r second slice has jam
and youre gonna put those pieces together
and youre going to cut them
for one side one piece for me and then the second piece for you

and I made mistakes
and Michael would and especially when FirstnameM was there and he was helping
xxx youknow they gotta do it this way and
so from starting to finishing and then with all the words that I hadta youknow to do I enjoyed that

I
okay
I got I felt frustrated
sometimes angry
did I r learn things
you sure heck bet I did
I
on top of it my leg hurts
I learned myself and I learned from FirstnameS
I there were just different things that we learned
like I said I was angry and frustrated
did I h learn something
yes I did
do I know that I needta learn more after just seeing how FirstnameS and I worked against each other or around each other
yeah
and I learned that I hafta learn more
but yeah it was interesting
and like I said I dont deny how hard it was because it just
you think it youknow you think its gonna be not easy but I figure I know so much
and then I find out guess what
its not so much
its very frustrating
but what else can I youknow
its the realization that how badly I am behind
how
the young man was out in the backyard playing kickball
and he nod knocked the ball through the c through the picture window
he then he brodu
knocked all the knocked the a an glamp
lock
and he just
and he then came back
and he saw what the young what the young man had done
and that thats what I got
okay
I see a boy
the mother is handing the boy a xxx

when hes partially walking down the street it starts to pour
he gets home

the dog was coming up the tray
they finally hadta go get the animals s
animals s
they
okay

no
anyways the they brought
yeah
ohgod do I hate Cinderella
yeah
my story huh
god almighty
www
alright
a woman with her two girls married a prince and he who had a daughter the same age
then the father died and left the mother in control of the whole family in which case what she did was she took care of her two girls and she did not take care of her stepdaughter
she treated her badly
she made her do the dishes and the cleaning
she had the worst clothes
she was just treating treated badly
then they got a notice that there they were invited to the to a masked ball
and she the young the other girl assumed that she would be going also
so they got ready for the ball
they and the mother trru
and she told
at that point Cinderella just went crying into the house
then she talked the girl talked to her friends who were mice
I love that one
she had three mice who were friends and helped her went and talked to
I dont know who shes they talked to but they ended up talking to the seeing the who the
I cant think of who it is
I know shes a nice little orangy
the woman okay the girl had help from the fairy godmother
and she they took the animals and they created the horses
the I
the horses all of the animals became
I forget if they were cared what they became but they all convert converted into
and the
and she was beautifully dressed
and they had a wonderful time
and then the clock struck twru
so she ran sothat they couldnt find her
then they went from house to house looking for the field s
the first two girls could not fit into the shoe
but Cinderella did
and so she became the wife or she marries the prince
and they live happily ever after
yeah
you would take the bread
and split it or take it and take out two packet pieces of bread
and then you would cover s you would take
the first half would be of would be peanut butter
you would fold a half one
you would put one ounce or one probably a case
but anyways they you would put a y tablespoon of a peanut butter on one side
then you would take a another half of jelly and put pat that down into the l into
youd peanut butter then the jelly
then you ttu
yes
in one sense I found it difficult trying to remember the words
I knew them
I knew
but I couldnt mem at first I could not remember
I couldnt memorize them
I couldnt pull
as we went on they didnt
I wanna say they came easy
they didnt come easy
but they the more I did it the more the words came
I was thinking about going over the words in my head
and I found that I still retained almost seven eighty percent of what I had learned
I hadta keep going back
I the words I knew I hadta keep going back sometimes
but did I feel it was helpful
yes because I didnt realize how much I had learned Imean I or lost
same thing
I think that
and I dont I know why youknow you have a time period to go over it and learn it
I was because of moving and everything else I lost alotof time and repetition in it
but I still kept alotof like I said I still kept alot of the words
Im worried about losing more of the words because I dont have a booklet
youknow I cant go back over them and over them and over them because theres nothing there in front of me
so that makes me nervous
but is the o program good
yes
especially for twits like me who didnt have the time or energy the move anything
you need to keep repeating it and repeating sothat you and then go on
I dont say I objected to it but I felt like if you give one through the for sixty words or eighty words
you go through those
I thought you should go through those say for three months
and keep on those
and add ten more words
because I felt the repetition of two sets of words
I dont know why but
you go through the words
ke in the end in the last even the last thirty days
if you get through them and you feel like
and while its not true obviously because you missed words for some reason I felt like the more that you did that the more youd catch on
I dont know if its true or not but
sure
okay
oh okay
there is a young girl
what do you call it
never mind
skip that xxx
but hes pawing at the tray
theres a fire two firemen coming
theyre carrying a ladder that will hopefully
and
and hopefully the theyll be able to the firemen will hopefully be able to use the ladder to get the gentleman down
and I guess thats it
I hate Cinderella
I know
Cinderella ndia Cinderelli
oh I certainly would
www
alright
Cinderellas mother died
and she and her father were living together
and her father decided to remarry
and so he married a woman who was a witch
and they had two she had two children
soon after the father died
and Cinderella became the household
theres a word for it but
someone who just
she was a servant
she waited on everybody
and the girl the two daughters treated her like a slob like a slave
and she just hadta pick up after them
then they got an invitation to a h a ball that was being held in honor of the prince
so Cinderella did all the work to clean it up to get it everybody everything ready
and she made her own gown
and when she went to join the two daughters and the mother to at the for the dance or for the ball they destroyed her dress
and they told her that she couldnt go
she went and was with in tears
and her friends which were like the cat and the horse and there were three or four animals
and they all tried to cheer her up
and she had been dreaming of going
and she now couldnt go
so then the fairy godmother appeared and told her that she could go
and she turned the horses into t footmen
she created the carriage
and she created r footmen
and the she created a ball gown for her to go
and so they went to the s
excuse me
they went to the ball
and the Cinderella got to dance with the prince
and she was attracted to him
and she wanted to marry him
but then her she went she ran because she was only allowed to go until midnight
so she when she realized she stayed late she went running home
she lost the glass slipper
it fell
and as she went running home she all of her clothes changed back
her the animals changed back into animals
and she was left the way she had started
the king ordered a search of the whole kingdom to find the girl that the prince was in love with
and they came to Cinderellas house
and each of the wicked each of the girl each of the each of the two stepsisters tried on the shoe
and it didnt fit them
then Cinderella went and tried on the shoe
and it fit her
so they said that she was the prince
and she and the prince married and lived happily ever after
mhm
I remember going into the s being admitted to the hospital
I felt wide awake
I was talking to the guys in the ambulance
then my sister met me
and after that I remember very little
I do me remember but I think its because they told me that they instead of they admitted me but did not do anything at all to work on my leg which is what they shouldve done immediately
they told me or they told my sister that they were gonna let me youknow rest for twenty youknow for twenty four hours and evaluate it which was the most asinine decision they ever made because by waiting and I dont know remember the medical terms but basically I was out
and my s they had sent my sister home
and she came back up the hospital the next morning
and she had a fit because she knew there was something wrong
and I guess that by then I didnt know but she had she called the doctors and had a screaming fit
and they ended me in to do to operate on me which was like twenty hours late
and by that time Id lost all use of my right leg
and I remember I sortof remember going in and out
I kept thinking
and like to me in my head I was yelling at the nurse saying
I didnt come out of it
youd hafta ask my sister but atleast three or four days
and I gather from my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious
and I woke up and was in a blitz blank out
I came outof the hospital like after six days I think seven days
and they immediately put in put me in
and it took me another ten twelve days
no thirty
it took me thirty forty two days between each between the two hospitals
and at the end of the two forty do
no
I wanna say Mount oh Saint MountStVincent
and they kept me there for lets see four five six weeks
and then they left me in there another twelve and a half months
so I spent thirteen fourteen weeks in there Imean fourteen months in there
and then they let me out
and the time in the hospital I
and I hope Im hoping y Im changing my mind now
but for the month for the twelve six months that I spent there Ive had alotof doubt as to whether I should have left it or not
because there I can go
I could study
I could take the van wherever I needed to go
when I wanted to study I studied
when I didnt wanna study I didnt
the last six months or so have just been massive disasters of being people who you dont wanna be around you if you wanna do things
and that s upsets me as much as knowing that for the first three four to five months I have no recognition of what happened
but now Im going through a period of anger
it just
thats quite a story Firstname
oh it gets better
I now hafta see all these
what do you call it
therapists and doctors and lawyers
and I didnt know until a month ago
theyve my sister and all these people have been talking about what happened to me
so now theres a lawsuit going and everything else
Im like
well theyve all been talking about it
they screwed up on the leg
so now Im in the middle of a lawsuit that I dont know anything about
theyve all talked
there were five people in there
who my relatives and fstu
and I smiled sweetly and listened to all this
and I have no idea whats going on yet
yeah
its been interesting
its but its getting over it I hope
I dont have a choice
thats for sure
I hope so
oh but that ones easy
well it may not be easy but I like it
so okay
okay
alright
a young girl was riding her bicycle
and she hadta stop because she saw a cat up in the tree
and she got down from her bicycle
and she was trying to get the cat down

and at that point none of the nobody was looking leaving

in the meantime the firemen came on their on the working riding on their ladder

and thats it
ohgod
I never remember the story but anyways
okay
www
yup
go for it
there was a man
he was
excuse me
there was a man who decided to marry a woman with two daughters
his wife had died
and he was he had a daughter of his own
and they got married
and it looked like it was going to be a good marriage
well it wasnt
he then died
and the woman and her two daughters treated the daughter Cinderella treated her like a slave or a whatever
she was made to clean the house to do all the work
the girls treated her badly
excuseme
she was not happy but she couldnt do anything about it
so in the meantime they received a notice from the prince and the king that he was holding a he was holding a e he was holding a ball for all of the for the whole v group for everyone sothat they could come and see if the prince could find someone to get married to
they were all spoiled and getting all dressed
and Cinderella didnt have the clothes to go too
so the mice who were her friends created a beautiful full length gown for her
and she went to get ready with the rest of them thinking that she would still be able to go
and the stepmother and the girls ripped the dress up and told her that she wasnt going that she didnt look proper
so she went in the back and just cried
and so the r
anyways the fairy godmother came out and told Cinderella that she could go to the i the ball
and she whipped up a clothes
ke one of the one of the mice turned into a horse
and one of the mice turned into a footman
and she created an outfit and told her that she could go but she hadta be left by noon by midnight
she hadta be out
so she went to the ball
and at the mall
and she fell in love with the prince
and they were having a wonderful time
and she realized she hadta be out of there by midnight
so she ran away
and as she was running away she dropped one of her flippers
and she made it back everything when she made it back everything came apart
there was no more there she was back in her old clothes
she was the mouses
so she just went back to her room and started cleaning and picking up after everybody
and she heard that there was a knock on the door because theyd been told that the prince or the prince they were going around to each family
the prince was going to have everybody try on the if l slipper to see if it would fit
so the two sisters tried it on tried them on
and they did not fit
l Cinderella came out and tried and they let her the
whoever he was
they let him try it on her too
and it fit
and she became the princess and married the prince
and they lived happily ever after
somewhere along that line
I think my speech is good
I do have problems getting rt certain ways around
hopefully I can talk
I everybody keeps say telling me I do pretty good and then stuff
but I do stru
and when I try to when I get excited or I try to talk too fast something I get all I get myself all balled s
and I just I get
I might aswell just go home
youknow
basically
the only thing I remember is I it was I went to school
and I started I ar I think I got I get there usually around six thirty in the morning
I get in there and I start setting up some stuff
at around six thirty around six oclock I leave there and I go to Conka
thats is exercises
and I go there in for thirty five minutes forty minutes and I exercise
then when I went home that day I went down
and it was around seven probably about ten after seven
I called my wife because she was on her way to school in this almost in the same area where ke shes at the school her school the ul UP

and then she comes calls me
and I called her

phew
its been alot better than it was yeah
ten years youknow ten years right
I had encephalitis ten years before
and I hadta remember everything
so its in my head
but its how when you get it outof there so
I had ke encephalitis for it was about a month
I dont even remember anything about it
but I was in the but when I remember they got me to start up another time
hadta remember how to remember how Ill talking about abck one two three noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff
just remember how do you rewrite everything
just taking your time
but its still in there
and you cant just get it on there
you might talk acouple times about it
then youre talking about the decks
and then you forgot about that one
so its always kindof like that
but you can still do it
so Im still writing and preposition and all that kind of stuff
just sort of thing you can do
just keep make sure its still doing than better than it was
yeah oh its unbelievable yeah
mostly hadta remember how to
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get
its funny how my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that
I could go in the kitchen first
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that
the name
I dont remember anything about it with my head
I could sit there and making breakfast and stuff like that
and shed say
shed put toast and Id say
but eggs
but it takes time to get everything outof your head outta there so
alotof its there
but most of its just you cant get it outof my head on there
its hard to come back around everything like that
and also its also because when you talk to me doesnt get the same way coming back to me
and its also kindof weird because if you talk to one person and me it kindof kills me
but if you have another person here I can understand alot better with that
but its depends on how its coming on to me yeah
like I said I hadta remember doing abck one two three everything like that
they took me at oh to books for the first year
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that
just trying to get back where it was
I just write trying to just getting everything on there
so its like that
its just hard
you start getting little things starting through there
but then I went to
I dont know if you go to Chicago
theres five weeks
there we got back how to do different things around there
how youre kindof think youre on this place I think then maybe a different one
its like you had different places you get around there helped around
but so it does get outof there more than you can
Imean the first time youre just going straight
and its hard to get anything outof there
but I dont know
is that did I tell you anything
when I was little first time
well it also can be that too for like I said for ten years its kindof I really hadta remember start everything
so I did get a remember
I did start up another time
so it did help
Imean my mom helped me
and different places theyve they help everything about it
but it is nice to get back up where you can go
the bottom
Imean it wasnt a real big deal because I couldnt go down
I hadta go up
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were
so its been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that
it helps alot better
okay
the boy was t outside with a soccer ball
and he was kicking around
and he kicked one really good
but it hit right in the middle of the window on the house there
so the next one over there her
gotta might have been sleeping and jumped out
and the lamp broke down there too
but you really cant tell on number four
it looks like he is not very happy
because he got his soccer ball
but hes still looking out there
and I think the boy musta ran away
he ran away
so because hes still looking to see what hes doing
okay
looks like mom told
and he said wellco he doesnt really want that
so hes moving onto the next
he says no big deal with the he doesnt the umbrella
so he got outside
and it rained
that was on number three
hes over there raining on him
number four
and its really raining him
hes gotten water all over the place
number five
he finally came back
and he didnt look that very good
and she didnt she told him its not very good and probably smarter that he didnt take it
so next time hes gonna take the umbrella when it rains
www
it looks like her dad
well mostly the girl whos looking to find her cat up on top on the tree
she wanted to get it there
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder
but it fell down
so hes stuck up there the whole time
the dogs kinda barking at him xxx
really helping there
but the firemen are coming over there
theyve got another ladder
theyre gonna help him back up
but I dont understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat
and the cat gets by itself anyway
its just kindof
yeah I dont know
its probably about what it is I think
so Im ready huh
okay
what it was she has shes not actually with the people
but theres two
its not like theyre cousins or something like that
theres two girls
and were next by him and their mom
theyre really bad ones and stuff like that or not very hasu
ofcourse shes not very good to her
then she always hadta work outside and do all the hard things
and they dune
theyve got enough money and doing whatever they could
so they gave a time that they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the money the
Im trying to say something
trying to say all the good people there
they had to go see them
and theres they got to play and music and stuff like that
so she would never get to go there
but I forget how
somehow she got in here
but she got to go
say exactly
it came that she had a very unbelievable great clothes and stuff like
they took her sothat one night where they got to see everyone
and actually it was the guy who came to see her
he was probably the best one there
he was very nice and very the best thing he could
and he really liked to see her
but when it was done that time he
so he
and so it was all done
but the next day someone actually brought those to him
because it was his
because the only ones that are big enough for him
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that
so it didnt work for them
so it came to him
they just told him
so it came on to him
it goes to that
Im not done yet
the guy hes the one guy that I saw
the two sing with him and play and stuff like that
thats where he was that night
so he came back to make sure it was her
so since its her hes taken with her
so its going to be with her for all this all the time and stuff like that as much as it could be for him
that tell you anything
okay
you should take a bread
get some butter outof the refrigerator with a knife
put some of those on the bread and also some of the
theyre not peanuts exactly
e closeby the peanuts
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread
so everything feels pretty good
except for your hand probably gets all over the place
but its a real easy one
you can do it for about two minutes
and thats a good one to eat if you need to get something to eat
got enough
pretty much
something probably something to xxx
I think you just youknow you just take the you took the butters
the peanuts
thats not the same thing
they sit in the its in the kitchen
put on a bread
and put it on a probably put it on a plate
go over sit down on the table
and have something to eat
I guess thats it
how it was
mostly when I started
I had a month I dont even remember anything about it
but it was like ten days
they finally got me in there to I finally started Imean I could actually talk or anything like that
but I had to remember how to remember everything
and were everything is gone back
I mean everything about abck all that kind of stuff like that
everybodys name
everybody the computer on there
the Coke sitting there
everything
the wrong about it
you have nothing about it
you hadta remember everything about it
so we went to
I had like thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first
and then we went to
after that thats when we started to talk and to get in the sort of thing
make sure Im forget something
its ten years before
but we did start ke abck one two three or something like that with my mom
started to its in books
I went there
there is someone we got a talk over there
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abck one two three and stuff like that
and it took a long time
it was about a year the start over that
and Ive gone down
it was Monday to Friday
now its down Monday Wednesday Friday
then after that theres a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks
just try to talk alittle better and that
because Imean at this time I could talk alittle better
but it just hard to get back everything outof there
so that helped different things about it for those six weeks
and youre trying with computer
or trying to try to write on there
trying to do something about it get alittle better there
and thats how they tried to
after that they started IU
and thats when they started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that
theres so much you couldnt remember anything about it
but its you just take your time trying to
me and my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things
so it doesnt keep everything in there the whole time
so you just gotta keep everything keep where youre getting things youre doing there and still be able to talk
mostly taking my time
so if I talk too much people have no idea what Im doing
and they talk to me real quick
this is kindof weird because if one person talk
if theres three people I can understand other people
I can understand more of this
but so it takes time getting around everything
so its just it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting alittle better
I dont know how long I can go
but its just it seems like Im still doing something with it
so and it keeps going over time
so I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that
and the and its my moms very helping
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too
they need to do something like that
but I have my brothers too
one of them Imean one I dont see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other
so it just its not it as it used to be
I knew alotof people and all that kind
now Im kindof move down ke acouple people I knew and just take my time
so its alot easy as how it was
I dunno
is that come around or
xxx about it was like I said I had to remember everything
Imean I wasnt really didnt get me out that bad because I said
so you hadta restart everything to get back on there
so you took your time and tried to get through it
and Imean if youre going to yell at it its not gonna do anything for it
so youre the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that
Id be outside and doing stuff like that or youknow
but it really doesnt bother me that much
Imean I just take my time during the day
ke Im gonna dry s
and I might go outside and working on the a branch or something like that
just keep going back and forth
ke Id go get my aunt
shes ninety seven
I get her on almost every times for a week
and maybe ke one day of the week and well see her
but I get her on the phone every day
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving
and its another way to get through to me and everybody else
Imean alotof them cant understand what Im doing
but alot I know they know everything about it
so its easy about it so
just anything youre telling me or
I thought it was kindof totally different when I restarted here
I hadta remember how to do everything
which was it was kindof its alittle weird for every everybody too
because Imean I knew right away my mom could ask me youknow what this was in the kitchen or something like that
yeah I knew how to make it
I can make my breakfast and all that stuff
she goes
no cant remember
like that
I knew everything
its all on my head like that
Imean made my breakfast and youknow ke the eggs bacon microwave and the whatever ke things like that
and always be there in the morning
always my breakfast first
people think Im weird
but its just something that
it is another way I tried to keep doing what Im doing
but it also is doing whatever I need to do
Imean I hadta do everything like that anyway
so it took some time on that
and its it was a long time to do
but you had just took your time and do whatever youre doing I think
its I dont know how to
youre not gonna too quick
and you hafta do sometimes
so you just kinda do whatever youre doing but then a little bit farther
number one the boy was sitting outside with a soccer ball
and he kicked a good one there
but it went over by the house over there went into the umbrella not the umbrella howabout the window
went into the through inside there it look
theres a guy sitting in number third
the soccer ball came in
knocked out the lamp
knocked him out too
he was probably sleeping I think and scared him out pretty bad
and then number four I gotta see what I can move around here
hes over looking through the window to see who it was
their probably ran away
but hes not very happy somebody threw the soccer ball into the window there
about it
mom told the boy that she
and she
on number two
number three he went out there and it rained
so hes walking
and its raining more
and hes getting his feet in there
but he got all the way back
and shes not very happy with him
moms very happy with him
and he knows
he had water all over the place
but next time he changed and took the umbrella with him
enough
okay
looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree
which they could do anytime I think
well I dont know
they cant get everything but theyre they do to know to enough
but the girl shed like to get her cat back
but so shes waiting there
and her dad decided he could go up there to help with that
when he took the
I know what it is
lak lddu
something close like that
but he took it up the top
and it fell down
so hes gonna have trouble anyway
the cats too far away
but hes stuck
he cant get down
the dogs kinda barking at him for no reason driving him nuts
but the firemen came in here
theyre gonna help for him
so theyre walking over this way
so theyre walking
and theyll get up here in a little bit
theyll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him
but the birds happy
theyre on the other place over there away from everyone else
so theyre singing something like that
but its pretty much about what it is unless theyre waiting on he gets down and the cat doesnt wanna come down
did I get enough
okay
looks like for some reason they gave it seems like another cousin with them
they gave her with her aunt
so Im not sure why hes they send that way
but anyway whoever gave it said thatd be nice
well give it to you and stuff like that
and theyll keep and theyll make it good for you too
but then the aunt
she made her pretty bad
she had to go work outside and everything else
and again shes certain s
but her cousins
they got to do whatever they wanted
and theyre kindof a pain in the butt
but so thats how it was for all the time
she tried to be nice
but they were still not very nice
but the one time they were gonna have they were
I guess they do for the sometime the year they get to see everybody
so they went to see if this would be see
their aunt
so theyre gonna go there to play or sing that night and stuff like that
but their cousin
but a what would you say itd be
not a ghost or some I dont know what
they had one they would bring on the way
thats not normal how the people and stuff like that
this was totally different
how they
but they
so she could go on that way
so she got to go in that place
then went to see there to that night
got up
she could go sing and play or was out there
got some people
and thats where they saw the big
its one of the
I think hes
I dont know if he is the king
or he might be just the new king coming there
he was out there
he was with her for a while
but then she hadta leave
and he is worried what happened her
but she left
and he was worried about that
but she did drop one of her shoes
so he had that
so they went back
she was going back her place where she was just n not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff
but her cousins
and they put them on there
and her feet are huge
so it wasnt gonna work on that
but then while theyre there they did he did bring them over to her
and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes
so he knew what it was
so he took her back
and thats one of the great or the best thing you could ever do
she went back
shes like a queen now
so best thing that came on that way
so enough
okay
you I would take two the bread
put it on top of plate
I got some butter
and I really cant say what it was
its in the
well I took one of those out
so you take the knife and just lot s
so you could flip both sides so comes in the middle there
Ill take the knife and go wipe it off put it in the dishes something like that
usually get something to drink
Coke mostly
but go sit down on
and just in your hands
and you got your got the sandwich
and should be pretty good
my speech
I think its alot better than what it was
and Im hoping that it gets better
actually Im hoping that it gets back to where it was
yes but to be honest with you I if what youre asking is I think that I didnt exactly understand what had all happened youknow
and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and alot of it
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were kindof funny or werent making sense
so I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would remember everything
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought
there I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset not upset sad
and then but then
anyway sorry
well most of the time Ive been pretty happy sorry because Im very fortunate that Im still here and have a second time to be alive and be with people that I care about
but its just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything
I was home when it happened
and I it just really hurt
for me it was on my left side
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down
but right away I could tell something wasnt right
and then I my wife realized more stuff that was going on
and she was able to ask me es quite a few questions
and after a few questions she could realize I wasnt making sense
so I guess thats the answer
sure alot
Im trying to think where to start
from the time that I was at the
I cant even think what its called
where was I at
after the stroke happened at first
yeah icu and then the
did it
where I was for awhile
yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me
yeah rehab thats the one
its hard for me to answer when I cant think how to say it
rehab
and they were helping me
and they were very kind
and my wife was wonderful
and they were just telling me things that gave me it gave me alotof hope that they realized I was pretty much I was alittle weak
but I was physically able to walk around and do alot
and that remember I told yesterday I could remember alotof like well how to play a guitar and kindof singing
although I guess you would know how this stuff means
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something
but that gave me alotof hope
and then I got back home
and Ive worked with a whole lot of things
Ill show you one of them
xxx
here it is
one of these things
so not every day but for alotof days I just go back
and I look at this
and I started going backwards just to try to read it
youknow dog and cat
so theres a whole bunch of these things that they had
and then some of those in the other room that I cant always get a hold of but I managed to get a hold of these
I usually I can usually get them
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something
and when I started playing
is it okay if I keep blabbing for a minute
this is actually I guess my wife can tell me I kinda blab
so I dont mean to be that way
but youknow I guess she realized soon
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing
and after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with older people
and then it made me think more about that after something I was going through
and I really wanted to just sing
I realized that I missed that
so we were talking about me doing that
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened
somehow one of them got missed
and so it was about a month I guess later
yeah July
one well Im forgot to say it
bottom line is one of them called not long before
ohmygosh youknow we didnt tell him s
and so I still said
so I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs
and I did it
and I was nervous
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to start doing it again
and I did a whole lot of shows again
and I think that really helped me because it started remembering and alotof that
so I guess thats the answer to alotof it
yeah and I was feeling so good
I musta done a hundred shows at least
she could tell you
there was a ton of them I did
and pretty much not having any problems
but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing
and I was singing all not making sense
and that just destroyed me
Imean I just that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I was back
and then that happened and the next thing I knew were going to the hospital
and I just couldnt believe it
I just said
and that was probably the worst
but then came back around again
so I was doing better again
and then allofasudden Covid came in
so since its been so many weird things in my life becauseof just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything
and then thats come along
and its just every were all going through that
kindof figure out whats all gonna happen
and how are people and etcetera and
so yeah its been really crazy
ohmygosh so many
I dont know where to start with that
I can only tell just the one huh
well I would talk about my wife and I getting married
I guess thats pretty obvious that I would say that
gosh Imean Im trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more
I got I forgot a little what you asked me
but this might be part of it too
we got to go to where we useta go every year
up to up north from us which is up by Wisconsin
FirstnameT my wife
youknow I wasnt able to actually I used to always be the one that kindof was the ke main ke driver
and so ofcourse she youknow I knew that I couldnt we werent going to do that especially with our kids with me driving
so she did
but going there again was a really wonderful time
it really reminded me of alot of places
because we usually would go in the same places
and so that sortof is a long thinking about
I just felt kindof
we married there
so I guess I dont know
I dont think Im really answering what you asked me
just like happy times of just one happy time
yes I would love to
well first of all were just friends
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church
and I was really interested in her
but I took a long time
and finally I mentioned about if we could go out
and she said yes which is wonderful
we went out
one of the happiest
the that first date was just amazing
I felt like I was this younger person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of
and we just went out to see a movie
and then we just talked for a long time
and I told her good night and drove home
and that was incredible
and so we started going out
and when we got married it was such a happy time
I remember I went it didnt right away go
before we got married that last night for
but I did
and I woke up
and I was really happy
and I was looking fairly forward to it
felt alotof peace
and so we had a pretty special wedding that we had done
and the way we did it was that youknow I didnt get to see her how she was looking when she walked out
and I was standing way back
and I saw her coming
sorry
its nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda
but I cried because she was coming orry with her dad
and that was amazing
and we had a fantastic wedding there
and anyway the whole time it was happy
I dont know why I cried sorry
I think I might have thought of becauseof FirstnameTs ke mom who had passed away a year and a half ago
so I think that kinda got me
but everything else was really happy
ohboy
well in this case its a guy a young boy
and hes got a
oh what do you call those things
things that you
see now I get stuck on
I owe
totally I cant think what thats called
bouncing go
ohno
I Ill get that
do I have much time because I can think of that
is there a timing on it
okay I hope thats okay and thats doesnt drive you crazy
youre like
Ive got this
its oh what do you call that
mom the moms go with
oh Im stuck on something really obvious
but anyway hes gonna hes taking it and using his foot
and as he does hits it alittle too hard into the I guess the right
and its going right toward a persons house
and oops looks like in number three you can see that it actually broke there
and theres this persons probably somebodys dad just sitting there
it looks like he mighta been reading or something
Im not sure about that
ke ohmygosh got alittle startled
now hes looking down at the fourth one
and he can look back there and see what happened
and then probably can see behind who that probably was I would assume back there
so thats my answer to that question
okay
on the first one xxx on the first one there is a person
this is a xxx I guess
and yes which is like sorry which is like mother
and it looks like to me like she is telling him that he should take a
its going to be the hard when we hadta think what thats called
to not get wet
like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain
stuck on what thats called
but I know what it is
and so she it looks like hes going like
and the though the second one it looks like hes oh like shes
oh I see what happened
shes looking a little bit upset like
and then the third one hes now outside
and boyco guess what happened
now its hes getting soaked
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house
yes and she does look a little bit upset
and hes looking kindof like
and hes soaked
and now she has the other thing I cant think of what its called around him to keep not getting wet
thats pretty much what I have
okay so first Im going to look at what I see
and then theres alot going on there in there
okay
there is a
okay
I see its a tree
there is a man standing outside or up high with the tree
theres a dog
cant help it
I always notice ke dogs and cats
theres a dog at the bottom under there looking up
kindof looks like its barking
probably saying something like
and theres a cat just sortof hanging out
oh I see
and then are both under the cator at the bottom of the cat or whatever is a young girl whos probably trying to help with the cat
interesting enough there is a
what is that called
ohno
I can point to it
but I cant say it
there is a thing that which the young girl could take with the man
and he could walk down there
cant think of what its called
okay
on the right see is a
crud I forgot what thats called
Ill skip that one
at the bottom there we do see there is a acouple guys a person people who are gonna probably help him
the which forgot what thats called too
like a
I cant say it
with a
I got it
with a fire person whos gonna come and probably help him up there
thats what Ive got
okay
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella
but Cinderella starts with she was had a wonderful mom and also dad father and mother
and they were loving and kind
and she was too
and something happened which alot lot of
and that was her sorry her ke mother
so her dad her father met this other woman and decided to hed like to have him and her get married
and as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go
but he did
and that person had a couple like sorry acouple ke daughters that she owned
and its showing that theyre all very mean not only to Cinderella but even to themself
they just theyre just very all they think about is themself
and the mother is just interested in trying to make alotof money when she gets married
so they realize that Cinderella is just is a very beautiful person
Imean shes very pretty and beautiful
but shes inside shes just a really sweet person who cares about people
so the oh I think its called stepmother
I think thats what its called
realizes they need to she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters
and so Cinderellas life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that shes m
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy at least for the most part and just doing alotof lovely things in taking care of them
and so around that time the prince
let me see
his dad
I cant think of what thats called
wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all
who would be just a lovely ke a girl
and so they have this ke ball
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that youknow
but they showed that the other two stepmothers
and that their mom
and theyre excited that they can maybe be the one thats chosen
woo this is hard
but the mom realizes
so Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful
so they made is made her beautiful thing
but then the stepmother got where she couldnt go
and so then Cinderella was really crying
as I remember thats the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken
and youknow how could they not even let me do anything
and then theres fairy godmother person pops outof nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what shes going to wear and where she can be driven
she gets there
and she can dance
and he sees her and wants to dance with her
and hes captivated by her
and allofasudden Cinderella realizes ohno its by this midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back
so Cinderella gets home
and shes still kinda happy
which is I thought that was always amazing
she was still she just happy and so honest about
and she thinks thats the end that would ever be
but she was still happy
and so then with the prince he is like
which I wouldnt really blame him
ofcourse hes gonna wanna meet her
and goes he wants to he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her
so he hasta go has a decree I guess that popped in decree to every single unmarried person
hasta be figure out who that was because
oh yeah I forgot when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things
I cant think what its called
behind your foot thing
so they know that if they can go to each person theyll find out who that was who that fits
so they go
and at the end Cinderella its obvious that shes the correct one
so they get married
and then shes happily ever after
thats it
my brain is like
okay
take my peanut butter
hafta open it
take it out
probably get wanna get ke not just ke one but get two
lay them down
grab something to go under thing
I cant think how to call it
under the jelly
and go in there
and take one and put it around the peanut butter
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three or four
and thats how I would say
I dont know what to call that sorry
well for the most part or I guess Id hafta say most of the time I think its doing alot better than it had done
and were talking ofcourse after my stroke right
hopefully I wouldnt have
yeah so I think I Im doing better
have a way I hafta ke go
but I think Im doing better
Ive been trying really hard to think
and I dont mean to keep blabbing
Im sorry but
Im just talking
earlier I think it was yeah this morning I was telling somebody here my wife or my kids or something about how sometimes I feel like a person thats just not born but whatever
what I mean is theres things Ive just forgotten all about
we got to eat a couple of things and I just forgot
oh I forgot what that even is
and so in a way thats kindof exciting
but then you feel like
so but yeah but overall better hopefully
Im hoping
yes
absolutely
no I probably feel like I blabbed too much about that last time
so it
I had come home
and it wasnt very late in the day
I think it was maybe twelve or one oclock I think
and I had decided to look outside to see if we got any yeah any ke Im sorry any ke any Im sorry any mail
and I walked back in the house and said hi and gave them the mail I think
and anyway I just started feeling really weird
and I cant even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it
but I decided I wanted to just to sit down with our with my ke bedroom
and I did
and right away it just started getting worse
and it really hurt
and for me it was youknow my left side I guess
but it was probably other ones
but I think I felt more here
and something I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really very different and strange
and something was kindof scary
and she started talking with me
and realized she asked me a few questions
and she could tell after several things shed asked me that I wasnt making enough sense
and then I started feeling almost sick
and she got me a thing in case I did
and I did getting sick
and she right away knew to get me to a hospital
and I think that well my wife and my kids knew they probably figured some things out because with my wifes mom had passed away about six months or something I guess it was before that
I think thats about right
and I think last thing Im saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit
and so I was thinking about that and praying about that
and thats the last thing I can tell you
we were going to the hospital
and I was trying she was asking me alotof questions as she was driving
and I was doing the best I could
but I couldnt really explain very well
so it was a pretty whew wow pretty intense thing that happened
that is a fantastic question
and if you asked my that before Im not even thinking of that
so Im just saying thats a really excellent question
well my wife and my kids came from church
friends had been all so wonderful
and especially as a wife and kids they asked me alotof questions
and part of the whole thing I dont know how to say it is theyve had to figure out what Im trying to say
and theyve been very patient about this when I get stuck on something
and every now and then I get a little bit upset
but not upset like crazy scary something
I just get frustrated because I know what Im trying to say but I cant think how to say it
but anyway so theyve also with them I should have said my sister
my sister is always one of my best friends
shes a couple years younger than me
and her husband too
theyve all gotten back
and they showed me alotof photos and remembrances youknow
things that I remember
and snu
I dont have it here
but ke theyd gaven
ke if it says ke dogq a picture of a dog
they give me tons of those
but my wifes is the main one
shes helped me out so much
and like I say theyve had to guess what Im trying to say
or ke Ill say
and then theyre all trying to
and then finally someone will figure
Ill say
that thats it
youknow but its getting to the point where hopefully as Im getting better I hope theyll sometimes say
youknow so thats been alotof it
and then I think also with me playing music my wifes realized that so much of that seems to have come back which is amazing because for a long time I didnt do music for a long time in my life
I started again awhile back
but stuffs back there from when I was a kid
its just back youknow
oh and one more thing
we really love certain tv shows and sometimes movies
and alotof those have helped me too
theres certain ones that we just really like
that I dont know it just helps me youknow with anyway
so that helps at all
so it was gonna get something else but I cant think what to say
sorry Im stuck on what the name of the show is
I guess that thats probably not very important sorry
we I liked I watch alotof older shows
and some of those are just great
theyre just great
anyway so thats what Ive got
cool yeah there are just certain ones
and some of the especially Im not trying to say anything whatever bad about newer shows because theres certainly some good new ones Im sure
but some of those older ones are just so great
sometimes theyre so well thought out or just so funny
the and so even when I was a kid there were certain shows that everybody remembered
youknow its just Ill say something thats kindof probably silly
but theyre showing with tv now the guy with the Fonzi going heyq
youknow its just one little thats not a very deep thing
but something like that back then that was everybody knew who that was
anyway its the best Ive got
sorry that Im taking a second
Im trying to decide which one I had mentioned
my wife and thats a very vital one
I thought Id try to think of something else too
and every one Im thinking of isnt much to say in there
so and theres alot I just think of it
I thought of one that would be very hard for me explain that
I just I wouldnt be able to get all in my head
well okay
with my wife again when we got married when we were married
I mentioned that
but I dont think I mentioned this
after wed been married for a couple days we went up north up to Wisconsin and no yeah
and no yeah and then we went
sorry Wisconsin
s what I meant to say was actually next to that which is like which sorry which is Michigan
and we went up to Michigan to stay
ohbrother it
how could I not think of that
I could draw a picture of it
I could drive where to get there
I cant think what its called
oh Mackinaw
and we stayed at Mackinaw
and that was fantastic
we had a few days
and we stayed at a beautiful place
and it was just so peaceful and just beautiful
and at that place I had mentioned which took me while to get out as kku
well up in Mackinaw they cant have any vehicles and cars
so you just hear this little clip of sorry of a horse horses going
and we just were out there
we had a suite I guess youd call it our third floor
and we could open it up and look down there and just see these horses
and it was just so peaceful and so beautiful
and that was a wonderful time
just being married and having a life together with each other
and looking back at that and seeing theres alotof other all around that whole place
but I remember that particular part of it
and theres another one thats close to it
I guess it was
I forgot if its before or after
right around there we went to a place called the Sleeping Bear Dune that this guy that I knew years ago had just told me
and so we went there not even knowing how to get there because back then we didnt have ke our interuhnet
we had to just figure out how to get there
but we found this place
well you go up real high
and then when you finish you can just run down
that was one of the neatest things
when I went up all the way high and we could look down there it was just beyond beautiful just unbelievable
and so when I think about that too I just get just get happy
so thats my little stories
www
on number on one theres a guy a boy whatever
and hes got a soccer
and hes hitting the soccer
and on the second one looks like he is
oh I see it now
hes hit it
and you can see actually where its actually where they have it showing where exactly went
and he hit by mistake Im sure but hit one of the
oh lets see here
let me think what its called
one of the houses
and it got crashed
and on number three
ohboy theres the man that probably owns the house there who was sitting down probably just trying to just relax and allofasudden probably got ohmygosh what was that scared but realized what happened
then that just crashed and broke
and so again I missed you on that but I think
because I cant see him
but it looks like hes probably angry
but hes ke holding it
and he can see what made it get broken
and I think thats end of the story I think
how much time
do you hafta make me start right away or
okay
Ive got it okay
I got stuck on that one thing
okay
there is a thing called a god crud called an called wait a minute called an umbrella
and there is a looks like a boy whos younger and his mom who looks like she is telling him
Im sorry
yeah I said it again
so he just kindof is
I dont need that or I dont want it or something
and she looks like shes alittle concerned
and that was on number two
on number three looks like hes now outside
and its starting to rain
and he now realizes he needs to
and can now Im on four
he turned around to the left to run back
and hes realizing he really made a goofy mistake and shouldve listen to his mom
yes and number five hes ke back to see her
he must be in the house because now I dont see all the rain coming
but hes ke soaked
and she looks understandably kindof upset
dont want to say angry but kindof upset
and so now hes going
this is number v six
hes going back outside
and he now has what he should have had for the dang it for the dang it for the umbrella
and oh as hes going now hes not getting soaked because he is wearing having an umbrella
thats it
this is hard because I hafta
okay I understand whats going on
I gotta think of all the different what theyre all called
well okay Im just gonna put it the way I would say it
I dont know
there is a dad
and s oh I see what happened
it looks like he might have tried to
could be two possibilities
okay he has a very tall ke tree
and hes up there
and hes ke stuck
it looks like the
what is that called
web
what is that thing called
I guess thats what makes it what I have whats happened to me
I cant think how to call a certain thing
a thing that he normally could have stuck in front of
oh I just touched something sorry
touch something thankyou sorry
and that looks like that had ke fallen down
looks like he was going up there to get a to try to help to get yeah to get a cat
and looks like his I guess daughter is looking up at the cat
probably shes
ke shes concerned about the kitty
theres a little
its hard to explain isnt it
theres a little thing that she could have been maybe
what do you call those things
as a kid you can get there
and you can drive
it could have even have fallen down the fallen down what he needs to not be stuck
Im not sure
anyway on the other side behind him thats a dog
dogs up there woofing woof probably wants I dont know saying
I dont know
and then on the last part here there are two responders rs people coming trying to help
and there is a
something else I forgot what its called
oh what is that called
we see that where they would use to have gotten around there
I cant think what its called
and the last thing on the very top of that is a bird
thats the best I can do right now
the story of Cinderella
I guess it starts off
as at least the way I remember
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very good people
and they treated her as they should very kind and with alotof love
and that would ofcourse have been great except her ke mother died
and I guess alot of those ke Disney shows do that sometimes
and so the dad was a good man
but like alotof people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else
and so that ends up happening
and really messed up by marrying this other woman
who ends up shes just so cruel and so selfish
and oh okay what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life
and so what I mean now is that the
what is it called
the other woman she now has the power I guess where shes really being awful with Cinderella
and I guess maybe even the her dad mightve died
I dont remember about that
anyway so theyre showing they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed
she went through a really nice life which was deserving to her because she was a very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldnt hurt anyone
so now that the other mother is now there the other mother makes Cinderella do everything
all the washing and everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do
and these those two sisters the k s the other
what are those called
those two other girls are just so mean to her and so just very ke very snotty horrible
dont even care about Cinderella at all
only that they can get whatever they want
they make her do everything
but even so she still seems to still have an amazing way to be lovely and sweet and caring
and so I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place
I cant think what its called
beautiful place
so sorry somebodys walking back here and Im getting this for
okay so okay I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman
I guess
so oh this is hard
so the ke
hows that Im in track where they are
so the so its made by decree that they should have they should have this ke yeah okay this ke ball
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta hasta come there
and then theyll be able to c to figure out whos the best one that he should marry
so then they showed in the picture if I remember right his
and shes excited because she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will be that they will want one of them
so theyre all excited including Cinderella was excited
but loandbehold I think it showed that the other mother says
seems to me ke I remember ke the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear I think
anyway so Cinderella part of her part of how shes just so lovely and kind even the little a little ke sorry ke nblu
so they even do what help to try to make her what she can wear
and I think Im what happened with that
anyway yeah then it gets messed up
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think thats where it shows Cinderella really for the first time really crying
really just destroyed because its like
Im being its like they think shes just nothing
and she doesnt deserve any of that
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother pops outof nowhere
and she makes a beautiful outfit
and then she
ohboy the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where
yeah with its ke a pumpkin
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in
and the animals are made to look like theyre people
and just the fairy godmother has told her
so I think it showed Cinderella arrives
and they can see that the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like
and then the
why this is really hard to explain this
then the guy
I cant think what hes even called now
oh how embarrassing
I cant think of the name of the guy
the young man whos gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her
and he is very interested in her ofcourse
and he seemed like a nice man like a good man
and she ofcourse is a absolutely very wonderful and very good girl
and they get to dance
and its just almost magical
theyre just obvious those two are meant to be ke in love
so then Cinderella leaves or sees
so she has to suddenly run
hes thinking
and as shes running down her slipper a grass
and she hasta keep running
so then I think the pictures show that shes back home
and shes just happy that she got to do something
and then they find out that
boyco my brain
that there was a grass
or theyre gonna find who was that woman who we actually would ofcourse have been n Cinderella
and so they go to every unmarried young woman
and none of them it doesnt fit right with any of them with the slipper grass
I cant talk right
with the slipper
and it does for Cinderella
and so she becomes married
and I think I missed one thing in there
seems like the mom ends up breaking that or something first
I dont remember that
but anyway they find the other one like I say
and that fits
thats the only one that fits right
and its obviously shes the one
and then it shows that they get married
and theyre happily ever after
I think thats it
yeah youd open up each of the each of the ke sorry each of the ke jellies
excuseme let me start over again
peanut butters
oh wait a minute
Im saying that backwards

first I have to get out

sometimes my speech is good
sometimes it is not so good
vocabulary I miss some words
sometimes I cant think the word
sometimes I think I dont enunciate real clearly
other times its better
sometimes is good
smztmu
oh lets see
yeah sometimes I say things backwards
does it is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching
I said some things backwards
so if Ill say
I think those are the main issues I have
no I dont remember anything for about six weeks
the first memories that I had after my stroke are were very cloudy
and they were not accurate they were not accurate
for example I remember being in a wheelchair
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the werteru
and I was strapped in because I couldnt sit up on my own
those for about two months I really didnt I couldnt remember I remembered almost nothing
and some of the things I had were very much incorrect
I found out later things I thought
and then when I first started remembering things I was oz was at that point I was moved to a rlbltenu
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct somewhat accurate
and that was probably month and a half or two months in
then I started remembering things but it was slow coming back very slow coming back
one thing that I didnt know was that as I was as it was coming and waking up I guess I was getting around to being able to talk
I thought I was talking
but I found out later that I wasnt that I couldnt talk clearly
I couldnt say anything
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling
and so I dont remember when I started talking because in my mind I was always talking just fine
and I felt like feel like you feel like maybe I was a baby tried to talk
and I thought everybody should understand me
but apparently infact nobody did
and that happened for a long that
well in my mind Ive always been able to talk right
now maybe in the last year or so Im much more aware of the fact that I dont talk plainly
that thats kindof the story of my memories that I have
well it was
still is
well I was I spent six months in first of all in some oh I guess critical care places
and then went to after about two months I went into the long term
well I went to a couple of rehab hospitals for awhile for two or three weeks each
and then I started remembering
and I started doing some therapy of that sort at that time
I couldnt do much of anything
I thought I could do more than I really could
but I really couldnt do much
I after six months I got home
and I did some I had somebody come on outpatient basis and work with me for about six weeks
a physical therapist was a speech therapist and occupational therapist
at that point I really wasnt doing much by myself because I really didnt know what to do
probably after about oh maybe after about a year I started kindof figuring out on my own stuff I needed to do
I started youknow I did have somebody that I worked with
he was kindof a cognitive specialist is about west
he worked with me for about three years
and I really felt like he did quite a bit of good to in terms of my cognition
and I worked on
I dont know if youve heard of BrainHQ
have are you familiar with that program
okay
so Ive worked I worked with the BrainHQ program alot for four years maybe five years now whatever
ofcourse Ive done Ive worked Ive when I finished when I finished the time that I had for physical therapy
youknow theres a limit on how much you can do in physical therapy according to Medicare
I started going to the YMCA twice a week
and I worked with a worked with a trainer there who was really good at helping me do some things I needed to do
and then I also started going sometimes to the YMCA on my own just to get more time in of working at stuff like that
I r are you familiar with FitMi
and I can see youre not
are you familiar with Flint Rehab
okay you should be
look up Flint Rehab on the line because I have the I have the MusicGlove
and I have the FitMi
and it from Flint Rehab
and they also have exercises online that you can do
so I its helped me to have that resource alot
I would youknow Id encourage anybody whos had a stroke to maybe look at that
they have a they have a the Flint Rehab has this webpage on Facebook
and its more of its kindof a support webpage
so you can hear other stories and soforth other people and what theyre dealing with and what theyre kmpntu
do you work on alot with stroke
you work alot with stroke victims
yeah
yeah Im sure you havent yeah
but I would I mentioned that because I think its a good resource for anybody who had a stroke
and Id certainly encourage you as somebody who wants to work with stroke victims to become familiar with the her resources that they offer
I think theres also a
become familiar with recently was theres a book called stroke warrior
I think it its a good resource
its a written by an individual whos who had a serious stroke when her in her forties
am I getting off the track here
tell me what tell me get me back on track
and Ill where should I be
and well you know I do a Ive done alotof things
and Ive done youknow alotof physical activity kinds of things like my stationary bike
Ive done alotof mental stuff like the
or I useta do that when I first came home
I did alotof crosswords and sudoku and stuff like that
Ive just tried to do alotof Ive tried to do alotof stuff on my own to get better
and thats it
just something that happened to me
youknow Ive done alotof traveling
that count
that work
yeah Ive done yeah Ive done several trips with
my wife and I have done several trips
and weve gone to Europe several times
and I have just really enjoyed that
yeah I just couldnt really describe each trip to you
but that thats something
something else that maybe I should tell you this
this is maybe its maybe I can go into a little more detail here
I really enjoy riding bicycles
and weve done alotof riding bicycling my wife and I for number of years
and weve done youknow ke a bicycle ride all the way across Kansas
its called Biking Across Kansas
weve done we had a group that we went biking with once or twice a week thirty to fifty miles at a time
wed go somewhere and ride somewhere for breakfast and come back
I just it was alot really alotof fan
really we enjoyed that
yeah it yeah I Ive enjoyed work youknow riding bike and working on the bicycles
and it its been something that we can do together and really enjoy doing it
so lets see
the kid is out kicking the soccer ball
yeah he kicks it pretty hard
goes up pretty high
and it goes pretty far
and it goes through somebodys window
and then it goes through it goes through the window
and the this guy is the guy is sitting there in the chair as the ball comes crashing through the window and hits the lamp knocks the lamp off and scares him I guess
and then Im not sure exactly what happens after that
but yeah theres a hole in the window then
theres a hole in the window
and he the guy is holding the soccer ball looking out the window
so not sure what hes gonna do about the kid who kicked the soccer ball through the window
thats about it
now yeah
Im not sure
well lets see here
yeah it hit the window with the shutters on that
theres a problem here because when the ball comes through the window theres a lamp there
and in the final picture the lamp is gone
yeah the chair is gone the chair he was sitting in is gone
and the guys standing there and next to the window I guess
but the chair and the lamp are gone
so not sure what happened there
okay thats about it
okay
well the little kid is going off to school
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him
but hes kinda waving it off saying
so he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye
and he gets out there going on his way to school
and it starts raining
and you can see hes kinda alittle worried there and worry it rains more and more
and now its a downpour
and its raining pretty hard
and hes kinda running to get outta the rain
and he ran back home
and he did see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didnt want to take the umbrella
so then he gets the umbrella to go off to school
and hes happy going off to school with his umbrella
okay
well the story is that this little girls cat got up in the tree
and the dad went up to get the cat down
and hes got stuck in the tree
and the dog is standing there barking up the tree
I dont know if hes barking because hes trying to get that guy down or what
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down
and in the process somehow the ladder
maybe the dog hit the ladder
but it the ladder got knocked down
so the guy couldnt get couldnt climb down the ladder
so they hadta call a fire department
and they came
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder
and theyre going to get the guy down from the tree
now the cat in the meantime is sitting up in the tree
and I dont know if hes taking a nap or just
but he doesnt really care
hes not bothering him
the little girl probably was musta been riding her tricycle because its sitting there
but she is now trying to coax the cat down
theres a bird there in the tree
and hes just kinda singing away and probably is oblivious to everything else thats going on
thats pretty much it
the girls got pigtails and all of that
so maybe shes a tomboy or something
I dont know
thats about it
thats it
www
okay
well Cinderella was a Cinderella was I guess
I think there was a I think that Cinderella was actually had to work for the whos the got evil sisters
and they werent very nice to her
they made her do the laundry
obviously in the story here all the animals loved Cinderella because theyre all in theyre all around whenever she is
and they found that they like her alot because all the little animals are around when shes doing her thing
so the king has a son
hes looking for a looking for a bride for his son
I didnt say that right did I
yeah he was looking for a bride for his son
and they were he had they were gonna have a ball
so they could all come and see who she
and she was looking out the window in this one picture
she was looking out the window kinda dreaming about it
but she obviously hadnt been invited to the ball
so they all went to the ball
and well the I dont remember exactly how it was that she ended up
I guess the fairy godmother came while she was at while they were at the ball
the fairy godmother took a told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that shed take her to the ball in
and it was a pumpkin carriage and gonna take them to the ball
and I remember this one picture there that seemed alittle weird
the horses were sitting on their hind legs with their kinda with their feet up something like youknow
they were standing there on four legs
it was kinda weird
and so the fairy godmother took her to the ball
and she at the ball and went in
and nobody knew this knew who it was because she was so beautiful
nobody knew who she was
and they had the ball
and the prince the prince liked her
and then the chimes went off in the clock big clock BigBen or whatever
and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before or back home before midnight
and it was after midnight
and so she got up
she ran out
and her slipper fell off
and she went on
she got home without the slipper
and then the prince started looking for whoever it was that had the slipper
and he was trying he was trying the slipper on everybody in the kingdom
and finally the they wanted to he wanted to try it onto Cinderella
but I think they the bad evil sisters didnt want her didnt want him to
but he did anyway
he
and it fit
and the end Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after I guess
okay
well I guess first thing I do is go to the pantry
and I get out the peanut butter
and then I go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out
and Id get some bread outof the freezer the refrigerator because thats where we keep the bread
keeps it fresh
and then I would take out two pieces of bread
and Id spread peanut butter on one of them
and then I would spread jelly on the other one
and I would put the two together
and Id have a peanut butter dnu
and then I would put the bread away back in the refrigerator
and Id put the peanut butter away in the pantry
and Id put the jelly away in the refrigerator
and then Id sit down and eat my peanut butter sandwich with a glass of milk
its pretty good
but its pretty good
understandable
yes I do
well no I dont remember the stroke
I remember the first one that I had
and I remember the third one that I had
I do not remember the second one
okay I can tell you about the first one
Ill tell you that one
the first one I was home alone
FirstnameS had gone to get her hair cut about twenty five miles away
and I was working here at the house
I was Id been working on doing some carpenter work in the house
and I started to feel I started to feel kindof numb in my right hand
I didnt feel too bad
but I knew from what people had told me what Id heard many times the one of the signs of a stroke is numbness
infact I remember I was a fellow that I used to work with had a stroke at work
and I remember going through that and kinda recognize from that how it looked
so I knew what was going on
I knew I was having a stroke
against my well I probably I shouldnt have done it
but I called FirstnameS
and I said
and Id said
so I did
I went out
and I got in my truck
and I headed for the went to the hospital which isnt very far away
its youknow six or eight blocks away from here
and I drove to the hospital and drove into the emergency room parking and walked into the walked into the hospital
and I said
and they youknow didnt waste any time
said okay
somebody youknow
they took me put me in one of the examination rooms
and they started to examine me
FirstnameS shed it was about a half hour away
so she got there after this had started that the questions
I think I theyd already taken me to get a ct scan or whatever it was while before she got there
so they when she got there I was already had gone in to get a scan
and so when they had when I was done with that they took me back into the waiting back into the room where I was the treatment room whatever you call it at their in their emergency room
and I remember pretty well that youknow FirstnameS was there
and I remembered I knew what was going on I that I was that I had a stroke
but it felt like it was probably it wasnt getting any worse
it was just stroke
so I wasnt too worried about it
but and at that time it was only still in my right arm
it wadnt
I could walk I could walk fine
theres no problem there
it was in my arm that was affected
didnt affect my vision or anything like that I know of
I was able to drive youknow to the as I said to the hospital and walk into the hospital and tell them what I thought was going on
so yeah so they looked at me
they then they I was there for awhile in the emergency room
and then they took me and took me to a youknow to the neuro c icu
yeah icu
took me to the neuro icu
and youknow then ofcourse people came in and examined me
and the doctor came in
and ofcourse FirstnameS was there
and I remember the room real well
I think I was hungry by that time
I dont know how far how much more you want me to talk to say
I can go on talk for awhile if you want
but thats that pretty much the story of the time as when I had the stroke
okay
yes I can
my recovery from that initial stoke
I went youknow I was in the hospital for about three or four days
and then I went home
I went home
and we called a neurosurgeon to take a look at me and soforth
but so but I went home
and I actually within a few days I was youknow I said
and so we did
we nice cat
so we went out to the country
we live in Wichita and went out to the country and on some of the country road
and I did a little driving around
and I felt like I was pretty good youknow
and then I did that again acouple more times other days
and it seemed like things were going pretty well
and then I and then we as I said made an appointment to go see the neurosurgeon
and we went to see the neurosurgeon
and his name was Doctor LastnameM
and he was in a building right there by the hospital
and so went to see him and youknow in his office
and he explained to me what he thought I had
well youknow he had seen the xrays and the scans and all that
so he knew what was going on youknow
and he told me what told me what I had
and it was a it was a
see if I can remember the word
its probably gonna get away from me
its a
its on the tip my tongue
its a
I dont know if you can help me with this u
its a
you cant
I see youre shaking your house
okay I have a hard time some sorta remembering what this was
its not a regular stroke
its not a regular stroke
its a situation that Ive had probably since birth
and it the situation is that there is a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the artery
and instead of going through the little capillaries and everything it doesnt go through the capillaries
it goes directly into a vein
so theres no filter there to slow it down or youknow
and so that con
and it I said it probably was there from birth
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure
and it didnt blow
it just there was and it was not a very big spot
maybe size of a quarter that where it had bled into my brain
but it stopped bleeding
it stopped
and everything was going okay
it stopped
and there wasnt really much damage
so Doctor LastnameM then said
so I went home from that appointment feeling pretty good
FirstnameS I guess both felt pretty good
I continue practicing my driving and soforth
and I went back and made an appointment to go into surgery on May the first
that had it
Im sorry
May the sixth
that had all happened on April Fools Day on April first of two thousand fifteen
and so I went in for the surgery on May the sixth of that year two thousand fifteen
and little did I know I wasnt gonna come home for quite awhile
I wouldnt be home for another six months
and in the meantime
excuse the French
the shit hit the fan
and it did big time
Im sorry did I Im I dont mean to offend you
okay so that was my second stoke
and didnt I then that was
well okay so what happened was when I went into the hospital then to have the that surgery that
and again its on the tip my tongue
that I wanna say what it is
maybe Ill think of it yeah
so when I went in to have that taken care of while I when I was in the hospital then they did the surgery
and the surgery was a c success
the problem was that when I went back when I was in recovery from that surgery I was in recovery and
Ill ignore that if you can
sorry make sure its not
no its not
okay no
so when I
the let it ring a time or two and go itll go away
Im sorry
okay so I while I was in recovery my a brain for whatever reason
and not in the area where the surgery was done but in another area far away from the that spot
it started bleeding
and nobody knows why it started bleeding
but it did
and eventhough FirstnameS kept trying to say
because I dont remember it ofcourse
I didnt see it
my head was very swollen
and she could tell that
youknow they tried to say
they tried to say
not a stroke
a having a
I cant remember the word now
hes having a whatever it is that they said
well it happens sometimes after surgery
its no big deal
itll it is go away
and she kept trying to tell them
well they didnt well they didnt get hold of the doctor until number of hours later
that was at one about one oclock one thirty when I came back outof surgery the first time
and at finally about ten oclock that evening they took me back into surgery
and youknow by that time theyd had done scans and soforth
and they could see that the brain was bleeding badly
infact about the blood was about three quarters of my brain
it was so bad that they didnt know if I would be bu
and if I did come outof it didnt know for sure if I would ever talk walk
if Id even know anything
if Id just hafta be spending the rest my life in a care home
they didnt know
and so I didnt know if youd me to go on some more about this
Imean I can talk for a long time about this if you want me to
so you ready to go on
Im sorry I cant even hear you
yeah
yes
ofcourse I when I was when I was in the hospital I dont remember
youknow for about two months I dont remember anything
and I wasnt doing anything
I as far as I know I dont know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not but probably not because there wasnt anything to work with
I youknow I couldnt talk
I couldnt do anything
and interestingly in July
so that was May
in July middle of July somewhere I had another stroke
and they
I was at that point I was in the I was in a rehabilitation center a rehab hospital
and they took me by ambulance because I felt I could feel that something was going on
and I was afraid it was stroke
but I couldnt say it was a stroke
but I knew there was something going on
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that theres a problem
they took me to the hospital and did the scans and soforth
and sure enough Id had another Id had another stroke
while I was there in the hospital
up until that time I could not move my legs at all
my hands I had I was no I couldnt do anything with it
I youknow was just thats why they didnt know if Id ever be able to do anything again
but while I was in the hospital I started being able to move
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was Id lost my ability to focus my eyes together
so I can only see outof one eye at a time
so I was wearing an eye patch over one side
then Id wear it for a while over this side then youknow
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldnt see with both eyes
I can steer with both eyes
but Id see different things
and so when I had the second stroke or well this third stroke in the hospital I the vision started clearing up
and I remember telling me telling FirstnameS
I said
and I sure enough I could
and then I also told her that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit
and youknow because when youre paralyzed youre not sure whether its moving or not
you think youre moving it
but it really isnt
and I said
and indeed it was moving
it was moving
so whenever happened in this second stroke was good for me because I was able to start moving my muscle
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle
and I was able to see with both eyes together
so I was there two or three days
and they took me back to the rehab hospital
and at that point I was able to up until that point Id rmy primarily been doing rehab in terms of mental stuff
and at that point then I was able to start doing smpu
and youknow as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to youknow start make myself move my muscles
my arm I can move my arm
my hand still wouldnt move
we just numbed it
I couldnt do yth couldnt move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that
and so I do remember that when at that point
and you I dont know
are you saying your question was
was that the question
yeah
and so I started working really hard
I started working really hard because at that point I knew that I knew that
well actually youknow I knew it before that
that I was some at some point I was gonna get better
I just couldnt do it
but at that point when I was steblu
and if I work at it hard enough Ill be able to get better
so I was in that rehab hospital for two rehab hospitals for awhile
and then I went to a long term care facility
and I was there for a hundred days
and they worked with me with a speech therapist a physical therapist and a occupational therapist
and the hundred days
I couldve used more but that was the limit for becauseof Medicare
but that was total of six months that I was not able to come home
men
so we put a lift on the back on the port
and put one put a lift going upstairs because our is we have two story house
and so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs
I hadta I Id had some more rehab along
I had rehab at home for about another six weeks of rehab
and he was very good rehab specialist
I did some other youknow occupational and physical and
whats the third kind
anyway Ill come Ill coming up with in a minute in a minute
so I did that
and but I never did I never did give up
I always continued to work as hard as I could
youknow I had a very good physical therapist to help me
and so we worked hard on that
and that took me until
and it actually and then I got when I was when I was still at
then I went to we had therapy on an outpatient basis for awhile at a rehab hospital here on outpatient basis for several months
and during that time I met a
I dont really know how to describe him
hes a hes kindof a hes kindof a
he does not have a hes not a phd
but he is a doctor of education or something like that
but he is very good at working with stroke people in terms of in terms of cognitive ability
and I worked with him for about almost four years
and infact Ive just got work when I quit working with him maybe in the last six months
we were went to his office went to
well he had an office
it he didnt have an office there
he had a he came to a he came to a university here
and he would meet with people there at the university
and I was still in a wheelchair at that time
and I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was when I was actually in a walker for another year
and then when I went to walking with a cane I continued working at with him
but it his
I witch
but he works with the cognitive abilities
and he helped me alot youknow
infact some of the things that weve done here is reminded me of some of the stuff that hes done that he did with me
youknow ll telling stories and alot different tests that Im sure youre very familiar with
but he was able to work with me and just pull stuff outta me and make it work
and maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was kindof inspire me to keep going and working
so I did that
and I worked hard on that
and I worked hard
when I actually when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me I went to the YMCA
and I got a membership in the yl and hired at the yl a personal trainer who didnt really know anything about strokes
but she learned
she was very good at studying and learning
the first day that she saw me and I was so stiff that I couldnt move
I couldnt move any
my arm was just
I dont know if you can see it here
its youknow your arm is just like this
and it has clenched fist and everything
and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like
and it wouldnt move
she worked with me
I went twice a week to go with her
and then in addition to that
h but after a while I went started Id say
I was still using my walker
Id say
and Im sure people probably thought stupid dumb
heres this old guy walking around with his youknow very slowly
itd take me youknow itd take me
it its six times arounds
and it would take me probably half hour to walk around that lap
but I was determined to do it
and I did it
I did it
and then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane
I still go very slowly
but Im doing it
so Im gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself
and Im not trying to pat myself on the back
I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have
and Im sorry for them
they dont
but and I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive
I did not lose my drive
always Ive always been kinda driven anyway
youknow Ive always been driven
but I was driven to r to improve and get better
and Im still doing that
and Im getting there
and it will never come to an end
but it I will keep working at it
okay
well when I
okay I tell you about my wife
hows that
at my wife
I Id been married before
my first wife had Huntingtons disease
I dont know if youre familiar with it
but she had Huntingtons disease for many years
and she passed away oh about twenty years ago
I had a I had a friend
now how do I go into this
when she passed away before she passed away
this gets complicated
okay my wifes brother my wifes brother had moved to Texas
in the nineties they moved to Texas
and in Texas she met and became very close friends with someone in Texas there that she didnt know
but they she met
they c youknow they worked together
and they became very close friends
are you in for a long story
so my sister inlaw sister inlaw her name is FirstnameD okay
and so they moved to Texas
and at some point they moved back to Wichita
and he went to work for Boeing okay
so at some point this friend of hers was going through a divorce
she shed been married for almost twenty years
and it end didnt end up very well
so she was going through a divorce
and so FirstnameD who is my sister inlaw invited her to come to Wichita just because she needed somebody to youknow she needed to get away from the situation that she was
and so she moved to chi Wichita
and becauseof the friendship that my sister inlaw had with her we got to know them
my wife and I got to know them
but not very well because my wife had Huntings
and you dont socialize very much when you have that exist
so I really did not know her them their friend very well
but we did see them once in awhile when wed go ke go to a family gathering or go to their house because FirstnameD would be there
and her friend would be there and soforth
and so that was like nineteen ninety one or something like that
well to make a long story long FirstnameDs friend then moved to get got married remarried and went to went and moved to California
she was out there for about a year
and she came back to Wichita
and her husband he came back to Wichita
and he had his her husband had a heart transplant
if he you having a hard time following this thats okay
Ill it Ill try to bring it all together
she
and it didnt take very well youknow
heart transplants theyre long drawn out
and she
and finally he gave out
in the meantime my wife with Huntingtons disease was moved to a
we had her at a nursing home
she spent five years in a nursing home
now then and her nursing home was the same town about four or five blocks away from FirstnameSs friend
I had no idea they that she lived there
youknow I had no idea that she lived in that town or anywhere
so at one point my wife finally youknow she went downhill and went downhill and passed away in two thousand two
I called FirstnameD my sister inlaw to tell her that FirstnameJ had passed away
and FirstnameS and no and FirstnameD said
FirstnameC just died yesterday
and FirstnameC is FirstnameSs husband
I say
over time I it and not right away but over time I
FirstnameS was living up there in the in Sedrick the town of Sedrick where the nursing home was
and at some point FirstnameS said or FirstnameD said
I said
so youknow after you lose a spouse its very difficult to for people to understand where youre going through when you lose a spouse
and I went I was in this little town where FirstnameS lived
didnt really have any didnt have any limits on fireworks
okay thats only important because my kids wanted to have re wanted to have some fireworks
and youknow oh my kids wanted to have some fireworks
so I said
well not my kids my grandkids
I said
so went up there went up there
and youknow I just said
and she said
so we did
and then we started kindof getting to know each other at that point
because like I say you dont you if unless youve lost a spouse you dont realize what its like
and so FirstnameS I kindof had an immediate bond there because we had both lost recently lost our spouses
and both of us had spouses that add
it took years before he passed away and my wife
and so youknow we started we youknow its it was a it was a t kinda a natural bond
and so we tu
and here we are
and so FirstnameD is still FirstnameD is still FirstnameSs best friend
infact she was here just yesterday or day before
theyre still best friends
and thats what happened to me was youknow my wet
and that was fifteen years ago fifteen years ago that we got married almost fifteen
wait a minute
see lemme think
lemme think
no its over fifteen years
it was fifteen last October
okay
okay
well I is a theres a little boy
not a real little boy
hes not a little boy
hes maybe I dont know ten twelve something in there
hes out kicking the soccer ball around
hes wearing a ball cap
and hes wearing jeans
and hes kicking the soccer ball around
and he kicks it really hard
raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air
and then it goes to it then you see the soccer ball travels through the air and hits a window
theres shutters on the window
its a nice size picture not a picture window good one good size window
and theres a bushes outside the window
and it the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp
knocks the lamp off the off outof knocks the lamp off the table
but it knocks the lamp over
and no
so it knocks the lamp over and comes through the window
the guy is sitting there probably watching tv or something
but he gets up picks up the soccer ball walks over to the window
and youknow the window
I think we talked about this last time
the window is there
the lamp where the soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore
its the lamp is gone
the curtains are little bit different
theres Im not sure what Im not sure what the
yeah its theres there Im not sure what some of the something is there the
anyway though theres a lady
and but the lamp and the chair are no longer there
and I think the Im gonna say that the window ledge is lower than it was
it just it looks different
but the guy he looks out the window
and I think he doesnt know where it came from
but I am sure hes probably going to find out
and hes probably going to make somebodys pay for the window
so the moral of that story is if youre gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesnt go through the window
the end
oh I forgot the beginning and the end last time didnt I
okay the beginning is that they the little kid
I think its a boy
is going off to school
and the mom tries to hand him a an umbrella
and he says
so he waves goodbye to the mom
hes got his backpack on
head for school
waves bye tell tells mom goodbye
and shes standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesnt wanna take with him
so he starts walking off to school
and theres some raindrops coming down not alot but just a few raindrops here and there
and he looks up at the sky
and hes like
so he said
and he turns around
and he and its raining harder
and now the winds kinda blowing because the rains coming at an angle
and its quite a bit of rain because as he runs hes splashing
so theres enough rain thats making little splashes
and hes kinda holding his hand up over his head like asthough hes gonna be able to stop the water off his head
but he runs home
and you can tell the say the mom is a little alittle perturbed but he get because he wouldnt take the umbrella
so there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet
and the mom just kinda looks at him like
he said
so she gives him r umbrella
and he head heads back to school
and its still raining
its still raining pretty hard
its coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was
so it must be lo blowing pretty hard at a forty five degree angle
and hes walk hes got his backpack
and hes walking off to school
and I the moral of the story is listen to your mom
she knows best
the end
oh yeah Ive seen this one before okay
okay
so the beginning is the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree
and the little girl is upset because the cats up the tree
and she cant get her down
I think shes calling the cat to come down
but the cat wont come down
so either cat wont or cant
but it looks like the cat really doesnt care to come down
hes like
so the little girl says youknow
and shes the little girl is probably
I dont know
shes pretty young because shes still riding a tricycle
and she got pigtails and little black sandals
like I said shes riding that little ik tricycle
the cat wont the cat wont come down
so apparently the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down
and he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there
and something happened
Im gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree ran into the ladder or something
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down
the dads stuck in the tree
and I dont know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone
maybe its maybe
I dont know
thats he musta had a cellphone
he calls the fire department
and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters
and theyre carrying their ladder
and theyre running over to get the man down outta the tree
meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree
I dont know if hes I dont think I dont think hes mad
I think hes just barking up the kriu
so the firemen are on their way
theyve got their ladder
trucks sitting out and set on the setting out on the street
theres a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away
and yeah then thats pretty much it
its a big tree
yeah both
and it is its summertime because the trees have leaves on
yeah okay well thats about good
okay
www
okay
alright well at the beginning I dont know if this is true or not
I dont know if this is really what happened in the story
but looks like it looks like that for some reason maybe somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else
and I dont know the story behind that
but thats what it looks like
and then so she says
well when shes gone it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend
she musta been sleeping in the out in the stable with the animals I guess
she in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters
she was doing their laundry
she was doing all the work
and like I said she had become more of a slave than anything else
so they lived in the shadow of the castle
and I think she dreamt about the castle
looks like she was in the one picture it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that
thats what it looks like anyway
and so it turns out that the king little short fat king
I dont know why the little short why the king is always short and fat but he is
is looking for somebody to marry his daughter
and he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom sothat the girls can have their pick of
they cant have their pick
but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball
and theyll have a chance to show off to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him
so he sent out this invitation
and ofcourse the wicked stepmother or the whatever she is the mother she ofcourse doesnt let doesnt want Cinderella to go to the ball
so the other girls go off to the ball
and Cinderella stays home
and shes gotta tend to the animals or whatever
so the fairy godmother came along
and Im not sure how she got into the story
but she came along
the fairy godmother showed up and with a carriage a pumpkin
it was that the I guess fairy godmother turned the turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a for the r for Cinderella to ride in
they went to the went to the ball with the two horses and the footman and the driver and all that
they went to the went to the ball they went to the ball but they went to the ball
and the nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful
so she the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the pumpkin
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is
they up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see its about a minute before midnight
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while its still a carriage
runs or runs and dnu
but in the way she lost her slipper
she was running down the stairs
the slipper fell off
and she didnt have time to go back and pick it up I guess
so she went on got in the carriage with youknow the carriage and went home
the prince was heartbroken because he and me because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the who had come to the ball
and nobody knew who she was
but he had fallen in love with her
and so he sent eryb he sent his man or servants or whatever out to find this the person whose foot would fit in the slipper
and so they went to Cinderellas house
and ofcourse the two sisters there they tried it on
and ofcourse it didnt fit
and so the Cinderella was there as a servant
and I think the I think the fairy godmother or something said made worked it out somehow that sothat the prince would try the slipper on Cinderellas foot
and sure enough it fit perfectly
it was perfectly obvious whose foot it was
and it was Cinderellas
and so everybody was happy
all the animals were happy
the animals were l the little rats
everyone was celebrating as the as Cinderella gets in the carriage with the prince
and they ride off into the distance and live happily ever after
you get some you got some bread
thats the first thing I guess
get the bread outof the refrigerator because I we keep our bread in the refrigerator
so you get the bread out
then you go to the pantry
and you get out the peanut butter
open the peanut butter
and is this a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
I think it is
so then I go back to the refrigerator and take out the take out the jelly
and open up the bread sack
and open up the peanut butter jar
and open up the open up the jar of jelly
I go to the knife drawer near the drawer where we keep the silverware
and I take out a knife and take out two pieces of bread
and I spread the peanut butter on one of the pieces of bread
and then I take another piece of bread and spread peanut jelly on the on that one
I put them together
and I go put the knife in the dishwasher so it gets cleaned up
and put the jar jelly jar back in the refrigerator
and put the bread back in the refrigerator
and then I go over and put the peanut butter back in the pantry
and then I sit down and eat my peanut butter and jelly sandwich
and thats it

my speech today is doing pretty good
some days not
yes I had a stroke at the school
and I was a teacher
and I had headaches for about a week or so and still working during the day
and they said allofasudden I said
and allofasudden I was talking to the nurse thats at the school
and she said
and I kept I was trying I was talking
I thought what I was saying was right
and I kept saying
and she kept saying
and obviously my talking was not even all there
and I dont remember anything from that point to I was I had this tube in there
I got my brain done
I got I had a tube going
I was out
it breathes you and everything
I dont rimmbvu
I didnt even know my name
I didnt know who I was
they gave me a mirror to know who I was
and I didnt know it was me
I thought it was a picture of someone else
so yeah for that long
so I had about two weeks of not here
yes
lets see
at the beginning I had I could not walk yet
so they were helping me to stand up at the beginning not walking anywhere but able to stand up
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side
so I had one therapist that bet
this one arm was not always going
so weights trying to get that going
then I had another therapist was trying to get me to start talking
I couldnt really talk of anything
so they were showing me like yesq or noq alot
I we had to start with that
sometimes I didnt really even understand if they said
usually they would show me that
and I thought
Id so that was hard
even at the beginning I didnt even understand cups
and they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere
and they showed me how to they hadta show me how to eat again
to at the beginning I was very scared by myself in a room
I also thought we had I thought someone had took me like a bad person taking me
so I was trying to run to help myself
I had those thoughts too of scared to the point where I was trying to hit people in a way because I thought they were trying to help no I thought they were bad people
so I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run
that was even that part for me
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way
didnt my mom and dad were there
didnt know who they were
my kids were here
didnt know them
like I said they showed me a mirror
and they said
and I thought
and it was me
so thats when it got started
then therapy started with even very small like saying my name saying yesq or noq
went from that point to we played some games for numbers like dice
we played some games that were cards like play cards in a way put sort all the cards together what colors matching
h little things
it gives me focus
and also I would lksu
if were playing a game I was okay
so we did that
then they started giving me cards
what the first one I ever saw was a baby
theres a baby card
and there was a bird
and they said
is it a bird or a baby
and it took
I didnt know
but I knew it a little bit in my brain
but not really on what they were youknow
it was happy thoughts
but I dont know I wasnt sure what that was
thats when it started
then I was able to start not walking very well
but I could stand up pivot sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself
thats when all that started during
once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning
I still do have to watch my dizzy feelings
but therapy that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better stuff like that
and other therapy was still doing the talking started at the beginning
so its that was about a year of just talking working on all those words and all that youknow
then after two years didnt have to worry about the other therapy because now Im starting to walk very well now
so only just therapy for speech
then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years we started working on these numbers which I still not good at
I went from one to now I know one and two to one two three
Im not higher than that not very good so youknow
and one plus one not sure there yet
but so was working on numbers and trying to start reading of any kind
reading it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading
Im still not all there
now its been three years
I can I really cant read I say
sentences maybe
it depends on what were talking about
Im starting to read books from ke little kids books
now I can do some of that
writing is not as good
so I use my phone
but therapy people was showing me ke apps stuff like that
because someday if you cant write again theres other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that
so well I cant remember the first thing were talking about
sorry about that
see this is me
okay kzu
lets see
I does it have to so what
are you talking about just a story are you saying
or are you saying ke something about something like that
okay I think is new stuff
I think since Im a teacher
and I was before
but now I hafta be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school right
so one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke
they have aphasia
and we when theres a new patient here I like to help them
theyre gonna have the same struggles most of the time that I had
and so now we are now friends
I can help them to have her
and tips I can give them
and so now when I do that kind of stuff Im now a teacher again
so I like that
and theyre also now my friends
I when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back
so I havent seen some of them now for years
they dont call me back
they dont understand me now
so my new friends are kinda like me
were very we talk alot which is good
but I think that we have bad days
therapy is hard some days
some days our brain mine my I would say my brain doesnt always work some days
my eyes dont always work
my foot now that were talking my foots not working right now
things like that
but my life being a teacher and a friend is an awesome thing to me
yeah
okay
I cant see us on the last one because were in the middle ourselves
so Im not sure whats under the last one
looks like theres a boy thats been hitting the ball round
probably a
I remember the name of those little guys
but theyre playing that ball
and it looks he hit the window
and it hit the window and went in
so it crashed the window
yeah
and I dont know if its his house or not
it could be someone elses house
but and he also hit the lamp also
and the guy
Im gonna move this again just a minute and Ill
so the guy is well he has the ball
but I dont know if he
yeah hes just looking
so I dont know if that kid decided to leave
or if hes gone
so that must be there should be more story line on that one
I dont know if he ran or if the guys just going
okay
one of the kids have
and mom said
and the kid said
and Im sure mom said
and so but he went outside
and here comes the rain going faster even maybe more raindrops
and so then he said
he went the other way home and said
and so mom gave it to him
and then he went back outside for school with the blu
yes thats a funny one
okay
it looks like theres a cat stuck in the tree
and so dad said
and the ladder fell down
and so someone mustve called the fire people
and theyre going to get him outof the tree and maybe even the cat
lets see
there
yeah I dont know if its really dad I guess
maybe its just someone who is helping for the cat
or if its youknow the little girls dad that did that
Im not sure
I dont see any houses around
so its hard to tell
she had her bike I guess
but and theres a dog obviously thats barking because theres a guy up there in the tree
so yep
okay
I dont remember her name sorry
its hard
okay
she
lets see
I dont remember where she comes from
but shes in the house with the
its not her mom
its
I dont remember what calls that
but its not her mommomnn youknow
and but theres two other sisters
and they get to do whatever they want during the day
but the other girl hasta clean and do all the stuff that who wants to do right
and Im sure shes but shes yeah she watches the castle the big one
and Im sure that she watches and thinks
and then they we get a letter that says theyre gonna do a
lets see what
its not a party
theres a word but I dont have it
the ball
thats what they call it yeah
so like a party in a way
but you dance and look beautiful
and everyone could go
and I think theyre going to do that because they want the prince
I think hes a prince
and he finds he needs to find a lady
and so theres a way to do it I think
so they said
and so when they got their paper I think she even gets to go
she didnt say she couldnt go
but she had a beautiful dress in her
I say its not a box
its something pretty
but I dont know what they call those things
and but she was looking at the dress
and oh Im gonna look so good
and the other girls they dont look as cute
but they she they looked her stuff
and they wanted this and that and dress and tore her dress and everything
and so they were gonna go
and she looked she didnt have thing
and so she was sad
and the fairy
I think thats what she is
I dont remember
right now shes different than the one you watch her another way
useta be a small one
now shes a real lady
but she was there
and she said
and so she takes the rats and the dog and everything become people
and the pumpkin they make it pretty for her to go in there
and they gave her a dress that looks beautiful
and she said
and so she may forget that part at the beginning
shes just shes so excited
she doesnt think about the time very well really laughs
and so then
lets see
she gets in there
and Im sure that everyone says
and but the
hes not a king yet
the prince sees her and said
and so they dance and everything
and allofasudden she does figure out the time
and she looks at that and says
and so she runs down the stairs
but one of her theyre not shoes heels
I dont know
theres ru
I dont know
I say shoes
so she one of them falls
and she gets home
and you could tell she was she had a good night
but shes probably also kindof sad on the fact she never gets to come back in her head youknow
but it was a beautiful night
and then shes back at home cleaning and everything else
and here comes one of the people who works for the youknow the king and guy Im sure
so they bring this guy
and he has one of the shoes and says he they want to find the pretty one
and those girls ofcourse theyre hoping they know theyre not her shoes
but they said
and ofcourse their usually have big feet or who knows
but I dont xxx that part of that story
but I remember it before
and then so allofasudden she gets to decide now
I dont know if they really the I dont think the other mom wouldve let her even try it
but Im sure someone I dont one of the one of the rats figure this out or something
they help her to sit down and put them on
so there must be kindof thing going on to help her to do that
and then and they fit
and so she gets to come back to the castle
and they get married
and oh and the end is always the
oh whats the word
I wish I had it in my head
but its not there
youknow they always say at the end
ke alwaysq
well what is those words
I wish I remember the name
it was like it always says the end of all the stories
afterq
h I dont have it
but Im excited about it
so and they are always together
youknow they always do
yeah
oh okay now Im going to show you theres another way to do this
so Im gonna give you the real stu
so if you want peanut butter jelly right together
so the first thing you need is two bread slices
and then whats weird about it you deed
and you take some of the peanut butter
and you put it in the cup
and then you get some of the jelly
and it has to be a certain kind because my dad only says you can have this kind
I dont know its one of those things
and you put that in there
and you get a spoon
and you stir it like this
I dont know Ive done this since I was a kid
and then you take it outof the cup
and you put it on the bread together
and then you put them together like this
and the you eat it that way
although when youre a kid youre also go
dad only lets you do that part because this is his smwtu
you get part of the from the spoon
yeah
my speech I think theyre not too bad
better than it was before
yeah doing very well
not a hundred percent but youknow good enough right
yes its been a little bit more than three years
yeah right about a week before my birthday
yes had my stroke
I had been having headaches
and I was a teacher working at a school and working
and during that day my headache was getting more worse
and I went to the nurse that day at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile
and as we were talking she looked at me funny
and she said that
and I thought I was talking fine
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that
and she knew that I was having a stroke from that
and they called five six seven eight nineoneone
and I dont remember
right after that when they
I remember being in the what do you call it in the
its not a car youknow
its not a truck
its is being in there laying down youknow
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions
but I could not think
at that point it was getting worse as it goes
and they ended up taking me
and one of the guys who does brains he found a spot
they made it a picture
they said that youre having you have a clot in your brain in the back
and its starting to blood
and it starts to take part of your what do you call it ke cells in a way that die
and so he ended up giving me surgery at that point and fixed it pretty much yeah
so Im still here today
but the clot is still here
it hasnt left
so thats why Im taking the medicine I am
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I it happened again
they said I was taking medicine that rktdu
it most people dont have trouble with it
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think
theyre hoping that they
yeah its one of those things
yup
I think at the beginning the first thing they were helping me to stand up to be able to walk again
they were more into that at the very beginning than other ke aphasia type stuff
they wanted to make sure I was able to walk again and because my one side of my body was starting to have trouble they said
so they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning
they started doing some little task for me
ke we played cards to see how many cards I can find looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that
but we were doing that just here and there feeling
I was also very sad very emotional feeling
didnt I couldnt even remember who I was
and so getting to work on therapy when you dont know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff
once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year
so said
so once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit we started working on therapy
and they said
and my talking I couldnt say pretty much any I couldnt say anything
they were saying like
I didnt understand what that meant
so theyd give me ke a cup
theyd take the cup and show me
and Id go yesq or noq
it took me a l even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it
if you dont want it goes this way
took that long to figure that out
little things like that I didnt remember
then once I was able to atleast think a little bit more we started with pictures like that bird and the boy and the banana
and we start that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words
and my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else
so still working on therapy myself
I have a book at home that I still do my homework everyday
so still going
its I Im the only thing I cant do right now yet is read and write
and I said but I told myself that Im going to do it
so Im not done yet when it comes to coming up youknow
Im going to read someday
and I will write
and I will have numbers at some point
so yeah
lets see
lets see
I oh one of my from a long time ago when I was I dont know ten fifteen right in there youknow teens in a way we had my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage
and we on the weekends you went to the cottage
and we wouldnt go every weekend
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools youknow
we would take that time
and I think that was one my favorite places to go
we could fish
we could swim
we could
and it wasnt very deep
there was alot
now it was deep in the middle
but right now Imean you could didnt really hafta swim
you could just walk around a little bit
there were frogs
there was turtles at
so Imean it was we got up in the morning
and I think we ate as fast as we could to be to go outside
and I think youre pretty much outside until its time to go to bed
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that all the fun things that we were able to do
ke my dad let me
we useta have a rowboat that had paddles
but we also had one that had the motor in the back
and it now youre you were not allowed to go fast
it was like two what do you call it ke no five fast
so it wasnt very fast
you could almost swim as fast as you can the youknow the boat
but they let me actually mow s
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that paddle boat and stuff like that
I loved to drive
I just thought that was really cool
Im not sure why now it was like it was such a big thing
but it was youknow
and I was by myself on the boat youknow
and I thought I was something else youknow and all that
we forgot the gas one time
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid
but I think that was
and at night we had ke a place to lay down outside
and we would go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty
and I think when I have my if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads
I think about that place
I dont know why
yeah
www
theres a boy outside that was hitting the ball around and having fun Im sure
and but as he was going by he hit the ball on the window
and it broke
and it actually went in the house with it
so the that ball fell into someone elses house
and Im sure the guy
I cant see that he has a picture
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously
but it even hit the lamp and everything
and so he was looking to see youknow what happened
so hes looking for the kid
so we dont know if he took off or if he was going oops feeling or what
we dont see him in the picture now
so at the end all we know is that the theres a guy with the ball looking for to outside to see whats happening
yeah
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened
we dont know what happens this time
okay
in the morning the little boy are
and mom had looked at the weather and said
and said
and the boy said
and so mom said
and okay
and so he said bye mom and went to school started walking
and here comes the rain
and it started probably even more rain as it looked
and so he ran to come home the other way
and lets see
so he went back in the house probably and said
and so she said
and so he put it on the brlu
done
okay
theres a cat that was going up this tree on that bird
and I think it was up there and stuck
and so this little girl was watching and thought
and there was probably a guy walking by
and he thought
and but he got up there
and now hes stuck too it looks like
and someone saw the guy up there
and the firetruck called and said
and so they brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down
yeah
okay
alright
so lets see
she
I think her mom mustve died because dad is finding a new a very bad lady
and now shes here stepmom in a way now right and with two girls
and they come to their really nice place
and she hasta do all the dishes and the laundry and everything
and the other girls actually they were even doing ke either singing
or they do their little mstrmntsu
theyre doing all of that during the day and having their fun
and they found out that theres going to be a ball youknow kind of thing
and everyone can go and everything
and the so she goes to get a dress
and it was new in my head on the fact that the birds I think and maybe see others a little friends helped her to make even bru
its one of those things that they lock
and they got outof there
it looks really pretty
but shes like
but its gonna look pretty
but then the birds said
and they maybe even some of the little mice or something whoever they are youknow were helping to put her dress look even better
and they got it done
and shes gonna go too
and but she also cant have a ride because theyre going youknow the mom and the two girls get to go together
so she had to find a way to go
and as they were leaving they said
I want this and this that you have
and so that was they took all of her beads and everything that was pretty
and so now she doesnt have ride to get to be there
and also her dress was torn and everything
and she found the
I cant remember what her name is
shes like a fairy
I dont remember what they call those little guys
but anyway youknow shes just sitting here and there
shes there to help you
and she said
and so they get that done
and all of the little mice become youknow like guys
oh and the so as one of the I think their dog goes and youknow as one of as one of the guys that doing the driving and all that
and so that thats how she gets there
and once gets here Im sure that theyre gonna be like
and they wont be very excited about that the fact that she made it here
and she looks really good
and so then the here is the new
hes not a king yet
hes a princess
no thats a guy thats a girl not a king
see I dont remember whose is whose
but youknow its one of the its the kings kid in a way right
and he finds her and says
and so theyre dancing and everything
and then she looked at the clock which I now I forget to tell you
but youknow shes only allowed shes only she is only allowed to be there until midnight
and so shes kept looking at the clock
shes good at that
shes watching
and so as they were dancing and everything she thought
and so ofcourse he probably said
and she said
so shes running
and Im sure even the one of the guys who worked there even had a question
and she I think she said
and so as she went one of her shoes fall
and she gets all the way home
and ofcourse you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for youknow back
and theres the dog and everybodys sitting there
and Im sure shes thinking
and I dont know if shes even a know she ever see her him again
but at least she had a real beautiful day night youknow
and then but theres a guy coming back at all the houses I think youknow to see where that shoe came from
and I think that the mom that new mom said
which they probably knew it was her at the beginning youknow because she looked way too good
and so they locked her in the like in her room or in the palace or who knows she is
I dont know
its always bad over there youknow that
shes they stuck her in there
and but here comes the one little mice that got the key to let her in to get outta there
and so when she got in there they said
and she doesnt look good
so youknow I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point
and then there she is
she said
and so she sits down
and it fit
and so she made it
and so they put her youknow took her back over to the castle
and they get a marry
and what is it called happy whatever you call it
its on my cup
I wish I could read it because I its always the thing at the end youknow
allq afterq youknow kinda thing right
yeah
oh for sandwich you said that has
if you want a butter sandwich you need the bread right
two slices of bread
and you need lets see whats the word peanut butter and a knife and jelly of some fashion
whatever you whatever kind ya like
and lets see
I think the first thing you wanna do is put the peanut butter on part of the bread and spread it around
there ya go
and then whatever kind of stuff you want with it you can put that together and smooth it around
and then put the bread together
and if your
what is they call that stuff
youknow you always have that bread around it that the kids wont eat
they dont like that part
so I hafta take that off too
they dont like that cart
whats it what is I cant remember what thats called
not the heel
if its the last one its a heel
they wont eat any of that
but the one that has that
what is that part
do you know
I dont remember what kind thats what part of it is
its the one the that part of the bread
oh thankyou
I was gonna say its that part all the way around
and my kids always want also tu
so you want you have one two three and four of them like this
my other kids so I have one kid thatll go this side and this side to make the squares
the other kid wants to go this way
I dont know
its very strange when you have a mom now
only kids will only do this way
this kid wont do this
one dont like this kind
you cannot do all of them at the same time
that doesnt happen your house
not when you have that many kids
and one of them wont even eat them
one of the best lunches
I hesitate because I do remember my speech before my
and it is lousy
I do remember my stroke vividly
I went to I
and I ate dmsmu
and I immediately felt ill
and I felt nausea
and I battled my nausea for twenty four hours
and I relentedly decided to call the doctor
and I drove to the doctor with my son in the car
and we waited for the doctor
and I went into the doctor
and he immediately ascertained that I had a stroke
and he ordered a wheelchair
and I was reluctant to sit in a ritnu
and the doctor ordered me to sit in the wheelchair
and we wheeled to the er
and immediately they gave me a test
and I think that I was talking pretty well then
I think that my the stroke was in the hospital my stroke was
and I kntu
and I kntu
and I was bewildered because I didnt know what aphasia was
its embarrassing
my phd I dont know what aphasia was
and I battered
and the doctor said that if I have if I had a
and my wife they decided to send me to the RRC
and I was bewildered because I couldnt talk
the speech therapists assigned to me didnt explain how I
and FirstnameL my sister FirstnameL explained it to me
FirstnameL LastnameC is a professor of linguistics
she observed that my she was appalled at my speech
and she searched for a good speech therapy department
and she found it at Northwestern
its a vbtu
and I went to I stayed in the hospital for maybe six weeks
and then I was assigned to rehabilitation for nine months
and then I switched to Northwestern
and I tested I think six months I
and I could drive
and nine months I have a rehabilitation
speech ot pt etcetera for six hours a day
thats it
I exercise
I went to speech therapy
and I was frustrated by speech therapy
I realized that I have not gotten better
right and I was worried about my boredom because
and I couldnt talk anymore
I struggle to write
and I suggested to the clinician that why dont you organize
and I the clinician decided to organize the writing group
and I have been writing for twelve years
and I wrote I
its a lousy book
and I switched to writing about the memoir of history
and oh I the therapist suggested that I took art
and I have been going to take art for five years at Evanston
thats it
I cannot explain
oh the Northwestern the clinician decided to organize
and I organized it my art sothat the musicians
thats it
I think when I was a kid twelve years old I went to
I didnt want to go to London
my father bribed me to go to London
if I go to London he gave me a huge allowance
ten pounds a week
and I went to school in London to Hendon preparatory school
and I was surprised that the children hating heated
and it was in nineteen sixty seven
and I pleaded that I didnt start the Vietnam war
and during London was extremely peaceful
and my father decided to permit me to roam around London
like the busses
like the tube
and I was roaming around London hugely
I walked in Leicester Square and walked in ttnhmu
and the my father stumbles upon
the etching was very cheap then
and I decided to invest in my prints making
and I bought print mtnu
I think that my father was contemptuous of travel
but he got the travel bug
hi kitty

and I traveled to huge
I decided to
ohgod
I am rambling
I traveled to Italy France Germany because in
and traveling to Europe was cheap
I do remember my father tried the most expensive restaurants
and he took me to the most expensive restaurants in Venice
I do remember it was excellent
the dinner was excellent
I dont know what to
I can tell you about my junvstu
I dont know why I decided to go into history at

and Purdue gave me a tuition
but the RU did not give me a tuition
and the junvstu
and my father offered to pay for me to go to the junvstu
and he explained that you should go to a best school
the junvstu
its not the junvstu
for instance Northwestern is better than the junvstu
but the junvstu
thats it
rambling I am embarrassed about my rambling on
and I decided to go in Jewish history

if the foots on if the glass slipper fits on the foot of the
all the women flocked to the flock to the castle to try on
however they would
and then they exhaustly
and it fits

and they all live happily every
the end
and I went to find a loaf of bread
and I open the two pieces of the bread
and the ohgod the spread of on the bread flat
and I went to the refrigerators
and oh the spread the peanut butter and the jam on it
and slapped the bread put it on the plate and cut it
and then I screwed the peanut butter and jam put it in the
the end
I think is better than when I had my stroke because all I could say for ke two weeks was no
so I think its gone better
yes I do
okay
so on the day that I had my stroke in the ftrununu
and I thought I was dying really
so I went to the er
and I had stones kidding
Ill tell you I would never want anyone to ever have that
so they gave me some pills and told me just go home
and it will pass
and Im not really good with pills
it makes me feel like Im not in my head
so I ddu
and I went to sleep
and then probably around ke I think it was eight in the iviu
and I was talking to my husband
and I kindof felt like I was drunk
and I thought it was probably becauseof the pills
and he told me
so I went back to bed
and probably around eleven I got up to go to the bathroom
and I fell
I was like
and I tried to get up
and I couldnt
and my husband heard me
he was in the other room
and he helped me get up
and he knew that smpwnu
I couldnt say anything
so he went ahead and called nineoneone
and he went outside to make sure that the mlntsu
and I was on the bed
and I was like
so I was trying to goes
and I fell inside of the closet
so when my husband came with everyone they found me in the collet
and my hzmu
and then I they had to take me to Boise
so thats about almost twenty five miles to get there
my husband could not come with be
so I just rode with them to the hsblu
and then I got there
and my sister and her husband were already there
and then my husband came later
and I know that after that I was in icu for ke a week
and that was kinda weird because I dont remember alot

and then I would get to work
and then wed go out and get a coffee
and then at lunch I would have a popn
and then after my midizu
or I would get another coffee
it was really bad
I and I think that I think that was why I had the kidney stones
it was really bad
I would never want anyone to ever have that
right
right so when I was in the hsblu
and the guy that helped me with that he was just amazing
youknow I had to figure out to sorry how to get up outof the chair and get to the wheelchair and then how to get outof the wheelchair and get in the bed
and then he would make me walk with him because I didnt want to be in the wheelschair
and then we did alotof the walker
and then after the hsblu
and then they gave me the brace
but that was after the hsblu
when I was in there I did alot with my foot and my hands like how to dress yourself with one arm
just saying that is kinda weird
I had to get
my hair useta be really long
and I had to cut it off so I can do something with my hair
and to do your makeup with your left hand
youknow I cant do my eye liner still
but thats been nstrstu
and then I went to speech alot too when I was in the hsblu
and then after the hsblu
and that was alot
I would get home
and I would just go to my bed and just sleep because they had you do alot so you can walk
and then we did alotof swimming
that is really goods
I dont know how su

and I make sure that I do that at home
and hoplu
I dont wanna go there right now until I dont know nflu
so
ohgoodness
well probably youknow I love my kzu
they are the joy of my life
my son
when I met my husband
this is a little bit too much
but Ill tell you anyways
when I met him he just got outof a relationship
and me and him were defu
and this lady said that she was prdjntu
and my husband I
this was new
so its like
and we just never left each others side
and the lady that he was in she got
after she had my son
because I say my son
she got really into drugs really bad
and so my husband and I took him when he was probably two months old
and hes always known me as mom
and he lived with us
and he didnt really see the other mom for awhile
and when he was seven I wanted to dpu
and it and then the girl wanna come back and make sure she was a mom
but she really wasnt
so we hadta go through all the to the course
and it was alotof cheers
and ill
and then we were able to dpu
and we had to go in front of the ddzu
and it was even my son was so happy
it was like the best day ever
and sometimes hes a little butthead
but I would never ever do it anything different ever becauseof its really good for us
so
okay so theres a kid again
hes playing soccer
and it went through a neighbors window
and its
oh it goes through the window
and it breaks a lamp
and the neighbor has the ball looking outside to see whats going on
and thats all I have
okay
so the mom told the son
and he was like
and so then the boy went outside
it was raining
and then it was really raining
and he had to turn around and go back to home and tell his mom
and she went ahead and gave him the nbrllu
and then he was able to go for a walk just fine
okay so
okay Im gonna say there this little girl was riding her bike
and her dog was with her
and they came across a cat
and the dog was trying to get the cat
and it was up in the tree
and shoe
and a maybe its a neighbor saw the cat in the tree
and he tried to put a ladder up so he could get the cat
and the ladder fell down
and he couldnt get the cat
so then the fire
a what are they called
firefighters can see it
so they came over to get everyone down from the tree and the cat
I guess that would be it
okay sounds good
so there was a guy that had a doctor
and her mother was not there any more
and he wanted her to have a new stepmom
so he married a lady that had two girls already
and then he died
and the e the stepmom was not nice
and she made Cinderella be the maid
she would have to make sure that she did the floors and made food and make sure that everything was clean
and the her spsstzu
I cant remember their names
they were not really nice to her either
so really all Cinderella had was the nmnlzu
they she had a r a horse a dog
and she had mice
and she would make clothes for the mice
and then there was a cat that was her t her the cat was the stepmom m
and he was not nice
so one day when

so he did a wanted to do a ball and to invite everyone in the kingdom
so at sndlzu
and when they got the invitation Cinderella was like
and her xxx all your chores
so she looked at a book how she wanted to get her dress
but her s otr her stpsistzu
so she can never get her dress done
so the mice saw that she would never be able to go because they were making her do so much
so they ssddu
why
there was ke some pearls and some ribbon that they took from them because they said they didnt want them
and they helped sue
so when she was everyone else was ready to go to the ball snlu
so she went to her room
and she saw the dress that the mice help
so she put it on and was running down the stairs
and her es her stpssu p
and they started to tear her dress apart
so she couldnt go to the ball
and she went to the grrdnu
and she was crying

so they she took a pknu
and then I think she took the mice and turn
and then the horse she turn
oh what do you call it

and then she made Cinderella a beautiful dress and glass slippers
and she told her everything will be okay until its midnight
and then everything will go back to how it was
so she went to the ball
and she met the prsu
and they were dancing the whole time
and her stepsisters were kindof jealous
and then allthesuhven
and it was rinu
and she was trying to leave
and she was going down the stairs
and she left one of her glass slippers
and the prince found it

and she got married
that was the end ohmygoodness
okay
well I would get some two sszu

and when it came out I would put jelly on one side
and then I would get a knife and do peanut butter on the other side
and then I would put them together
and then I would cut them in hpsu
is
but its not where I would like it
so soso

okay
okay so on the day of my stroke I had a pain in my stomach
so I it was really bad
so I went to the hsblu
and they said that it was
ohmygoodness
it was
what
I was having kznu
and so they gave me some medicines because I would have to pass them
and Im not really good with pills
but I went ahead and took them again
and so when I got home I took them
and my husband made sure the kids were okay getting outof school
and then he did dinner and all that why
and I think about it was eight oclock
I came to the lvru
and I was talking to my husband
only it felt like I was really drunk
and hes like
and I go
so I went back to the room and went back to bed
and around eleven I hadta go to the bathroom
and when I got up outof the bed I fell down
and I couldnt get up
and then I couldnt ke talk at all
I could hear my husband saying
and I couldnt say
and he knew something wasnt right
so he put me on the bed
and he called nineoneone
and he we live in a
sorry todays not good
we live in a our house is a split level
so they he went outside to get the mlntsu
and I wanted to change my pidezu
so I went to the closet
and I was trying to figure it to put something on
and I fell in the closet
so when my husband came in the room it
because he was like
and I was in the closet
it was kindof funny eventhough it wasnt
so they had to put me on the
so they helped me get out and put it me in the mlntsu
and my husband could not go with me right that time because the kids were at home
so he went and got a neighbor to set
and then his friend took him to the hsblu
so he was right behind me
and then when I got in the hsblu
and I couldnt talk to them and tell them hi or anything
and then my husband was there and his friend
and I think I was in the icu for about a week
and I was talking to my husband last night because we were watching a show about a person that had a stroke
and he was kinda crazy
and I was like
hes like
I was like
I think hes just mean to me
but I think for the because I still had the kidney stones that they were passing through me
and I dont remember a whole bunch
but my mom said this that I was yelling alot
and then after that they put me to ov another room for a week
and then after that I went to the therapy floor for about four weeks before I went home
sorry I think thats it
right thats right
well when I was in therapy I had alotof speech therapy and then pt and ot so I could because I was in a wheelchair for a while
even when I got home I was in my wheelchair for two months
so I had to give get up and outof the wheelchair
so I knew how to get in the bed and get out
I with my hand I did alotof stuff like combing my hair brushing my teeth trying to cook stuff sorry and walking
when I got home I then went to an outpatient therapy about three times a week and was probably about three hours
was the same thing only I was trying to walk better
and then with my hand doing more stuff around the house youknow like cooking because I hafta cook for my husband and the kids
so what I can do with boku
and we have alotof stairs in my house
so alotof going up and down
and then with the Cova
and then last week I went to a gym
and I have a friend that is a personal trainer
so last week I did alotof stuff with my upper body
and then today Im gonna go see her and work on my lower body because I want to run this year
thats my goal
so alotsof
right
okay I know I tote
see what else can I say
well youknow the one thing that has been awesome this last year was I couldnt drive after my stroke
and so it was nine months that I would hafta ask someone to help me to go somewhere
or I would have to get a jubu
and sometimes I would hafta go to Boise
and I would hafta get a jubu
and that would be fifty dollars one way
it was crazy
and my sister would help me out sometimes
and my mother inlaw would help me out and when my husband would too
but I really wanted to drive
and theres only one lady from Twin Falls that is like two hours away from me to Oregon kin s
shes the only lady that will help people that had strokes or brain ndiz
so I was on the list for three months
so when I was able to go to the class I had to do alotof mmbizu
and youknow alotof people that have strokes they can only see outof one eye
so I hadta make sure I could see just fine
I had do alotof tests
there was ke a big board
and it would have lights that would come up
and I would hafta smack them
and I had to be really fast
and when I was able to pass that then I had to go to drivers ed
and it was kinda weird
and then I hafta drive with my left hand
so I have a knob that I do on the stiriu
and then I drive with my left foot
so they put a oh its like a
oh how do I say it
they put a
so on your pedal they put a block in front of it
so I dont I cant have it go down
and then Im able they put another pedal over on my left foot
so I can drive with my left fktu
so it was kinda weird to figure that out when youve been on your right hand all the time
so it took me about two months after I was went to the class and everything
and then I had the doctor make sure that I was okay and I was able to drive
and I felt like I was ke sixteen again because I was like
and the only thing they my s or my doctor doesnt want me to go on the freeways in unless is
but I can get to everything on the back rows
it just takes me a little bit longer
but I can drive
so thats really cool
right
so there is a little boy that was playing with his stocker
and he wasnt paying attention
and he kicks it
and it goes through a window
and then the ball knocks over a lamp
and theres a neighbor
he gets the ball
and hes looking outside the window to figure out who kicked it at his house
right
okay so theres they
and his mom says
you might want to take a nbrlu
and the little boy is like
and he started to go to school
and its starting to rain a little bit
and then it really was raining
so he went back home and told his mom
and then he has his the mblu
and hes able to go out to he can o now go to school because hes not getting rain on him
okay
Im gonna say there was a little girl that was riding on her bike
and she had her dog with her
and a cat was by them
and a cat went up in the tree
and the dog was barking
and she couldnt get him
so there was a nice guy that came along
and he was trying to help them get the cat ts outof the tree
and he put had a ladder
and the dog pushed it down
so he was in the
ohmygoodness
he was in the kriu
and he couldnt get down
so then a the firefighters came to help them to get the ban
sorry
okay
so Cinderella had a dad when she was little
and I think her mom passed away
and he wanted her to have a mom
so he married a lady that had two daughters
and he got really sick
and he died later
and I think they were tinedzu
and the et the stepmom made her do all the chores
and she was beslu
and her the stkmmu
so Cinderella had alotof mnlzu
she had a horse and a dog and mice
and she would make little clothes for the mice
oh and I think there was m burrs
and she was always dedrinu
and there would be something better for her
and the king had a prince
and he wanna
so he wanted to have a ball
and he invited everyone in the kingdom
and when the stkmmu
shes like
and she had a dress that was her moms that she need
but the stepmom and her sksstzu
so she was never gonna be able to get the dress done
so the mice saw that they that skndrlrlu
so they snuck downstairs and looked at stuff that the stpsistzu
and they got a ribbon and some pearls
and then they went they were able to help with each other
and the birds make her dress ready
so when they were able to get ready for the ball the us the stepsisters and the stepmom said
and she went to her room
and allthesudden
so she hurry
and then the mom was like
she was talking to the stepsisters
and they were like
so they took it and ripped it
and then they went to the ball
and Cinderella went outside in the garden
and she was crying
and then her feru
and she told her what p what happened
so she made a coach outof a pmpnu
I think they she had three of the mice be horses the dog be the coachman and then the another coachman was the horse
and she was like
and shes like
so she made her a beautiful dress
and she had glass shoes and told her that she can do all this but when it is midnight it all goes away
so she went to the ball
and she met the prince
and they dntsu
and then all it allofsuhven
and she was trying to get away so she didnt have everything go away
and as she was running away one of her shoes came off of her
and then she was able to get home without the prince knowing that she was looked like she was before her fairy godmother helped her out
so the next day Cinderella was having such a good day
and then there was about another announcement that the girl that was dancing with the prince had a shoe
and whoever it fit that is who he was going to l was going to marry
and the stkmmu
and she kinda looked like the girl that was dancing with him
so she put her in her room and locked her in her room
and she had her key in her pocket
when the duke came and let everyone in trying up
and why
when the stepmom saw that she was ts coming down to try on the shoe she trip
and he was like
and shes like
and she put it on
and she was able to marry the prince
and they live happily ever after
the end
okay
so again I would take my bread and put it in the totstu
and then when it was done with the toaster I would put peanut butter on one side
and then I was
and then I would take the jelly and put it on the other side and spread it out
and then I would put them together
and then I would take a knife and cut it in half
and thats what you would do
its pretty good
I know I struggle when I get overly tired
I Im told that people wouldnt know I have trouble unless I
my hesitation to them Im told is sounds like Im thoughtful
they dont understand it
my hesitation is because Im struggling
yes
sure
I went to bed on a Monday night after work
and just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and
about one or two in the morning I hadta go to the
and I was struggling to get the covers off
I was laying on my left side
so I trying to get the covers off with the right
and I couldnt believe how heavy the covers were
and that was my first sign something was wrong
I at first I thought because I had the two cats
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something
but they I youknow the room was dark
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might
and finally they came off
and then I tried to take some steps
the bathroom was the next room over
and I was finding that I was exhausted
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed
I dont know why I didnt think to just get back into bed
but I just laid on the floor
I laid there for about thirty minutes
my Garmin told me what was going on the timeline
and so when I got back up I still didnt feel like I could
so I did and just crawled back into bed
and then about I was awake asleep back and forth
and I was trying to figure out
somethings wrong with me
but I dont know if this is major
and I was trying to decide
its probably something wrong with my brain or my heart
and I didnt want to go to the emergency room
and thered be nothing wrong
but I called a guy from work
I used my phone
and I thought I was dialing his work number
but I got his cellphone number
so I want to leave him a voicemail message
and I was surprised to hear him answer
and thats when he told me
so I worked for a very difficult company to work for
and I didnt want to tell them yet what was going on
so I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh
but at least they would be notified I wouldnt be in that day
and I said
and so he just chuckled and said
and then I called a friend and told him what was going on
and then between two of us we decided
well my idea
so a half hour later I called him
and I decided Im going to call my neighbor
take me to the hospital
so I did
and my neighbor next door came and got me
and we went to the hospital
I dont know why or how we went to the hospital that we did
it was a great one
weve got four hospitals to choose from
so I dont know why or remember why we went to that
but she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago
and she was struggling trying to figure out where the
and at that point I couldnt read
but I saw the red lettering
and I knew that must be emergency
and so I pointed to that
and then she didnt know what to do with me once
again she was someone with a brain injury
so she was having trouble thinking her way through this
and so here me I just had a stroke
and Im having to do the thinking
so when we pulled up under the awning there was a
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital
and I caught his eye
and he came out
and I told him
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke
and I told him
at this point I was not having trouble walking
but I was afraid I might
earlier in the day in wee hours I was having a real
but now I was okay with it
so he said
and he got a nurse
and she came out
and I told her the same thing
and then she went back and got a wheelchair
and they got me in
mhm I had alotof speech therapy
I went to two different organizations for therapy because
so I wanted more therapy than that
and so I went to both
so for maybe about I dont know six or eight months I got
each session is about an hour
I also did some physical therapy
but I didnt stick with it
and so I can still feel ke my right leg drag a little bit
and I also have trouble writing
so I have some occupational therapy I did aswell
and it helped a little bit but not alot
but the speech therapy
I found some therapists I just connected with better than
and the one I spent the most time with I really liked her
she was very good and very positive
and as she explained it something important to me
she said in the beginning she said
then after we work together awhile Ill test you again to gauge
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that
so when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was
I felt so stupid because I couldnt do them
but if Id have known earlier that thats what they were doing it
but youknow they didnt think to tell me that
but I did games on my phone
I went to a local college that had meetings on
and so the first hour everybodys in the same room
and then the second hour were split up into groups
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into
so you go into a group with about four or five other people who
I bought books grade school books for math and reading
and I did that on my own
and I did puzzle books
and then I went back to work
I went back to work very quickly
way before I really was able to do much
but I just thought
so I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke
there was something
oh I always liked to cook
but now I really kicked it up
I found about healthy eating
and Ive always liked junk food
and I decide to eat really healthy
I felt like that would help me recover
and so I got this
and learning to understand measurements again was difficult at
but I learned
and I still struggle with it sometimes
making conversions is not so easy for me
but I see the ingredient list
and then youve got ke a paragraph of everythings
so Ive learned to if its the first two things you do
and then maybe the next three things youve gotta do something else
then I color those other three with another color
that kind of thing
and so then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods
and that was motivating for me
and then I also I was working near a mall
and so at lunch time I would go walk every day
well the job that I had that was so stressful
about two years ago now they laid me off
and I was happy about that
I hated that place
I loved the work
but the people were just insane
and bullying people to get things done
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over
but I was afraid to look for another job because if the next
so I was really afraid to move
and theres not many jobs around here for that kind of work
so I felt really trapped
but I was looking
but it was just youknow there really wasnt alot to pick
and well anyway the day three months or so before
so I started collecting my information that I was gonna need
and I put my notes in a notebook
and I took them out to my car
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and
I didnt keep them at my desk
I took everything outof my office except for things that belonged
I saved off programs I had written everything
and so then when the boss and the hr guy came to my office and
I tried not to look so happy about it
but I was really happy
and then I was outof work for ten months
and it was okay because I had unemployment
I had money in savings
and I was doing alright with that
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job
and now I work from home fulltime for a company thats in
and so my boss thats
hes always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice
and I still do the same kind of work I useta do
but now its for nice people
okay
this boy is kicking a soccer ball
and he kicked it right into somebodys living room window
and it went in and knocked over the lamp
and the man saw the damage as it happened
he got up with the ball in his hand
and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball
the mom is trying to hand the son a umbrella
but he doesnt want it
and so she still holds onto it
so now the boy is walking
and its raining on him
and the rain is getting heavier
and he shows up in front of his mom all wet
and hes not happy about it
and shes not happy about it either
but now hes got the umbrella
and hes continuing on his walk now with the umbrella
the little girl wants her cat that climbed up in the tree
and so the man got up the tree to retrieve the cat
and the ladder fell out behind him
and the dog is barking at all the excitement
and the firemen are coming to rescue I assume the cat and the
and theres a bird on another branch thats singing
the Cinderellas dad met the woman with the two
and then the daughters were mistreating Cinderella
they are planning to go to the ball
and they took a necklace off of Cinderella
Cinderella was locked in a room
and some mice came and with a key and got her out
and then the fairy godmother provided a horse and a driver
and Cinderella danced at the ball with the prince
and then it was almost midnight
and Cinderella hadta leave
and as she left she was going down the stairs
and she dropped her slipper
and then think it was two men came to her house with the
and it fit Cinderellas foot
then they knew it was Cinderella was the one who had danced
and then Cinderella and the prince got
I would get two pieces of bread
and a jar of peanut butter
and a jar of
did you said just peanut butter
oh okay
and a jar of jelly
and a knife
and a spoon
and a plate
and a napkin
and then I would take the knife and prdu
and then I would take the spoon and spread a jelly on the other
and then you would put those pieces of bread together and put
pretty good
yes
no
I went to bed on a Monday night
I worked all day
and I went to sleep
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back
about one oclock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to
and thats typical for me
and I had trouble getting the covers off
I was laying on my left side
I remember that because I had right side weakness
and the blankets just felt really heavy
and so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket
as it was like they were full of bricks or something
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the
I was exhausted
and so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed
and I laid there for about a half an hour
and I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down
and then I got up and thought
but as soon as I stood up I realized
so I crawled back in bed
and about seven thirty or eight oclock Id decided to
I my boss was a creep
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible
and so but this guy was kindof the bosss pet
and so I thought
and when I used my cellphone
I had that guys cellphone number and desk number
but I thought sure I selected the desk number because I was
but I thought
well he answered the phone
and so it hadta be before eight oclock because I was
and I said to him
and he said
and I said
and I chose those words carefully
I didnt want them to know there was a health issue
but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why Im not
and I certainly needed to make that call
and so he took it as humorous
and I was fine with that
that was kindof why I said it the way I did
and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that
he said
and I said
and so he was real relieved to hear that
and so I felt bad when he said that
I was like
and anyway so I called either before him or
and I never call him
weve been going together for about six years
and I for me to call him is thats a big deal because
and but I called him that morning
and he picked up
and I told him I said
and he I think he suggested I go to the hospital or see a
or he might even try to help work it through and try to figure
finally I said
and if I dont then I think I said
I dont remember what I did
but there was some kind of a plan if I didnt he didnt hear
and so I think before I called him back I decided
and I didnt want to freak her out
so I didnt wanna say hospital or emergency
so I just said
and so she said
and I said
and so I called him and told him youknow I was gonna go to
so later he told me that he almost called an ambulance
but he hes the kind of person hes afraid to make a mistake
Im sure theres some psychology there to delve in
but I told him I said
maybe initially I might be not happy with you for making that
but later I would understand that you did it outof love
so its okay
so anyway so then my neighbor came over
and I wasnt dressed yet
and so I was in my bedroom getting dressed
and I dont remember taking a long time to get dressed or
I wasnt experiencing the exhaustion anymore
and but I noticed at one point she came around the corner
and so then but I finished getting dressed
and just I kindof planned out some things to do to
if I made sure Id let the dog out and let her back in
and I grabbed my purse and my phone
and kinda made a mental note
yes Ive got my health insurance card
Ive got money
got my drivers license
Im good to go
and then we went out the door and or I went out the
she said
because shes just next door
but I think she afraid for me to walk
so she was in my driveway
and Im coming out the door
and Ive got a deadbolt and a knob lock
and I the dog is in
and Im trying to lock the door and xxx the knob
I could feel it
and its right
but Im sitting here looking with my keys
and they werent fitting
so I was having trouble
I dont carry alotof keys on my ring
but I couldnt figure out which key went into the lock
so finally I thought
and we when we went down the road I dont remember who or
but I think I went to the best possible one
and when we got there it was like four of
we call this hospital row
so my street is always the first in the city to get paved
well maybe the governors and then mine
so then she didnt understand where to go exactly
she I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didnt
and I saw the red lettering
and I couldnt read it
that was so significant to me because I remember I could not
I knew what the word was
but I couldnt say it to save my life
but well I could say it
I just couldnt read it
and so I pointed
and I said
and so I wasnt reading it youknow
it was like
and so we got to the entrance
and there was ke I wanna say a canopy but not
and I caught the eye of a policeman that was sitting or
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the
and I waved at him and motioned for him to come
and he did
and I told him
and I dont know when I determined that was a possibility
dont even remember
but and I said
and I was walking fine
but I just never had a stroke before
so I didnt know if maybe Im walking fine now
and allofasudden I cant youknow
I didnt know
so I was afraid to walk
and so he said
and a nurse came out real fast
and she brought out
she came out first
and then I told the same thing to her
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair
I think it was just inside the door
then so she got me in the wheelchair
and we went in
and I remember looking at the people in the waiting room
it was pretty full
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of
and I almost wanted to say
but youknow just not appropriate to really say anything
I just felt bad
and so then the intake person wanted my health insurance
so I gave her that
and she asked me
and I remembered the Metformin
but I called it Glucophage
I think Glucophage is I think thats the name brand for it
but I couldnt think of Metformin
and there were alotof supplements I useta take and
but I couldnt remember the name of them for the life of me
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if
and but I just was just struggling
I couldnt remember the name of them
and I it surprised me that I couldnt remember them
and then I got put in a room right away and just waited
and that same nurse came back
and she asked me
and I said
but I didnt think a long time had passed
and so she was alittle irritated with that and went back and
and they were back there very quickly
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do
and they had one test where they were gonna need to put me
theyre trying to find the origin of the stroke
I think at this point they know what happened
they just cant figure out
and they never figured it out
but so they put me to sleep for that
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to
I dont like to be put under
I like to know whats going on
and then theyre gonna put this thing down my throat
and I know that there is the possibility
its so slim
but possibility that something could go wrong there
or would some permanent damage could happen
so I was pretty freaked out about it
but I thought I gotta submit to this
so they did that
and when they did either a ct scan or the mri
I dont remember which when they
Ive had those done before not on the brain though
and they told me it was really important that I that
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it
so Im not gonna flinch
and so anyway then began nine days of in hospital stay
okay
a speech therapist told me either that day or the next
and for a moment I thought
and then she explained what it was
I was like
and so while I was in the hospital she provided alotof
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next
and it was ke really important to me
I was just super motivated
and then when I was released it was gonna be a month
and so I contacted her again
and I said
and so she sent me alot
and she just like in the hospital she was willing to send
and I was so thankful for that
and so I just worked on it
and then and so Im not in the hospital
so I didnt give it to her to check it now
I just figured
and I got adult coloring books becauseof a high fine
and I went to a teacher supply store and got some kids
thats where I estimated my level was at the time
and so because when I looked at higher grades like
but third or fourth it was like
and so I did that
and I got puzzle books for kids to do
and so I did those
and I always did like to cook before
but now I had a special interest in cooking healthy food
and I want it to be food that tasted good
and so I got some healthy recipes
and worked on those
and I was surprised to see that I struggled with
like a jar of garlic
half a teaspoon is one clove
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that
I was like
and so I didnt know initially that I could use one teaspoon
so I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work
and so and I learned to highlight in the cookbook
everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would
and so I did really well with the cooking
and just as time went on it was no longer a struggle
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like
I never did figure it out
but I was like
but I went to therapy
and I went to two different therapists
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I
and so I thought
so both therapists would see me twice a week
and so and there was two different locations
and so I went to them
and it was exhausting
I went back to work at about seven eight seven weeks
and it took me eight weeks
but I took seven off
and so youknow I was leaving work to go to therapy
or I would go
no I didnt do it xxx
I would did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the
and my employer bless his heart said
and I thought
I cant I was exhausted as it was
and I was like
but I just agreed to it
I know he didnt have time to check up on me
so I said
so then I just did all this therapy
and my there was one therapist
well first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was
and I think Id been seeing her for maybe youknow two weeks to a
and when she was there one evening she recognized me
and she called me by name
and I just politely acknowledged her
but I had no clue who she was
and now Ive learned that since my stroke theres some
now if the person has something very different about them Ill
youknow somebodys got a huge nose or a big old wart at the
just something that would make me remember them then
but just yeah its very easy for me to forget who I just
and so I remember her pointing that out at the next
she says
and I said
and so but anyway she worked with me for maybe two
and then she moved
and then so another person took her place
and wasnt real crazy about that person
but and in hindsight she probably didnt do anything
it was just I was just struggling with my confidence
and it but then I went to another therapist
and that lady was young
and she was very upbeat and very positive and encouraging
and so that was helpful to me
and so we did alotof focusing on short term memory and
I did that with her
she taught me some card tricks to do that Ive since
like five and two
I dont remember what it was
but anyway so I was practicing with my cards on my
and she didnt give me homework
neither one of them did because I worked
and they felt like
and I was actually kindof relieved because I was just I
the fatigue was just crazy
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because I
and so think I just about covered it
something important that happened to me
my grandbabies
my daughter and I we struggled alot in her teen years
and she met this guy when she was thirteen or
and youknow when I first met him Im just seeing this skinny
and Im thinking
and well anyway they eventually got married
and then but she was determined she didnt want any
she was so sure she would screw them up
and its just too hard
and so me and my husband well just youknow well just see
and they did
they did alotof traveling and everything
and I had a s and I have a son too
but he didnt seem to have any interest in getting married or
and so I just thought
so I just worked in the church nursery and kinda helped
and then my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida
and by this time youknow I realized through some
and I was always super protective of my kids
and I realized he was just as protective of her if not
and so I thought
and so then I dont remember how long theyd been
maybe a year or so
and she came back to town
and a relative on his side had a baby
and she wanted to hold that baby
and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby
and she just whenever I took a picture of her with that baby
and I thought
and she told me
and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing
she lost two or three
and then when she had this one
and maybe about six months in Im in Indiana
and shes in Florida
and Im nesting
and then my house is reasonably clean anyway
but I cleaned my whole living room once
and I just said youknow it had been a recently
and so there wasnt alotof junk in there
but I started pulling items out and going through them
and I cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows
and just youknow every crevice I cleaned in that living room
and I asked her I said
and she said
and I said
but once I sltu
I dont remember exactly which room it was
it mightve been my bedroom
I dont remember
but anyway then when the baby was here he had some
I dont remember what it was
but it was they wanted him to be in the not
intensive care
they wanted him there NICU I guess
and so he was there for a few days
but my daughter called me
and she said told me what was going on
and I was she said
but I could tell her voice
she was scared
and I wasnt really worried so much for the baby because what she
but I was really frightened for her
just her mental her emotional being wellbeing
and after that phone call I hop on the airplane
I hadta be with her
I was compelled to be with her
and I show up in that hospital
and she was just shocked to see me
ke I was the last person in the world she expected to see
and I remember thinking
and so anyway I saw the baby
and couldnt touch him
and that was okay
but I took a couple of pictures of him
and then I came back home shortly after that
and later I learned that she thought I was coming to see the baby
and she was kinda mad because she wanted to decide when she
and she thought thats why I got on a plane like I did to try
and I just explained to her that I said
and I said
but I said
and I think she was taken back by that
and I said
and I said
and so anyway but that little guy hes so
and he as I listen to him and his language
it was really interesting
and hes almost four now
but when he was about two he loved dinosaurs
I think he still kinda likes them
but I kinda feel like hes maybe sorta outgrown them
and hes onto other things
but I was making him videos and because I didnt feel
but this little guy he doesnt know what normal sounds like
and so I made him these goofy little videos with these little
and they would get into trouble youknow
and I had a box of toys here for him
and so I had a dinosaur
Id wed call them saursq because thats why he called them
and I put a no a saur
and I put a saur
and it was just and so I would make sill
and I would tell him
and he thought those little stupid little videos
maybe two minutes long each
he thought those were hilarious
and he would watch them over and over again
youknow they just a hundred times youknow
and then his baby brother came along
and I think theres a two years difference
yeah two years
and so the baby hes just cute as he can be
and so hes right about almost two
and so much difference between the two and their personalities
and but the first one hes super smart
hes also very manipulative youknow
and so he works that cuteness angle youknow
and then the second one he was alot more agreeable
and he was plenty smart
but I could tell not to the level his brother is youknow
its like he didnt get stuff quite as quickly as like
you hadta work with him awhile
and but then hed get it
he was fine
I think he just likes to analyze maybe more youknow and just
so the second one just super long eyelashes
so any girl would love to have and just as cute as
and I went to go see them last Thanksgiving I think it
it was last Christmas
I went to go see them Christmas
and I facetime with them alot
and so the older one hes thrilled to see me
and he just runs to me and youknow says granny youknow and wants
but the baby eventhough hed seen my face alot on the screen
and he ofcourse Id seen him in person too but not real often
it took him a minute
and he had to watch his older brother
ke I guess its okay to go sit near her
it was like it seemed like at some point a light
and he was like
so then had both on my lap
and they just for about an hour or two I was enjoying
it was just it was just so cool
so I yeah I always heard how much fun grandbabies are
but ohmygosh instant celebrity is so much fun
so thats the probably about the best thing thats ever
okay
theres a boy outside
hes kicking a soccer ball up in the air
and the ball winds up inside of a shattering somebodys
and the ball lands inside this mans house
and this man is just sitting on a couch and was surprised to
and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over
and so the man picks up the ball and looks out the window
okay
theres a little boy
and mom is strongly advising him to take this umbrella
and he is not open to that advice
and so he leaves without it
and he waves goodbye to his mom
and shes still got that umbrella in hand and asking him to
but no hes good while he gets outside
and its raining hes noticing
and not only is it raining its becoming this
and hes walking through puddles
and hes trying to keep his head dry with just his hands
and he gets to the house
and he sees his mother with this I told you so attitude
and shes looking at him where he is drenched
and but the next scene is hes going on his way in the
but this time hes got the umbrella
and its open and is keeping him dry
okay
this little girl has a cat
and the cat is on a tree and the branch
and the little girl cant reach it
and the cat is just hanging out on that branch
so somebody apparently called the l fire department
and so these two firemen are coming towards the scene
and the little girl it looks like she had gotten there
and theres a dog at the tree trunk
and its barking up
theres a man up on the branch of the tree
and the dog is probably barking at him
and theres another tree
theres a bird
looks like its singing
and theres a ladder on the ground
possibly the ladder was used by the man
and he looks kindof not kindof scour he
and so its probably his ladder that fell
and so hes just kinda sitting there taking all that in
and so with the firemen on the way looks like its gonna
mkay
the evil stepmother and two stepsisters met the
and then later as the stepsisters are older
now theyre not little kids anymore

theres a ladder on the ground
and it was used to catch a cat
but it was on the ground
so I didnt
and I needed to take the dog
but he was couldnt get up because the dog was growling on him
so I got some firemen
and he got up there
and on his way to the ground he saw a wren
and that was it
okay
Cinderella went Cinderella was introduced by her two siksters
and they told him
but Cinderella had a fairy godmother who got her all dressed up and sent her to the ball
and at midnight she at midnight she hadta go
and she lost her slipper
and so everyone was wondering about the slipper
but she only had one
and then the count came and said he had the other slipper
and he took it from her
and it was her slipper
and so Cinderella and the prince lived p happily ever after
something like that
I get two pieces of bread
I put e jelly on one slice and peanut butter on the other
and I put it together and eat them
my speech is okay
but alotof times I know what it is but I cant say it
thats what it is
I know what it is
and until someone tells me what it is I just cant say it
I dont know why
but its the way it is now
yeah
well I got up in the morning
and right away I rolled over
she was by my side
and I told her I felt a little queasy
and she didnt say much about it
so then I went to the bathroom and I went to the bathroom and did my thing
and then right after I did my thing something happened in here
and I said
and thats the last thing I remember for weeks
well the last thing I knew before my stroke hit was
well after my stroke hit I woke up
and I was well I remember that is this was Amsterdam NewYork
so the next thing I know Im back in Wichita
and Im on a bed
my wifes there
and I slowly start talking to her
but I dont think I at the r first thing I n dont think I made much sense to her
but she was always there for me
so it youknow it was okay because I could tell her anything I wanted
shed listen
did whatever she could
and then after awhile two or three nurses would come in everyday
and they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back
and every day it was something different
and I would go down the hall
and they would do leg lifts trying to get me whatever
and I would do stairs
I remember that I did stairs
did alotof I dont know
then I dont know
there was always somebody there
there was always somebody doing something to me
alotof it I dont know anymore
but it was very for the first couple weeks I it was very extensive
well the best thing I can remember before my stroke was getting married ofcourse
and I was in the service at the time
we before my before I was a privacy officer I was also in the airforce for twenty two years
so other from that I think the thing that I do the most about in Helenikon Greece
I was very interested in basketball and baseball and especially football
had alotof good memories about football
yeah I was I Im not a blowing my own horn but after the season I was the best player defensively on the team
I had alotof interceptions
alotof things happened
but theres a alotof things
oh there theres so much I
infact youknow theres so many things good and bad that have happened to me
I cant do anything
infact theres alotof them I dont even remember anymore
theyre either trivial or whatever
but a thats the way it is
okay
there was a boy who kicked the ball
and the ball went into a glass window
and when he when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the stairs
and so she
and he told him he wasnt getting it back til the lamp was fixed
okay
first of all the boy did not want to take an umbrellbrella
he she
so she
so she
and he was all wet now
and so she
and she
and he went to school with it
okay
okay
first of all I see a little girl
and shes trying to get a cat
but her ladder broke
so she couldnt get it
so she went to her frather
and he had a real he had a dog
and the and had a dog
and he and up the tree trying to get him
and so because she couldnt get him
and she couldnt get the cat
she couldnt get the dog
she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal
okay
when the grandmother
and n Cinderella did all the work
and as kids got older there were more things for Cinderella to do that they wouldnt do
and finally they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala at the princes palace
and they told her she couldnt go because she wasnt invited
and only they went
so after they were gone the fairy godmother showed up and showed them how she could do it
and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into the carriage and the horse and all
and then Cinderella was given a fine dress to wear
and then when she got to the when she got to the ball the only thing the only thing when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but Cinderella
and they danced the night away
and then at twelve oclock she said she hadta go
and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground
so when she got home Cinderella was back on her in her shabby clothes and with the dogs and cats and everything
and then the shoe was supposed to be broken by the ugly mother
but they it wasnt
and so Cinderella put on the shoe
and it was an exact match of the other one
so she
and so her and the prince got married
and they lived happily ever after
you put on one once you put two slices of bread together
one with a peanut butter and one with jelly
and you get them together
you got a peanut butter jelly sandwich
oh its fair
its alot better than it useta be
I had my stroke three years ago
I dont remember it
I remember being at the restaurant
and I collapsed
thats basically my memory
I remember waking up a brief for a brief moment in the ambulance
I remember waking up a few times in the hospital but only brief little things until the second day
I just woke up and saw the ambulance and then blacked out again
Ive tried doing all the things Ive been told I could try to do fry
and theyve been from in the beginning it was just little things like trying to walk and trying to talk say things
something important that happened in my life
I graduated college
I became an officer in the Marine Corp in Vietnam because I was gonna get drafted
so I enlisted
I became a manager in a company for Austin Perino a restaurant company
and those are some of the things that happened in my life
the day I graduated college
I graduated Bradley University undergrad
and I got to walk out up to
we went by groups
ke the whole business group graduated together
they didnt say the individual peoples name
and I graduated business in business from Bradley
boy kicking a ball
it goes into it goes you see it going past the window and it through the window to the boy to the man Imean to the man whos sitting in the
and then he looks holding the ball he looks back up at the window at the boy

seems to be adequate
the eighty four incident last I remember is five days before that
lets see
it happened on a Thursday March the eighth of eight four
I remember we were at some friends house having supper the previous Saturday night
and I remember nothing after that until after outta icu and started remembering things slowly about three days after I was moved out moved outof icu
and the eight nineteen ninety
lets see the
I was crossing tenth street Indianapolis
and I remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk
crossing with the light and seeing getting up close in the quarter panel on the car going from west to east
and then I have the sensation being spun around
thats the last I remember thing from last thing I remember for probably I dont know twenty minutes or so
eighty four
okay
it was very that was really troubling because really troubling because didnt know where I was
and there were visitors in the hospital room in my hospital room
and these guys were saying the visit
I knew who they were knew these people
but theres alots lotsof them there
I didnt know where I was
there were lotsof there were several people visiting me
and there several of them asked
I thought was perfectly fine
and but what I didnt know was that the Id spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat in a coma
and it looked like I wasnt gonna come out anytime soon
they gave me a tracheotomy
and I and so the what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords changed my voice pretty radically where my wife had told me
she said that the said that you had the
so I said
so but that was extraordinarily troubling because I like I said didnt know where I was
my and people I c recognize its recognize saying
and it was a really troubling to me
really troubling
that was one of the first of my m first of my memories
well its what it ended up being was that the
in terms of my brain injury if you will certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling
and youknow just when I happen to get focus on something I didnt r particularly understand or approve of I get or it didnt show up
but it was xxx extraordinarily angry
and did never did lash did never did lash out
but just but real really angry
and I kept it all internal
it was very troubling really troubling for a n for quite a while
and I dont want you to ever to relate to that
I wouldnt wish that in I wouldnt wish that on anybody
the almost nine nineteen ninety was almost a what
again
thats always say
it was like just a rerun but not near not nearly as severe
but the eighty four incident was most interesting because an engineer for my the company that I was employed by
I was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning I had a wonderful career ahead of me
was gonna go far in the organization
and my one of my supervisors told me
and he wasnt supposed to do this
told me I was on the highpotnn list which meant again in my I was going far
my career was laid out in front of me
there was nothing stopping me
and then after the eighty four incident a personality change which I find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn
which I find out twenty years later is endemic
and the and I sound different
I was slower to comprehend things
but finally did after bit taking more time would comprehend things
and I couldnt do my engineering job to suit me
and I didnt tell anybody that
I didnt tell anybody that
tried I faked it
I faked it and spent my lunch hours for months I was by myself in a conference room relearning aspects of my job and not telling a not telling a soul because I just knew
this was before eighty eight
nineteen eight nineteen eighty four again
actually before the American of Disabilities Act
eighty eight
and I was on the accident in eighty four
I was on company business
and I knew I just knew that mtu
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired
I knew I was
had three kids a wife and spouse just a lovely woman there at home with the three kids
and I was the I was the income
and I couldnt stand the thought of being fired
and so like I say like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job
and it took me but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that I was no longer on the fast track
no longer
it took I wasnt it wasnt obvious at first
but I was no longer on the fast track
and the biggest most difficult part of that was the short term memory just short term memory difficulties
and so I ended up with a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my short term memory
so it was largely the aphasia and people seeing me differently at work
and ofcourse Im ofcourse I look on back look back on it a few years after that
and I did not deserve a to be on the fast track
I it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me
but it wasnt obvious to me
and that the writing everything down was the biggest assistant sis assistant assistance to me that helped me do my job
the basically it was being the
I call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident
thats how my life has been defined
and I its I just it that is what I call my defining moment the defining event
because Ive struggled with the aphasia obviously and memory issues ever since then
and Imean ke for example the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was outof engineering school at Purdue
had a job in Indianapolis
and so the as economic viability I paid rent to my folks lived in the lived in their house
and that winter my dad and I put the put an Oldmobile vl eight in a Chevrolet Vega a little small car
and it was quite an interesting project
and interestingly enough I can probably
the engine had a Rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties
and I could probably still today
now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven
I could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded
and but I ob but I could ask me what I had for supper last night
cant tell ya
so yup
short term memory issues
but then things from long ago and do m something long ago I can reconstruct like it was yesterday
no actually I was I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering
and I got outof school the spring of seventy six
had a job at a company named Shwitzer
theyre in Indianapolis
and Shwitzer no longer exists
but I was in engine cooling engineering at s with Shwitzer
and so I my customers were well call it for engine cooling fans for Shwitzer were Ford light truck Ford heavy truck
the Ford one of the small Ford Pats cars had a Cadillac excuseme Pontiac
and the Chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers
so I was already doing that kind of stuff as my as a job
but then my father found this article on engine conversion on the Chevrolet Vega
and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and I to build together that winter while I was working the automotive industrys field
and it xxx its kinda how I p kinda how I gravitated
well it was real it was a real sleeper
meaning that the hot car at the time was the Datsun two forty zl
it was a real it was the first of the Datsun zl cars
and I useta from a stoplight dust those guys off
and they couldnt they and those the other guys the drivers of Datsuns zl cars couldnt figure out how in the hell this Vega beat the shit outof them
it was alotof fun seeing looks in their faces as it in my rearview mirror
okay
this story is theres a young lad
looks like maybe teenager like a sixth grader or seventh grader kicking a soccer ball
and then and here it kick xxx puts the soccer ball through a houses window
and the soccer ball comes through the houses window and lands on a an adult male males lap in the house
and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the hole in the window and says trying to figure out whats going on
and done
looks like a young boy is leaving
and his were gonna say it was mother says
and he says
and then he leaves saying goodbye and everythings
and the mom holding the umbrella
and the young lad is out and about walking around
and it starts to rain
then it starts to rain heavier
and hes running
and he gets back to his mom so soaking wet
and hes not happy
nor neither is she happy
and then he goes out finally with a with an umbrella
and it looks like all is well
well the beginning it looks like a cat a pet cat had climbed up a tree
and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree
got stuck up in the tree
a little girl who was probably her owner rode over there on her tricycle and wants her cat down
and looks like an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is caught up there by this barking dog
also and now then theres also a bird on the other side of this tree singing away
and theres also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the cat and the male the male figure
theres thats a tree by the dog
okay
thankyou
Cinderella was her mother passed away
father remarried
and the ck theres the wicked stepmother had brought with her two rather mean spirited daughters
and they and in their home life the Cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which I always say by the stepdaughters
and so just worked very worked alot
and then in the kingdom the king had a unmarried son
and one of zdvzu
and the and so Cinderella with the help of the mice and there in the house they sewed up a really lovely gown for Cinderella to go to wear to this to wear to this dance wear to this ball
and the stepmother was intent on getting one of her daughters married off and then so would not allow Cinderella to go to the ball
her stepsisters went
and the and a carriage which looked like a pumpkin and then mice who ended up turned into horses
and I think that the horse from the house ended up as the driver of the pumpkin carriage
and she ended up going to the ball
also the prince danced the night away with Cinderella
and but the stipulation h from the Cinderellas lla ir fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight
so it was late
so she hurried outof there and left a glass slipper behind
and then after the and the after the ball was over the prince said there was only one person interested in
it was the gal that left the glass slipper behind
and so the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that lady who left the glass slipper behind
and it was the it was the one it was the it was the it was the lady whose foot would fit this small the small glass slipper
and the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper
Cinderellas foot would fit in the slipper
and so she was identified as the one that the prince wanted to marry
and so the so then the Cinderella married the prince
and they all lived happily and they lived happily ever after
oh prefer preferably on a wheat bread
you would use a knife and get the spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread
aha but then the on the other side of the other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly
and then so you take a spoon
not knife because you cut up you cut up the jelly and the jar
but you take your spoon and spoon out the grape jelly on the other piece of bread
use that use the knife to spread out spread it out
then put the two halves together
and you got the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich
speech is adequate
much improved
the halting of speech
the what happens is that the if I
for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics
it helps immensely if I think about it for about a about
le unless Ive seen it before the
and it is well Ill
I before my eighty four accident I
but its much more difficult and takes longer
and thats its like I say
been that way for thirty six years
the first one was a where I was tl boned at an
and ended up being a
I caught the old International Harvester
and had a shattered pelvis broken hip five broken ribs
did I say punctured lung
seventeen units of blood
three and a half weeks in a coma
and I in a coma for three and a half
hospital probably about two and a half months
and our third child was born three days after I was moved
and the second one was February of nineteen ninety where
there was a shared
and what I believe that I was
well I guess I dont know how long
but I recall walking across the street starting across
and then I had the n the sensation being spun around
and then later like I say I
I dont know
twenty minutes later
and I was in a great mood
I was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last
and this one is February nineteen
and I was in a really great
and then I say a brain injury because I
and I had that was that
it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down
finally went away
but I dont I recall maybe three four five days
something like that
but it lasted a significant amount of time
and the doctors could not tell me whether the
it was extraordinary painful
and I recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a
oh after three or four months when
oh okay
yeah wasnt just me being a big baby then right
and he chuckled
that thats kindof it
those are the two accidents in a at
West Tenth going into West Tenth and
okay
the after the first the eighty four incident
what had happened was that the eighty four laptops
and my boss at that time
Ill call it
I wont say leisure work play with
but learn how to use there at home
and ofcourse this is before the this is before the web
but I had been doing a Nastran which is Nasa structural
and but that was all that was all on IBM
and so here is just a simple little
oughta be able to know how to use that
and so they brought this my boss brought
and in those years there was a user manual that came
and so tried to use a computer an a
if youve ever read if youve ever read a Microsoft
and one of the one thing in
selectq
well had we never had any training in a in
and after several days of trying to figure out what
theres one feu
select meat
an aphasia
selectq meant what they meant by
I just could not
there was no way
Im extraordinary troubled really troubled by that
and so finally I called a coworker and said
and it described the tapping the cursor and moving the
thats what they meant by selectq
well hell that was never described in the manual at all
and that really that threw me for a loop
and so I became very questioning as to whether
and so finally the like I say the
the most basic of terms which the
or my no this is DOS not Microsoft
this is before Microsoft existed
this DOS manual it did not comprehend
but they did not
DOS manual did not describe that anywhere
and so the and so I went back to work and
and finally my after a couple years
and so wow that was a godsend
Imean just being able to write things down
so I carry a small
dont have with me right now
but I still I carry a small ke a small notecard
because that was writing when
holymackerel that was a
a that in particular
and also I ended up as a later as a
I developed tricks where I when I meet somebody new
use their name in any kindof verbal conversation with
use name use their name every time first or last name or
and then after the
and that has been a
for example I met a in our neighborhood met a
Im at home now
not down the farm
but met a fellow in the neighborhood
and I got his name
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told
and this morning I was I saw him out for a walk and
and then ne finally the name came to xxx
so but the discipline on recalling
yes
the I think I mentioned to you last week
y possibly I didnt
but the time Id spent some time as a at the rehab
and because I started oh
and it became rather troubling to me because having they just
so there was no therapy
you just youre able to survive
just a the thing youre able to just could just check
and because they just did not do therapy in those
and over the course the next twenty years wife and I
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five
thats what theyre telling people even fifteen years ago
and so I wanted to share that with
but it is takes a long time
and in oh
hey you dont stop recovering
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly
but you never stop recovering
I had a in the eight the eighty four
and it was just something that I accepted
and it was I could function without it
no big deal
but to stick a pin there and I dont wouldnt
no big deal
and then it was probably five years ago or twenty
I think it was yeah
I think it was oh
twenty five years after the eighty four incident I was in the
and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five
so what Im telling you actually is that the
but still you never stop recovering
you just dont stop recovering
you dont
yes its not rocket science
it time is the best
because you the feeling that the feeling that
and youll notice one day itll
it actually it will happen
you will experience it
actually no
it was it just Imean I was used to
but I dont know if I got used to
but like I say twenty five years later I just put on
and had none before
I dont know when it happened
have no idea
they will it will they will
the nerves will work again
they will actually
they will
when I first
when she and when I she and I first met
we went to we went to different highschools together
her from in near Washington Indiana in Washington
and myself from Plainfield
and it was before classes started at Purdue
August of nineteen seventy two
it was her first day on campus
my first day on campus
there was to be a dance at the dorm I
again each is our first day on campus
and so I was a little bit
which I will arrive but place a little bit early given
and so I ended up being just a little bit early for the
and my wife and her
guy girl girls go with body guards
I get that
I think its a
her and her wife and her and
and FirstnameSs wife has never met a
the shes the a true extrovert
matter of fact if you look up in Webster extrovert and it said
but anyway so she and a girlfriend that
and wellco I answered
and then we I just I hung around
I hung around her that
and thats where we started dating
and oh its we dated probably three
dated around about three years or so
and after about four years I figured out that wellco maybe
and I oughta get more serious about this
so it was just like I accused her of
thats where we first met is she picked me up at a
a young boy its look like a grade
is kicking it
and he it ends up going through a house window
a gentleman on a couch there in the window sitting
and then he gets the ball stands by the broken
in the beginning this mother it appears is had
and he says
he says no and says
and then leaves
and then in the middle it starts raining on him
and then rains heavier on him
and then he goes back home just
and then the last the end of the story was he learned his
the way this started was that the it looks like that
that the dog is barking at a dog is barking at this guy
and on the on a tree limb theres a cat
and it would appear that a cat climbed up the tree
the a little girls cat climbed up the tree and got stuck
they a male a man
theres also a firetruck and a fire engine
but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder
and it looks like the d the ladder is being used by
and the and a songbird is over on a
okay done
Cinderella was a daughter of a subject of
she her mother had passed her mother passed away
and her father remarried
and the stepmother had two daughters who
and as they after they were married the
and so Cinderella spent her time working cleaning
and in that in the kingdom there was
an advisor to the king suggested a ball be held
so the word was put out about the ball coming up
Cinderella was real happy about the ball
and so the farm animals
and then at the last minute the stepmother
and the and then also the

I can be confused a couple of times
sometimes I get the wrong words
it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say
sometimes its like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that Im trying to say
I do have problems on sometimes on the relationship between words
ke I know that Im wanna talk about a female relative
and I might say the wrong one
ke I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother
stuff like that
but I do have problems with numbers too
I know if Im talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number even how many times she hasta repell
so and just like that I said repealq insteadof repeatq
that thats some of the things that I have problems with
but otherthan that Imean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow slowly I usually can get through it
I dont know about it actually
I was sposta be having a physical therapy at home
and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kindof crazy she said
I wasnt making sense
and later that morning the physical therapist came
and he had all the he had all the equipment
and he took my he took my vitals
and he said that I should go to the emergency room
and thats that I remember
I didnt remember
so my brother and my wife took me to the emergency room
and luckily at the hospital that I went to has a good stroke thing
so they took me right in there
they took a even in the emergency room they had a ck
so thats about what I remember
well when I when they took me back to the hospital room there I saw like five different doctors
and they all did the same type of stuff
so I could probably youknow do the what a doctor would see to check about a stroke
but I remember I had some memory loss
ke by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit
and although Ive know my brothers wife for youknow thirty five forty years I could not remember her name
ke one I said
youknow stuff like that
but it by the time I was discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the knowing that I did have some ha
I didnt know at the time that it was aphasia
but I knew the symptoms that I o protest
but that thats all I remember
well with the I didnt have any physical problems with the streak
so when I did get well at the hospital they brought a speech therapist
they didnt know how long I would be at the hospital
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged
so I had hoped I knew I had problem speeching p
so I had asked if I could forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well
I was walking and all that
but they said that
so I had home speech therapy
it was very good
I the therapist was very good
and she was actually the one that
after they let me have I think its a Medicare type thing that you can use ten sessions
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the speech clinic at Buffalo State in New York
and alotof that was to get my memory back
alotof the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories
its hard to explain how it took
I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist
and after a couple of sessions with the neurologist he said youknow theres pretty much nothing else that he can do about it
but if I had any other problems youknow they could call me
one of the things they did probably one of those cognitive test
I did them
and I did okay I guess
probably sound like the stuff that they said that President Trump aced youknow
I had some problems with it
but I had brain damage
so I guess I had a reason
but thats about it
well probably one of the nicest things that I have recently was my daughter on this Mothers Day she stopped over with the card for my wife
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant
so on father
and then on Fathers Day we went over to her house with my oh son inlaws parents
and they did a review
so they had a car
and we saw that were going to have a grandson
so that is probably one of the youknow that period between there has been exciting for us
okay
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the window
the ball breaks the window and startles the man who grabs the ball and looks out the window to see whats going on
okay
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school
and he wanted to take or she wanted him to take an umbrella
but he did not do that
he started to walk back to school
and the rain started to come
so he ran back
and the mother was alittle angry because he had not pulled it or he had not put the umbrella with him
so he went back put the umbrella on and walked back to school
okay
well it looks like the cat was stuck in the tree
and the man had tried to get to
but he was not able to do that
so the firemen came to help him
I dont know if theyre there to get the cat or the or get the man
and the cat
okay the story starts when a woman
so rren Cinderella goes to the ep the man or the bad stepmother
and the two children the stepmothers daughters were bad
well they arent bad
but they make Cinderella do all of the work around the house
and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her
and apparently they can talk with her
and then at after awhile after several years it looks like after the Cinderella got alittle older there was a invitation to go to the ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for Cinderella
but then Cinderellas godfather
and a she turns the animals into people that work for the stage not the stage the coach
so they go to the ball where Cinderella meets the prince
but becauseof the godmother only could do the spell until midnight everything turned back to normal where her gown was gone
and the coach were m
and the animals were back
but then there was a man that worked for the princess
at the end they put the glass ip slipper on Cinderitta
and it fit r perfectly
and they found that was the woman that the prince was looking for
and they went happy they went happy to the end
and thats about it
oh okay
I would open up the bag of the bread
put a piece of slice of bread
I would push
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around
and then put the second top of the slice of bread
and I guess thats it
its pretty good
I have problems sometimes especially with numbers still
and sometimes I dont know if its because I dont hear the what Im saying correctly
its something like if I was to say
I might say my incomeq taxedq or my incomeq xa or Texas
youknow stuff like that where I kinda think twice of what the real or the word that I was trying to say
something like that
but other than that Im thinking I can talk pretty good as long as people give me time and slow down youknow because normally people speak faster than I can
so usually if Im in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I have some kind of problem speaking
so they understand
so it its pretty good
Imean ke I Ive gone to a bunch of doctors
and youknow they might repeat something for me or youknow ask what I had really said stuff like that youknow if I say it wrong
but otherthan that Im feeling okay speaking
oh I dont really too much about it
I knew that I had been having physical therapy because Id had a hip replacement the other hip replacement
so that morning my wife ders or she said that she understood or she knew that I was having some kind of problems speaking
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular session
and he also noticed that I was speaking differently
and he took my vitals and stuff like that
and he said that I should go to the emergency room
and after that were only maybe three miles from the hospital
so my brother came over and took my wife and him over there
and they sat there while I went through the emergency room and stuff like that
so it took about maybe three or four hours to have youknow go through
they did some task
and I think they have a good stroke thing
so they actually in the emergency room they had a ct scan were I could do
and then they found where I had a room
youknow and they had found that I had the stroke through the ct scan
and then by the time I went up to the room probably three or four other doctors came from youknow the hospital doctor neurologist
they actually had a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to stop the blood or anything
but it looks like after it the clot burst I was okay
and there was no xxx more bleeding
so that thats about what I remember
and I know when I saw the doctors at the room they all had the they have the same type of test that they do to see if it was really a stroke and what kind of damage it mightve been
and I knew that I had some memory loss
I recognized my brother and my wife
but my brothers wife came later because she was a nurse
and eventhough I know her for thirty five forty years I couldnt remember her name
so I did have some small or what do you call it short memory loss
but that thats about it
well at the hospital I stayed there for three days
and they did alot tests
they did mris echocardiograms to make sure youknow I didnt have it
they did things measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything
they did ke the last day that I was there they brought a speech therapist there because they didnt know how long I would be at the hospital
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my speech xxx affected
and it turned out that youknow the next day they s distarged
and I never saw her again
and becauseof my medical insurance when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before they could start my speech therapy
so I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house
and that was about it
Im trying to think
I know last session I think I talked about my daughter being pregnant nowadays
but if I was to think younger maybe a good time a thing that I liked was in my when I was twenty I was in the airforce
and I was stationed in Italy in the Alps
it was a radio station on top of a mountain actually
so having never learned how to play or how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn how to play or how to ski because our sight was on the top of the mountain
and they had a ski slopes there
so I had a good time in Germany
and the guy was a very old German guy that gave several of us skiing lesson
and after that because our location where I would work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didnt xxx
so I got to be pretty good at ski playing ski
I keep on saying playq playingq skiq
skiing is skiing
its not playing ski
and that was a good time
yeah
yeah Imean it was a very small village where we lived when we were at when we were off the sight
so there was alotof places to ski
and it was only like forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg
so we wed ski in alot a places around the Alps
okay
theres a boy in the yard playing with the o soccer ball
he kicks the ball
and it hits the window and breaks the window
the window gets broken and comes through into the house and knocks the lamb
and then the man goes over to the window to see who had broke the window
okay
the story starts with the mother telling the young boy that he should take a umbrella
but the child kinda waved it off saying that I dont need the umbrella
and he starts walking to school
and the rain starts to fall
it starts getting alot heavier
so he runs back to his f or not his office to his house
and he gets all wet
and his mother is alittle mad at him because he didnt bring the umbrella like he told him
so and then he went got the umbrella and started to walk back to school
okay
I think Im pretty good
you want me to tell you what I okay
what Im seeing at is a cat that is on top or on top of the tree
and the young girl wants to bring him down
and her father tried to go up the tree to get the cat out
and the dog is barking at the man
and apparently the father got stuck in the tree himself with
and after that two firemen came to bring him a t a ladder to probably take both the father and the cat outof the tree
no I think I have them as good as Ill be able to remember
okay
okay the story starts when a man brings his maybe his youngest her
they start when they were earlier
but after several years it turns out that Cinderella has made hasta do all of the work to take care of the family there
after awhile Cinderella starts to be friends with little critters
after awhile there comes an announcement that theres gonna be a ball at the princes castle
all the women the stepmother and the stepsisters were all dressed up for the ball
but Cinderella was not invited
so she started to look around or she was reading something
and she saw a godfather
and she had she made up a beautiful gown for Cinderella
and she turned the animals into a couch
so Cinderella and the prince had a beautiful time and were dancing
and then at the strike
and the coach turned in back into a pumpkin
so when she was leaving from the ball she left lost her glass slipper
after they found the glass slipper a man who worked for the king and the prince went around to try and to see if they could find who dropped the glass slipper
so they look
and none of the other woman at the house would fit with the slipper until they found Cindereed
so they went to the castle
and the prince and nder Cinderella got married and live happily vu
okay
I would get a couple slices of bread
the way I would usually do it would be spread the peanut butter on one slice
put a little bit of jam around it
and then put the top slice

most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well
but it seems like when I get in a situation where Im in a hurry is more when my speech or my I lose some of the words that I want
and I found that the going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know Im hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it
so thats what I do for youknow my help
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache
I normally in the morning go out get the paper have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work
and I went out and got the paper
I still had a splitting headache
I took a couple of aspirin came in and had a bowl of cereal for breakfast
and while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper
and I opened it up
and I could not read what was on the newspaper
I couldnt see a whole paragraph
and blocks of characters were missing altogether
so thats the first thing
so I just I set the paper aside and said
and got dressed and went to work
I droving
and what I was seeing on the highway again on the dashboard of the car I couldnt see all of the f s instrumentation on the dash
but I was able to drive fine and go to work
no problem at all there
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office
and I couldnt remember my login
didnt know how to log in
and I still had the headache
I talked to my boss and told her what was going on
she said
remember I took probably a half hour forty five minutes and still couldnt
so I said
I came home took acouple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day
that was on a Thursday
on Friday morning I got up
and I exercise on Friday Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning
so I went to exercise class
and I exercised
but when I was with the group I was talking
and what I was saying wasnt making sense to me
wasnt making sense to any of my friends
youknow they the words were correct
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words
they didnt fit whiff
and so I said
so I came back home and had breakfast when I got back from exercise
and then I normally would go to work
but I couldnt go to work
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to see my doctor
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a ar heart l the colo heart doctor
and she talked me instead to go to the emergency room
went to the emergency room
and they discovered that Id had a stroke
and so they put me in the hospital
and I was there three days
they were trying basically my heart was outof rhythm and was beating too fast and lotsof different things
so they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized
and then three more days basically discovering that Id had a stroke and aphasia
and then I was went home after the trying to think what day of the week it was
Wednesday I went home
and Thursday I drove back to the drove then because I could drive
I could everything do everything I needed to do except talk
so I went to make a appointment with the speech therapy at that point
and thats where it started
well it started out with something simple because basically I could look at anything and know what it was
but I couldnt pull the words out
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example
looking around the room
looking at each object in the room
naming it
trying to find the word and say the word out loud
youknow so thats where it first started
and it built from there
youknow just and some of the things we looked at just a few minutes ago youknow like with the pictures
youknow look at the picture
name the picture
and over time that gradually got better and better
but thats where I think the start with the therapy was
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out
and I found when writing I taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldnt spell properly anymore
and youknow that was something I had to work at
so I found that with my keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil
and with a notebood
it has a spellchecker and a ell
not Im not sure what youd call it necessarily
a checker
but it starts out youknow if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work
so that sometimes helped alot aswell writing
so Ive done alotof that
but its mainly working with seeing what seeing the words and then saying it out loud
thats done more I think better than anything else
and I worked hard at it for a long time
and then I took got kindof afterwards Ive kinda gotten alittle slow about it
or not slow but just havent done it as diligently as I used to
but for the first months after the stroke I was I worked hard at it
trying to pull those pictures back
and I found that you its like learning in school again grade school
you look at a word
and you learn that word
and oh thats that word
and it comes back and stays back
but with aphasia it doesnt stay there
its more like having an electronic dictionary that is occasionally gets scrambled
youknow its like
youknow that type of thing
so
happy
I think when my grandson was born
he was a joy to be around
and I got to spend alotof time with him when he was little and an infant
and watching him grow
and just that was special
hes ten now
and hes doesnt spend as much crime
and hes off doing other things
so
www
www
okay
boys out kicking a soccer ball
kicked it
got alittle too close
kicked it through the window
Im not sure whether thats his neighbor or his dad
but the window s
and a Id say his dad saw it
opened looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball
okay
in the beginning the mom sent little boy out to go to school
she
and he didnt want to take his umbrella
so he said
and he went out and he went out
and the rain started raining
and so he ran back to the house
and his mom was upset with him and for going out without the umbrella
and so he got a umbrella
and went back out with an umbrella the next time
alright
well it looks like the beginning the little girl was riding her bicycle or tricycle
and the dog or
and the dog chased the cat up the tree
and so she called back to her dad and said
and he got out a ladder
went out to climb up to get the cat down
and the ladder fell
and so they hadta call the fire to help him and the cat get down the tree
so thats pretty much the story
alright
Cinderella
well originally apparently her mother died
and her family were comfortably welloff
and that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters aswell that moved in with her
and they were not very friendly with her
and over time her father must be outof the picture for some reason because she the change of the Cinderella and the family changed dramatically
and she became more of a slave than a sister and the girl and the mother
and things got worse and worse as she got older
and one point in time she got acquainted
or how do I say it
she learned to live with the animals in the home in the family or in the house and outside the home aswell
and they became her friends instead of her stepsisters
and that developed over time
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his the princess
so he they planned on a ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the kingdom
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave not take sepmother
and Cinderella had a gown somewhere I think
from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but a trunk someplace
and she got it out
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters
and they ended up tearing it up
and she didnt have anything
and then the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to redo her dress
her stairy
there we go
I got a word
fairy godmother stepped in aswell
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into horses
and anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball
and stepmother the prince fell in love with Cinderella
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening
and they Cinderella hadta leave at midnight
and as she was leaving she left her one slipper got left behind
and they couldnt find her
they had to looked all over for Cinderella or for the girl
and they couldnt find her until they finally came to her home
and her stepmothers couldnt stepsisters couldnt fit the slipper
but Cinderella could
so thats where they ended it
oh thats easy
get two pieces of bread
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife
put the peanut butter on one side of the bread
jelly on the other
put them together
you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
well its doing fairly well except when I get in a hurry and try to describe something for someone
thats where I have more problem with speech than anything I think
is s describing something for somebody else to know what Im trying to talk about
especially FirstnameP my wife
seems like youknow Im think
and then youknow get the details
and then sometimes the details dont work well
so
all I remember about the stroke is the fact I woke up one morning with a splitting headache
and it was so bad that
I think its probably the worst headache I ever had
took a couple aspirin and went to outside and picked up the mail my not the mail but my newspaper
went back to have breakfast
and as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast I tried to read
and I could not make read the paper properly
the blocks of words were just that
they were blocks
and some of it they werent all together
it was like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words not the whole words
so I left the newspaper that morning and didnt read it and finished getting ready and went to work
and drove to work
and on the way to work I noticed that on the dashboard of the car again parts of that was I could see parts of the dashboard
and parts of it I couldnt see
I couldnt see all the words all that
but I was able to drive properly
and drove to work
got to work
and when I tried to got to work I tried to log into my computer
and I didnt know how
I think thats probably the best thing I can say about that
I didnt know how to log in
I didnt know my username
I didnt know my password
anything
and I just had a total blank with that
so I worked at it for a while and couldnt do anything
so I finally went to my boss and said
hey Ive got a problem
and I was asked
so I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again
and I couldnt make it
so I finally said
so I went home and went to bed
when I got home I took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and spent most of the day in bed
and I slept
and then when I got up in the afternoon I was able to read
I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that
but it still was problems
and I do Sudokus the puzzle
and I did that on the computer and was able to do it
it took much longer than normally to do it the puzzle
but I was able to complete that
and then had a normal evening and went to bed early
got up the next day and went to exercise class with a group that we meet at early in the mornings on Monday Wednesday and Friday
and this was a Friday morning that
Id gone to work on Thursday
couldnt work
so then Friday when I got up I went exercise with the group
and with the group we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up
and while were walking we talk and visit with eachother
and when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didnt make sense as far as the words that I was speaking
the words were correct
but they were not making sense as complete words
so I said knew there was something wrong
my friends knew there was something wrong
so I when I got through the exercise class
we spent an hour exercising together
I went home and had breakfast
and I told FirstnameP
I said
that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor
and she decided that ratherthan that wed take me to the emergency room
and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that Id had a stroke
and so I spent the next three days
well there was a problem with my heart
my heart was beating too fast and outof rhythm
and so they spent most of the time from the next two or three days correcting that issue
and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia
and theyd discovered that Id had a stroke and had aphasia
so thats pretty much where I am
well I tried to
no I really didnt youknow
I just thought I had a headache youknow
and talking with FirstnameP later she said on the Wednesday the day before I woke up with a headache she said
ke Wednesday night late Id l mentioned that I had a headache then
so I dont remember that at all that part of it
but its
so
yes
yes I do
yeah
well I think the best thing that happened was I got a great therapist
and she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction
its finding what needed to be done
and then working with me to get that
but basically I went therapy three times a week for several months
and then dropped down to a couple times a week and we til finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us were youknow Id already done all of them
and reached a point where they couldnt go any further with it
so yeah
but starting Ive got a squirrel running across my patio
nevermind
let go of that one
but part of it starting out was almost like we looked at the pictures with the that we saw with all the drawings of different things
I had the same thing sitting in a go in the room
sit in here
look around
and name each object I see in that room and say it out loud
youknow Id tell I can figure
youknow sometimes youknow you know all these words
you know all these items
but you dont aim not able to pull those words out
and the same thing driving down the street
you look at say a mailbox
say that word out loud
mailbox
post f youknow and hedges
whatever youknow whatever you see make a name
youknow bring a name for that item
and its something that Ive kept along with all the as long as Ive had a aphasia now
its youknow when I look at something Ill say the name of that item just to keep it going
and so thats one of the things I do all the time
I dont even think about it alotof the times
its just something automatic to do
okay
the boy was out playing in the yard kicking a soccer ball
he kicked the soccer ball alittle too hard in the wrong way
and it hit a window and broke
the window
and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor
Im not sure who this person is whether its his father or neighbor
and then the adult was watching outof the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broken his window
well at this point we dont see his face
and from I would say hes upset about it
but Im not sure how much
you cant see the expression on the face
alright
a mom and the boy
looks like hes got a backpack on going getting ready to go to school
but it must be raining outside or look like its raining
and she said
he said
so he l left home without the umbrella
and as he was walking to school it started raining
and he realized that was getting wet
so ran back
and his mom was upset about it
but he got his umbrella and went back out to and went back to school carrying his umbrella
alright
at the beginning it looks like the little girl was out in the yard on her tricycle
the dog was out in the yard
and the cat was out in the yard
dog chased the cat up the tree
and the little girl got upset then got her father to get the cat outof the tree
he brought the ladder out climbed the ladder and in the process knocked the ladder down and got stuck in the tree
and then they had to call the fire department to rescue the father and the cat
so and hopefully thats where everybody got back down on the ground after the from the ladder the firemen brought
okay
alright
Cinderella
story started out when she was a small young girl
and her apparently her mother died
and her father brought home a stepmother
and they met e when she was young
and met with her stepsisters aswell
and as they grew it looked like more and more she was acted as a servant rather than a child or a girl in the family as part of the family
she was more of a servant
and so they grew up that way
and then over time she got to know the animals in the home
horse and the dog and the mice
and had more of a friends with those than with the other two people
and then as she grew the family or the king in that ighbor neighborhood city whatever had a son that was grown same time
and he decided the son needed to meet a girl his age and possibly
dont know what the situation was there
but anyway he decided to create a ball to bring all of the eligible girls in the kingdom and meet them and decide who might be his girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it
and so they sent that invitation out
the stepmother saw it and planned on taking his
Cinderella wanted to go aswell
so she with the help of the animals made a build a dress for her a gown and showed it to her stepmother and the daught or the sisters
and they ended up in damaged it tore it
so she couldnt wear it
and somehow she got her godmother found out about it and helped her get another dress and changed and set the animals up as a coach and horses and took her to the ball
and while she was at the ball she met the princess
prince liked her and spent most of the time with her
the other people were the girls were jealous
but they danced and got along well
but she had to leave at midnight
she was running out
she lost her one of her slippers as they were leaving
it was too late
so he sent people out looking for slipper to match the girl
and eventually they found it at their home
the stepmothers stepsisters didnt werent able to fit it
the mother tried to break the glass slipper
and they recovered it
and they got the princess or to the Cinderella
she was able to wear it
and she showed them also the other one that she had
so she had those to prove that she was the person that actually had the slipper
and then got together with the prince again and lived happily ever after
thats it

peanut butter little coat and everything
and the jelly I had always on the other side
and
and thats it
I can say what I want to
it is just very halting
and I cant find the words all the time
I think it happened at night when I was asleep
it was at breakfast time
and I couldnt say what I wanted to
the words wouldnt come
I went to a rehab facility for one week
and there was a speech therapist there
and she did little kinds of tests
then I came home
and I had a speech therapist for once a week
and she is almost done
and now I am doing Arc Zoom kind of events
and I try to do two or three a week
I dont know how to tell a story
I cant I dont snory
I dont cant think of a story
there was a man
and we play pickleball together
and he died on the court two days ago
yes it was a shock
and I was upset about it
the boy is kicking a ball
and the ball hits a window and breaks it
and it comes in and surprises the man in the chair
the ball came into the room and knocked over the lamp
and the man stands up from the chair and looks out the window where the ball came from
oh okay
I think that the mother is trying to give the umbrella to the boy
but the boy says no
and he doesnt want the umbrella
and then he goes along
and allofasudden he gets rained on
and then he goes back
and he is wet
and he tells his mother that he is unhappy and wet
and she gives him the umbrella
and he goes back out
and has the umbrella to protect him from the rain
I think that the man tried to climb up in the tree to get the cat
but the ladder fell down
and he was not able to get down
and the dog is barking
and the firemen are coming to get the man down and to take the kitty outof the tree
alright
the book begins when the father comes home
and he introduces his daughter to the new stepmother and the two stepsisters
then it goes on and shows that they do not take very good care of her
the father died
and the stepmother and her daughters were not nice to Cinderella
she had to take care of the horses in the stable and was not being treated very well
then there came an announcement that the kingdom was going to have a ball
and that Cinderella wanted to go
and the mice helped her make a pretty dress
but the bad stepsisters tore the dress apart and the necklace that she was going to wear
and they locked her in her room
but the mice came and helped her and get outof the room
and she had a fairy godmother
and the fairy godmother made a beautiful white dress and a pumpkin and turned into a beautiful coach
and the mice were beautiful horses
and the carriage took her to the ball
and she had a dance with the prince
and they were very happy
she was very worried about the time
and the clock ruck
and she had to hurry away down the stairs
and in the process she lost one of her glass slippers
and the pumpkin no carriage turned back into a pumpkin and the mice back the horses back into mice
and then they made an announcement in the kingdom that they were going to look for the lady who had the foot that would fit in it
and then the stepmother and the stepdaughters tried
and Cinderella came out
and the glass slipper fit her foot perfectly
and then she married the prince
and they lived happily ever after
I would have two pieces of bread
and on one I would spread the jam
and on the other I would spread the peanut butter
then I would put them together into a sandwich
I think it is pretty good
I think I do very well
I had my stroke at night probably when I was sleeping
I think I became aware of my stroke at the breakfast table
my husband asked me some questions
and I couldnt answer him right
I went to a rehab center for one week
and then I had a speech therapist
and I am almost done with her
I think my last meeting will be next week with her
I am trying to be a person who uses Arc which is a Aphasia Recovery Connection
and they have conversation segments
and I generally sign up for those
thats kindof one thing I do to help me
a story about me
I having trouble making a story
the I Im not sure how to make a story
okay
I can tell you about our trip to China
it was a land and tour sea tour trip
we took an airplane from Singapore
and we flew to other hotels
the airplane flew to Tibet
and we got to see many beautiful temples
and the people were walking around the temple
and it was very beautiful
and I enjoyed going inside the temple
they had a very big Buddha there who was made all of gold
and it was an immense amount of gold
the people burned oil in the temple
and we had to inhale the smoke
the visiting the temple was very beautiful
we saw the people doing exercises
or not exercises
they were praying
and they prayed by moving their bodies up and down
so I enjoyed watching them
then we walked along the street
and we went to various vendors
and we purchased a silver Buddha and a singing bowl
and that was rary
then we went to eyenother
and it was so tall
the height of the place was very tall fourteen thousand feet
and I had altitude sickness
and I had to have oxygen
and the ee doctor gave me oxygen at night and the next day
so I was glad to leave Tibet after that time
then I took a boat on the Yangtzi river
and it was very beautiful
the boat stopped at different cities along the way
and we saw many bridges that went across the river
and I thought that it was interesting
it looks like a young boy is practicing his kicking
and he is kicking the soccer ball
and the soccer ball hits a window
and it is broken
and he knocks over a lamp and startles the man who is sitting in the chair
and the man in the chair gets up
and he picks up the ball
and he looks out the window at the boy maybe wondering where the soccer ball came from
the mother is trying to get the young boy to accept the umbrella when hes going to go out
but the young boy says no
he doesnt need the umbrella
and he will do without it
but he gets out
and he finds that it is raining on him
and he gets very wet and decides that is not a good thing
so he comes back
and he talks to his mother
and he is very unhappy because he is very wet
so the mother gives him an umbrella
and he goes back out into the rain
but now he has the umbrella to protect him
and he can walk in the rain just fine
a picture of a man who went up the tree to rescue the kitty
and in the process he got stuck up on the tree
and they had to call the fire department to get him down and to rescue him
and the girl is crying about the kitty
and the dog is barking
it seems asthough the ladder fell out away from the man
and thats how he got stuck in the tree
the story of Cinderella begins when
and he is introducing Cinderella to his
they are introduced
and the life goes on
and the father passes away
and the stepmother and the stepdaughters are very mean to Cinderella
they treat her very badly and have her cleaning out the fireplaces which is how she got her name Cinderella
and so she also has to clean out the stables
but along this time comes a announcement from the castle
and the manager speaks an announcement that there is going to be a great ball because they want the prince to find a consort or a wife
so the princess so Cinderella makes her a dress
she finds a book and makes a pretty dress with bows and sashes
and it is very pretty pink and white
but the sepsisters
and they hurt the dress
they tore off the sashes and the bows
and the stepmother looked on and allowed this to happen
so then they went off
and they were going to the ball
but the princesses no the magic lady came along
and she was a good fairy
and she made a beautiful dress for Cinderella
and she made the pumpkin turn into a beautiful coach and the dog into a concert some kind of person to help with the coat
and then the mice were turned into magical horses
so then Cinderella went off to the ball
and she had a wonderful time
and the prince thought she was very beautiful and had nice dances with her
and the stepmother and stepsisters were jealous
and so they were whispering and talking
and the princess no Cinderella went outside into the garden
and she noticed that the time was getting close to midnight
and she knew that she had to hurry back because everything would turn back at midnight into its natural form
so she quick got into the carriage and went home
and she just about made it
and allofasudden the pumpkin returned its way
and they the pumpkin returned to its natural form
and the mice turned into horses
and the and so then they man in the castle made an announcement because she left a glass slipper on the stairway when she ran away
and they were going to try and find the person who fit the glass slipper
so the manager person came around
and they locked Cinderella the stepmother and stepsisters locked Cinderella in the room
but she had the help of the mice
and they helped slip the key out
and she was able to come out
and she fit the glass slipper exactly perfect
and so then the Cinderella and the prince got together
and they got married and lived happily ever after
I would have two pieces of bread
and on one of them I would spread the jam
and on the other piece I would spread the peanut butter
then I would put the two pieces the bread together

I had a stroke
and the questions
it just happened
well in the well first of all Im working
and allofasudden I had
I couldnt open the door
so I did
and shaky I guess
and I sat down
and itll go away
and I couldnt speak
and I didnt know whats going on
and then on the ground
and obviously something is wrong
bumpy ride with the hospital
and then I
and then its fuzzy
but I still remember the brain is like
after the hospital or the er
and then outpatient I guess
asleeping
and youknow maybe a months ago
and the brain is
I didnt understand but I didnt notice
and I think a way people dont know
and that is a sign of fragile okay
so eight years Im learning still
but I think Im very I wanna know more
alot
questions with the doctors
I have vertigo and dizziness
no actually seven years no problem
so it happens
and apparently a rupture
and Im exercising with the lawnmower
and very hot
and I had a I could tell its
what to call it
I Im really struggle
its the timeline
its two timelines
and I know something is up
and then maybe five minutes its gone
and I still have not recovered
and its May
but I think there is progress or
okay
well Scale
and garden
the Ipod
this conversations
the yoga
science
so
now I tend to be switch it up youknow
brandnew
Im still struggling on
I dont wanna learn with my stroke I guess
I like tactical
ke the garden is physical
and I like that
the news I could care less
because its no description
and I tend to be distant
I dont want it
I dont need it
youknow lets say yesterday people know
howabout a year ago or a month ago
people forget too
so
Obamacare youknow
yeah I guess so
thankyou
okay
important
you mean a stroke or
okay I guess get involved
and I struggled what to do with myself
I got girls
so well FirstnameM is now in college
so I visit her
but obviously its less
FirstnameE is still a junior
so I move on and focus on FirstnameE with
she is very good
and she is methodical and just precise just like my dad
he useta be in the military
youknow
now I realize I had a stroke and that is not related youknow with dad
I hafta finesse or
and
and I Im not like that because I hafta be
the repeat the question
and I didnt realize
and now I Im getting involved
and its really
FirstnameP works now
and Im retired or homemaker
so the switch is like
yeah
no
the boy is playing soccer
and but a window is breaking
and dad noticed with the stku
and looking out with the boy
youknow whats the deal
""
okay mother and the boy gets the umbrella
and the boy take it
with the umbrella
and its raining with the boy
and the puddles and everything
and the mom said youknow
and the boy gets
and he is happy now
wow

yeah
what to begin
there is a firestation
the man is up with the tree and cant get up
and the dog is barking
and the cat too
he is rskjuu
and the woman
yeah but
okay
oh
okay
okay
""
okay
well theres a fairy tale I guess
and it happens with Cinderella
and begin orphan I guess
and theres a story with the
ohman
wow whispering
the
its tough
what to begin
I dont know
and how to the particulars I dont know
okay
and the ir fairy godmother watching out with Cinderella
happy
and the mother is not so keen on that
the girls
and so Cinderella is an orphan
so she does simple things like breakfast or
whats the word
I Im strslu
doing the dishes and all that
theres a slipper
and whats the particulars I dont know
and the a ball I guess
and she
the ball is Cinderella
and she goes
and she is beautiful with Cinderella no the
whats the word
her great
oh okay
well she is married now
and the end
the husband and wife and p happy ever after
okay bread and peanut butter and jelly
and then thats all
oh okay
much better
for what
anything
well I learned alot
and I did alot coins stock the restaurant talking about it
and like the restaurant typically Ill explain alot
and everybody understands me
so thats refreshing youknow
you mean years ago
well I remember LexusOfTowson
and I had a stroke
and I didnt know about it
somethings hpinu
and I says
and then I blacked out
and on the ground now
and the supervisor
the ambulance
and I can remember the hospital or the emergency room
and I couldnt speak
and I was really I dont I didnt know whats going on
and then I blacked out
confused
I remember hearing mom asking alotof questions
and Im silent
Im in the hospital
and also members
and a different room now
they my bed youknow
and I can remember
and then my work
his boss he comes
and I remember people came like
and praying
so yeah I Imean I Ive alotof things
and it I guess repairing
so tell me what kinds of things have you done since your stroke to try to get better
and lots to things to do
with and in retrospect
youknow its xxx ke I didnt know whats going on
and youknow whats yesq and noq
and I said youknow I didnt get it
and then yesq
and so its ke okay
a boy playing
and then middle school youknow n kindergarten
and Ive
the garden is two years
and Im doing exercise conversation
I like that because I can talk
and one to one
now
or I dont care
alotof times I do
and I respond
and all of it helps healing
understand
okay
sure lets see
that is complex
and I will I Ill tell you
FirstnameM my girl she was I think ten
FirstnameM
and FirstnameE is eight
and the difference is very its like
and I was
whats the term
Im healing
so FirstnameE realize
and she my wife she is also doing that
so there is a shift
okay
the opposite FirstnameE is clueless now
and he
and she says not knowing anything
and so in retrospect it made sense because
Im doing nothing
and FirstnameE is doing something
now I realize now like three years and I says
so I did whats they call it talking
and
somebody else FirstnameE and FirstnameP that was working
so atleast I did more
and then I also did the restaurant with Starbucks or ic EllicottCity
and I did more now
so Im happy
and Im sad because I missed it
and I always told you youknow
but you can
yeah okay
oh by the way FirstnameE is at school almost
college
yeah its exciting
I think
yeah yup
yeah still
and she is good
the boy is playing soccer
he breaks the window and his house
and the window is shattered
and he is not happy his dad
and then he sees oh his boy
so he is gonna talk to the boy
okay
her mom is doing the umbrella
and his boy
then he
but the boy forgot now
and its raining
and the boy is sad because its really pouring
now the boy is back
and she is not happy the mom
and then the boy not forget his umbrella
and its still pouring
kinda close

yes
okay
oh yeah
JohnsHopkins and the test
and I still not right
but Im close
and just move on
okay

okay so Cinderella is an orphan
and shes happy
sad but in good spirits
the girl is her orphanage
and whats the word
his
not the real mom but
she has got girls three girls
and there is a ball
and everything the girls
so then that is good
the Cinderella is not coming
she is working cleaning up all that
then she

so second time
and also nice with the rin Cinderella and the man the prince

being here
it seems better until the first almost a first year was I said it happened me on August of a year ago
and after having been in the hospital for two weeks then I was at home by myself
and until I got into a group of people from people who were hlu
so
not weeks pntsu
from g from August until I think it was April in this
and then that was the end of my it was being ht
what would it be
Apriata v I didnt hafta pay for them
and there were two women
if it was three s
and either on
and alotof language of eating
and so then that they felt that was fidu
and then I to inch s
youknow it was only three s
and I loved it
and so they peu
and
and she felt that I was not she felt that I because of my age I guess I think that was the reason that I should stndu
and had I been in the country I would have been fine
but in the city like this it is
my mother
and so I arranged to have I sold it
so within actually two weeks two ksu
and youknow it was unhappy for me but thats the way it goes
yeah
yes
it was about April it was August
and it was
I had it on Rehoboth and the each on the side
and I had driven because Im always driving back and there a great deal
and I came home in the afternoon and at which for about this period
and went I came in my ri
I live by I live myself
then I
well wait a minute
I feel Im gonna
no okay I
anyway I went in to lie down
and there was something
and I think I must have put a phone on and called one of my daughters
I have two daughters
and I was lying there and then allofasudden they came in with a daughter of one of them
and they said
they came outside with the peep s
I said
and because Im lying there and
and finally I said
so I went just they just took me like I was to gsu
and when I arrived
because I have been there many times for other things
and when I went there they put me immediately into the hbskulu
and to they thought that Id had a stroke which I guess thats what they accomplished
and so they were they gave me a nice room by myself
and I guess I just sortof didnt say much
and I was there for two weeks
and they had many people coming in h wdnksu
what Im trying to think
pilu
some of them I knew and some I did not
and so the and they walked me alot
they told me to they helped me walking
and I was doing things like that
and I said
and I didnt
and then I said
ksdu
so thats what they did of two weeks
and thats when they did alotof what applications right in there
and what was going to happen
and so thats the way it is
and fortunately nothing else came a great bfrntsu
but it was I assume it was something in my
what alotof people that I talk here in this group of people I will say
and theyve told me about many have told me about it
so I feel the same
and I have walked for years I have the every morning at six oclock get the NewYorkTimes to me at the door
and so then they continue do that now
but now Im having a problem because youknow I can I Im I can part s
have you heard of something like that
where I hafta go back and sometimes it stop and sometimes it doesnt
do you understand me
yeah
no I tried very difficult
but Ive gone my daughter one daughter is in furious s
and Ive in January I went with her to NewYork for almost a week
and met alotof people many people Ive known
and so
and we wed go out in the evening and that was fine but not particularly on my own
really
Imean its fine when I read it or when I speak people but its difficult for me to do that speaking someone else
and I Im more just silent about doing that
well Ive have two I had two il children
it was youknow I it was a long time long ago since I during the war
and then I was married then
and then oh I was I guess it was after it was in nineteen sixty five when I was still living with my husband and the children
and I was starting to read I had something to do to read
and I guess Id we had thingy things were I was unhappy
and I so I my two daughters were both going
one was finished college and the other was in the college in Washington college
and so I think I decided that I would live by mslvu
and it that year was pretty year
and I have never regretted
I have always spread them
Imean Ive had friends of men and women
but I really hadnt wanted to go to get desire again
I havent
I feel pretty much about that for myself yes
oh its a child thats taking a
and shes crasho
so what would she doing next
theyre nuts
""
yes well theres the young child with the umbrella
and the child apparently was saying
ke a or her
and shes shaving s
mhm
uhhuh
well apparently the its her dog
and that
this must be
and helped to get it
and
and then
and what hes
maybe hell jump off
he should
feel like Im drowning
I was in Mexico a great deal many times
looks like I would be down there with him
but what theyre doing or what they
and he was holding on this to hold
what is she doing
but the money s
could you tell me
of what dear
yes ofcourse
well she was wanting the group or certainly dealing with some good and not so good
and she was looking happiness for a man to take her happy forever
and it
other people are not theyre parents because shes doing that thats happening
and then he she is in the end had a very in happy place
the whole thing
jelly sandwich
you got a couple of pieces with probably
trying to think what I have at home
ke usually with tuck s
and take your pntu
and
right
and with the raisins in it make it much more xxx interesting
and then you can probably take another pu
and
www
surely
speaking to people I think better
many people have told me that
but its still I dont know why I have sometimes when Im with a group of when Im with a group of people its very difficult for me because of my
the ear
so then I cant
I tried it
and with five
and I paid for that
and I couldnt I pick up
he gave me a I would it
so I paid for the five hundred dollars instead of three thousand or whatever it was
I gave it up
and so
youknow because its
yes
if Im with a whole group of people
oh I would
yes
I had I guess it was I mem it was just two
and I was driving from down on the beach
and I drove home
and Id got in the my in my house then I went in my bed
and I knew there was something wrong with me
and I dont know why but I must have put the phone and called my either one of my girls
and they came immediately with their father
and they immediately curd
I said
Imean I was awake
I said
and finally they said
the youknow what it is the bango and the whole thing
I cant make it better
so immediately we got to the cemetary
and they immediately they put me up in the
and they found
and when I spoke with the people
a long I was there for two
and when I said
so finally I did but I was youknow uncertain the way they treated me
and then I had quite a few doctors that up time to find out
I dont think I brought it with me
they told me that it was because I guess it was
I Im sorry I didnt bring
I usually bring it with me to tell me what happened to me
because it was with
first of all I was ninety
that probably does
yes
for a year I went to a
it was through for that didnt pay me for this
I would go for
but it thats when I stopped and I came over here
so
from then Im trying to think
well my daughters ofcourse l help a great deal
Imean theyre fairly good for me
but and I had good friends
but at some of my age were getting to live
die at thats
and yeah
and but we have alotof personally Id go when my

oh in my life

mhm
a knife
and the
and
fine
it varies
by that time I get not sloppy
not sloppy but Im tired
and that determines how I do
oh yes
well I went back to school
I was a teacher twenty five years
two in Pennsylvania and twenty three in Baltimore
I went back to school to become a counselor an elementary school counselor
and that day I went to
Tuesdays we have the team
and I have I figured
no
I everything was in order
and everything was in their place
and I went to a meeting Monday as
and I came home and I thought
well I know what was on CreaturesGreatandSmall
so I had
you press a button and it zooms back
and I recorded it
and so I watched it
and I says
by that time I settled down
and I says
and I slept
and I got up this morning and I took a shower
and I got partially dressed because I couldnt find my slacks
and so I came down and I turned the
what is it called
I want some spritz in my hair
and so I turned it on and I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee
and when I got the milk out and poured it in when I closed the door I says
and with that
I fell on the floor
and this side
and I thought
and I kept thinking my hand
I flopped it down
and so I was in the kitchen
and by the time
I thought
I went out and I thought
and by the time I got to the television I have a halfway to go yet
and FirstnameT was the principal and she came
and in the meantime my telephone rang three four times
and I could not get it
and if I woulda
because I didnt know it might affected my speech
and I was youknow it
anyhow she said
and I thought
and she called the police and the ambulance
and they came back
and he broke the door down
well not the broke it
he like
it sounds like theyre gonna
slit
but on this one he hadta it needed repaired
so and thats
I was in FranklinSquare hospital
and at that time December seventh ninety nineteen ninety three they didnt have anything to do
they put me in a room and they said
I was hungry the next day and the next day
and they kept saying
and he she anyhow they finally got me to eat
but my sister and brother came down
and I says
I couldnt believe that they came for me
because I didnt think I youknow
well I went to Sinai because they did not have a program for people with strokes
so I went to Sinai
you know where Sinai is
and they have a really good program
and boy they didnt mess around
and I liked it there
and but the speech pathologist was a man
and he said that he is after awhile he said he was going to leave
he and his wife and I think they had two children
he was going to Texas
and he brought me
and he said
and I did that
and then I was there I didnt get outof Sinai until I think the fourth of January
well I was there until the twentieth I think
and then I went to Sinai
so and then I had FirstnameJ was my caretaker because I live by myself
and she was okay very good Imean but she gets tired too youknow of doing the same thing
and then she while I was in Sinai I got a woman came
and she was you were making sure that anything she was recruiting people with strokes or brain damage because of a car accident
and he
and maybe Im not quite sure whether she told me or my sister FirstnameM
but so the Return program I started in May the beginning of May
and I had FirstnameS
and she only she worked all around the clock
she couldnt take ke a half day
and so I got FirstnameC
and she could work half days
and but I got
and I kept thinking
and anyhow Im wavering
that is not the reason you asked the question
well the FirstnameJ said
and I slept for around the clock
and I got up and the headache was gone
but FirstnameSu is a good friend of mine
and she called the doctor
and the doctor said
and he did
and when I saw it was the bleeder
and I he said Doctor FirstnameLastnameD said
and I said
and I had I Im a well a school teacher
and ten questions were a second grader
and I couldnt answer seven of them
and now when I went back to that I answered three
and I thought
so I kept on going to the Return program
and May June July and the beginning of August FirstnameC was in the hospital
she fell down a flight of steps
and she was pregnant
and she was so upset youknow
and I said
because they hafta call somebody to youknow take care of me
and I says
and when I was sitting there I thought
I couldnt get up
I couldnt get up
and I called FirstnameR the next door neighbor
she came over
and she says
she pulled me up
and she says
youknow she didnt
ke call FirstnameSu
and I called her and I was back in the hospital
and because when I had the stroke they gave me Ecotrin three times a day
when I had that c my second stroke they said
and I thought
and I say that to myself but they decided that it would be good to a Coumadin
and I got very depressed when at
I was not depressed the first stroke
it hit me the third stroke
I thought
youknow I never know whats gonna happen
and I just really depressed
sothat they got to take Zoloft
and I took it and I thought
and so when I left the hospital I ate my cereal every morning and I had diarrhea every day
and after I thought
and he said
so I got to take Crestor
no Crestor is that
Effexor
and Ive been on that ever since because Ive tried to take it off
and you hafta do it by half a month and then
and by the time I get finished everything bothers me I get really upset
and I started to cry
and youknow I think its better to be on the Effexor
well one of the things Ive never been outof the Pittsburgh
Ive been to Pittsburgh at that time when I was about fourteen
I went to Pittsburgh once
my mother and sister FirstnameK the older one
and but it when I was about fourteen in the summer
FirstnameMi is my good friend in high school and her aunt were going to NewYork because of their aunt
there is a problem with her
and I think that shes becoming senile or whatever but somebody hasta see what youknow is going on
and so I kept asking my mother and asking her
and she kept saying
and I says
and youknow she decided
so we went to NewYork
and Ive forgotten the name of the town
it starts with a gl
a little town
and anyhow we went to see her
and one of the things that happened
oh the she was upset with FirstnameMi and I
we both had periods
and our the aunt told us youknow how roll it up and all that
and we rolled it up and we went off to ConeyIsland
and we got back everything would be fine
and the aunt was mad
mad as heck
what happened was he
and the dog knew
and he
it was all over the house
and she cleaned it up instead of waiting until we cleaned it up
and she was upset
and I rightly so
but we didnt know that the dog would do that
but and then at the thing that
we went to not a Broadway play but RadioCityHall
and we saw EricMarie
starts with an rl
is it could you spell that
no
its long longer
but he wrote the book and they made it into a play movie
and we got to see that
and it was and then I love to travel on trains
and we went to that way and then we come back
and that was the most exciting thing
Im sorry the last one is
no I just wanted it you repeat the last one
and no
the little boy or no middle ten years old
and kicking the ball
and he thinks
and
and I Im not quite sure
the mother tells him
and he looks and he goes
and its raining
well the
and apparently
and
and then I guess somebody called the
maybe his wife or whatever called the fire trucks sothat
because I think the little dog
well out west they have a storms
and I think in Texas a couple months ago
and the little girl was on the shore
and no more
it swept in and he
and the rescuers came
and he she
oh yeah
the names I cant remember
well Cinderella is working for them
and them is I think the mother and the two little girls at the beginning
and then they grow up and shes still working Cinderella
and so there is
Cinderella is all the animals sortof alike
and except the one that
she has it in her hand at
I dont know what kind of animal it is
but that but only the one that is growling youknow
but otherwise and then they look she he
no here I go again

doe
I found out that I did the first the beginning of it was I did about almost three years of speech therapy
and then
and so for alot of years I didnt do anything
I did go into I didnt wanna sit at home so I did I cant sit at home so I went into a place real close to where I live
and I pulled in parked there and went in there

like at a opening baseball game or something
I can now since I tdu
people not people that have known me but just people that see me when I bought something at store
they say

October twenty six nineteen ninety nine
I remember falling off the chair and nder n wondering what happened to me
and I couldnt get up

and it wasnt until the afternoon that I called FirstnameA
but I couldnt say anything
I said
and she said
and thats when she called the ambulance
well we had one month in HeathSouth
speech therapy some physical therapy occupational therapy
and then after one month I had continued the speech therapy about
and then she said
so I went home
and I lived by my by myself
but I the friend keep took pity me on me and she said
and she been doing for nine years now
and reading is m continued all the time
and all of its better
I can read the paper and the books and

a year ago in a few months
she had a brain tumor
she was only fifty five
and she had agn I she had a diagnose it the doctor diagnosed it one year before
and he said
and so she did
she had therapy and no chemotherapy and radiation therapy and nothing helped
but just like TedKennedy
she did the same thing
yeah yes
okay
the kid was playing with a soccer ball
and he all the sudden he hit it over he hit it into the window
and he broke the window
and the man inside he was wondering what happened
and he looked out with the window and saw nothing
okay
Johnny was going to school and he the it looked like rain
and his mother said
he said
and he started out and he started to rain
and then rain harder
and then so he came home soaking wet
and then the mother gave him the umbrella and he felt better
well I think its the beginning was the cat kmu
and like cats do he sit down
anyway the girl was who was the cats mistress said
she was crying and
and so the her father said
I Ill get the cat down
and he climbed up and he couldnt get it
he was helpless up there
and the dog was barking at everybody
and so the firemen came with a ladder
and hopefully they got the cat down
mhm
well this girl is caught in a thunderstorm a wash which is running very hard with flood water
and the fellow in the life jacket was the policeman fireman
he came
and hes got a belt he hes got going to give it or get it around her and he will save her

well Cinderella is was a maid I think for the family that had two ugly daughters
and they were envy envious of her for her beauty
then the
lets see
the in the castle they were giving a dance
and the ugly daughters were invited
but Cinderella was not as she was a lowly person
and so they go to the dance and Cinderella was home
and her fairy godmother came to her and said
and she said
and so she had her beautiful gown made up for her
and it fit just right
and the shoes fit right
and the carriage was just right
and she went to the dance
and she met the handsome princess
and he danced with her and he was spitten
and but the twelve oclock all bets were off
the she hadta go home
and the something turned out into a punkin
I dont know
and so she went home
and the next day the princes man came in or came to the house and he wanted to know whom who wore the slipper
and the two ugly girls they had big feet
they didnt fit
and so she
and it fit
and he said
and he
and they lived happily after ever after

there once was a girl named Cinderella
she lived in a house that was occupied by a mother who was mean and two sisters
they werent sisters but
and they were mean too
yeah
and one day she saw her stepmother going away and sh wishing the girls goodbye who werent her sisters
and she wondered
but she found a dress
and she put it on
oh and then she went to the ball
and she met a nice looking man
and she was
and then she tripped and
and she lost the shoe
and there she was
and
and she let her in
and once in awhile
no
the man came around looking for the girl that had her shoe
and she
Cinderella did a nice thing and put it on
and she went away happily ever after
well
and
and
and
there we are
okay
now
okay
I think its pretty awful then
Imean it useta be pretty good but now I have trouble doing some of this
about what
speech
I dont like it very much
I just dont
I just dont like it very well
thats all
I was at the hospital having another thing
and all I remember youknow the doctor said
and that was the end of that
I just dont remember then
thats all gone
at the very at the hospital I could say
I thought it was pretty good but I cant I couldnt have I could not I couldnt see
and I couldnt move my arms or legs or any of that shit there
and I didnt like that shit at all
so thats what it is
its obviously its better than it was but its
I wished it were better than it is thats all
yeah
oh well we started with the Adler program
and that was lovely
I was there I kmu
and I went to then we went back we then we went for Tucson
and weve been going since then
so its pretty much the same idea
yeah
yeah
I know
its a very good place
I know
that was of the bunch thats the best of the bunch
okay
meaning
so but I hadta I would have I had several quite a few of students for me
and there are things there were different things I hadta do make sure it was working out
and the best I can say of all of this is one of my one of my students is now with the Navy at its the npfolsu
and hes doing very well
and hes got his license again which is really great
so Im very happy about that
I had one two three four five
I had five students who went on to be fltu
which is very good
Im very happy about that
okay
didnt we through this
okay
okay
well
and thats it
okay
and his parent his mother is saying
and the kids
ah
ohboy
okay
well it starts this girl has a cat
and the cat is in their tree
and shes waiting for the cat but
and then shes going and
but then hes in the tree himself
thats not a very good place
meanwhile
and through all of that theres a bird going
and thats it
excuse me
here well a minute about placement of tissue
okay well theres
as this
the man is trying to get the woman from the fdu
in the fdu
its the
oy
the man is working to get the from the for getting from the girl from
theres a is flood
alotof flooding of water there
and
thats all
yeah
no but youknow some of it yeah
okay
so Cinderella is about this girl who
she was very nice she was very pretty but her she had sisters who were kindof not very good
and then as Cinderella was working she hadta go places or she hadta work she work while the girl while her stepsisters s would do what they were doing anything
but Cinderella hadta do these
she had do alot of the work in the house
and the girls she
anyway as theyre going along

yes
""
pstu
and sandwich
okay
pinu
and
xxx oh that what that was a tindu
it depends on what Im talking about
if its pretty typical
telling a story
Ill put it that way
if I told you something about what happened it becomes I
and people will say
ke even my mom will be like
so you know what I mean
my words
yes
mhm
and it alotof times I cant come up with the words either
but what Ive learned quickly to do is how to define what the word is which then becomes part of telling a story in order to point out what the word is
you mean ke once Id been in the hospital
I can
well yeah I can before they took me
okay
basically what happened like two or three months in advance I couldnt organize
I was running a business at a church bookstore
and it was close to Christmas so theres more stuff
and trying to figure out even how to
and at one point when I realized
and I couldnt figure out how to do it
and things looked a different size
so I couldnt tell what fit
and it turns out I also
I remember specifically too
Id ordered fifteen hundred dollars worth of books
Christmas time
and then so Ive got the receipt
and I couldnt get anything put together
ke I didnt know where to
Im pretty focused
couldnt figure that out
and then I saw another receipt because I got ordered like seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books
and I remember looking at it going
and then I just was like
and in addition to that I was going to school
so youknow all together
well at school I was Id been in digital arts classes
so I was in a Flash class where making movement
and it was the same kind of thing where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things
but our final project
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing that wed done right before that it took I put it in like seven or eight different programs
so now I look back
so to
mhm
and then the day that I went into the hospital it was the first part of January
and I was at work
and things had been being weird
and a girl was there
and its like I was like I was
Im like
my mom picks me up
well actually drive
and I took a rest during that time
but I found out later that I wasnt even speaking well
that then I go to the emergency room
it took them eight or nine hours to see me
yeah
and I didnt know that until later that
they were just like
because they were nice
I remember that part
and then I did get unconscious
my mom tells me that they put me
and so I still dont have I dont even go like
nothing like that
and the way they discovered I had encephalitis and this unusual one herpes encephalitis
the neurologist was saying
and
so they gave me the medicine right away instead of waiting for the test results three or four days later
and thats when I see its kindof
thats what even the neurologist has said
so thats my story
so they say
mhm
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year
and youknow it was tough to figure out how to walk
its not that it was where I couldnt walk
its that I couldnt
I couldnt both ke if there was a radio or a tv on I couldnt pay attention to what you
I couldnt figure out how to cook
youknow things like that are still complicate
no theyre complex but theyre not as complicated
Ive just learned how to
and
you mean ke learning words again
well I definitely
I wrote alot
Imean I wrote pages and pages
just in general I wrote a letter to PimaCollege because of something that had happened the semester before
and I took three or four months to write it
I didnt want anyone to help me
so and that was cool that Im
youknow I look back Im ke really glad I was the person that I was to not give up
and so I also went to exercise
mom took me to her exercise class
and they knew my mom well so I didnt feel uncomfortable not being able to do much
little things like that
I did lots of little things
okay now like what
oh okay
Im like
yeah Ill tell you a recent one because that might be alittle more difficult
I can tell you the past because Ive told alotof stories from the past
so Im doing it deliberately for the current
and its sad
my grandson just passed away a week ago
hes twenty
and he passed away from cancer
and he was sick for a year and a half
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer
so he was sick before
now lets see how I can
I shouldnt try to think
okay
so what happened is when he graduated from highschool he lived outside of Tucson close to Phoenix
and so he was going to join the Marines
but I said
because it had been tough in his family life
so I found a way to get him to move in with me
we didnt have alotof money to make it happen
so I found a way to get him here
and after hed been here a few months kept saying
they finally found out what it was
so it was just a tough approach
and so they his parents finally moved him back in
and its just been a tough path
Ive learned how not to talk much
so I havent been able to participate in us in language at all just in touchyfeely stuff
but Ive stayed up there when he was in the hospital
well a week before he passed away my man and I went up there for a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool
we got to spend time there
and then the following
and we went up there for a day
we were right there when he passed along with other people and stuff
so it was very sad
and it was a good process too in the final moments
thats my story
oh yeah
okay these things are pretty easy for me
so theyre
this guy here
is that okay to say it that way
okay
okay
the fire department guys are showing up to help someone
I dont know
because
okay
and then
thats what I got
mhm
okay
www
there was a girl who had a family
but two of the girls werent her real sisters because her dad had married a woman with these two girls
and they were pretty rotten
and I can see some pictures with some animals
and I dont know what that meant
and
okay just a minute whispers
oh and I think they wanted to go to a like a party
and the girls wanted to go
oh it had something to do with the prince meeting the prince
the girls wanted to go
for some reason Cinderella also wanted to go
and she was able to because a fairy came along and helped her get dressed and get there
so then she gets there whispers
and then something happens at midnight
so she cant get home because what she rode in becomes a pumpkin again
and she loses a shoe
and then once shes home like the next day the prince comes with the shoe
hes looking for the person it fits
and its not her stepsisters or her fake sisters whatever theyre called
but her foot fits in it because her foots little and so is the shoe
and so they officially fall in love and get ready to get married
I know these days how to say it
okay
first of all
gotta find where it is
then look for the peanut butter
so is it in this cupboard
then get them both out
then get a knife a
put the bread on the plate

well my wife says sometimes when I get alittle upset I talk too loud
but
so youknow
yes it was in March of two thousand and seven I guess three years ago
I was at the breakfast table
and
and I said
and I called my wife
and she said
so they immediately took me to the RestinGeneral Hospital enrolled me and
Im thinking about the tia
I went in to have hip joint replacement surgery
and I was a healthy
I just had
so I went to have that replaced
and the following the surgery went fine
following morning they got me up for the first time to walk
and when I got up I collapsed suddenly
and they did the usual mris and the cat
and they would ask me the battery of questions
and I had difficulties knowing when I was born what year I was born etcetera
I had
never did
smack by the time I
I could listen to the news and understand what I was hearing
but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do
so I tried to cope with it by asking my wife
and I started trying to work one line at a time in one column
that was difficult
but when I felt I could repeat that and say it then I would try to get
and it was difficult
but
and after several days I got to where I could maybe read and comprehend a short paragraph
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was
and I said
so I got downstairs sat down at my computer and I hadta call my wife
she showed me
and it came up
and I said
and I said
and I got something in front of me
I said
and said
but it took me awhile to get that
and I had jumbled
and I even saved it because it was very jumbled
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after it was very jumbled
and so thats when I heard about the StrokeComebackCenter from the traveling nurse that came by to attend me
and she said
and I said
and so I came here and was starting on a once a week schedule
and I felt it was a very good experience because I started making progress
and what I l Ive always said about with FirstnameM and the center as a general is they seem to have a very good way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge but not over not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it
so if it was
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and
and this sorta
so it was a
and then she said FirstnameM said
so I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students
and after
I decided I would start to write a maybe a little journal of my experiences from the day as I recalled it from the day I had my first stroke and to the recovery period
and I ended up doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester
and I ended up labelling it as Firstnames aphasia journal
and I would write a little section each week
and then she would kindof react respond back to me
but I would build on it and finally ended that up
and she turned it in as her theme her project for the me for the semester
and hadta give a presentation on this interaction
so all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this
but I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again
and thats when xxx sent me in and dgmostu
but they went ahead and sent me to JohnHopkins StrokeRehabilitationCenter
and I became a patient there subject and worked with them
and they diagnosed that I had a previously undisclosed flap on my heart
but that is probably why I caught the clot
and xxx
but thats yeah I participated in that
and part of my therapy building along was after going through writing my weekly Firstnames journal I met with a couple of retired army officers who contacted me that said they were the US DepartmentofAgriculture was wanting to write a history of nutrition research that had been performed by the military after the DepartmentofAgriculture became involved
and they said
I said
and he said
and so I started another project to still working on it writing a history of nutrition research performed by the military from the seventeen thirties to the present day
youknow and I and Im youknow Im still working at that
and I continue to come here to the Center once or twice a week and because I have a buddy
name is FirstnameK
and she was had a stroke not too long before I did
and we were here in the first class together
and shes about forty I think
but we kindof were buddies
so it
I would think its
okay
""
surely
I will use one that I actually used in my penpal stories
one of the things that came was I was a farm boy growing up in Missouri
and I had a grandmother which I thought very much of
and she had was a single lady by this time
her husband had passed away
my grandfather passed away
but I was out getting starting in college or no
and dad decided that I should maybe buy a or Id decided I wanted to buy a Hereford heifer to start a
I had my Fourh FFA activities
I told my grandma about it
and she said
to keep the weeds down out on her place
so I went together and dad and I
and we purchased two heifers Susie and Stella
well I took Susie
and we stayed on at my dads place
and Stella was at my grandmas place
the but on one occasion we brought them back home in the winter time
we bring them all back to the barn to where the youknow to get them off the pastures were already gone up and to give them hay
well I was going out one day down to bring try to get the cattle to come up including Susie and Stella to get them up to the barn
and they were running around
and I got aggravated xxx I decided Id throw a rock at one of them to get them to go back
well I ended up
and I picked up this boulder and gave it a heave
unfortunately it ran headlong
knocked the thing flat on its
so I was scared as the dickens
I ran up to dad
dad came down the barn immediately and got his old dull pocket knife out
thought maybe hed be able to figured it was probably dying but atleast wanted to preserve the meat to let it bleed it out
well the
Stella blared and belted
and so it wasnt dead it was just knocked out
so that taught me a lesson not to be throwing rocks and
Stella became fine xxx
but that I used that as part of a short story about a little writing a
well this young boy is playing soccer
and hes just kicked the ball up in the air and uhoh
it just hit the window in the house and I guess broke in the window
it not only went th
and then dad is picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window and figured out trying to find out where did that come from
sure
well the sighs
lets see
the young boy is with a mother
mothers got an umbrella
hes seemingly reaching for the umbrella
the next panel looks like mothers trying to encourage the boy to take the umbrella and go outside
but the boy apparently decided to go outside without the umbrella
and now its raining
and now its starting to pour down rain
and hes running back to the house
and now his heads all wet
and his mother looks sortof upset
and he goes back outside but now hes using the hes wearing the umbrella
well I think we had a problem where occurred where a cat decided to crawl up into the tree and go out on small limb on the outside
it looks like the yeah young girl got upset and had called her dad probably to maybe try to get the cat down
shed been
dad had apparently gotten a ladder and had started up the tree and got up there but for some reason it looks like the ladder has fallen down
the dog is now upset and barking
dads stuck in the tree
and the cats still there
well there seems to be a bird chirping for one unknown reason but enough that somebody decided to call the fire department
and the fire department with two men are carrying a ladder apparently there to try to rescue to get the man down and possibly get the cat outof the tree
think that found all of the characters that were in the
""
okay
look through it
www
okay
story is about Cinderella who was a younger sister of with two older sisters I believe
and she seemed to be the prettier of the three
and her mother was a little bit of a domineering lady
and they were all excited becau
well the older sisters were getting themselves well dressed and
well at first it was sure whether younger sister Cinderella was gonna get to go to her nu
but there were some animals around
and
but anyhow they all finally got dressed mother and the three daughters
and they went to
and there was a handsome prince probably with the son of the whoever was a main character or the
and there was a number
and apparently Cinderella may have got to dance with one of the young men
but somewhere in the process she lost a slipper
after the ball when theyd all gotten home I think she must have noticed that she was missing her slipper
and much to her surprise PrinceCharming came riding up to the house in his carriage and was looking for who does the slipper belong to which one of the ladies
and probably they must have tried it on
and the two older sisters their slipper was too small to fit on the feet of them
so he then PrinceCharming tried it on Cinderella
and it ips the shoe fit perfectly on the slipper s
and so Cinderella then got to go back with PrinceCharming and go back to another ball or something
that seems to be what
theres animals in this watching the process but I dont know how they were exactly were involved in the story
but thats what I remember I think of that story
okay
well if we were making thinking of the process of the last class I had with FirstnameM in which we were trying to hafta work out steps to do things you needta stop and think about it
well the first thing you hafta go
and if we were having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would hafta go in the into the refrigerator and pull out the peanut butter and the bar
I would get out a plate
put my bread on the plate
and I would go to the get a knife outof the drawer
and I would use a knife to spread first the peanut butter on one side of the bread
then I would use the knife to spread the jelly on the bread
and I would close put the other piece of bread on the join it with the others
now Ive got myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
and I can take it to the table and eat it

youknow it really doesnt count very much

I was thought I was clear but I wasnt
I was bla
well thats mortifying to think about
that I wasnt clear
but I guess I wasnt
I dont know if I was or if I wasnt
I think the only thing to describe me is a little bit
and its been
five years
mhm
I think thats alotof time
I will talk about the third grade
the third grade I was very interesting that you wouldnt think that this would work
we moved to Seaford
we did not move to Seaford yet
we were in Richmond
Richmond first and then Seaford
and in Richmond the school that we were in was of the school of the private school
and so the because we had no school we had our school in our church
and that was very interesting as a m as a combination
and it was learning the very best way
you met the teacher
she met you
you learned everything about xxx students
you liked them all
you liked everything about school really well
and I think that in terms of school in firms
because it just it didnt have any bad times
it didnt have any bad iklenzu
it was just clear
it was clear
it was fresh and niu
and that was so good for us
and then the ntu
it was built
and it was all very fair
and now if you go back you cant believe it
because now it looks rather
Imean its s its so much to word

its shocking
but then it was new
it was very new
and it was great
then we moved when I was six and its gone
