haven't had that many . [+ gram] 28472_29382
but &-um when I was <I guess> [//] around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader . 29910_37030
and I was in practice . 37738_39318
and I was doing +//. 39558_41878
which I can't believe I did . 43067_44077
"+, but headstands and head [//] back flips . 44518_46358"
and doing a flip I fell . 46917_49447
I tripped . 49976_50776
and I came down . 50826_51526
and I broke my arm . 51547_52237
so ‡ I remember that instance . 52783_54603
I remember it quite clearly being driven +//. 54680_57450
&-uh it was a CYO thing . 57638_59078
so ‡ I remember being driven in [/] in the car by the priest and the [//] my [/] my other friends around me and going to the hospital and [/] &-um and having my arm taken care of and having surgery . 59522_72012
so ‡ +/. 72255_72525
I was in a cast . 81976_83126
you hafta remember it was a long time ago . 83171_84401
so ‡ I was in a cast . 84471_85321
and I was in a cast for a long time . 85456_87156
I do remember my father making me &+s &-um slings that were &-um (.) the holidays . 87583_94843
so [//] because it went through many holidays . 94992_97192
and [/] &-um and then <once it was> [//] &-uh you_know once it &-uh &+m +... 97777_103087
I went back to being a cheerleader again . 103585_105235
&-um it's a_little misshapen . 107999_109229
but it's fine . 109493_110303
so ‡ I no longer do back flips to say the least &=laughs . 110900_114440
well ‡ my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight . 123556_125886
well ‡ the problems were that he (.) could not communicate . 131477_135077
right after his stroke he really had no language at all . 135154_137474
so ‡ the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and [/] &-um and has continued at this clinic . 137673_145323
&-um and this is almost four years later since his stroke . 145709_148449
so ‡ I've seen the development of the speech patterns emerging . 148876_152826
and &-um what I have seen <is him> [/] is him recapture language . 152849_156499
I[/] I think very similar to what I see in a child . 156523_156843
"so ‡ , in moving in [/] in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see . 158073_158143"
okay .
well ‡ I guess the thing that always &-uh &+st stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and [/] and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident . 192677_192678
"and [/] and I remember asking the question +""/. 194938_195028"
"+"" is he alive ?"
and it was such a strange question .
but &-uh I needed an answer to it . 208117_208197
and they said <on the other> [//] on the [/] &+su the other side of the phone &-um they didn't know .
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and [/] and getting out there . 213578_213688
and I remember hearing the sirens <as I was> [/] as I was approaching . 221068_228754
and when I got there &-um you_know <he had already been in a> [//] &+st he had already been out . 229534_229644
&-um he didn't know who I was . 232062_232142
and he didn't know who anyone was .
<but luckily and> [//] &-um but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him .
so ‡ they knew that he wasn't drunk .
they knew that he wasn't impaired in any other way .
and he knew enough to know that <he was> [//] he had a stroke .
"and (.) I remember he was the one who said to me +""/. 240147_240237"
"+"" get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible ."
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to .
and I remember this police officer . 262980_263050
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him &-um when Anthony was on the force .
so ‡ he came in <as a> [/] as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant .
and so you_know I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you_know in that it was very much <like a> [/] &-um like a movie or you_know . 271945_271985
but and I remember getting down <into the> [/] &+in into the brain attack center . 297211_297212
and &-um everybody was doing what they needed to do .
and it was all this kind_of prescribed dance that went on .
and &-um you_know getting him there and [/] and getting him that shot and [/] and that starting .
and [/] and [//] you_know ‡ and then from there it was just the recovery .
it was the day in day out routine .
but &-um I do remember that . 298418_326385
that stays with me .
"yeah ‡ it does, absolutely ."
okay . [+ exc]
well ‡ a boy is outside .
and he's playing (.) looks like soccer .
so ‡ he's kicking the ball .
and lo_and_behold it goes (.) into the neighbor's or his own &-um window and crashes through that window .
and there's the [/] &+f the man who's sitting and either watching t_v or talking or having a conversation .
"and the soccer ball comes through the window, hits the lamp ."
and &-um the gentleman inside is really quite surprised .
he then &-um has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man .
"and the mother is saying to him +""/."
"+"" take this umbrella because I think it's going to rain . 423020_423021"
"and he's saying +""/."
"+"" no, no, no, I don't need that umbrella . 429090_429180"
"+"" I'm leaving ."
so ‡ she's got the umbrella in hand .
and he's out the door .
and then &+gasp lo_and_behold the rain starts .
and he is caught in the rain .
and he is really wet .
and he makes his way home .
"and his mother is looking at him saying &-um &+h &+h +""/."
"+"" I told you so . 431705_431825"
"+"" and let's get the umbrella ."
"+"" and then you can go back out ."
well ‡ it's a series of circumstances .
and (..) the little girl's cat is in the tree .
<she was> [//] looks like she was riding her bike .
and <she was> [//] &+s &-um she saw her cat up in the tree .
she could have called her dad .
"and her dad said +""/."
"+"" okay I'm going to help you and go get the cat ."
and took the ladder .
and it doesn't seem like the ladder is quite as [/] &+l as &-uh high as what he needed to .
so ‡ anyway the +...
no ‡ I'm sorry . [+ exc]
then it looks like he used the ladder .
and the ladder has fallen .
and he is stuck in the tree .
and (.) the dog is barking (.) because they (a)re all up in the tree .
and the firemen hafta come and rescue .
"when Cinderella was a little girl, she was brought to a house ."
and there was &-um a stepmother .
and the stepmother had two (.) daughters .
the father dies .
and <the daughters> [//] &-um the stepmother &-um has a sense of favoritism towards <her children> [//] her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid <and they> [//] so to speak .
so ‡ &-um Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and [/] and all of that .
and then the [/] &-um the [/] &+s the stepsisters &-um (.) grow meaner and meaner as the time goes .
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more (.) jealous of Cinderella .
&-um and then comes the [/] &-um the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity <for the> [//] &-um for there to be a dance .
and everybody <is all> [/] &-um is all you_know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the [/] the perfect outfit .
and [/] and Cinderella &-um is not going to go to the ball .
and she is at home .
and [/] <and> [/] &-um and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot .
<so they find> [//] I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the [//] <in a> [/] (.) in a hope chest or <I guess> [//] what I would call now a hope chest . 525010_719425
and &-um so that becomes +...
<I don't> [//] &+n wait a minute . [+ exc] 720175_720265
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing . 725843_725873
&-um so ‡ the sisters go to the ball .
and [/] and &+s poor Cinderella is home with her mice .
"and [/] and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance, I believe . 729789_743110"
so ‡ the fairy &+p godmother creates the [/] &-um the carriage to take her in . 743132_748392
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect . 748622_751692
and [/] and her fairy godmothers then help her &-um to go to the ball . 751710_756360
so ‡ when [/] when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there . 756522_759602
and &-uh everyone is just &=gasp . 759618_761028
<takes her breath away> [//] and she takes their breath away . 761474_763944
and she meets the prince . 764143_765613
&-um and they dance . 766384_767864
and they have a wonderful time . 767887_768917
&-um but what happens is the clock strikes twelve . 769306_772406
and she needs to be home . 772427_773667
and &-um she is running out the door . 774325_777285
and <her slipper is> [//] her shoe is left behind . 777305_781165
so ‡ she goes home . 781930_783240
the sisters and whatnot they all go home . 783651_785891
and [/] and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper . 785908_792208
and he combs through the village . 793241_795601
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers . 795709_800679
and it doesn't work . 800697_801697
and then lo_and_behold he finds Cinderella . 801760_804400
and the &+f shoe fits . 804558_805988
they get married . 807253_807883
and they live happily ever after . 807907_809397
"the end, the end . [+ exc] 810528_812008"

"but that's a whole other issue, yes ! [+ exc] 815339_817339"
I would get the bread . 819870_819871
first [//] well I would get the bread out_of the +//. 846201_846291
for me I keep my bread in the freezer . 850437_850487
so ‡ I would take it out_of the freezer and let it defrost . 853041_853111
&-um my peanut butter stays in a cabinet .
my jelly is in the refrigerator .
so ‡ the bread comes out first .
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out .
&-um once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first . 854693_871501
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter . 871725_875685
put the other slice of bread on . 876868_878828
and slice it in a triangle motion . 878924_881824
there you go . 883344_884184

I will tell you about a cheerleading accident . 133960_136170
&-um and I broke my arm . 136641_138141
and I was in I &+th believe <it was sophomore> [//] it was my sophomore year in high_school . 138391_144121
and I was in the gymnasium . 144626_146016
and we were practicing . 146035_147625
and I did a back flip . 148147_149697
and I came down on my arm . 149861_152301
and I remember hearing it crack . 152322_154092
it was CYO so <it was> [/] it was not &-uh &-uh &-like in a public school . 154582_160122
and &-um I remember the [//] some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest . 160694_165544
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital . 166131_170451
and I remember that &-um I was in the hospital for almost a week . 171024_175084
I'd never really been sick and have since really been sick . [+ gram] 175599_178469
but [//] &-um (.) so ‡ I [/] I remember being in a cast for quite a long time . 178600_183980
and [/] and [/] &-um and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long . 184000_195200
I had a Christmas sling <and a> [//] and whatnot . 195218_197028
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling . 197161_199361
but &-um (.) I can now tell the weather . 199882_203342
oh ‡ well ‡ <I was> [/] I was fourteen years old . 213375_216135
your body just gets better . 216153_217303
I [/] &+f I [//] there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that . 217579_221369
<it was &-um going back> [//] I never went back to the squad . 221516_224776
I tried to do twirling . 224796_225906

so +... 230701_230941
besides my husband ? 238201_239201
well ‡ after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him &-um (.) and realizing that (.) he needed time for processing and [/] and sort_of (.) understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them . [+ gram] 247844_268264

so ‡ he [/] he was able to do that . [+ gram] 273070_274850
so ‡ after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sort_of &+s a little bit of self teaching and [/] and &-um and giving him time to find his words and [/] and thinking of the process <as as> [/] as a child learns speech again . [+ gram] 275100_293930
so ‡ I tried to educate myself on [/] &-uh on how children learn language . 294247_300977

"so ‡ he had the foundation there, so &=shrugs . 310003_311803"

&-uh &-um in the summers we would go to the beach . 348893_355393
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins . 356192_360022
and we were always close . 360074_361434
and we went to a place in &-um Long_Branch . 362158_366508
and it was this sort_of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families <would [/] would get into a room> [//] would get a room . 367606_376266
and then you would get a parcel <of a> [/] of a kitchen . 376283_378883
and [/] and you_know when you think about it now . [+ gram] 379502_381382
but [//] &-um and so we would go . 381492_386252
and my folks never had much money . 386326_387826
and [/] and &-um so they would sort_of save up for this week . 387847_391707
and [/] <and we would go to the> [//] and we [/] we would all stay in this one room . 391766_394856
and I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother . 394879_397249
and [/] &-um and <we would just> [//] we would go to the beach . 397805_402395
and we would just have a great time . 402417_404367
<and I> [//] so I remember &-um going to the pool . 404389_408309
they would have salt water pool . 408329_410009
I remember it being really cold . 410031_412721
so ‡ you would jump in in the morning . 413032_414432
and you_know you would just spend your whole day there . 414452_417532
and you would be spent by the end of the day . 417548_419688
and [/] and I still remember the smells and the sights of it so . 419703_423533
you_know ‡ and I remember the [/] &-um the routines . 424019_427199
being Catholic <on a> [//] on a Saturday . [+ gram] 427219_429899
there was a place called Rutt's_Hut which I think is still around . 429920_433180
&-um but it was this little &-um over the boardwalk over the beach kind of place . 433709_438519
and it was &-um +... 438573_440213
and on Friday nights my [/] my mother and my aunt <and &+m and> [//] they'd wake us all up to go to &+r Rutt's_Hup [

we were probably &-like all in our pajamas . 457702_459792
and [/] and [//] but &+w we would all get out there . 459855_462345

I guess the mother heard the weather report (be)cause she had an umbrella in hand <as the> [/] as the little boy is walking out the door . 577295_582955

&-uh I remember the details now from my own picture book . [+ exc] 953877_956837

it's got to be just right . 1040143_1041183

"again two slices of bread is nice, but for this we'll put the peanut butter on first &-uh with a knife . 1045651_1051881"

"you_know ‡ in this case you could cut it in half, fold it in half, get another piece . 1060178_1063558"

so ‡ anyway &-um she then &-uh decided to take me under her wing and &-um knew someone down on Wall_Street and [//] &-uh who worked at a personnel department at what was then the Irving_Trust_Company which no longer exists . 638135_656355

&+th they [/] they were at one Wall_Street . 660079_661709

her name was Firstname_Lastname who I went to see . 671986_674486
so ‡ I [/] I put a suit on &-uh went shopping and bought myself you_know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview . 675239_684519
and I think I was a shoo-in because her friend the guidance counselor had called her . 684536_688366
and so she hired me . 688708_690838
and I ended up in a subbasement . 691704_695414
not just a basement . 696092_697202

and was working for an executive there . [+ gram] 982009_984199
and &-um it was just a wonderful environment . 984806_988216

&-uh we [/] we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin_American area . 1010894_1018684
so ‡ <those were> [/] those were some pretty exciting times . 1018857_1022177

and &-uh my direct boss <who was the> [//] he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office . 1024144_1034044
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor . 1035180_1041369

but that's okay . 1059250_1060120
so ‡ I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a_little more fast moving and exciting . 1060890_1072650

they didn't want her on the scene . 1692593_1693953
and &-um the mice brought her the key . 1694578_1697328
she got out and &-um tried on the shoe . 1697344_1700004
of_course ‡ it fit perfectly . 1700021_1701371
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after . 1701711_1704771

then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread . 1741761_1746891
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both . 1747709_1749989
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly . 1750661_1752771

yes <I had in> [//] &-um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor . 25359_36499
and he told me that if [//] as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen . 36970_40480
and two days later it ruptured . 40634_43394
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm . 43800_46260
and &-uh fortunately <it was> [//] &+y he needed do surgery . 46768_50928
but after that I was (.) fine . 51311_53031
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain I've ever experienced . 53472_57172
so ‡ that's the &+f first thing that came to mind . 57947_59917
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically . 67341_69671
and it could not be . 69690_70380
so ‡ it was full blown surgery . 70802_72942
and <I remember being> [//] &-um I was &+m obviously much younger . 73391_76491
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience . 76510_83720
and I hadta go very slowly . 83736_85106
and I was out_of work for a long time which is what I remember the most . 85541_88271
and then little by little I just got my strength back until &=ges
I had the [/] the privilege of working &-um with a hippotherapy &-um organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who &-uh worked with children with multiple sclerosis and [/] &-uh and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally . 106520_123790
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying . 124223_130293
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would [/] would elicit your sympathy . 130616_138127
and you just sort_of hadta tell them to you_know to &+b to buck up and do it . 138149_141649
&-um but <it was very> [//] it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that . 142093_145953
and now of_course here I'm doing that in [/] in [/] &-um in a much broader spectrum . 146015_150875
there are several . 178862_179842
&-um let me think what would be a good story . 180104_183484
well ‡ very recently &-um two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country . 185135_196205
and since we didn't have complete leisure time we &+div divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every <major league> [/] &+coun &-uh major league stadium in the country . 196940_211230
and in two thousand twelve we completed that . 211297_214037
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in [/] in thirty (.) cities . 214459_219859
yeah ‡ and it was absolutely wonderful . 220710_221990
and then of_course they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami . 222043_224623
so ‡ on Memorial_day weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there . 225137_230327
and &-um in August we'll be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there . 230870_236860
so ‡ when we hear if you build it they will come we think it's meant for us and that we're going to go see baseball games . 237309_243689
"&-um and even_though I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally, these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had . 244126_254596"
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that we'd never seen or never would have seen . 254647_260447
and it was just the [/] the [/] the best six years the best time <I can> [/] I can recall . 260812_265772
and we love to talk about it . 265985_267835
yep . 269342_269452
okay ‡ &-um there's a young boy kicking a soccer ball . 319806_322986
&-um he doesn't know his own strength so he kicks it &+har very far and very hard . 323583_328283
and it breaks the window . 328777_329707
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball . 330237_334377
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked +//. 334756_341236
oh that's the ball . 341378_341708
I'm sorry . [+ exc] 341987_342287
he's holding the ball . 342304_342944
and he's looking out the window to see who kicked the ball . 343365_345635
okay ‡ &-um a little boy is leaving for school . 364142_367452
"and his mother obviously thinks it's going to rain or knows it's going to rain, offers him the umbrella . 367855_372615"
"and he says +""/. 372634_373014"
"+"" no mom, I don't need it . 373519_374409"
"+"" see ya . 374607_374927"
"+"" I'm leaving without the umbrella . 375097_376277"
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder . 376823_380613
and he gets really really wet . 381268_382998
so ‡ he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry . 383378_388478
and he's [/] he's happier at the end . 388951_390691
okay ‡ the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree . 410590_413910
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree . 414674_417844
&-uh a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat . 418533_423043
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure . 423762_427842
and now the man is stuck in the tree as_well . 427858_429808
and the [/] &+defi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat out_of the tree . 430223_435723
okay ‡ &-um Cinderella is a story about a little girl &-uh who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled . 514773_524853
and she is not treated as an equal . 525448_527518
she is treated as a real stepchild . 527648_529258
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders out_of the fire . 529277_532617
and she grows up in that role where her [/] &+s her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not . 533190_538980
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry . 539703_545833
and the invitation comes . 546309_547249
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball . 547268_551118
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball . 551958_554578
and Cinderella thinks she won't go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures &-um makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball . 554708_565258
noone knows who she is . 565275_566465
and part of that is the glass slippers . 567061_569171
she has her glass slippers . 569507_570347
and she gets into the pumpkin that's turned into the carriage . 570516_572786
she rides to the ball . 573403_574203
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight . 574220_578610
so ‡ she goes to the ball . 579317_580417
and she has a wonderful time . 580434_581764
and the clock strikes twelve . 581990_583660
and she's running out_of the ballroom . 583683_585333
and she loses a glass slipper . 585881_587151
"and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry, he's going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his [/] his true love . 588034_598074"
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live . 598474_602344
and the two [/] &+stepsis two stepsisters try on the slipper . 602367_605607
and of_course it does not fit . 607567_608817
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him . 609367_613287
but the slipper does not break . 613338_614838
she tries on the slipper . 615492_616382
it fits . 616404_616964
and they live happily ever after . 617273_618633
and that's about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella . [+ exc] 619667_623157
I would take a knife . 650194_651284
&-um I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly . 652127_655347
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first . 655775_660645
and then I would spread the jelly . 661334_663304
and then I would fold the bread in half . 663550_665670
&-um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst . 33117_36087
and my doctor had told me that I could just (.) do normal activities and nothing would happen . 36398_40738
and unfortunately &-um it did rupture . 41127_43107
and it burst . 43125_43835
and it was February . 44303_44833
and it was an ice storm . 44849_46329
and it was the middle of the night . 46689_47539
and it was very treacherous getting there . 48353_50943
but I [//] we did . 50966_53366
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic &-um operation . 53529_57199
and they couldn't do it that way so it was a full-on operation . 57216_59936
and I remember <it was> [//] I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time . 60456_64616
and eventually I just got back to my own [//] my old self . 65105_68465
&-um I don't remember too much about what I did to get better . 79125_81735
I do remember though that &+th I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk . 81751_85441
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown . 86061_91841
and it required crossing a very busy street . 92308_94428
and there was no traffic light . 95038_96498
and I remember them being able to cross very easily . 96572_98682
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in [/] in either direction to inch my way through . 98705_104395
&-um but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to [/] to move . 104817_111987
and now I don't even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but &=gest
yes . 117182_117482
okay ‡ thank_you . 117497_118437
yes my first experience was &-um back in the late nineteen nineties . 129419_135299
&-um I worked with &-uh a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges . 135316_146216
and the [/] the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they (.) had been . 146760_156560
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse . 157015_162095
so ‡ that was my first experience was [/] &+t was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually &-uh substituted for words <that could> [/] that could not be understood . 162487_171587
and [/] &-um and the [/] the kids were great . 172044_173944
and <they were> [//] you_know they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do they would just start to cry . 174131_178551
and &-uh <you'd hafta> [/] you'd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just &-like I don't wanna do this . 178864_186854
and &-um now of_course fast forward to here &-um this has been an amazing experience working with both children and [/] and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate . 187385_197025
and what they're doing you_know to [/] to make themselves better . 197047_200517
and I'm [//] I've taken cues from the people &+w &+f with whom I'm working &-um what not to do and [/] and what to do . 200533_206243
and [/] and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps . 206260_211080
so &=ges
yes <I'd like> [//] it's something I love talking about . 239338_241848
&-um my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park &=clears
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year . 251526_255536
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in [/] in the south and then the midwest and +... 255916_261555
and &-um even_though we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had . 262065_272245
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something . 272323_275943
and we were also very sad that it was finished . 275965_278505
"&-uh but every time they build a new ball park, &+w we'll be going . 278946_282156"
so ‡ &-um and [/] and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created <our Christmas cards> [//] our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling . 282494_291284
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with &-um with the [/] the trip itself . 291663_297493
"and the first one &-um it said +""/. 297591_300221"
"+"" from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home . 300423_304313"
which [/] which was mine ! 305243_306513
&-um but it was nice . 306883_307923
and &-um it [//] in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen . 307946_312816
we saw cities we never would have seen . 312836_315166
and we interfaced with people that we never would have you_know communicated with (be)cause they're very different when you leave the New_York area . 315185_320615
so &=ges
okay ‡ &-um this story begins with a boy playing soccer . 349922_354402
and he's kicking the ball in the air . 354924_356584
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction . 356606_359316
and the ball goes crashing through &-um the window of a home . 359479_364849
and there's a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window . 364990_372950
"and at the end he picks up the soccer ball and looks outside to see who (.) kicked it, from whence it came . 373373_378953"
okay . 398704_399094
&-um a little boy is leaving the house . 399110_401170
he does not want the umbrella . 404974_406464
he says “bye mom” and leaves without the umbrella . 406686_409386
and as he starts walking it starts to rain . 409884_412214
and then it starts to rain even harder . 412238_414358
so ‡ he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake . 414838_419768
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet . 419790_422550
and then he (.) takes the umbrella and starts out again . 422840_425610
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree . 444121_447861
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down . 448319_452269
"so ‡ her dad takes a ladder, climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat . 452702_457942"
unfortunately the ladder falls . 458317_459477
he can't get down . 460017_460987
there's a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really can't get down . 461002_464422
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree . 465015_470745
&-uh Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters . 541574_548994
and even_though they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family . 549580_554120
in_fact ‡ her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders . 554461_559051
and she is kept down at heel even_though they are (.) wealthy and &-uh (.) snobby . 559616_565796
and an invitation comes to a ball . 566252_568532
and the [/] the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going . 569177_572407
but it's quite clear that she will not be going to the ball . 572454_575694
&-um the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife . 576506_581216
and Cinderella's &+f friends from the field make her a dress . 581868_587398
"and she's all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say +""/. 587788_590888"
"+"" you're not going . 591039_591969"
and they destroy the dress . 592274_593344
and she's devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball . 594078_598938
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears . 599758_602118
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress . 602498_604598
&-um she turns a pumpkin into a carriage . 605493_607313
she turns four white mice into four horses . 607328_609678
I could sing it but I won't &=laughs . [+ exc] 609728_611678
I really could . [+ exc] 612854_613604
&-um and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken . 614064_620314
and everything will turn back to the way it is . 620446_622536
&+sh she goes to the ball . 623434_624454
she meets the prince . 624810_625370
she dances with the prince . 625601_626921
they're falling in love . 627051_628301
and the clock strikes twelve . 628324_630784
so ‡ she hurries out . 631528_632308
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her . 632324_637654
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman he's fallen in love with . 638376_642776
so ‡ they set out to try the [/] &+r the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in <the town> [//] the village . 643412_650082
"and even_though the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it, they eventually find that it fits Cinderella . 650656_656526"
and they live happily every after . 656546_658706
okay . 673082_673532
&-um <I would take> [//] I would open both jars . 674224_676524
I would find a knife . 677046_678086
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread . 678219_681389
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread . 682178_686478
and since there is only one piece of bread <I would just> [//] I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich . 686773_691203
okay ‡ &-um I had fallen at one point . 32785_36405
and I fractured my right wrist . 36420_39200
and I remember that . 39898_41658
well ‡ it was &-um how many years ago ? 47361_49771
it was probably in nineteen ninety &+th two or three . 49859_55859
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream . 56395_59195
and I was looking at the sign . 59715_60835
and then I tripped and fell . 60850_62040
and I was holding my keys in my right hand . 62717_64827
<and so I've> [//] but I got a little fracture . 64849_67410
and I hadta go to the emergency room . 67428_68748
&-hm well I was casted for quite a while . 76018_77878
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge <I think> [//] was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own (.) recovery . 78253_86133
&-um but it wasn't really a bad thing all in all . 86654_88964
I had the cast on for awhile . 89016_90016
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist . 90037_93967
yes ‡ I do . 103263_103833
I have a very dear friend [//] cousin who is [//] &-um has aphasia . 103850_107450
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and she's now seventy one . 107465_110355
and I visit her regularly . 111125_112455
and we communicate in a very interesting way . 112472_115402
well ‡ I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to . 119949_123599
and I don't give her many choices . 123651_125731
and we do a_lot_of hand motions . 125908_127968
and she has a way of communicating . 128108_130098
she's pretty amazing . 130226_131296
&-um she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats a_lot . 131916_137976
she [/] she likes to say she wants to go home (.) indicating her frustration with her situation . 138181_143351
but I can see when I speak with her that she's very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts . 143789_148509
she has the thoughts she [//] if she could only put the words together . 148616_151726
and it is very very frustrating for her . 152340_154000
but I think that she's kind_of come to terms with where she's at . 154021_157511
it's hard . 158329_158799
wow (.) well the first thing that came into my mind because I'll [/] I'll take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place . 192985_204805
and <the most> [//] so it's a trauma event where my grandfather passed away . 205087_209337
and he was not sick . 209889_210989
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was &-um at work . 211005_216255
so ‡ he went off on a normal day . 216689_217959
and I remember playing you_know with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital . 217981_227571
and a friend of mine and I made [//] put some cookies together and [//] for when he was going to come home <because we didn't entertain the thought of this person> [//] because it was my first experience with the death . 228296_238676
so ‡ it's kind_of a sad story . 238736_240086
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life &-um in the sense of the &+pro cycle of birth and death and whatnot . 240107_248007
so ‡ it turned out he passed away that night . 248888_250458
and I never did see him again . 250474_252084
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship . 252308_257887
and &-uh so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life . 258425_263675
and then looking back on it as an adult now &-um realizing that this man was really an angel of mine . 263746_270796
I didn't realize it then but I came to believe +//. 271195_273235
and I don't know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there . 273252_283562
came to learn about that . [+ gram] 284171_285271
and it just served as a [/] a real learning in my life in many different ways . 285891_289321
okay ‡ well ‡ this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went out_of the way and broke the window . 344552_351482
not his intention but it was an accident . 351531_353271
and lo_and_behold his dad was sitting in the living room . 353413_356173
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad . 356195_360435
and &-um the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didn't see the boy because the boy ran away in fear . 361172_368312
&-um this is the story about a [/] &-uh a little boy who was on his way to school . 392200_396070
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella . 396087_402467
but he didn't wanna take the umbrella because he didn't wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain . 402488_407248
so ‡ he went on his way . 407300_408340
he got caught in the rain . 408974_409714
it started to rain very hard . 409734_410994
he got very wet . 411018_411688
and he came home . 411704_412614
and he got the umbrella . 412679_414169
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom . 414477_418677
+< that's right . [+ exc] 422611_422911
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson . [+ exc] 423125_426405
(.) okay ‡ well ‡ (..) little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park (.) with her dad . 445019_454049
and as they were going along they noticed that &-uh a cat was running along the field . 454380_460590
and a dog was chasing it . 460640_461650
and don't you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree . 461674_465034
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so . 465049_468269
she encouraged her dad to &-uh get the ladder (be)cause they lived right across the street . 469164_472624
and &-uh the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree . 473117_475477
but then he got stuck in the tree . 475496_477156
and &-uh looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down . 478825_483775
so ‡ I'm sure someone had a cell phone in this picture even_though it's not shown . 483960_487830
so ‡ the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat . 488738_490828
and they all lived happily ever after . 490844_492604
&-hm okay once upon a time there was a young girl . 589515_596705
and she hadta go live with &-um her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldn't take care of her anymore . 598906_605086
so ‡ he brought her to this house where these &-uh stepsisters and stepmother lived . 605231_610881
and they took the [/] the girl in . 610932_612942
and &-um turned out they really &-um didn't treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted . 613738_622608
and she was sort_of like their maid . 622623_624483
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent a_lot_of time among the cinders by the fireplace . 624501_629501
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball . 630750_634970
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball . 635587_639567
so ‡ when they got the announcement &-uh Cinderella knew about it . 640705_645225
but of_course the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball . 645244_648814
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball . 648830_651330
so ‡ the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things . 652789_657229
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house . 657307_663697
and then they saw how sad she was . 663716_665526
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such . 665652_670422
but &-um Cinderella [//] I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball . 670528_675788
so ‡ as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go . 675836_679716
and they had beautiful dresses . 679733_680893
and she hadta help mend them . 680941_682521
and &-um let's see what happened &-um &=clears
&-um she [//] I think she went out in the garden . 691548_694638
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad . 694661_696891
and she was crying . 696914_697674
and she really wanted to go to the ball . 697691_699121
"and her fairy godmother had said you_know +""/. 699212_701422"
"+"" you may go to the ball just &-um (.) change . 702252_705632"
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress . 705653_708023
"and she said +""/. 708076_708836"
"+"" fetch me a pumpkin . 709065_709845"
and then turned it in to a coach . [+ gram] 709867_711057
and shen [
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin . 712924_715834
and so she was able to go off to this ball . 716547_719127
and when she got there the ball was in full swing . 719144_721994
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the [/] the prince . 722018_725618
"and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious, they really weren't gracious people . 726221_730601"
and one had a tic and a &+n creaky knee . 730623_733023
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just +... 733045_735225
things that they just didn't know how to &-uh interface <with the king in a proper way or> [//] the prince in a proper way . 735722_740432
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her . 741194_743674
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince . 743724_747124
and there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love . 747172_750432
and &-um they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting . 751084_754844
and suddenly <the struck [
and &-um she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight . 758636_765626
and &-uh with that she ran away . 766586_768296
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind . 768314_771334
she made her way home . 771969_772999
she was a_little sad because <I guess> [//] she thought she'd never see this prince again . 773077_776197
and then the prince &+s found the slipper . 777050_779800
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper . 779820_782920
so ‡ he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on . 783040_790140
and then they did come to the home <of the> [//] &-um where Cinderella lived . 790157_794027
then they [//] the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot . 794045_797415
wasn't going to fit . [+ gram] 798105_798905
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe . 799065_804235
and it fits . 805109_805919
and they get married and live happily ever after . 806201_808911
that was not the best version of the story that I've ever heard . [+ exc] 809630_813450
well ‡ if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would &-um open up the freezer and get some gluten-free bread out_of there . 837339_845509
and I would &-um put a paper towel on the counter . 846346_848566
and I'd put the slices of bread on the paper towel . 848589_850969
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly . 851735_855175
put them on the counter . 855396_856256
and I would retrieve from the drawer a (.) implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly . 857079_863579
and I would then open up the peanut butter . 864321_865821
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread . 865837_870467
and then I would close the jar . 870788_871948
and then I would open the jelly jar . 872527_873707
and I would take a nice heaping . [+ gram] 873722_875282
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around . 875300_878700
and then I would &-um put the top on the bread . 879533_882413
I'd close up the jelly and put the knife &-uh and the spoon in the sink . 882430_887560
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater . 888075_890435
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate . 891083_894063
and I probably wouldn't cut it . 894350_895360
and I would go sit down . 895649_896479
and I would enjoy (.) a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich . 896494_899284
oh that's right . 33407_34357
I [//] &-uh injury [//] I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant . 35033_43553
I was going to a store to get some [//] an ice cream . 44183_47183
I was really hungry . 47558_48148
I had just worked really hard that morning . 48166_49716
"and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying +""/. 49732_52322"
"+"" if they sell cheeseburgers I'm getting one . 52402_54582"
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist . 55163_59643
and immediately a big &-uh ball popped out_of my wrist . 59737_63507
and I couldn't move my fingers . 63671_65111
so ‡ I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast . 65396_71576
and <it was> [/] &-uh <it was> [/] it was interesting mainly <in my [/] &+c my> [//] &-um in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything . 71625_79315
but of_course I couldn't work either . 79332_81642
&-um but it presented a challenge . 82347_84307
I learned how to do things left-handed . 84434_85804
I hadta write left-handed . 85875_87215
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars . 87232_90252
and <that was in> [//] &-um I think it was in May . 91092_93892
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in Columbia_Presbyterian with him with the cast on . 93915_99055
we have these pictures . 99143_100053
and I remember he had &-like a little &-um kind_of like a scrape on the back of his head <or just> [//] not [/] not a [//] &-like a bloody thing but a [/] &+w a [//] kind_of like a worn-out spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast . 100589_111219
&-um I don't actually remember doing physical therapy . 122150_124240
once I had the cast off I think I was fine . 124684_126824
and I regained all the strength in my wrist . 126841_128631
I think six weeks . 131351_132161
yes it was my dominant hand . 137317_139007
yes I do . 150263_151083
you_know ‡ my cousin Ann &-um she's seventy one now . 152501_155431
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six . 155451_158381
and so she's left-handed . 159114_160434
and so she lost the use of her right side . 161570_163800
"her hand is all mangled and her foot, also . 163849_167439"
and her communication skills are very limited . 168070_170350
she [//] it's aphasia is what I think she has . 170550_173120
and &-uh she's gotten progressively better over the years . 173587_176257
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again . 176434_178854
"she useta always say +""/. 178957_179747"
"+"" zoom zoom zoom zoom . 179826_181156"
and &-uh I always thought because <she was in a car> [//] she was sitting in a [//] &+p her parked car when she had the stroke . 181636_186736
and &-um she doesn't say that anymore . 187448_189648
but a_lot of the people where she lives that's her nickname Zoom_zoom because she useta say that a_lot . 189671_194431
but she's very challenging to communicate with . 194652_197402
&-um and I'll go see her and spend and hour or so . 197491_199931
and we have lunch . 199955_201055
and &-um things and we try to communicate <as well> [//] as best as we can with asking her simple questions . 201630_207030
and she communicates in sort_of a roundabout way . 207052_212312
she has three children . 212424_213244
and when she wants to talk about them she &+aw can't always get their names but she'll say one two or three . 213261_217891
and that's how we know (be)cause sometimes she brings a_lot_of numbers in . 218237_220637
so ‡ when she tries to tell you she's in pain she'll &+t take her good hand . 220652_224552
"and she'll say +""/. 224568_225068"

"+"" I don't know . 229398_229538"

"she [//] somehow, it's amazing how she communicates . 231292_233272"
I give her a_lot_of credit . 233292_234892
yeah . 236526_236746
okay ‡ &-um I would like to tell you the story &-um about my grandfather . 265719_271089
because he was the [//] one of the most important people in my life when I was a child . 271545_275535
and <I was> [//] &+g it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten . 275619_278739
it was in July . 278809_279319
and &-um it was just a normal day . 280287_282577
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street . 282599_285829
and it was back in the day when there was a_lot_of freedom . 285947_287697
you [/] you went out the door and came in for lunch . 287715_290315
and then you went out the door . 290339_291569
and there really weren't very many parameters . 291645_294365
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had . 294875_296955
and &-um came home to find out that he had had a +... 297102_299952
he [//] &+th they didn't use the word stroke but that's what he had . 300000_302610
&-um that he hadta go to the hospital from work . 303176_306266
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies . 306567_312657
and then the next morning I remember waking up . 313309_314909
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like . 314929_317429
"I have that feeling of what it felt like &-um to find out that you know he wasn't coming home and just as a child, an innocent child &-um kind_of coming to terms with life and death saying “wow” and really being blindsided by the whole thing . 317578_332428"
having that be my first experience with death . 333113_335433
and &-um you_know <I had> [//] my four sisters were there and my cousin who &-um is in the nursing home . 336034_341954
she was around because she [/] she kind_of lived with us for awhile . 342095_344685
and <it was just> [//] <she actually> [//] I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard . 345204_349414
<everyone went to the> [//] all the adults went to the funeral at night . 349819_352139
I just remembered that . 352263_353163
and I was hysterical crying . 353902_355342
I was so so sad . 355363_356083
and she didn't know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me +... 356208_358898
and it worked . 358918_359938
she wasn't being mean . 360362_361242
but I was beyond being consoled at that point . 361874_364934
and I [/] I felt very alone in my &-um grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather . 364955_372395
but anyway that [/] that [/] that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future . 372982_377872
and I remember a time when &-um I was in sixth grade . 378401_382921
and we were having a sleepover in my friend's back yard . 383498_386028
happened to be with a [//] &+w a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to &+leu leukemia a [//] &+g the other girl who lost her grandmother . [+ gram] 386623_394433
and I had lost my grandfather . 394457_395807
and we [//] it was like they [/] they could make a movie about the bond . 395823_398893
we were all in the tent . 399294_399904
and [/] and we were just talking . 399981_400781
I &+re can see us all sitting there . 400887_402747
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life . 403119_407219
and we put it out there . 407238_407968
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go . 408052_410982
and we all just [/] just let it out . 411611_413311
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this . 413335_418225
and it's &+t a good thing . 418244_419424
so ‡ that's why I think this story is [/] is &+m so important to me was because it's something that affected my life you_know as I grew up . 419474_427254
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that &-um I didn't know about angels then . 427645_431805
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe . 431923_435923
and he can &-uh sort_of watch over me if you will . 435940_439390
"yeah, &-uh one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball, kicking the ball . 465488_474728"
and inadvertently it went through the window &-uh of his [/] his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper . 474779_481389
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp . 481412_484402
and he stood up and looked out the window . 485083_486633
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window . 486656_490736
he &-um kind_of shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing . 492916_497116
and he was going to go speak to his son about that . 497256_499226
okay ‡ well ‡ &+i Johnny was on his way to school . 521756_523827
"and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said +""/. 524310_527030"
"+"" Johnny, take your umbrella . 527156_528196"
"and he said +""/. 528213_528693"

"+"" I don't think it's going to rain today so I [/] I don't wanna take it . 529575_531705"
so ‡ off he went without his umbrella . 532369_533839
and sure enough it started to rain . 533860_535540
and it [/] it started to rain harder . 535563_537443
and he got wet . 538051_538811
"so ‡ he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said +""/. 538862_542642"
"+"" you were right mom . 543272_543752"
"+"" I needed my umbrella . 544298_545088"
then he took his umbrella and went off . 545582_547112
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of &-uh taking her advice next time . 547196_551836
it's always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though . [+ exc] 554789_556999
(..) okay &-um Sally and her dad were &-uh walking around the park one day . 574239_579449
Sally was riding her tricycle . 579566_581096
and &-um as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree . 581774_586314
and <her dad> [//] &-um she urged her dad to help the cat . 587740_590910
and &-um so &-uh he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree . 591669_595819
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over . 595875_598595
and &-um some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the &-uh fire department . 599257_604607
and sure enough the fire department came to &-uh help retrieve the dad from the tree (.) and the cat . 604630_610050
and at the end of the day every one was fine . 610261_612411
&=sighs once upon a time (.) in a land far away there was a &-uh little girl named Cinderella . 687558_697708
and she was brought to the home of a [/] a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her . 698661_704901
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters . 706037_708847
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was <the [/] the mom> [//] her stepmom . 708949_713889
and they actually put her to work . 714640_715740
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose . 716378_721688
&-um but Cinderella (.) was happy nonetheless . 722383_725913
"and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the (.) birds and such . 726169_731249"
"and she was a very kindred spirit, that Cinderella . 731364_733984"
and &-um she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride . 734573_741853
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom . 742297_744957
"and in her heart she thought +""/. 744973_746153"
"+"" oh ‡ I would just love to go to that ball . 746634_748234"
and &-uh she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of_course she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella . 749092_755322
and &-uh but the stepsisters were going to go . 755822_757722
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball . 757856_763176
and &-uh Cinderella was sad . 763850_765300
"she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said +""/. 765584_771414"
"+"" we'll help you, Cinderella . 771574_772754"
and they brought out some ribbon and some [/] some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her . 772769_778399
and &-um she had the dress . 779354_781354
but she had no way of getting to the ball . 781576_782896
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared . 782950_785800
and it was her fairy godmother . 785817_787187
and her [//] &+fair my [
"+"" don't cry my child . 789458_790378"
"+"" I know you wanna go to the ball . 790678_791548"

"+"" and I'll turn it into a coach . 794144_795344"
"+"" and your mice friends will be the coachmen . 795952_797542"
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the [/] the coachmen . 797565_804105
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world . 804533_807443
and when she got there she &+w approached the ball and looked down the stairs . 807491_811661
and there everyone was dancing . 811676_813136
and they saw her come in . 813152_814162
they turned and looked at her . 814181_815091
and &+sh the prince (.) looked . 815141_816951
and he thought she was the most &+am amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen . 817021_821461
he invited her to dance . 821646_822636
and they just had a nice connection . 822655_824965
and she &-um engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing . 825011_829701
and &-um suddenly the time had gone by . 830221_832701
and it was midnight . 832717_833277
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight . 833294_837114
so ‡ quick she ran from the castle . 837160_838540
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper . 839489_842969
and she found her way home . 842987_844217
and &-um &=clears
so ‡ he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to &-uh find them . 853956_857816
and everyone tried on the slipper . 857832_859012
and when he came to the house <of the> [//] where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper . 859064_866404
and &-uh it didn't quite work . 867442_868882
but the [//] Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs . 868930_871580
and the mice gave her the key . 871595_873725
and she got out . 874256_874906
she came down . 875149_875759
and she said she'd like to try on the slipper . 875781_877881
and with that she tried on the slipper . 877954_880194
and <her fairy god [
but as it was they [//] she tried on the slipper . 889606_892596
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted . 893074_894824
and they got married . 894848_896058
and they lived happily ever after . 896076_897716
I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters &=laughs and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness . 898382_905332
yes ‡ well ‡ if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of gluten-free bread from the freezer . 922913_931163
put them on a paper towel on the counter . 931559_933179
I'd get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon . 934120_937840
and I'd open up the peanut butter . 938068_939198
and I'd (.) scoop out (.) some peanut butter spread it on the bread . 939770_943720
close the jar . 944320_944920
I'd use the spoon to get the jelly out_of the jar . 945315_947555
I'd put it on the other slice of bread . 948156_949746
&=clear
put <the jar> [//] the lid back on the jar . 951951_954431
I'd put the peanut butter and jelly back . 956334_957834
I'd put <the lid [
and I probably would not cut it in half . 963412_965262
and I would take it to a table . 965377_966357
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 966376_968956
&-hm I can remember &-um when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing . 30951_39101
I was swinging with a friend . 39117_40807
and we were standing facing each other . 41408_43428
and I hit my head . 44072_44822
and I did have a concussion . 44871_46311
&-um and I remember feeling quite ill . 47178_49958
and my mother was taking some nursing courses . 50617_53707
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight . 53925_59145
but &+sh I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache . 59223_63443
and then I was fine +//. 63655_64535
"+, after a day or so . 65251_66231"
no ‡ I think just rest [/] rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes . 71934_78794

&-um all different people who've had +... 97246_100856
I think &-um you_know I've encountered people who stutter . 103903_107153
and I will usually just try to &-um let them finish . 107436_112436
I'm pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them . 112717_116157
and I've encountered people with aphasia . 116700_118430
and I'll often do the same . 118544_120124
unless they really look as though they're struggling . 120584_123164
and then occasionally I'll try to give them a cue . 123480_125930
&-um yeah so I would say that's the most that I can think of . 125990_131170
and children with &-um speech and language difficulties &-um . [+ gram] 131354_134814
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words . 134835_140955
mhm ‡ I can remember &-um when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas . 169166_177436
it was a couple weeks . 177453_178763
she had been in the hospital . 179071_180131
and she had not been ill . 180149_182099
but she was diabetic . 182620_183890
and you_know periodically she would be in the hospital . 184058_186688
and it was Christmas eve . 187271_188631
and we got a call that she had passed away . 189005_191195
and it was terrible . 191977_192807
my dad was at work . 192860_193980
and my mother hadta contact my dad . 194561_196541
and &-um it was a really very difficult time . 197237_200767
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry . 200788_203668
so ‡ it was really something that I think I really remember . 204142_207882
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father . 207906_213276
&-um and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve . 214272_218282
we put everything up then . 218417_219637
and then we would get up . 219660_220440
so ‡ my mother did have all of us do that . 220539_222969

and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers . 226305_229925
and my dad didn't come home (un)til very late . 230509_232759
and then he was there of_course on Christmas morning when we got up . 232879_236739

one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball . 286606_291076

she went and got her dad who brought a ladder . 414918_418128
he started to climb the tree . 419519_420749

they were very very mean to her . 604416_605796
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go . 606286_608416

and all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother was there . 615622_618142
and she helped Cinderella . 618628_620008
and &+sh there was a beautiful dress for her . 620538_622968
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen . 623594_627134
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight . 627593_631473
so ‡ Cinderella went . 632146_633036
and she danced . 633531_634541
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her . 634732_644592
but then the clock struck twelve . 645396_647806
and out Cinderella ran out_of the ball . 647962_650612
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes . 651224_654424
&-um and then &-um <she turned> [/] &-um she turned back into Cinderella . 655629_659479

and they had (.) Cinderella's shoe . 673302_675692
and they said we can try this on . 676029_677609
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince . 677626_680526
and all of the stepsisters tried it on . 681024_683624
and Cinderella I [/] &+th I believe <she was> [/] she was locked away then too because <they had noticed> [//] they knew [//] <the stepmothers [* m
they realized . 694219_695139
so ‡ I think they had locked her away at that point as_well . 695572_698322
and they helped her get out . 698794_700614
and she tried on the shoe . 700960_702260
and sure enough it fit . 702347_703567
and &-um she was able to see the prince . 704294_706504

put another piece of bread on top . 752828_754388
cut it in half . 754776_755496

Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away . 512770_515561
and her father married a wicked woman . 515801_518791
she had two daughters of her own . 518977_521116
and they (.) maltreated Cinderella . 521712_524933
she hadta clean the floor . 525368_527198
she hadta bring them breakfast . 527540_528900
she hadta make their dresses . 528950_530350
and one day &-um where they lived &+th an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land . 531260_540200
and all of the unmarried women <in the> [/] (.) in the area were invited to the ball . 540770_547310
and &-um the two stepsisters were going to go . 547885_551615
and Cinderella helped them get ready . 552384_554054
and she on her own made her own dress <with the help> [//] actually with the help of the animals . 554267_559737
she was very kind to animals . 559752_561222
&-um &=tongue
and then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her . 564886_567916
and they were evil . 568137_569397
and they ripped her dress and tore her dress . 569656_571966

and they left . 575174_575974

"and she told Cinderella +""/. 581376_582496"
"+"" I can help you get to the ball . 582874_584824"

and she had coachmen come . 590902_593432

and sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did &-um fall in love with her . 595933_601053
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that Cinderella hadta be home at midnight . 602396_610286
that if she was not home &+b when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form . [+ gram] 610546_616686

and she didn't realize . 622501_623561

and the prince found it . 632641_634061
and that was all that was left of Cinderella . 634246_636266
so ‡ the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him . 636289_642919
and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this &+gl fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella . 642935_651695
so ‡ the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away . 652365_657005

&-um I remember &-uh hurting my back about five or six years ago . 36835_43845
and I really didn't do anything to hurt my back . 44302_47462
I just kind_of moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back . 47480_50500

sometimes they just couldn't get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign [//] &-uh sort_of a sign language where they kind_of point to what they're looking for or what they need . 119145_129205

it was a_lot [//] you_know a_lot_of discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it . 169506_174246

her parents were ill . 187446_188346

I was busy at work . 191187_192097
and she was more interested in talking about it . 192202_194342
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind_of we were on the same page at the same time . 194655_200405

and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out_of the tree . 424604_428994
okay ‡ &-um there was a little girl named Cinderella . 541914_545604
and her mother died . 545626_547126
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own . 547443_551913
and the new mother the stepmother didn't really care for Cinderella that much . 552757_557967
she was more concerned about her two daughters . 558029_559889
and then as they grew up the [/] the [//] she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her . 560580_569110
and &-uh one day there was a [//] an invitation to a [/] &-uh a big ball to meet the prince (be)cause the prince was looking for a wife . 569666_581556
and &-uh his father was having a big party [//] a big ball to [//] so he could meet all the eligible women <in the> [/] in the (.) kingdom . 582183_589413
so ‡ she wanted to go to the [/] the ball . 590021_592071
but she was too busy . 592125_593205
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for (.) everybody else &-uh because they all hadta have their clothes made [//] cleaned and ready to go . 593225_603045
so ‡ she [//] in [//] she started to get everybody's [//] everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball . 603373_609403
and in the meantime her friends the [/] the [/] &+mi the mice put [//] sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball . [+ gram] 609687_619347
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go . 619398_622958
&-uh but the sisters found out . 623413_624863
and they tore up her dress . 624882_626302
and <she was> [//] &-uh she thought she'd never get to the ball . 626472_629952
&-uh and then she met her [/] &+s her fairy godmother . 630688_632838
she went out in the yard and was crying . 633090_634620
and the fairy godmother came . 634636_635776
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the [/] the mice into horseses [
but told her that she needed to <be home by> [//] &+mid leave by twelve o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point . 647857_654817
so ‡ she went off to the ball . 655371_656481
and she met the prince . 656502_657522
and they fell in love . 657601_658551
and all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight . 658989_663329
so ‡ she &-uh hadta run out . 663683_666683
and she ran down the steps of the [/] the castle . 666793_669663
and left the prince . 669744_670714
and she lost her shoe on the way . 670907_672877
so ‡ the prince thought he would never see his [//] this girl again . 673394_677954
and so the next day the father <and the> [//] and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on . 678382_689112
and that was Cinderella . 689288_690368
so ‡ then she married the prince and lived happily ever after . 691065_693405
I would take the bread . 712989_714139
and I would <spread the peanut butter> [//] open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread . 714258_719758
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 719774_723274
and then put another piece of bread on top of it . 723865_725785
alright &-uh back when I was in high school I broke my collar bone &-uh in phys(ical) ed(ucation) class . 24473_30263
I was a senior in high school . 30598_31858
and I was playing third base in gym class . 31876_34906
we [/] &+pl we were playing softball . 35420_36140
and I was playing third base . 36159_37059
and it was a ground ball . 37525_38375
I kind_of moved over toward the short stop . 38390_40380
and the short stop charged in to get it and ran into me and kind_of hit my shoulder and snapped my collar bone . 40437_45717
and it was &-uh in the springtime . 46278_47918
so ‡ <it was> [//] I [//] &-uh you_know <they hadta> [//] I'd never broken a bone . 48508_52718
they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me . 52742_54942
and take [//] &-uh then I [//] we [//] the field was about half a mile from the school . 54961_58801
so ‡ I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm . 59171_61901
and [/] &-um and they said my arm was broken . 62427_64967
and they put this harness on me that kind_of pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight . 64986_69146
and &-uh so I got to wear that for my prom and for graduation . 69169_73159
and there was a &-uh miserable injury . 73207_76567
I'll say that . 76728_77418
no ‡ really <you just> [//] it's a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and &-uh you_know meet up when [//] while they heal . 81516_89786
and &-uh otherwise it's just limited activity for awhile . 90248_93608
right around the funnest time of the year . 94867_96447
+< yeah it did . 102819_103569
&-um yeah <I &-uh go> [//] &-uh I distribute communion in the &-uh nursing home once a month . 118713_127243
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making a_lot_of sense and some are not so communicative . 127661_138711
and you_know you end up you_know using (.) my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to you_know coax them into <talking to you> [//] communicating with you . 138812_149312
and &-uh you_know you do a_lot_of different things &-like make [//] you_know with trying to make facial expressions and trying to [//] you_know to just kind_of jar them back to the present so they can determine whether they're even ready to take communion . 149787_165277
&-uh but you_know <that's kind_of> [//] <it's a_lot_of> [//] it's <a_lot more> [//] a_lot less verbal and a_lot more you_know trying to make a personal connection with them . 165807_174867
&-uh when +/. 207715_208345
I'll talk about my other daughter . 208660_210340
when Erin was born &-uh and we [//] it was &-uh a little postdated the energy [* s
and she was a little bit late so they decided <she would> [//] they would induce her . 218758_221988
and she [//] we went to the hospital . 222009_224959
it was all planned . 224982_225692
it was only going to be a couple of hours . 225712_227162
and it ended up being of_course like thirteen hours . 227312_229492
&-um but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileen's parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby . 229955_240385
and it was <the first> [//] my parents' first grandchild so a really exciting time . 240408_244988
and I have three brothers . 245033_245943
so ‡ it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl . [+ gram] 246605_250505
so ‡ &-um you_know <it was> [//] &+ju the whole (.) thing was just that [//] being that (.) we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done . 251048_260218
and <a little> [//] but it made it so exciting because we knew our [//] &+gran that the grandparents could be there . 260240_265260
and <we could be> [//] you_know it could be exciting for everybody . 265281_268781
yes it was . 270728_271188
so ‡ the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air . 304730_309190
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard . 309653_312293
and it goes through the window &-uh of the house . 312344_315904
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over . 317138_320668
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily . 321449_327619
and &-uh I'm sure he's on the other end running from his father . 328452_332042
the little boy is getting ready to go to school . 360869_362309
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and [//] &-uh because it's sposta rain . 362885_369535
and he tells her he doesn't need it . 369856_371976
and he walks out the door . 371997_372857
and you_know he just barely gets away from the house . 373353_375843
and it starts really raining hard . 375866_377326
"so ‡ he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her +""/. 377983_383143"
"+"" you know what you were right . 383508_384408"
"+"" I needed the umbrella after all . 384650_386000"
&-uh the little girl's cat climbed up the tree . 406465_408715
&-uh it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog . 409158_412168
and she [//] so the cat got stuck in the tree . 412899_415959
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out . 415977_420417
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell . 420439_425119
so ‡ then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father (.) and get the barking dog away from the tree . 425941_434611
so ‡ once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone . 542252_545402
and the father met a [/] &+w a woman and decided to get married . 545862_550432
and this woman had two daughters . 550499_552119
&-uh and the [//] so the [//] they became a family . 552915_555995
and quickly the new mother who [//] &-uh became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters . 556300_564900
so ‡ she [//] they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the &-uh stepmother and <the two> [//] the stepmother's two daughters . 565491_575771
&-uh and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody . 576487_581967
&-uh and then one day there was going to be a ball . 582621_584961
the king was going to have a [/] a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife . 584980_590450
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party . 591160_597020
&-uh and Cinderella wanted to go . 597483_599463
but her [/] &+step her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody else's needs were taken care of first &+everyb her [//] the two sisters' dresses were ready and everything else . 599481_608231
so ‡ Cinderella got it all ready . 608479_609779
and in the meantime her [//] the mice sewed a [/] a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear . 609803_615673
&-um so ‡ after she got <all of> [//] everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself . 616451_621721
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs . 622166_626036
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her . 626367_629427
so ‡ she thought she wouldn't be able to go to the ball . 629928_632088
and then <she met her> [//] she &+w ran out into the back garden of the castle [
and she met her (.) fairy godmother . 637279_639689
and the fairy godmother told her that you're going to go to the ball . 640101_643051
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach . 643376_645076
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown . 645646_647596
and <she put the> [//] she turned the mice into the horses . 648011_652931
and she went off to the ball . 652981_655261
<and the> [//] but there was one stipulation is that <she hadta be home> [//] she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was . [+ gram] 655520_663150
so ‡ she went to the ball . 663867_664817
and she met the prince . 664838_665918
and they fell in love . 666054_667164
and then the [//] all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock strike twelve . 667636_671096
and she immediately tried [//] ran out_of the ball hadta get out_of there before she turned back into Cinderella . 671723_677953
and she lost her shoe on the step <of the> [/] &-uh of the palace . 678424_682954
&-um but there was nothing she could do . 683492_685612
she just kept running . 685636_686566
and the next day the king's (.) minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe . 687043_698883
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldn't fit into it . 699425_704525
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe . 705107_706737
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after . 707072_709622
I would put the bread down . 727660_728830
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread . 728849_731439
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 731990_734380
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it . 734852_736742
(...) &=click the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in <my breast> [//] my right breast . 20223_26773
and (.) our son Joseph had just been born &-uh <a year ago> [//] a year before the [/] &+di the diagnosis or the concern anyway . 28045_37375
and so &-uh I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him . 38143_45633
but there was surgery required . 46063_47513
and there was a waiting period . 47560_48870
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him <not on> [/] not on me so_that I could get back to &-um taking care of him . 48889_58109
as it turned out everything was fine . 58678_60568
the lump was removed . 60592_62452
it was benign . 62547_63377
and everything was alright . 63425_64614
so [//] but it was a scare for awhile . 64867_66987
and &-uh important that I kept the priorities that I thought was [//] were important . 67470_74030
there was very little recovery . 79357_80677
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasn't too sure whether they had removed the breast or not &=laughs when I first woke up from &-um the anesthesia . 80700_89480
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright . [+ gram] 89756_96446
and I was so busy . 96468_97418
I don't recall anything special &=laughs other_than (.) a dressing and &-uh (..) keeping up with <whatever med(ication)s> [//] &+o whatever they told me to do . 97487_107757
but I [//] &+di nothing was [//] &+in was bothering me after it was &+o over . 107780_111470
yeah . 114624_114894
mhm . 123038_123638
&-um I useta teach English as a second language . 124754_130174
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation (.) exercises that we did . 130359_136969
I always &-uh tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew . 137628_141978
but &-uh yeah there's difficulty when someone is not fluent in [/] &-uh in your language . 142000_149000
&-um &=click &=sigh sometimes with elderly . [+ gram] 149584_154694
&=click I &-um took care of my mom and my dad &-uh as they were really in advanced years . 156397_162477
&+l nineties . [+ gram] 162586_163206
and &-uh sometimes my father would go back to Italian . 163469_167149
&-um it was a place of comfort <I think> [//] especially as he was &-uh maybe dying . 167893_173943
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow . 174254_178094
<all I> [//] &+real but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking . 178113_183263
but &=click it was &-uh memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another . [+ gram] 183278_188608
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too . [+ gram] 189495_193535
but I was very interested in where he was going with [/] &-uh with the Italian at the end . 193890_199220
(.) with my mom she was more [/] more grounded . 200803_204183
sometime <it was hearing> [//] it was her hearing problem . 204200_206350
was a_lot_of shouting &=laughs going on . [+ gram] 206468_207608
so ‡ it's [//] sometimes for me it's that . 208421_210341
it's like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive . 210360_217450
yeah . 220036_220236
you're welcome . 221138_221448
oh I've had so many happy things . 234473_235783

&=click &-um we were in East_Orange_General hospital . 245674_249064
I had a wonderful doctor . 249155_250615
&-um my husband Joe &=clicks who had a_little too much background in &+s language &-uh problems that can occur with babies and children &=laughs made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like (.) monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food . 251350_273560
whatever the heck his [//] he worried about my doctor removed from the diet . 273575_277795
so ‡ when it was time for Joseph &+t to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural . 278228_282078
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes . 282576_284706
so ‡ when the day come [//] came I [//] for Joseph's birth I was one lesson short <of the full> [//] &+le of the full (.) course I guess of childbirth preparation . 285295_296865

&-um the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her (.) in every way . 835276_841546

the ball was held because the [/] &-uh the King decided that <his son> [//] it was time for the son to marry . 861436_867556

well ‡ Cinderella would love to go . 875600_878190

it was just a lump in [/] in my breast . 37800_40070
and that [//] &+w I'm [/] I'm pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of [/] of our son to think about . 40731_49011
and I didn't think because of my age or the [/] the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything &-um more than precaution to do the [/] &-um the procedure . 49152_58522
&=click but as close as I came was &-uh you_know the [/] the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and [/] &+g and caring . 59900_66680

we were students at Montclair_State . 199530_201880
