<it would be on> [//] &-uh &-um you_know it would be on &-uh eight or something . 1131371_1138621

you_know ‡ I [/] I &+n +... [+ exc] 1499127_1500237
the umbrella . [+ exc] 1500430_1501170
okay ‡ the umbrella &=head
finally I got to say umbrella . [+ exc] 1502635_1503745
the little boy wanted the umbrella . 1504161_1507291
and his mother had it . 1507852_1509102
the mother doesn't look very happy . 1509287_1510937
<she doesn't> [//] actually it's hard to tell anything about how she looks &=ges
she changes over here . [+ exc] 1517014_1517934
&-uh <so or he> [//] either that or he tried to grab it from her . 1518726_1524006
I'm not sure . [+ exc] 1524653_1525463
(be)cause it looked like something happened &=ges . 1525550_1527030
&-um the second &-uh he looks like well [//] he's going to leave . 1527732_1533212
and &-uh <she's gonna> [//] she still has the umbrella . 1534374_1539314
so ‡ here's the [/] &+s the little boy . 1540293_1542083
he's actually getting wet . 1542660_1543970
he's walking . 1544497_1545407
and &-um he's getting wet . 1545951_1548151
and now he's really getting wet because it's probably really coming out a_lot . 1548613_1552093
you can see right here . 1552111_1553791
<it's like> [//] &-um this in pʌlt@u [

well ‡ he's a pool [* s
pool [* s
<he's on> [//] this [/] this pools on his &-um shoes and stuff like that . 1569619_1575849
so ‡ he's back in his house . 1576286_1578496
and he's all covered with water . 1578869_1580559
and his mother she doesn't look like &+sh this was a great decision on her part . 1581315_1587255
she doesn't look happy . 1587907_1588827
it's hard to tell really but it's kind_of like &-uh the cartoon is +... [+ exc] 1589406_1593806
it's hard to tell what she really looks . [+ exc] 1594740_1596340
&-uh so ‡ I guess that she decided she'll let him use the umbrella . 1597212_1602392
and it's still really raining . 1602974_1604804
but he [//] at_least he's dry with the umbrella . 1605229_1608689
yeah . [+ exc] 1613307_1613497
&=laughs well this is pretty funny . [+ exc] 1622635_1624785

<she had her> [//] &+bici she was on a tricycle . 1640771_1643381

and he's barking . 1649249_1650159
maybe <that's what caused> [//] the [/] &-uh the cat was afraid or something and went up there . 1650605_1656065
either that or they're afraid of the sun . 1656508_1659228
I've always said that as a joke . [+ exc] 1659333_1660573

&-um but I think they were looking &-um +... 2050150_2055389
the [/] &+ma the major part of the story <I think I'm gonna> [/] <I'm gonna> [/] <I'm gonna continue with this> [//] is that &-um they were looking <for a> [/] &-um <for a young> [/] for <a young> [/] a young man &+h handsome man who was gonna get married . 2057889_2078139
