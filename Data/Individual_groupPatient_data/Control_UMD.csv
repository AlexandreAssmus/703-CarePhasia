&-um she was a poor stepsister . 125431_129681
and she had other stepsisters . 129729_131750
she hadta clean the house while her other sisters didn't . 132539_135049
and she &-um went to the ball . 136794_140174
and she met a prince . 141868_142678
and she went in the coach which was a pumpkin . 143377_145877
and (.) anyways at midnight [//] stroke of midnight she lost contact with the prince . 146201_152031

I realized that that (.) was something to do that's made me a_lot calmer and &-um stronger . 92383_103123

which was a stress reaction to my father passing away . 117170_121790
thank_you . 124003_124473
well ‡ (.) I think &-uh giving the first speech I ever gave was a good thing . 144025_155635
I was very anxious about it because noone had ever asked me to give a speech before . 155656_161586
and I carefully wrote everything down and wrote four pages of notes and &-um got up . 161635_173075

I listen to people speaking Spanish . 686620_688760

the best part was riding the jump trail in Rockcreek_Park which is a [/] a horse trail that they've let the <little> [/] little usually trees fall across .

and we [//] also we lived in a very &-uh rural area in New_Mexico up in the mountains . 76932_81652
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all . 81703_86403

they just amazed us . 92221_93961
and the street lamps and everything . 94051_95791
I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money . 95807_102187
it's so much richer . 102234_103444

would you consider Alzheimer's ? 62897_64677
yes ‡ my husband . 64947_66337
what ? 78894_79184
well ‡ it started about six years before he passed away . 83981_87521
I noticed that he was very forgetful . 88592_90562
he couldn't remember what building we lived in and other things . 90582_96832
"and even driving , his driving was erratic . 97243_100133"
and &-um I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and [/] &-uh and canasta that he no longer wanted to play . 101333_117843
<he didn't want to> [//] we used to square dance quite a bit . 119052_122512
and then he decided +//. 123547_124557
he never gave me a reason . 124577_126047
and at first I didn't quite understand . 126068_128428
and &-um he dropped out of a_lot_of the things . 130120_133070
he was a volunteer at the Kennedy_Center . 133089_135889
and he loved it there and they loved him . 136043_138973
and the next thing I know he wasn't &-uh going anymore . 138996_143466
and I tried to figure out why . 144832_146722
"and he said +""/. 146742_147092"

so ‡ the final straw came when &-uh (.) I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him . 159610_169690
and &-uh that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts . 169814_179204
and he got very confused with the different women . 180383_184093
they all happened to be black . 184368_186178
and so he mixed them up . 186748_188408
and when one wanted to feed him he'd push her hand away . 189220_192320
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldn't handle it and I couldn't handle it . 193191_199981
and that's when he went into a nursing home . 200190_202920
and he remained there . 203600_204630
and he deteriorated quite a bit . 205963_209833
he forgot how to walk . 209850_211260

&-uh he didn't remember (.) whether [//] where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands . 216645_223595

"he was always neatly dressed and clean , out_of bed , until he reached the point where he stopped eating . 228806_235896"

I think I do fairly well . 9737_10997

and &-um later (.) the [/] &-um the prince was very depressed . 450169_458789
he had fallen in love with this woman . 458883_460613
and she had disappeared . 460726_461576
all he had left was a glass slipper . 461838_463838
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else . 464147_468417
"so ‡ the [//] his father , who I guess was the king , and the minister of marriages &-um went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on . 469457_487297"
and of_course it would not fit anyone at all (.) including the two unpleasant stepsisters . 487726_494776
even_though I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit [//] try to fit in . 496220_502900
but it still didn't work . 502951_503911
and it got blood all over the place . 503934_505414
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper . 506215_514365
it was Cinderella . 514465_515525
and of_course she was just &-um &-um a sladey@n . 515609_520019
but he insisted that she try it on . 520764_522884
and sure enough it fit . 523025_524416
so ‡ he had found his bride . 525057_527087
and there was great celebration throughout the land . 527143_528993
and they got married and lived happily ever after . 529067_531487
how I would make a peanut butter and &+je +... [+ exc] 538008_539598
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it . [+ exc] 540025_543215
but I [//] <you would> [//] I would take two pieces of bread . 544124_546144
and I'd put peanut butter on one using a knife . 546160_549140
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread . 549948_555488
and then I'd put the two together . 555507_556867
and I would probably slice it . 557417_559027
(be)cause it would be for a kid I'd probably slice it in quarters . 559251_562021
well ‡ not bad . 36639_37669
I've given several speeches . 37720_39300
&-um haltingly . 46692_48032
&-um (.) I've had &-um (.) &-uh prestroke incidents . 54159_60659
TIAs . 61887_62627
serious illness „ yes . 63287_64456
I was &-um flat on my back for a year at age ten with &-uh rheumatic fever . 65194_71215
the days before there were antibiotics . 72282_74652
so ‡ there was no way to cure it . 74809_75959
and I was one of the few who survived at that time . 77616_80016
that was one of the close calls . 81122_82312
&-hm well ‡ I [/] &-uh <I was> [//] &-uh when [/] when they told me I could get up I &-uh was very happy . 88827_96977
and I was gonna go out and play baseball . 96997_99097
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed . 99145_102165
I hadta learn to walk again . 102339_103439
&-um (.) so ‡ (.) I got into all sorts of athletic activities . 105022_110672
&-um my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again . 112586_117476
and &-uh he also bought a &-uh one arm printing press (be)cause he wanted me to exercise on this printing press . 119086_126006
so ‡ I went into business &-uh printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve . 127142_134572
&-uh but I [/] I maintained &-uh some form of athleticism all the way <up until> [//] &-uh up [/] up [/] up until the time that I &-uh enlisted <in the> [/] in the navy . 136423_151183
I was a &-uh long distance runner in school . 151245_154375
I played basketball with half hour quarters . 155047_158497
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time [=! laughs] . 160386_165046
&-um (.) and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and (.) got into as much of that as I could . 165979_173299
and &-uh I think it (.) had a salutary effect . 174939_178789
that's the &-um naval air core flight test which is the toughest &-uh physical . 182431_187001
it's four days of &-uh physical examinations &-um as_well_as &-um &-um academic . 188202_197762
you hadta be at the top [/] top ten percent of your class to get started . 198548_202258
then came the physical . 202478_203638
that was a challenge . 205347_206267
and so that's why I got into the navy . 206744_208574
ye(a)h ‡ <there's no> [/] there's no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever . 214085_217605
&-um <the few other people who survived> [/] the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort . 218987_229507
"and &-uh the first time I went through the navy exam they said +""/. 231166_234226"

&-uh (.) well ‡ there [/] <there was> [/] there was one &-uh interesting time &-uh <when I was> [/] &-uh when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasn't working . 281142_298102
we [/] <we had a> [/] we had a good program by all appearances . 298508_302608
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms . 303412_306542
and they looked like an army . 306565_307855
and they'd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight . 307872_311492
and still malaria . 311511_312701
why ? 312773_312913
so ‡ I went out looking for answers . 315092_316782
and on this one occasion I drove for [//] across this desert area for <about oh> [//] musta been six hours . 317597_326007
I'd been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark . 326911_329781
and I'm getting a_little concerned . 331149_332009
I was also warned about the Danakil people &-uh also called Afars . 333657_338597
very &-um (.) no &-uh I don't think you'd call it hostile . 339917_346297
but they didn't have many friends because their [/] their [//] &-uh the way they qualify for marriage +//. 346432_353352
they had these mass weddings that were made . 353758_355828
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body . 356599_365069
"so ‡ (.) after about six hours &-uh we happened upon this little group of tuples@n , round mud houses . 366970_376340"
and we stopped the &-uh Landrover . 378449_380349
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys . 380463_384203
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars . 384295_386565
"I thought +""/. 386617_388217"
"+"" boy ‡ I shouldn't be here . 388492_389122"
"and it turned out that about a third of the community , maybe more , were down with malaria . 391433_396323"
and they assumed that I was a physician because they'd [//] &+on the only white people they had seen before were physicians . 398930_405000
just by sheer accident I had a car full of (.) medication . 406188_411728
so ‡ for about the next two hours I was a physician [=! laughs] . 412962_415852
peering under eyelids and [/] and baby bottoms and [/] and administering this medicine . 417429_423049
and &-uh at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy . 423101_428711
and suddenly the chief appeared . 429071_430911
"seven feet high , long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice . 432527_439457"

and I kept asking for seconds and thirds . 476406_478286
and the chief got a big smile on his face . 478307_480187
it all ended well . 480237_482267

my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four . 79278_80828

they think it was because she had &-um blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx <in her> [/] &-um in her atria . 82158_93248
and &-uh then she you_know unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid . 93652_99882

&-um so ‡ it's left her pretty severely impaired . 103765_107055
&-um my grandfather's strokes were smaller . 107648_109698
I believe they were right hemisphere . 110334_112104
he had some serious apraxia . 112262_114002
but he had no evidence of aphasia . 114189_115979
he was still able to read and write and did not make a_lot_of effort to speak . 116025_121025
I was fairly young . 121326_123276
&-um and he was [*] &-mm hemiparesis and used a wheelchair . 123325_129764

he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all . 132022_136342
he just sort_of refused to do it . 136644_137964

"&-um and then , after that , went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks . 189781_194501"

she was not as cooperative with that . 201108_202548
she found it very uncomfortable . 202718_204048
and [//] right ‡ and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress . 205718_212818

&-um Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to you_know get out_of the house and to have a bit of glamour . 1080084_1088204
&-uh but of_course they won't let her . 1089143_1090123

&-uh and the prince <is> [/] is about to propose to her there and then on the spot . 1218256_1223706
