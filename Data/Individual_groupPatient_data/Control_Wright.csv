last weekend <we did> [//] &-uh my husband and I did our usual Saturday lunch at Sue's . 1789103_1795503
he decided he did not wanna share a [/] a dish with me so we each had our own meal . 1798013_1804713
after that <we ended up> [//] since we didn't share we each ended up with leftovers to be finished the following day or days . 1807120_1817500
after lunch we decided to meander a little through one of the antique stores down in Chandler . 1819255_1828695
nothing to buy . 1829720_1830480
we have a house full of stuff that we really don't need anyhow . 1830756_1833756

went on home . 1837936_1838906
I grabbed a book . 1841583_1842403

he lived with it for some twenty plus years . 2422401_2425161
one of the problems with Parkinson's is as it progresses you lose the use of your vocal cords and your voice gets softer and softer and softer . 2426695_2438915
I have a hearing problem . 2440974_2442124
I understood how frustrated he was . 2445518_2447988
he was in a wheelchair by that time . 2448096_2450196
and basically I tried to get him to raise his voice a little . 2453533_2458543

she needed a mother . 2947772_2948782

a lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters . 2952840_2957040
&+s the woman who was Cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her . 2957160_2975890

but all_of_a_sudden the truck hits a boulder in the road . 42773_46413
and the little mouse falls off the back of the truck which has no tailgate . 47887_53137

he's into the basement and there's our little boy safe and sound sitting on the soft pile of clothes waiting to be laundered . 774138_782598
now we see the little boy on Carl's back up [//] back up stairs . 783945_789145
and we go into the living room . 790939_792749
oh_my_goodness . [+ exc] 793624_794684
he sits down and there are papers (.) flying all over the place . 795090_801170
he's gotten into the newspaper . 801842_803312
"not the little boy, Carl . 803914_805474"
now we have Carl getting up with the little boy on his back going to look at the fish in the fish tank . 806664_812754
I don't hafta tell you what happens next . 815169_817409
next thing we see the little boy is in the fish tank . 818931_822071
"and Carl with his paws up on the side leans over and grabs the little boy by his shirt, the back of his shirt and pulls him out . 822790_832060"
well ‡ safe again . 833543_835013
now we have him all dried off . 836333_837773
and Carl goes into the room with the stereo . 838001_840691
and he starts playing . 840907_842017
"turns it on, chooses some music and he starts dancing . 842571_847771"
so ‡ Carl is dancing in the middle of the room with his hind legs . 847973_851123
and the little boy is just thrilled . 851467_853027
he sees this and he just giggles and laughs . 853405_855325
and he can't quite dance yet but he really loves to watch the dog dance . 855932_859672
uhoh we've gone to the kitchen . 859773_861233
Carl has managed to open the refrigerator door . 862120_865880
and the little boy is really interested . 866295_868595
next picture we see a loaf o(f) bread on the floor and yes Carl has opened it . 869684_874474
we see an empty butter . 875528_877848
and the little boy has a stick of butter that he is squeezing with great joy . 878146_884016
then Carl comes up with a bunch of grapes which he holds up so the little boy can take them and eat them one at a time . 884858_893298
then we have Carl . 894837_895847
he gets the Hershey syrup which has two holes already punched in the top so you can pour it . 895900_903380
holds the can in his mouth and pours the syrup into a little cup . 904541_908941
then Carl goes and gets the milk . 910333_913783
opens the milk container . 914363_915793
pours it with [//] in on top of the Hershey syrup . 917244_920374
and now we have chocolate milk . 920966_922526
now we go to the cookie jar and Carl takes the lid off . 923784_926684
the little boy knows exactly what to do . 926734_928524
that little right hand goes in that cookie jar so fast . 928620_931140
and out it comes . 931820_932630
now we have a real pile in the middle of the kitchen floor . 932684_935524
"we have a Hershey's syrup can, we have an open cookie jar, we have &-um milk or with [//] what looks like cream not milk . 935867_944327"
"open on the floor we have pieces of bread, &+tha we have a stick of butter, and we have something that looks like it might be jam in a big puddle in the middle of the floor . 945058_955488"
of_course ‡ the little baby has chocolate all over him . 955534_958394
and he has strawberry jam on his knees . 958413_960333
and he's just a picture . 960356_961546
"so ‡ the next picture, he's back up . 962554_964714"
dirty little boy . 964880_965900
back up on Carl's back . 967090_968650
they're going upstairs . 968934_969964
they go into the bathroom . 970377_971277
Carl turns on the water in the tub . 973744_975874
takes the baby by the back of his shirt . 977277_979557
puts him in the tub . 980769_981579
gets a soap and a washcloth . 983004_984654
lathers it up . 985101_985821
washes baby . 986934_987874
"&=laughs he gets some soap in his mouth, Carl does . 989446_992066"
and he starts blowing bubbles . 992578_993848
oh the little baby thinks <that's just> [/] that's just really funny . 994235_996655
so ‡ then Carl gets the blow dryer out . 997597_1000777
he dries the baby who thinks this is fun . 1001502_1004082
he just looks at that he just loves it . 1004316_1006116
and then the next picture we have the baby being boosted over the side of the crib by Carl . 1006655_1016195
now baby's back in his crib . 1017078_1018808
Carl starts to clean up . 1019450_1020570
okay ‡ he picks up the sandwich bread and the pieces of bread in the sandwich wrapper . 1020719_1025479
he licks up the milk that's spilled on the floor . 1025848_1028979
and he goes to the window to see if anybody's coming back yet . 1029000_1031970
no he's still got time . 1031992_1033061
he goes into mom and dad's bedroom . 1033108_1034808
he straightens up the bed . 1034950_1035910
he puts the powder puff back in the powder box . 1036280_1038839
and he's looking out the front door . 1040318_1041688
here comes mom . 1041733_1042413
oh ‡ mom comes in and there's her boy back in his crib all covered up . 1044753_1049454
and there's Carl guarding the little boy on the floor where he was when Momma left . 1050343_1056663
"and so (.) mommy says +""/. 1057869_1062179"
"+"" good dog „ Carl . 1062759_1063519"
and Carl cuddles up and puts his big head in Momma's lap . 1064710_1068700
and she pets him and gives him love . 1069465_1072305
and that's the story of Carl and the little boy and mommy . 1073234_1077094
www .
first we go to Lowes . 1200961_1202271
and we decide what kind of flower we're gonna buy . 1202984_1205054
so ‡ we decide to get pansies . 1205154_1208054
and we want a six pack because they're already started and easy to plant . 1208761_1213411
each one has its own little square of soil . 1213953_1217483
"so ‡ we go home and we say +""/. 1218061_1219221"
"+"" where are we gonna put them ? 1219363_1219963"
so ‡ we're gonna put them around the birdbath . 1220153_1222203
so ‡ we dig little holes around the birdbath evenly &=ges
and when we have &=ges
and &=ges
&=ges
then after we &=ges
"or the [//] beneath the pansy, &+he her roots and her root ball I'll call it . 1249663_1253173"
&=ges
&=ges
now pat &=ges
pat it down so_that the pansy stands up . 1264664_1266834
<I'm talking like that book> [=! laughs] &=ges
stands up big and tall &=laughs . 1269148_1271808
and &=ges
and after that's done we water gently . 1277106_1279676
and then they're planted . 1280283_1281413
and happy . 1281782_1282122
well ‡ first you need bread . 1288008_1289108
and you need peanut butter . 1289888_1291118
and you need jelly . 1291894_1293064
and you need a knife . 1293756_1294926
so ‡ I would take two slices of bread . 1296082_1298232
and I'd put them on the bread board . 1298250_1300030
and on one side I would spread peanut butter &=ges
and on the side I would spread jelly &=ges
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place . 1307624_1311064
so ‡ then &=ges
&=ges
&=ges
&=ges
and I serve her . 1326185_1326575
I'm going back to my kids . [+ exc] 1330946_1332596
my daughter's fifty three . [+ exc] 1332974_1334504
and <her sister> [//] her younger sister's already retired . [+ exc] 1338365_1341995
well ‡ I am seventy four almost seventy five . [+ exc] 1344134_1346344
what we gonna do now . [+ exc] 1349102_1349912
yeah ‡ <I can> [/] I can tell you what I did . 1379016_1381026
I went into the hospital <the day after Christmas to have major surgery> [=! laughs] . 1381471_1385691
but getting ready for that is [/] is &-uh much more of a story . 1386069_1389579
because &-uh &-uh my daughter and her husband came from Florida &-um two days before Christmas . 1390505_1399255
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife . 1400024_1407404
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan . 1408185_1412715
and there were seven of us for Christmas . 1414115_1416895
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldn't let me drink wine because [//] but I snuck some in . 1417148_1422628
then five o'clock the day after Christmas &-um we went to the hospital . 1424262_1432362
and the rest wasn't that much fun . 1432379_1434239
&-um the rest of it +//. 1435337_1436517
the [/] the reason my daughter was there was to <take me> [//] look [/] &+aft look after me because she's a registered nurse . 1437027_1442467
and so she was there for about a total of seven days . 1443068_1446078
and then the cousins stayed on . 1446146_1447936
but that's what I did over the Christmas holiday &=laughs . 1448961_1451691
and I don't plan to do that ever again . 1452861_1455491
no . 1459433_1459723
it was a new experience however . 1460249_1461789
last weekend +... 1467015_1467935
oh ‡ last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida . 1468028_1475198
and they're arriving tomorrow evening . 1475514_1477974
so ‡ I moved the car out_of the garage . 1479206_1483796
and I got my &=ges
and I &=ges
and I took my chamois and some pail o(f) water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing . 1490760_1496390
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday . 1497239_1500209
Sunday I vacuumed the living room . 1500648_1504828
moved all the furniture . 1506648_1508338
put &=ges
I've found if you &=ges
so ‡ I did that to &=ges
then having [/] &+sss &=laughs having vacuumed forwards &=ges
"because you_know if I don't have everything looking just right, they'll think +""/. 1543882_1547542"
"+"" &-mm things are getting ahead of her . 1547702_1550782"
"+"" time to put her in the home . 1551598_1552998"
you_know ‡ &=ges
so ‡ then I discovered the spots in the rug . 1556640_1558850
so ‡ now I go out and I do the spot rug thing . 1559404_1562264
upstairs made sure everything was ready <in the> [/] in the &-uh guest room . 1562792_1567882
generally I didn't have a whole lot of fun . 1569023_1571523
&=laughs you_know . 1572304_1572624
"oh and I [/] I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing &-uh the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker, the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason they're coming . 1572850_1599450"
so ‡ all in all I worked the entire weekend . 1600309_1603639
and I'm tired &=laughs . 1603885_1605105
oh_my_gosh what [//] when did I have my last vacation ? 1612684_1616554
it was probably in +... 1617036_1620676
well ‡ you_know when you're retired it's hard <to tell when you're on a vacation> [=! laughs] . 1621259_1624759
but I did go to Florida . 1625210_1626540
I think it was in June . 1627951_1629041
it was a sad time because +//. 1630577_1632627
yeah . 1632747_1633087
and you_know it's a sad time but I did have fun . 1633150_1635760
the reason it's sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years . 1636208_1640498
they were litter mates . 1640513_1641493
and one became very ill and hadta be put down . 1643023_1647243
and &-um I think it was (.) well February or March . 1647297_1653857
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down . 1654710_1663050
so ‡ <those were> [/] those were not fun . 1663823_1666193
those were not fun . 1666812_1667702
but had [//] I did have fun in [/] in Florida . 1667748_1670358
because we always do . 1670375_1671175
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx . 1671199_1673519
and we go out to dinner . 1673930_1675280
and we have wonderful gourmet meals . 1675300_1678810
we just kind_of play family . 1679528_1680708
because we don't see each other that often . 1681745_1683875
but we do things . 1685293_1686243
we [/] we go to the Everglades . 1686364_1687914
we take an airboat ride . 1688050_1689460
and &-uh [/] and that kind of stuff . 1689507_1691187
and <they have> [//] they once had two dogs and three cats . 1691202_1694932
they're down to two dogs and one cat now . 1695289_1696919
so ‡ that [/] &=laughs that keeps me happy . 1697043_1699703
but pretty much that's it . 1699750_1700970
www .
okay . [+ exc] 1767305_1767725
we'll [/] we'll set the scene first . [+ exc] 1769251_1770781
we're in a lovely little rural location here . 1771317_1775047
&-um the banks of a very tranquil lake . 1775512_1779052
and we have a sailboat in the lake . 1780317_1783117
and <we have> [//] actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite . 1783824_1788924
a boy [//] little boy playing with a kite . 1789342_1791572
so ‡ it's [/] it's windy . 1791654_1792854
it's windy enough to keep the flag fluffering [
now we have a cozy little house on the shore . 1800193_1802753
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade . 1803433_1806793
and the car is parked in front of the garage . 1807379_1809879
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach . 1810140_1818450
now the beach is very very narrow . 1819319_1821789
but it's wide enough that the little girl out there can play and &+sh she's making a sandcastle . 1822148_1827438
and it also has a pier . 1828405_1830645
that's where the sailboat comes when it's tired . 1830971_1833131
and looks like dad's on the edge of the pier . 1833183_1836593
or maybe it's Grandpa . 1837386_1838506
we can't tell from here . [+ exc] 1838522_1839702
but he's fishing and he's caught a fish . 1840107_1842097
now the boy who's flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog . 1842977_1848417
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass . 1849149_1853949
"shoes beside them, radio playing, dad reading a book . 1854289_1858179"
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine . 1859207_1864237
and then they have a picnic basket between them . 1865657_1868257
so ‡ all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home . 1869025_1878715
www .
now here we have a rural scene . 1930994_1933474
we have just a two lane highway . 1934548_1936238
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees . 1936913_1941593
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front . 1942903_1953653
and the man has a map in his hand . 1953820_1957650
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree . 1958513_1965523
well ‡ it's clear . 1966050_1966970
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is . 1967285_1974775
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story . 1975019_1980279
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the car's headed . 1981226_1987696
off they go . 1988563_1989233
we see them receding into the distance . 1989386_1991416
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole . 1992138_1995628
and suddenly there's the car back in front of the farmer . 1997872_2005632
it looks like they just went around in a circle . 2006188_2009888
who knew ? 2014027_2014397
www .
www .
www .
we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boy's birthday party . 2077358_2082878
and the little boy looks to be about six . 2083375_2085475
and &-uh what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table . 2087159_2092179
we have the front door open . 2093130_2094719
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in . 2095649_2098899
obviously they're guests . 2098920_2100340
and they're carrying presents . 2100467_2102197
each one accompanied by the mother . 2102247_2103707
and they all stop and they look at the cake . 2103727_2106007
well ‡ there's a big chunk taken out_of the cake . 2107934_2111754
and one of the candles . 2112324_2113624
looks like the little boy's fifth birthday according to the candle count . 2114968_2118188
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints . 2119171_2124671
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug . 2125992_2129402
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa . 2129466_2132436
and there's a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa . 2132952_2139682
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom . 2140705_2149365
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this . 2149656_2154206
the little boy is crying . 2155376_2156586
doesn't look like we had much fun at this birthday party (be)cause it leaves it right there . 2159036_2166576
but there she is . 2167529_2168609

here we have what [/] what appears to be an emergency . 2418540_2421750
and how do we know this ? 2421999_2423149
because we have a fire truck on the street and [//] &+f that goes by this large tree . 2423264_2429464
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder . 2429666_2434416

and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder . 2476651_2481021
now this [/] this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree . 2481982_2487292

he's barking . 2493600_2494280

and then they're coming to rescue first the father and then the kitty_cat . 2496768_2501408

they just loop the track and go right back to another place . 199506_202216
yeah ‡ I try to just &-um be patient and &-um continually try to open those doors of communication . 207121_214081
so ‡ (.) it's [/] it's my mother . 215206_217066
so ‡ &=laughs it's a lifetime process . 217301_219421
but maybe in the next twenty years or something &=laughs we can talk . 219595_224765
so ‡ there's a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better . 225543_231533
and he still hasn't quite learned . 231585_234265
so ‡ as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house . 234376_238646
and there's a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened . 238845_247415
so ‡ there is a little boy getting ready for school . 250990_253970
"and his mom comes up and says +""/. 254116_255636"
"+"" don't you wanna take your umbrella ? 255993_257442"
"and he says +""/. 258005_258646"
"+"" no . 258988_259298"
he's asserting his independence and making decisions for himself . 259350_262790
so ‡ he doesn't wanna take his mother's good advice . 263478_265968
he goes out for the day and realizes that it's raining [/] raining very very hard . 266624_271544
there are puddles everywhere . 271811_272981
it's really uncomfortable to be that wet . 273003_275013
so ‡ he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels a_lot better (be)cause now he has some weather protection . 275471_284081
so ‡ there is a little girl whose mother has died . 287308_290868
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her . 291716_296796
so ‡ she's introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters . 296968_301898
she's excited . 302023_303033
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean . 303396_308456
and the stepmother is very cruel . 308501_311081
so ‡ all the years as she's raised with them during the beginning few years it's [/] it's okay . 311495_319455
it's not great . 319470_320210
and then her father dies . 320233_321213
and she's left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters . 321263_325093
and they basically make her to be a maid . 325163_327923
they're never very kind to her . 327968_329148
and she hasta do all the work on the farm . 329213_330903
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food . 330923_334373
so ‡ there's also in the same area &-um a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle . 335573_345233
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince . 345823_351093
so ‡ he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region . 351611_356691
so ‡ an invitation for a ball so_that the prince can choose a bride . 357560_362980
and they get this invitation at Cinderella's house . 363973_368743
the stepmother reads it . 369000_370330
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited . 370348_373518
they wanna go meet this handsome prince . 373568_375348
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess . 375725_381405
so ‡ they get ready for the ball . 382478_383908
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball . 384375_388355
she wants to go dance and have fun . 388403_390153
so ‡ she hangs out with all her little animal friends and &+s is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball . 390608_398498
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that she's not allowed to go . 400041_406671
she's not going to go . 406718_408008
they rip off all of her jewelry . 408030_409950
they tear apart her dress . 409970_411520
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as_well . 412215_419105
so ‡ Cinderella's very sad . 420323_422423
she doesn't know what to do . 422438_424278
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny . 424331_432481
"so ‡ she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride, creates a beautiful dress for her, gives her these delightful glass slippers, and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball . 433300_450400"
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was . 450695_454975
so ‡ Cinderella goes and is very excited . 456240_458910
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night . 458965_466905
and the stepsisters are very jealous . 467170_469140
they don't know who this woman even is . 469211_471051
and she's having a great time . 471795_472975
but then she realizes that this [//] the clock is about to strike . 472993_476473
and so she runs in such a hurry . 476535_478725
"and the prince goes after her like +""/. 478743_480633"
"+"" wait &=reaches"
"+"" you can't leave . 481316_481916"

"+"" I hafta go . 483625_484265"
and she leaves . 485050_486280
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind . 486633_491263
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to (.) the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe . 491626_505546
so ‡ Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe . 506403_515753
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive . 516681_521431
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house . 522015_525126
but it doesn't fit the fat foot of the sister . 525180_527220
it doesn't fit the fat foot of the other sister . 527240_529200
and it sure doesn't fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother . 529215_531905
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella . 532493_534573
so ‡ they know that she's the one that was at the party . 534723_537313
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after . 537851_541141

the boy made it to school walking to school without getting wet because he used the umbrella like his mom told him in the first place . 385138_395410
so ‡ the story of Cinderella &-uh starts off by &-um Cinderella's father takes her to &-uh her new home with [//] &-uh and introduces (th)em to her new stepsisters and her new stepmother . 397025_414286
and so at first things are okay . 414286_418328
and Cinderella just ends up having to do chores and earn [/] earn her keep inside the house . 418328_426510
and &-uh then one day there was a grand ball going on at the great palace . 426510_434383
and an invitation came that said all the ladies in the house could come to the grand ball . 434383_440875
so ‡ everybody was really excited at [//] that they were gonna go to the grand ball at the palace . 440875_449241
and so everybody was gettin(g) ready . 449241_452130
and Cinderella had a nice dress . 452130_454555
and it seemed to be nicer than her stepsisters' . 454555_458820
so ‡ her stepsisters got jealous wrecked her dress &-uh made fun of her and everything . 458820_466325
and Cinderella was upset . 466325_468050
and then she couldn't go to the ball because her dress was ruined . 468050_471020
and the stepsisters just laughed at her and made fun of her . 471020_475801
so ‡ Cinderella stayed at home . 475801_478126
and the &+s stepsisters ended up going out to the ball . 478126_483270
&-uh meanwhile ‡ there was a magic mouse or &+s +... 483270_488100
I think it was a magic mouse that &-uh granted Cinderella a wish . 488100_493395
and Cinderella wished she could go to the ball and [/] and have a nice dress to [/] to go to the ball in . 493395_500348
and so [//] &-um oh it was a fairy godmother . 500348_504833
the fairy godmother granted the wish to Cinderella and gave Cinderella the most beautiful dress that there ever was and turned the pumpkin into a carriage so_that she could be escorted in <to the> [/] to the grand ball in a nice carriage with her nice dress . 504833_523906
so ‡ when she gets to the grand ball &-uh everybody's impressed with how beautiful Cinderella is and how nice her dress is . 523906_531931
and the prince asks Cinderella to dance . 531931_535098
and the evil stepsisters are there and are so jealous that Cinderella's there and now with an even nicer dress than she had before . 535098_543086
and now she's getting asked to dance with the prince which all the stepsisters wanted and [/] and were so envious of Cinderella . 543086_551885
so ‡ Cinderella was so enlightened and enthusiastic about being at the ball with the beautiful dress and now dancing with the prince . 551885_562950
and it was like a dream come true . 562950_564288
"but &-uh the fairy godmother said +""/. 564288_566663"
"+"" you hafta be home before midnight . 566663_567990"
"+"" so ‡ otherwise everything won't go back to normal . 567990_571526"
and so Cinderella noticed that it was almost midnight . 571526_575641
so ‡ she runs out [/] out_of the ball <in a> [//] right after her dance with the prince . 575641_580438

and the carriage turns back into a pumpkin . 612300_616425
and &-uh so the next day the prince still with the [/] the thoughts of Cinderella on his mind &+wa wants to find out who Cinderella was . 616425_627876
and all he has left is a glass slipper . 627876_630226

one sunny day in June a family of rats decided to get all the family together and go for a picnic . 386393_394873
they packed the truck with all their toys . 396155_398555
and they gathered all the rats . 398630_400660
<they climbed> [//] some climbed in the front of the cab . 402286_404896
some of the younger rats climbed in the back . 405386_408136
off they went down the road up a great big hill with flowers and bushes . 410592_417662
it was a very bumpy road with lots_of rocks . 419396_422246
when they hit one particularly large rock a little girl rat <with her baby> [//] (.) with her stuffed animal flew right out_of the back of the truck . 422607_438697
the truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls . 439021_449551
she lay alongside the road watching the truck drive off in the distance . 450226_456036
the rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic . 458303_463583
and they all climbed out_of the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys . 463872_472962
some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water . 474873_480153
some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers . 481182_487692
it was a beautiful lake . 488295_489615
and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time . 489634_493034
grandpa rat played the fiddle while grandma sat next to her [
and mother and father rat watched their children play . 501098_504248
everybody was having so much fun except for the little rat who had fallen out_of the truck . 505003_511803
she sat alongside the trail hugging her stuffed animal (.) to her and crying . 512419_521169
she was so scared and lonely . 521921_525391
the woods seemed so big and scary . 525734_532864
she looked every which way . 533579_535419
and didn't know what to do . 535493_537793
the flowers were pretty . 537986_540186
and she looked at the red flowers around her . 541101_543421
and the yellow flowers . 544056_545726
meanwhile back at the lake father called all the little rats to come and have lunch . 547906_555856
back in the woods <the little rat> [//] the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her . 556062_574032
she found that they were very very yummy . 575034_578384
and she filled up on juicy red raspberries . 578760_582870
meanwhile back at the lake the family started to realize that something was wrong . 584811_591211
they were missing the little girl rat . 591829_594489
the children sat and waited while the parents searched and called . 594826_600676
but she was nowhere to be seen . 601112_604242
they looked in the water and along the edges . 604650_608070
they looked under rocks and in the grass . 608550_612440
they were sad . 613328_614478
some of the young rats were even crying . 615418_618288
they did not know what had happened to their little sister . 618409_622469
they decided that they needed to pack up and head back the way that they had come . 623911_628911
nobody was going to be able to eat or have fun until they were all together again . 629420_634770
the little rat back along the trail had filled up on berries and was laying down in the grass just looking up at the sky wondering what to do next . 634819_651939
the rats in the truck searched and searched as they drove back along the trail the way they had come . 652195_662765
the little rat thought she heard something . 662852_666942
she thought she heard the rumbling of a truck and her brothers and sisters and mother and father and grandma and grandpa calling her name . 667811_676241
she rushed through the grass back towards the road . 677153_680693
she ran out into the road just in time to see her father's truck cresting the hill . 681360_687310
and they spotted her . 687841_688711
and they all waved and were so happy to find her again . 689341_693121
but [//] and they hugged joyfully (.) did cartwheels and jumped and cried . 694661_702601
but the little girl realized that something was wrong . 705020_709140
she had lost the stuffed animal that had given her such comfort when she was lost in the woods . 709617_714797
she ran back through the woods . 715530_717430
"and in the grass there she found her bunny laying down, her stuffed animal . 717484_722014"
she hugged her stuffed animal to her . 722629_724429
and she was so happy . 724758_726518
they all climbed back into the truck again . 727949_730199
actually they all decided to set up and have a picnic right there where they had found their little sister . 732477_739957
so ‡ they started to spread out the blankets and get the food out once again . 740850_746950

good dog Carl . 989541_990801
Carl <lived in a family> [//] lived in a house with a family that had a little baby . 994683_1001473
Carl was a big Rottweiller . 1002065_1005835

"+"" I'll be back shortly . 1016477_1017787"
Carl was being left to babysit for a baby . 1019356_1023266
and he was just a big happy dog . 1024443_1028653
they waited as they watched the mother get into her car and drive away . 1031775_1036565
Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone . 1037328_1041228
the baby also waited expectantly . 1041931_1044421
when Carl was sure it was &+s safe he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed out_of the crib and onto Carl's back . 1046688_1058888
Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse . 1062435_1068365
they were going to have such a good time together . 1070872_1073822
they walked down the hall into mother's bedroom . 1074013_1077723
it looked so soft . 1079014_1081134
they jumped up onto the bed . 1081854_1083884
and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch . 1084659_1091059
afterwards they got off the bed and they went over to mom's vanity . 1094125_1100025
there the baby got into mom's powder [//] perfumed powder . 1102735_1108505
and he dusted Carl's nose . 1109283_1111743
it tickled Carl's nose . 1112068_1113868
but he liked the smell of the powder . 1113918_1116048
and he was having so much fun with baby . 1116343_1118863
they played dress-up . 1120153_1121563
Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can (.) on top of him just like a little purple hat . 1124223_1136733
baby had a hat too . 1137902_1139592
baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff . 1139688_1142948
they looked at themselves &+to [//] in the mirror and they smiled . 1143501_1146871
this was so much fun . 1146918_1149428
next Carl took the baby to the laundry chute . 1150908_1155308
uhoh . 1156768_1157408
what do you think is going to happen here ? 1158149_1160329
the baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down . 1162252_1166632
and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby . 1167974_1176304
he gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry . 1177469_1186809
"Carl jumps down the stairs, gets the baby on his back again, and <climbs back up &+th> [//] runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck . 1188873_1201603"
Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room scattering the newspaper every which way . 1205523_1212353
they walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish . 1215809_1222669
the baby decided that he wanted to go swimming . 1222886_1227676
and so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water . 1228073_1236783
the baby splashed and chased the fish . 1237038_1240818
afterwards Carl decided that he wanted to dance . 1245709_1251909
amazingly Carl knew how to turn on the stereo . 1253394_1257124
and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music . 1257599_1262849
and Carl danced and danced for the baby . 1263497_1266537
and the baby laughed and clapped his hands . 1266626_1270396
afterwards Carl and the baby were both very hungry . 1274411_1278161
so ‡ they wandered into the kitchen . 1278500_1280260
they got into the refrigerator . 1282601_1284651
and what did they find but bread and butter . 1285303_1289813
Carl got a package of whole wheat bread . 1291172_1293882
and he ripped it open . 1293897_1295337
and ate all the bread . 1295358_1299018
"meanwhile ‡ the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers, and tasting the salty buttery taste . 1299957_1310907"
they found grapes . 1314303_1315853
and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth . 1316245_1321715
they made chocolate milk with syrup . 1323095_1325565
what a mess . 1326275_1328045
you can imagine there was syrup and milk all over the floor . 1328489_1332539

and the baby was a mess . 1342867_1345277
the baby climbed onto Carl's back . 1345428_1350728
and they climbed back up the stairs leaving the mess behind . 1351995_1356005
"Carl, smart dog that he was, started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside . 1356518_1363568"
he got a washcloth a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap . 1364390_1369240
and he scrubbed the baby . 1370721_1372371
Carl's mouth was full of soap . 1374740_1376790
and he made bubbles when he breathed which made the baby laugh . 1378129_1382329
afterwards Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry . 1384787_1389007
he brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside . 1389741_1398291
then Carl had work to do . 1399377_1401217
he went back down to the kitchen . 1401986_1404266
finished off the bread . 1404616_1405826
put the wrapper in the trash . 1405874_1407454
licked up the milk . 1407536_1408906
he looked out the window . 1410218_1411448
mom wasn't back yet . 1412163_1413583
he still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away . 1413833_1418593
after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around and fun time he looked out the window and saw mother coming home . 1421015_1431815
the baby was laying in his crib quietly . 1431864_1436604

mother walked in to see them just as she had left them . 1443203_1446893

and found that the vehicle we were towing behind the motorhome had blown a tire and ripped up the whole front side of the truck we were towing . 1811669_1824389
while the children slept in the motorhome the adults got out . 1827130_1832300

and he put both of my hands on <the steering wheel or> [//] the &-um handlebars . 3117476_3125166
and he put my feet on the pedals . 3125567_3127697
and (.) <he drove> [/] he drove ahead of me . 3131401_3133451
and he [/] he went as quickly as he could back to the car . 3134295_3137085
meanwhile ‡ it took me about an hour to get three miles . 3137131_3140851
and I made it back to the car . 3141466_3142646
and he hadta lift me off . 3144829_3145789
and put me in the seat . 3147034_3147754
it took three hours for us to get <home or> [//] to the hospital . 3147855_3153085
and x-rays and everything +... 3156403_3158813
broken back +... 3158862_3159342
"&-um and when my husband called me that night from home and I was in the hospital not having any idea when [//] you_know <what our> [/] what our future was going to be like, he told me he was very sad . 3159977_3173027"
&=laughs very sad and very sorry . 3173197_3177347
oh yeah &=laughs . 3186661_3187541
yes . 3203100_3203690
my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia . 3209573_3212623
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia . 3214079_3216919
so ‡ her first language is Mandarin Chinese . 3217744_3219994
and then her second language is English . 3221815_3225775
and (.) I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods instead_of really understanding things . 3231247_3241117
and it's taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her even_though she insists she understands . 3241945_3250875
you_know ‡ and the the very next day she'll not have a clue what I had told her . 3251502_3256742
and so I have just learned to &-um &-uh watch for cues that she's not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding . 3257578_3268398
and I've hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase in_order_to make sure that she understands . 3269119_3280179
I was in the military . 3297510_3306040
I'd just come to Phoenix from Korea . 3307333_3309873
and I didn't know anybody yet . 3313359_3315209
and so I got a part-time job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard . 3315504_3323764
"and I worked middle of the night shift, all night shift . 3325029_3329509"
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed . 3330716_3336356
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes . 3338168_3342758
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons . 3343106_3346196
we weren't allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon . 3346333_3351233
there's actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for self-defense or as a weapon . 3351285_3356285
so ‡ on this fifty acre site there was one light pole . 3357010_3360410
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds . 3361539_3368079
so ‡ all around you it's pitch black . 3368445_3370465
and you're just under this light pole . 3370820_3371790
and you can't see <beyond the darkness or> [//] beyond the light . 3372058_3377158
and so I would sit there at night . 3378404_3380864
and &-uh (.) one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work +... 3381793_3392543
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning . 3393277_3396427
and this time it was around three in the morning . 3397159_3400009
and I didn't realize that they were going to be coming that early . 3401562_3409292
and I was &+s sitting where I shouldn't have been sitting . 3412105_3414715
I was just outside the light so_that I could see . 3414768_3418048
(be)cause it's creepy . 3418095_3418995
very creepy all night long . 3419562_3420932
and so you_know by three o'clock in the morning I was already on edge . 3421224_3423904
and all_of_a_sudden +... 3424855_3427545
and I hadn't seen anybody approaching . 3428921_3430511
but all_of_a_sudden a man jumped out from behind a close_by Port_a_Potty . 3430618_3435268
he yelled . 3435347_3437207
and he had a rope in his hand . 3437432_3438482
and he was stretching the rope in_between his hands like this . 3439261_3442571
and he yelled . 3443150_3443750
and I screamed . 3444932_3446012
and he laughed . 3447147_3447857
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up . 3449140_3455100
and he continued to laugh . 3458042_3459162
and I cried because it had scared me so badly &=laughs . 3460268_3463058
&=laughs as it turns out he was just one of the construction workers that showed up early and maybe got dropped off along the road . 3465634_3472214
yeah &=laughs . 3473755_3473756

and the creeks were flooding . 3517180_3520680
and the [//] there were roads that were impassable . 3523205_3526095
there were roadblocks up everywhere . 3526149_3527969
but every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads . 3529615_3536565
they don't realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water . 3537392_3541912
and that it's much deeper than they realized . 3542469_3544699
one father <had gone across the or> [//] had attempted to cross the road . 3545151_3554311
he thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine . 3555655_3559205
then as they entered the water very quickly the &=hand
and pushed his truck right off the road . 3569593_3571573
he and his daughter were the only ones in the truck . 3574537_3578317
daughter was in her seatbelt . 3579761_3581171
he was able to get out_of his seatbelt . 3581553_3583553
then he climbed to the top of the truck . 3584175_3588485
and over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter . 3588701_3591401
the water swept them off the top of the truck . 3591594_3597504
and <as they> [/] as they were swept downstream they caught a tree . 3599882_3603342
and the girl hung on to the tree alone because her father had been swept further down . 3604643_3615233
and he hadta grab another tree down the way . 3615494_3617574
someone watching who had seen everything had called nine-one-one . 3619020_3623190
the fire department got there . 3623251_3627341
and they saw the little girl clinging to the tree . 3628464_3633444
one particularly strong handsome young fire fighter (.) put on his life vest . 3633859_3647769
jumped out into the water . 3648678_3649898
grabbed the tree . 3654702_3655652
put his arms around the little girl . 3657419_3658969
and she clung to him (.) knowing that her life depended on it . 3662273_3668133
he held her very tightly while he put another belt around her . 3670332_3674712
it was a belt similar to the one he was wearing . 3675603_3677903
and they [/] they tied themselves together with the belt . 3678046_3680586
"and his friends back on shore, the other fire fighters, pulled him back to the shore with the girl . 3681382_3689192"
and when she was safe a different fire fighter went in after the father . 3690974_3697674
and got him safely out . 3698637_3699877
and they gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law . 3700906_3705256
&=laughs and he got a bill for fifteen hundred dollars for the rescue of him and his daughter . 3706190_3711180

once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella . 4027062_4029692
her mother had died . 4031722_4032772
and her father (.) married a new wife who had two children of her own . 4033393_4043363
they came to live in Cinderella's house with Cinderella and her father . 4043570_4047720
"her new stepmother <and her> [//] and the stepmother's two daughters, Cinderella's stepsisters now, didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful . 4049676_4061266"
and they were mean to Cinderella . 4062490_4063880
and <the mother> [//] the stepmother decided that Cinderella <would be the maid> [//] would be like a maid . 4065322_4072532
and she made Cinderella do all kinds of work . 4072637_4075077
she made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning . 4075168_4080338
and she hadta serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters . 4081265_4085335
one day an invitation came . 4085541_4093221
the prince was having a ball . 4093273_4095463
and all the eligible women in the city were invited to the ball . 4097703_4104884
the &+m stepmother and the stepsisters were so excited . 4105064_4109424
and they started planning right away for the ball . 4109559_4112899
Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she couldn't go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs . 4113667_4121607
and the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of [/] of very long difficult dirty jobs knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them in_order_to go to the ball . 4121761_4132991
Cinderella was so sad . 4134995_4136425
and she went in her room and cried . 4136813_4138313
and her animal friends gathered around her . 4139292_4141872
she was friends with all the animals because she was so nice . 4142859_4145630
the animals loved her . 4146091_4146941
the animals helped her do her chores . 4148468_4150287
and they all worked very hard . 4151268_4152528
and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball . 4152729_4156660
when it was time to go to the ball she went downstairs . 4157898_4161938
and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress they just went crazy with rage . 4163290_4171710
"and they tore the dress off of her, the pins out_of her hair . 4171848_4175018"
and they pushed her down . 4176907_4178397
and told her that she didn't deserve to come to the ball . 4178939_4181529
"crying, she went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her . 4184305_4188835"
and then fairy godmother appeared . 4190593_4193483
and took pity on Cinderella . 4195318_4197598
with a wave of her wand the fairy godmother (.) produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen . 4199307_4214267
and Cinderella looked beautiful . 4215672_4217352
<the stepmother or> [//] the fairy godmother said that Cinderella was to go to the ball . 4218083_4222203
but she hadta be back home by midnight . 4222425_4224975
because at midnight her clothes and her carriage and everything were gonna disappear and go back to normal . 4225967_4233227
so ‡ she took some mice and with a wave of her wand she turned them into horses . 4235255_4242595
and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage . 4244504_4246844
and Cinderella climbed in in her beautiful gown and went to the ball . 4247053_4250943
everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom . 4253302_4257942
and the prince fell in love immediately . 4258353_4259873
they danced all night . 4259923_4261433
she was having such a good time Cinderella was she didn't realize how late it was . 4262584_4267634
and as the clock struck the first bell for twelve o'clock she looked up and realized how late it was and what was gonna happen . 4269759_4280659
"with a gasp she ran out_of the ballroom, leaving the prince shocked not knowing what was going on . 4280707_4290807"
she ran out_of the ballroom and down the stairs . 4290918_4293088
she hadta get out_of there before the last bong . 4293718_4297628
before the twelfth bong [//] bell . 4298121_4300251
on the way down the steps she tripped and lost a slipper . 4301311_4304081
a beautiful little glass slipper . 4304805_4306675
she made it home . 4309172_4310092
and all the beautiful dresses and pumpkin coach and horses turned back into what they had been before the fairy godmother visited . 4311223_4320883
so ‡ she had made it home safely without anybody quite figuring out who she was . 4323931_4327331

the prince wasn't happy because he didn't know who she was where she lived . 4331889_4336119
and he didn't know when he was gonna see her again . 4336288_4337938
so ‡ he took the glass slipper and had his [/] his servant go to every house in the city . 4338974_4349374
and all the girls hadta try on the slipper . 4349957_4352727
he knew that whoever the slipper fit was gonna be the girl who he had fallen in love with <at the dance or> [//] at the ball . 4353337_4360317
<the two girls> [//] the two stepsisters tried to fit their feet into the slipper but their feet were too big . 4360589_4370009
"and the servant said +""/. 4372644_4373294"

"+"" there (ha)s gotta be somebody else . 4376618_4377878"

"+"" here's another girl . 4385205_4386015"
"+"" she needs to try on the slipper too . 4386654_4388294"

the prince was very happy that his servant had found Cinderella . 4409276_4415106
when they got married Cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them . 4416347_4423147

okay ‡ when I was seventeen years old after I'd &+gra graduated from high school . 24137_28017

it [/] it [/] it was excruciating . 38768_41248
you_know ‡ the [//] my scalp is very sensitive so I couldn't lay my head down on anything . 41296_45926
I really didn't know what was wrong with me . 46109_47839
I just thought I had a bad headache . 47888_49098
so ‡ I went out to the kitchen and &-uh just sat there for about an hour or two . 49929_55809
it was the middle of the night and &-uh didn't really know what to do (be)cause I couldn't lay my head down . 55856_60686
but I was exhausted . 60736_61496
and &-uh so I ended up &-um going . 61520_66830
and &-uh there was someone staying in the room with me . 66880_69360
I [/] I told them that I couldn't sleep . 69376_71006
something was wrong with my head . 71104_72254
and &-uh he was actually a neurologist . 72272_75262
&-uh but &-uh he ended up giving me some pretty strong &-uh &-um pills to help the pain go away . 76272_85682
and it helped through the morning . 85728_88068
but then the next day it continued to hurt . 88113_89693
so ‡ &-uh I ended up going to the hospital that evening . 90762_93792

a cat [

&-uh &-um and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me . 114352_121192
&-uh so ‡ that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture . 121375_126345
a [//] <it was a> [/] it was a resident it was a teaching &-uh hospital it was U_C_Irvine . 126431_134941

it was painful . 143893_144603
but they had given me morphine by this point . 144623_147263
so ‡ I felt much better . 147390_148530
&-uh I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside . 148775_151815

and &-uh I felt fine by the next day . 160928_164028
&-um but they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much . 164047_168147

and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there . 184720_187360
and they kept me two more days . 187408_188848
and &-uh they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go . 189864_193694
and to check my white blood cell count . 193743_196573
and it was pretty much the same as it was before . 196592_199102

&-um so ‡ Cinderella was very happy &-um that they had the dress for her . 771145_776155

and &-um they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters . 795835_806215
and she went out to the yard and was crying . 807415_809785
and then &-uh a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight . 809802_816732
she made her very beautiful and &-uh all that . 816748_821118
but she warned her . 821164_821714
it would only last til midnight . 822156_823066
and you_know she turned you_know &-uh a pumpkin into a carriage and you_know transformed all these elements &-uh to make her look very beautiful . 823083_831403
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince . 832709_837779
and &-uh I guess it was love at first sight . 838383_840933
and they were dancing together . 840955_842075
and you_know he he very much enjoyed his time with her . 842090_845850

the carriage turned back into a pumpkin . 869243_871033
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers . 871051_874971
and so this prince &-um after this happened he &-uh was very interested in finding her . 876469_884669
you_know ‡ <he was> [//] &+wo he wondered why she had ran away . 884907_887227

you_know ‡ whoever's foot it fit would be that girl . 893929_897129
he sent out his [//] &-um I don't know it was the duke or something &-uh to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit . 897807_905467

their feet were way too large . 931041_932421
they went flying you_know every time . 932473_935213
and &-uh the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the [/] the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind . 936763_945683
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper . 946776_950726
the stepmother was very angry at this . 952827_954627
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper . 954681_957971
and &-uh the stepmother tripped him . 958750_962070
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces . 962612_968162

and everything was ruined . 971305_971945

&-um my grandfather had a stroke and &-um now he can't talk .
I don't live here in town so I don't see him very often .
&-um when I come to visit it's very hard for me to communicate with him because I can't understand what he's saying .
he really tries hard to make sounds and point to things and make hand motions but it's [/] &-uh it's difficult to understand .
so ‡ I watch him very closely and I try to hand motion back &-uh trying to match what he's doing to maybe think about what he may be trying to say .
I watch his lip movements but &-um sometimes that's not so successful .
oh .
&-um the last time I was really scared &-uh it was the middle of the night .
and &-uh I listened to the baby on the &-uh monitor .
and all_of_a_sudden I heard that she was having trouble breathing .
so ‡ I jumped up out_of bed and ran in there and picked her up .
and she was crying . 179555_179645
and I held her for a few minutes and tried to get her calmed down .
and then I gave her a bottle . 179935_180045
and &-uh we called the doctor immediately .
you take two slices of white bread and put them on a plate .
you take the peanut butter with a knife .
spread the peanut butter on both sides of the white bread .
after that you take the jelly and spread the jelly on both sides on top of the peanut butter .
then you take the bread and close the sandwich and cut a slice down the middle .
"&-uh to make a &-uh peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter, &-um the jar o(f) jelly, a plate, a knife, bread . 6351_15521"
and so then you would take with your knife . 16256_18746
&-uh I would put the peanut butter on the bread . 19190_21090
and then I would take and [//] the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 21136_25536
to put the two slices of bread together . 25964_27984
cut it in half on my plate . 28512_30652
and go for it . 30852_32092
well ‡ I'm very lucky because I'm basically very healthy . 46543_50073
I was ill as a young girl . 50510_52880
and &-um so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health . 53085_57845
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did . 58251_61821
so ‡ going along pretty healthy . 62325_65235
you_know ‡ I had &-uh one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery . 65299_71439
no drugs no anything . 71489_72879
so ‡ I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains . 73434_79674
and they would be &-like between my waist and my boobs . 80164_85594
and they would last like four hours . 86112_88362
and they were bad . 88516_89526
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position you_know where I could just get some relief . 89579_97669
you_know ‡ and you kind_of felt sick to your stomach but <it was> [//] pains were terrible . 97684_102204
so ‡ this happened a few times and you_know you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out what's wrong . 102681_108821
"so ‡ you tell them all of this and they think +""/. 109126_111186"
"+"" &-hm"
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but they're not telling you a thing . 112023_115773
so ‡ they send me a for a sonogram . 116465_118305
well ‡ I've never had one of those . 118363_120423
"and so I told them at the place I said +""/. 120474_122304"
"+"" if you find a baby in there and I'm like sixty years old . 122570_125900"
"I said +""/. 125953_126283"
"+"" we both can make a_lot_of money . 126602_128102"
so ‡ it kind_of made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me . 128433_133973
well ‡ the report comes back later . 134563_136333
and so I have a gall bladder problem . 136424_138394
so ‡ you_know it's like what do I do about it . 138801_141861
"and &-um you_know nothing happens, few little simple attacks . 141960_146470"
but my husband and I are in Tennesee . 146521_148491
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks . 148933_153763
scared my husband to death (be)cause he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane . 153897_161377
so ‡ when we get back I go back to the doctor again . 161846_164706
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder . 165129_171219
and that's the way life goes . 171980_175830
yes &-um the other people &-uh would be my mother because I do feel like she's maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory . 183951_196121
and I want her to be my mother and &-like she always useta be . 196594_200914
so ‡ it's been very hard &-like in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently . 201408_210698
"I try not to tell her +""/. 211195_214155"
"+"" can't you remember ? 214545_215335"
&-um because I'm now learning that she can't . 215957_218567
&-um so ‡ it's difficult because it's a learning process . 219135_223405
it's changes weekly maybe even daily . 223515_227205
&-um that's the main communication problem right now . 227595_232995
&-um I [//] <I've been> [//] I was frightened or scared &-uh many times &+w when I was young and growing up . 252494_262514
&-um we lived in a small town like six hundred people . 262779_266569
but I did live in the town . 266949_268579
&-uh my [//] &+fa I guess I was &-uh scared maybe because my father &-uh would go away to work into the big city . 269069_276539
and he would leave &-like on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night . 276800_281110
&-um my father being that he didn't live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family . 282100_290000
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and [/] and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town . 290496_301006
then we had &-uh a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was &-um loud and &-um I'm gonna say verbally abusive even_though I didn't realize that at that time . 301419_316499
and &-um so he would scream and yell and &-uh maybe not &+som always treat our mother like we thought . 316911_323781
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and [/] and the difference . 324097_329147
&-uh well ‡ here in Arizona we sometimes have flash floods . 343851_347721
&-um we had one and a young lady and her vehicle decided that she could drive off across this wash no problem . 348171_358711
guess what . 359130_359660
there was a problem . 359848_360888
&-uh the &+s car stalls . 361314_364994
the water comes up to the sides . 365214_367254
she's able to get out_of the car and get on the roof . 367644_371234
but then she's stranded . 371489_373149
the water is just roaring like crazy . 373231_375681
&-um but people on the shore on the banks see her . 376025_379825
&-uh they call rescue people in . 380215_382635
&-um they have all the equipment . 383023_385783
they work their way to get out to her . 385836_388346
&-uh they're gonna rescue her with their [/] their ropes and their belts and their ties . 388701_394561
&-uh they're making sure that they can safely get her attached to them so they can get her to shore . 394947_402267

and I was just feeling so badly . 169013_172183
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didn't know really what was wrong . 172621_179521
but they really didn't think anything was wrong . 179706_181586
they just thought that I didn't wanna take care of my little girl . 182000_186060
&-um finally after three days I had that +//. 186458_190988
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three a_m . 191010_195690
and finally I had surgery at &-um Monday evening . 195857_202947
so ‡ I was really very very ill . 204270_206400
in_fact ‡ I had &-um peritonitis . 206653_209573
and they really did not think that I would live . 209590_212770
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they [//] &-um that's just the way they did things . 212817_223537
<and I actually chose> [//] you could choose if you wanted to have the baby &-um to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby +... 223754_233384
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are (.) &-um healthy and not ill . 233720_242970
and I chose <the baby> [//] to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby . 243069_251799
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kind_of thought of her as their own . 251876_257576
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses . 257839_263769
and consequently from that &-uh I had ototoxic drugs . 266347_271217
so ‡ I lost my hearing that way . 271269_272519
(o)kay since I am hearing impaired &-um I understand that situation really well . 281431_288141
so ‡ I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing (.) and not admitting it or not having hearing aids . 289072_299402
because <you can> [//] you just notice &-um that they're not understanding or they're not interested in what is being said or they're just on a different page . 299417_311747
and what have I done about it ? 311902_313292
actually ‡ what you do is you just talk to them . 313514_316624
and you just go right in front of them so_that they can see your face and your lips . 316846_322576
and also if you're in a really noisy environment go outside and [//] &-uh where it's quiet . 322591_331531
okay . 338968_339058
oh don't put that on yet I hafta think .
+< &=laughs .
&=sighs (...) well the only time that I can really remember +//.
is it on ?
okay ‡ the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon .
and we were driving in Florida .
and seatbelts were new .
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car .
and we were just driving down a country road .
and all_of_a_sudden this truck just came right out barreling down the side road .
and came right out in front of us .
and we actually drove into the ditch .
and if we wouldn't have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured .
but since we had our seatbelts on <we just took> [//] &+th my husband just turned the car .
and we continued on .
and <that guy just never> [//] that truck just never stopped and just kept going .
I_mean he was oblivious .
okay . [+ exc]
well ‡ you sure like beginning middles and &=laughs ends don't you [>] ? [+ exc]
okay . [+ exc]
well ‡ it looks to me that it had been <raining for many days or> [//] raining very hard .
and (.) this [//] (.) hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream .
and managed to grab a hold of a branch .
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in .
and &-uh the man is there rescuing her .
and pulled her to safety .
well ‡ looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking .
well ‡ Johnny was kicking really too hard .
and kicked the ball right through the neighbor's window .
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair .
and the ball came through the window .
knocked over the lamp .
"and the neighbor went +""/."
"+"" oh !"
and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball .
(..) well ‡ it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school .
"and mother said +""/."
"+"" well ‡ you_know ‡ it's sposta rain today ."
"+"" you should take your umbrella ."
"and Johnny says +""/."
"+"" no ‡ I'm not going to carry that umbrella ."
"+"" I don't like to carry umbrellas ."
"+"" I'm going to go to school ."
and you can &+ha &+ke keep the umbrella at home .
so ‡ he started walking to school .
and sure enough it started raining .
in_fact ‡ it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands .
and run through the puddles .
and run home .
and by the time he got home he was really really wet .
"and mother said +""/."
"+"" see ‡ I told you it was going to rain ."
"+"" why didn't you take your umbrella ?"
so ‡ Johnny started off to school again in dry clothes with his umbrella .
okay .
oh &=sighs &+c +...
(..) when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters .
and so Cinderella &-uh grew up with two stepsisters .
but then the father must have died because all_of_a_sudden it's the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella .
and Cinderella became the &-um cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day .
&-um <it was> [//] (.) the [//] everyone had grown up and gotten older .
and they received an invitation <from the prince> [//] from the castle because the prince was &-um old enough to get married now .
and he was looking for a bride .
so ‡ they were having a big party at the castle .
so ‡ the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters .
and Cinderella overheard it .
so ‡ she ran to her room .
opened up her trunk .
and got out her special gown that she'd been saving for a long time .
she tried it on .
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was .
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart .
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball .
so ‡ the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball .
and Cinderella was left home all by herself .
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and (e)specially the mice were [//] felt very sorry for her (.) and were very upset .
and then all_of_a_sudden a [//] &+f Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared .
"and said +""/."
"+"" Cinderella we [//] you are going to go to the ball ."
and so she fricked [
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown .
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach .
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach .
and I think the dog became the footman .
and everybody went off to the ball .
an(d) she had a wonderful time .
oh and she had glass slippers .
that was the special thing .
the &+g fairy godmother had given her glass slippers .
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything [//] the coach would turn back into a pumpkin .
and she would not have her dress anymore .
so ‡ she had a wonderful time at the (.) &-uh party and &+s danced with the prince all night .
and then all_of_a_sudden the clock started striking midnight .
so ‡ she ran down the steps .
and ran into the coach .
and ran all the way home .
but [!!] she had lost her one shoe .
so ‡ the prince had found the shoe .
"and said +""/."
"+"" I will only marry (.) the (.) girl that fits into their shoe ."
so ‡ there was a proclamation sent around that the (.) &-uh prince's (.) &-uh footman would be going around with the shoe .
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe .
so ‡ &+s the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball .
so ‡ she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket .
and the mice connived and got the key out_of the pocket .
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe .
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe .
but they didn't make it as [//] &-um because their &+f feet were much larger than Cinderella's .
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave .
and &+th the mice had just gotten the (.) door open to Cinderella's room .
and she came running down the stairs .
"and said +""/."
"+"" may I try on the shoe ?"
"and the footman said +""/."
"+"" yes of_course ."
and he went over to (.) <try the> [//] put the shoe on her .
and the stepmother used her cane to trip (h)im .
so ‡ the shoe fell to the ground and broke .
"and so the stepmother said +""/."
"+"" well ‡ that's that ."
"and Cinderella said +""/."
"+"" no ."
and she pulled the shoe out_of her apron pocket .
"and said +""/."
"+"" here it is ."
and so the footman put it on her foot .
"and the prince said +""/."
"+"" oh ‡ Cinderella !"
and everybody was happy .
the mice were dancing .
and everybody was happy except the stepsisters and (.) the stepmother .

so ‡ I &-um stayed at home . 1347935_1350825
&-uh went through all the testing . 1350840_1353120
went to the doctor's . 1353170_1354760
&-um finally decided to go to a chiropractor . 1354976_1359616
and my doctor agreed that was fine . 1359733_1362753
so ‡ I went for massage therapy and &-uh muscle and nerve stimulant . 1362801_1370811
and that helped . 1372490_1373150
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck . 1375310_1378210
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium . 1381336_1385446
now that's not proven . 1385465_1387595
my regular doctor of_course doesn't go <along with it> [=! laughs] . 1387656_1391776
my chiropractor thinks that's the answer [=! laughs] . 1391796_1394536
but it was just a terrible ordeal . 1394585_1397175
and &-um I've not had it return . 1397541_1400041
&-um just a little bit once in awhile . 1400356_1403286
but I find that when my back is out_of alignment and my discs are compressed that it kind_of slows down your [/] your functioning . 1403360_1412480
so ‡ anyway that was the worse thing I've probably experienced . 1412503_1416793
&-um somewhat yes . 1427830_1429240
well ‡ my husband &-um has been treated for lung cancer . 1436385_1443845
and he had extreme &-um hard core treatment . 1444950_1449090
he had chemotherapy and radiation . 1449255_1452535
and he had brain radiation . 1453346_1454636
&-uh they do that to &-uh ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain . 1454655_1462225
but in the process of doing this my husband's been on a_lot_of medications . 1462271_1467361
and he's a very bright man and very articulate . 1467970_1472080
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow . 1472095_1478415
his thought process was very unlike him . 1478511_1483161
he just didn't process well at all . 1483215_1486065
so ‡ you hafta be very patient . 1486480_1488820
hafta listen . 1488835_1490595
hafta try not to lose your temper . 1490680_1493660
try not to be argumentative . 1493726_1496456
&-um tried my patience as much as it's ever been tried . 1496865_1500415
&-um just kind_of wait [/] wait it out . 1500645_1503205
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self . 1503593_1510333
and &-um you work back into it from there . 1512181_1513731
&-um he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment . 1514671_1519581
but it [//] his
and &-uh the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me &=laughs . 1523183_1532593
&-um it's just a matter of speaking distinctly . 1532773_1538453
I hadta repeat my [//] myself . 1538470_1540130
I hadta make decisions for him . 1540846_1543036
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it . 1543395_1550185
so ‡ we did work through that . 1550270_1552250
actually ‡ it went pretty well . 1552406_1553716
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be . 1554403_1556783
and &=head
&=head
I do not wanna be a <care giver> [=! laughs] . 1561758_1564588
but you work through it . 1564766_1565806
you do what you hafta do &=laughs . 1566001_1570221
(..) oh yes . 1576328_1582308
&-hm let's see . 1582581_1584211
&-um I guess the most frightening time would be &-um I lived in Colorado . 1589135_1599795
and I worked for the telephone company . 1600236_1602926
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley . 1603330_1606300
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down . 1607835_1612875
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities . 1612990_1617920
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne . 1617968_1622018
that [//] once they closed my office I commuted first to Fort Collins . 1622063_1625903
we closed that office . 1625926_1627166
Boulder we closed that office . 1627446_1629116
and then I went to Cheyenne . 1629260_1631260
and that's about &-um just under a seventy mile trip . 1632973_1636323
and it's on i@l twenty five . 1637226_1638066
it was winter time . 1638083_1639533
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible . 1640658_1644548
&-um I was on the road and a storm came up . 1644713_1648503
I slid off the road . 1648548_1650838
ditched my car . 1650890_1651890
and I hadta call for help to come and get me . 1653106_1656106
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up &-um transmission . 1656503_1664483
so ‡ I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley . 1664500_1668140
and he came with a tow truck and got me out . 1670433_1671853
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there . 1671868_1675828
and it's very frightening (be)cause you're not really sure what's going to happen &=laughs . 1676691_1680431
but he did get me . 1680483_1682243
we got back to town . 1682296_1683696
they got my car back . 1683720_1684990
and &-um I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne . 1685406_1691746
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over &=laughs . 1691766_1699096
okay ‡ I'm not real sure . [+ exc] 1702923_1707333
is that ice ? [+ exc] 1708451_1709581
it looks to me like there's water with ice on it . 1710360_1715930
and a young girl has fallen through the ice . 1716925_1720685
and she's unable to get out . 1720920_1723090
and there's a rescue person probably a firemen &-um that is holding onto &-um a stick or an overhang of some kind . 1724351_1736921
and he has on a life jacket . 1737311_1739121
and he is going out to rescue her . 1739316_1741736
and it looks like he is very close to getting her . 1742846_1745176
&-um and it looks to me like he's within reach of [/] of grabbing her out_of the water . 1745301_1757141
very scary . [+ exc] 1757301_1759931
there's a young boy playing with a soccer ball . 1765770_1773400
and he kicks it . 1774496_1774686
it goes through a window . 1774956_1777276
breaks the window . 1777581_1779341
goes inside a house . 1779513_1782343
knocks a lamp over . 1782360_1784800
and there's a man sitting in a chair by the lamp . 1786123_1789193
he gets out_of the chair . 1789256_1792306
retrieves the ball . 1792323_1794343
goes to look out the broken window . 1794388_1798398
but I don't think he finds the young man who kicked the ball . 1798416_1803306
he's just standing there looking out the window wondering where the ball came from . 1803351_1808881
there's a mother with an umbrella . 1814066_1818336
and her son with his backpack going to school . 1819650_1822310
&-um he is trying to leave . 1824520_1826300
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella to take . 1826946_1829356
but he doesn't want it . 1829478_1830708
so ‡ he waves goodbye . 1830758_1832418
goes off without the umbrella . 1832546_1834406
gets outside and it starts to rain . 1834428_1836018
and it starts to rain really hard . 1838816_1840236
it's coming down . 1840260_1841470
and he's getting quite wet . 1842193_1843233
so ‡ he turns back . 1843373_1845523
goes home . 1845545_1846305
and he appears to be quite soaked . 1848173_1848633
his mother is scolding him . 1848656_1851696
he then evidently leaves with the umbrella . 1851716_1856246
and walks to school in the rain with the umbrella . 1856693_1860113
mother does know best . 1860176_1862396
www .
okay ‡ &-um Cinderella lives with her father . 1866165_1870985
and her mother had died . 1871586_1872586
and her father decides to remarry . 1873568_1875118
so ‡ his wife and her two daughters come to the house to live with them . 1875718_1882428
and <the mother> [//] the stepmother of Cinderella is very mean to Cinderella . 1883948_1890048
and the stepsisters are very mean to her also . 1890910_1892910
and the father is away . 1896641_1896871
he really doesn't know this is going on . 1896895_1897865
but Cinderella hasta clean the house and feed the animals . 1899488_1905358
and she becomes more of a chambermaid than a daughter while the stepsisters are pampered and get lots of nice clothes . 1905490_1912980
&-um Cinderella makes friends with all the animals in the yard . 1913475_1918975
and she longs to be part of the family and to be happy again . 1919701_1925321
she's looking out the window one day . 1925440_1928430
and there's the castle where the [/] <the beautiful> [//] the handsome prince lives .
and she daydreams about being pretty and meeting the prince someday . 1936043_1939353
well ‡ the prince is in the castle . 1939376_1939716
and his father says it's time for him to marry . 1942951_1944591
he needs to take a wife . 1945231_1947081
and in order to find a nice young wife for him they're going to have a ball and invite all the [/] the eligible ladies from the kingdom to come to the ball . 1947393_1958543
so ‡ they send out invitations . 1958560_1960860
and an invitation goes to Cinderella's house . 1961145_1963625
but the wicked stepmother gets it . 1964550_1967130
and she reads it . 1967593_1969603
and the daughters of_course are going to go . 1970886_1972616
and Cinderella thinks she should get to go also . 1974410_1975980
so ‡ the stepsisters <get all the> [//] get these beautiful gowns and get prepared to go to the dance . 1976031_1984701
and Cinderella goes to the chest where her mother had her things . 1984873_1989283
and she gets herself a dress ready to go . 1990023_1992383
and is going to go to the ball along with the stepsisters . 1993353_1996423
well ‡ they get ready to go . 1996915_1998635
and the stepsisters tear her gown . 2000815_2002535
and they're very mean to her . 2003246_2004816
and they tell her she can not go . 2006510_2006990
so ‡ she hasta stay home and clean the house . 2007040_2011040
and <the mother> [//] the stepmother takes off with her daughters to the ball . 2011906_2015646
well ‡ Cinderella is crying . 2015695_2018665
and her fairy godmother appears and wants to know what's wrong . 2021323_2024943
so ‡ Cinderella tells her she wants to go to the ball . 2024960_2027950
"and the fairy godmother says +""/. 2030030_2031450"
"+"" I will grant your wish . 2031871_2034781"
and she gives Cinderella this beautiful gown with some beautiful slippers . 2035491_2042121
and turns a pumpkin into a coach . 2043903_2045233
and the mice into beautiful horses . 2046400_2048380
and she sends Cinderella to the ball . 2049495_2050485
"but she cautions +""/. 2050635_2051605"
"+"" you must be home before midnight because if you aren't the magic will go away . 2052429_2057489"
"+"" and the coach will become a pumpkin . 2057991_2059650"
"+"" and the horses will become mice again . 2060487_2063438"
"+"" don't forget to be home by midnight . 2064005_2065935"
so ‡ Cinderella goes to the ball . 2066100_2068300
and she is the most beautiful girl at the ball . 2068530_2072139
and she dances all night with the the prince . 2072431_2074380
and he is very taken with her . 2075271_2077451
and they are dancing . 2078206_2079036
and all_of_a_sudden she sees that it's going to be midnight . 2079250_2082969
and she runs away from the prince down the stairway . 2083344_2086514
and she loses one of her glass slippers . 2086926_2089126
she gets to the coach . 2089176_2091466
and they barely get back home before the magic goes away . 2092178_2095558
and she returns to her life cleaning the house . 2095748_2100728
and the wicked stepsisters and the mother come home . 2101686_2104846
and they're very distraught about this beautiful girl that was at the [/] the ball but she disappeared .
well ‡ a notice goes out to the kingdom that they have a slipper that they wanna fit to the beautiful girl who left the ball . 2110616_2120926
and the prince visits all of these women and tries the slipper on all of these women . 2123060_2130100
nobody can fit into this beautiful glass slipper . 2130281_2133141
he comes to the house of Cinderella . 2133345_2135425
well ‡ the stepsisters of_course wanna try on the slipper . 2135448_2138858
well ‡ it wont fit either one of them . 2138873_2140973
and the prince asks if there is anyone else in the house . 2141550_2145700
and they don't want Cinderella to come out forth . 2145811_2149501
but she does . 2150371_2150501
and she tries on the slipper . 2151261_2152371
and it fits . 2153053_2153493
and she turns into this beautiful princess again . 2153971_2157791
and the prince marries her . 2158818_2159248
and they go away and live happily ever after . 2159583_2162093
well ‡ in about <I think it was> [//] two thousand and one I became ill with a fairly serious strain of viral something . 630_14930
they couldn't really tell me . 14945_16295
but it was highly contagious . 16311_18141
I hadta stay out_of work for a week . 18256_20476
&-um kind_of isolated . 20848_22058
I was allowed to stay home . 22170_23580
I wasn't hospitalized per_se except for the initial &-um diagnosis in the e_r because I had spiked a hundred and four temperature and was having difficulty seeing . 23595_34145
&-um the one e_r doctor that came and saw me thought I might have meningitis . 34191_40631
but then his superior came and said it wasn't meningitis . 40650_43500
it was just a really bad viral infection . 43523_45673
so ‡ I was laid up in bed . 46223_48523
&-um and what happened throughout each day and evening varied anything from spiking temperature to chills and hot flashes . 48800_59090
&-um there was some vomiting of_course . 59206_61586
&-um a_lot_of nausea . 61633_64393
my husband was great . 64447_66988
he [/] &-um he wasn't my husband at the time . 67010_70440
we were living together . 70455_71515
but he made chicken soup for me and [/] and did you_know the clear liquids and [/] and apple juice and things like that and made sure that I was eating . 71573_81953
it was kind_of frightening actually (be)cause I didn't know what was actually happening . 81976_86126
a viral infection doesn't really describe much . 86146_89206
but &-um I came through it okay . 89758_92008
I was really weak . 92028_92948
I would say that after that week had passed it took me couple months really to feel like my old self again . 92965_100965
&-um but I was okay &=laughs obviously . 100983_105673
I'm okay . 105905_106355
that's it . 108410_110070
sure &=laughs . 112055_112395
what I specifically did about it ? 123388_127528
(..) oh_my_gosh ‡ I am trying to remember a specific incident . 127918_139878
&-um (..) holy_moly ‡ I can't think of anything right offhand . 139926_151796
I know I have been in those situations before . 151980_154700
of_course ‡ I witnessed . 154843_156143
it's not always me that solves the problem . 156178_159158
<let me think> [/] let me think . 159178_161648
well ‡ yeah ‡ that has happened . 167825_171585
on the phone usually . 171635_173595
&-um just because_of cultural differences too . 174148_180308
okay [>] . 182088_182318
&-um well ‡ in the couple instances that I remember I hadta just keep repeating myself . 184248_199368
&-um I would try to slow down my words . 199428_202788
speak clearly . 202805_203955
try to find related words to what I was saying if they didn't understand exactly what I was saying . 204298_209968
and ask them leading questions to see if they understood what I was &-um asking of them or trying to explain to them . 210068_219888
&-um and I believe resolution came about . 219936_223646
from what I recall it sounds like it . 223665_226005
again I can't remember a specific instance with who I spoke to and what we spoke about . 226273_232643
but in those cases you_know the couple +... 232658_242988
<I remember you_know> [//] some time ago &=laughs it worked out okay ‡ I guess . 243060_244660
no . 244708_245218
oh ‡ yeah &=laughs . 254186_254666
oh ‡ &-hm ‡ so many to choose from . 258964_264855
she says trying to remember . 264878_269248
&-um okay ‡ frightened or scared . 269481_274781
&-um (...) well ‡ there was a time I was actually afraid for someone else . 286270_304520
&-um my husband and I when we first started dating he was involved in a group &-um that did medieval reenactment . 304806_315686
and part of their &-um events and &-um group gatherings involved a [/] a large gathering where the people could take on personas of warriors . 315898_332468

by <language problems> [//] &-uh communication problems does it mean someone that mighta had a disorder or is just it an issue communicating ? 956175_965015

okay [>] . 970136_970346

okay ‡ so ‡ a few years ago when I was in school &-uh I was taking a class where I was partnered up with &-uh a student from China <who had a very difficult> [//] who had difficulties communicating verbally in English . 979882_996622
&-um he [/] he was hard to understand . 996667_999047
but I did my best to communicate with him by &-um maybe not trying to understand his complete sentences but trying to pick out words out_of what he was saying and try to match that into the context of what was going on around us to piece together what he might be saying . 999604_1020444
and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on &-uh stating how I was understanding him so_that at some point if I didn't understand him he would realize that I wasn't understanding him . 1021544_1039304
and &+afrel after several weeks it just got easier and easier to understand what he was saying . 1042422_1045922
I would [//] just became accustomed to the accent and the words that he might choose to use . 1046231_1053031
and over time it got easier . 1054081_1055451

and &-uh we hear a knock at the door . 1091917_1094307
and just thinking that maybe it was &-uh another guest or not thinking much of it &-uh the [//] &-uh one of her friends answers the door . 1094934_1103244
and it turns out to be a guy in a mask &-uh attempting to either rob us or rob the house . 1103693_1110513

when I was five years old I had tonsillitis and hadta have my tonsils removed . 56845_62525
it was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to &-uh breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become &-uh sore and aggravated . 62576_71826
so ‡ I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out . 72121_76271
the best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better . 76351_82601
but afterwards going home I hadta take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better which gave me vivid dreams . 82690_89380
and I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo . 89560_95820
and when I woke up screaming it my mother had come in to take care of me and it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake . 95871_109211
and apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsillectomy . 109230_116710
&-um after about a week I got better and I was happy that I never hadta do that again . 116763_123113
I actually had an employee that worked with me that was hearing impaired . 135610_139760
and in_order_to work with her and explain directions and &-uh meet with her on a regular basis we &-uh went and got a sign language specialist that would come in and sit with us and translate from &-uh my speech into sign language to explain &-uh what tasks we had for her or give her regular updates meetings etcetera . 139863_161323
&-um in addition we also learned some basic sign language and worked with her using different electronic means to communicate more easily to get around any communication barriers that we had because_of her hearing impairment . 161413_174773
it worked out well . 176470_177460

&-uh I was in Vail Colorado with some friends and family &-uh to go on a snowmobiling trip . 185241_192891
we decided to go out when we got there later in the day when it was still snowing and take a quick trip around the area to get our bearings . 192988_200018
&-uh there were five of us on snowmobiles . 200225_202695
and this was my first time I had been on a snowmobile even_though I had told them I had ridden them before . 202826_207336
&-uh we began to run through &-um a series of roads in the [/] the backwood(s) areas of Vail . 207451_214271
and it got darker and darker and the snow became &-um snowier and snowier . 214485_219225
&-um as we got through the area the &-uh group began to spread out . 219666_225966
I wasn't going as fast as everyone else and I lost track of the people in front of me . 226060_229560
so ‡ I couldn't see which direction to go and drove off the side of the mountain in my snowmobile . 229716_233726
I tumbled down the hill about a hundred feet crashing through the darkness &-uh falling off the snowmobile and eventually landing and stopping in the snow . 233780_244090
I was momentarily <I think> [//] unconscious . 244135_247585
and when I woke up it was dark and cold and silent which I thought was very bad because I didn't know where I was and I was in a snowstorm in a mountain in Vail somewhere lost . 247608_258158
&-um I began to move around to see if I was injured and I had hurt my back and my head but could still move around find my flashlight and start looking to see where I was . 258511_269031
I actually landed on top of my snowmobile on the side of the mountain at about a forty five degree angle towards the top where the road was . 269578_276718
and I could see with the flashlight the direction where the road and where I had crashed through the mountain was . 276780_281740
so ‡ I began signaling with my flashlight and trying to yell for people when I heard &-uh a snowmobile coming . 282005_287845

&-um what happened +... 117526_118556
oh I went skiing and I fell &=laughs . 118895_120595
didn't think I had done anything but somehow or other I managed to break a bone in my wrist . 121793_125963
and so I hadta go to the hospital . 126038_128168
they hadta x-ray it twice before they figured out where it was . 128186_131126
it hurt like cra
&=head
happened in Colorado . 136206_137146
came back home . 137341_138071
hadta put a cast on it ten weeks . 138388_140238
atrophy . 140658_141098
the most painful thing I've ever had in my life . 141118_143058
you can't move your hands &=laughs afterwards . 143123_145053
so ‡ I hadta go through physical therapy but now it's perfectly fine . 145516_148546
&-um well ‡ it's interesting to try to have a conversation with somebody who &-um English is their second language and their first language is Spanish . 154353_163023
and <I don't know> [//] I know &-like almost zero Spanish . 163043_166163
and so to try to have a conversation of &-um any depth or anything you can really just get the basics . 166255_173225
so ‡ it's very interesting to try to communicate with a s
I think I'm communicating just fine . 187225_188885
I think they're not &=laughs listening . 188903_190333
but [=! laughs] do you mean &-like they couldn't understand what I was saying to them &*INV
&-um can I tell you how that was ? 197659_199189
do you mean &-like what was I feeling ? 199521_200501
what [//] how did I experience that ? 200520_201780
oh_my_gosh ‡ oh ‡ I guess the only time was when I traveled to Mexico . 204091_206951
and &-um &-uh oh they [/] they stop you going down there sometimes . 206975_211435
and they'll pull you over . 211488_212258
and they'll ask you &-like what do you have in your trunk or things like that . 212280_214400
or they'll say something to me . 214423_215393
I have no idea what they are saying to me . 215411_216841
and then finally they'll find English words . 217253_218823
and I'll be [//] &-like &=head
and so <it's just> [/] <it's just> [//] it's [/] &-um it's a little scary because <you don't know> [//] &+w you really don't know what they're trying to say . 223306_230956
and you could get in trouble if you don't respond the right way . 230975_234555
&-um because of communication like that ? 243605_248165
+< or just when was I frightened or scared . 248585_250070
&-um . 250858_251548
you know what ? 256510_256829
it was the strangest thing . 256850_257630
I [/] I made a right hand turn &=ges
and I thought that I looked but I didn't see the car . 259916_262506
and so when I turned once I was turning then I did see the car . 262703_266023
and I thought I was going to get hit but I didn't . 266613_269293
but it's amazing because my entire body flooded with adrenaline . 269355_272645
I felt like I had gotten hit . 272666_273926
nothing had happened but <it just> [//] it scared me like crazy (be)cause I just knew for sure they were going to hit the back of me but they didn't . 274020_280620
<there was> [/] &-hm there was a girl that was out hiking with her family . 287013_292563
and &-um all a sudden there was a storm that came up . 292926_296906
and &-uh in Arizona we get a_lot_of flash floods . 297463_299903
and unfortunately she got in a part where there's the flash floods . 299956_303066
and she got caught out in the water . 303143_304873
she was able to get a hold of a stick and hang onto that . 305356_307506
and so they called the &-uh rangers . 307556_310186
and they came out . 310321_311091
and they rescued her from the water . 311256_313436
&-hm there was a little boy that was outside playing &-uh with his soccer ball . 328038_331948
and he was practicing his kicks and kicked it . 331963_334293
and it got away from him . 334353_335093
and it went through the window of the neighbors house and landed in . 335111_338751
and the neighbor was sitting in his easy chair . 339021_340721
and he got up and saw the hole in the window . 340743_343663
and looked out and saw the little boy . 343678_345448
"and said +""/. 345903_346293"
"+"" well ‡ I guess you're gonna hafta mow my lawn for the next fifteen years to pay off the window . 346430_351300"
www .
okay . [+ exc] 372076_372336
&-um there was a little boy who was leaving to go to school with his backpack . 374153_378463
and his mom told him to take the umbrella . 378541_380021
"and he said +""/. 380036_380466"
"+"" no no I don't need the umbrella . 380923_381873"
so ‡ he waves goodbye to his mom and he heads off to school . 381890_384130
and sure enough it starts raining a little bit . 384151_386281
and then it rains really really hard . 386300_387810
and he's drenched . 387831_388831
so ‡ he decides he better go back home and get his umbrella so he can maybe stay a little bit dry . 389311_393751
okay . 399550_399760
so
and they were mean to her . 405858_407038
they made her do all the chores . 407388_408678
and she became friends with all <the &-um animals> [//] (be)cause we're in the Disney version the animals <in the> [/] &-uh in the &-uh house and outside the house . 408788_417728
and so &-uh there came the announcement <that there was going to be a ball> [//] that the prince was gonna have a ball . 418880_424820
and all the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball . 425051_427521
so ‡ they got all ready to go . 427588_428758
and Cinderella couldn't go to the ball . 428773_430373
but her little friends decided that they would help her . 430390_432970
and her fairy godmother came along and wanted Cinderella to go to the ball . 433288_436058
so ‡ she turned &-um let's see a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses and got her a gown and glass slippers and sent Cinderella off to the ball . 436145_447825
and she met Prince_Charming there . 448455_450375
and she danced with him . 450390_451530
and just had a great time . 451581_453111
but she hadta be back before midnight because everything would go back to pumpkins and mice and everything would disappear except for the glass slipper . 453910_461580
so ‡ <she runs out_of the> [//] &-um she runs out and loses her glass slipper . 461633_466943
and so the prince decides he's gonna try find her by going through the land and taking the glass slipper around . 467375_472415
and &-um trying it on everybody . 472438_474388
and they lock Cinderella up in the tower because the stepmother doesn't want her to try on the slipper in case it fits . 474406_480146
she tries to get the [//] her daughters to cram their feet in it but it doesn't fit . 480165_483505
and their little friends get her out_of the tower . 483526_486006
she comes down . 486573_487223
tries on the slipper . 487241_488051
and it fits . 488071_488661
and then she marries Prince_Charming and lives happily ever after &=laughs . 488736_492056
&-um there was a cat that went up the tree and got stuck .
and the little girl wanted her father to get the cat out .
so ‡ he got the ladder out and climbed up the tree to get the cat .
and then the ladder fell down .
so ‡ he's stuck in the tree .
the cat's stuck in the tree .
and the dog's barking below them .
so ‡ they hadta call the fire department who's coming with a ladder so they can get the cat and the man both out_of the tree .
this is a story about a birthday party gone awry . 240_3920
here was a beautiful birthday cake with candles on it . 3990_7700
and the neighbors were invited over with their children for Tommy's birthday . 8429_13679
apparently he was four years old . 14428_16168
there were four candles on the cake . 16192_18052
but Tommy's dog saw the cake unattended and took a big hunk out_of it . 18701_25691
and then he ran underneath the sofa to hide from the mom who got very angry and had her broom out and was gonna beat the dog with the broom for chewin(g) up the cake . 25768_36778
in the meantime all the guests were arriving . 37217_39497
there was a little boy guest with a (.) present and a little girl guest with the present and their moms . 39580_45070
and they were seeing the whole event unfold as they approached the room for the birthday party . 45460_51190
the end . 52086_52726
the boy was crying . 52832_53752
he wasn't very happy on his birthday . 53798_55388
<in order> [//] you take out your bread . 57722_59802
you lay out your two pieces of bread . 60071_62571
you can put your jelly on one piece and your peanut butter on the other . 62591_66421
flop (th)em together . 67066_68146
slice them . 68193_69133
and voila you have your peanut butter and &+beh jelly sandwich . 69719_73749
&-um I had a gallbladder attack on my &-um twentieth wedding anniversary . 75239_83409
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs . 83567_87897
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown &-uh gallbladder attack which is very very painful . 88003_94713
and so I went to the hospital . 95436_97486
I was beginning to turn green . 97536_99796
and &-um I had the surgery done . 100042_103092
I was in the hospital about three days . 103848_105208
that's before they did it with any kind of scopes . 105232_108202
you_know ‡ they did a regular open laparotomy . 108258_110958
so ‡ &-um +... 111347_112457
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work . 113374_117324
so ‡ &-um I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure . 117529_124509
and then once it's over you feel a_lot better that's for sure . 124740_127800
okay ‡ the problems are word finding and the ability to speak . 133065_137665
&-uh my mother's disability is apraxia aphasia . 138370_142640
and so she sometimes uses different words &-um to try to get her point across . 142853_149423
what I do is I offer her extra time . 150050_152510
sometimes extra processing time helps . 152810_155370
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the “is it this” and touch . 156221_161611
if it's an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever . 161656_165166
&-um sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a_little better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it . 165989_177229
and then because we live with each other and we're together so much I can kind_of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs . 178533_188723
&-like today with [//] &+th I knew she needed some kind of check (be)cause I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring . 188799_195189
and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card . 195238_198658
so ‡ for the most part I can kind_of guess so +//. 198742_202002
&-uh a little bit like Vanna_White . 202504_204094
is it this ? 204307_204897
is it that ? 204946_205626
does it begin with the letter ? 205703_206983
sometimes beginning letters help . 207120_209100
so ‡ that's how we work it out . 209313_211033
&-um my husband and I were in Washington_D_C doing some sightseeing . 214147_218637
and <it turned> [//] when we came off a [/] a boat trip it [/] it got a little darker . 219078_223958
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel . 223980_228440
and so we were walking along . 229183_230763
and it went [//] was pretty isolated street . 230813_233203
there wasn't a_lot_of people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station . 233223_237973
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us you_know maybe twenty yards back . 238705_247055
and it was <three young kids> [//] &+d &-uh three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough . 247106_252646
and so <I was very> [//] I [/] I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing . 252871_258741
and my husband said if they come after us I'm gonna take &=laughs the [/] the movie camera . 258791_263491
and I'll hit em [
and you run like hell . 264028_265078
&=laughs so ‡ we were picking up the pace . 266137_268267
as we picked up the pace they picked up the pace . 268286_270146
and as we turned the corner there was a bus station . 270203_273043
and people were waiting there . 273089_274419
so ‡ we were just so grateful to see other people . 274539_278579
and they backed off . 278626_279456
and they left us alone . 279582_280822
so ‡ I think it <was a> [//] could've been a robbery you_know . 281469_284649
and that's it . 286141_286571
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldn't . 289659_295379
and this lady was driving her s_u_v thinking she could get through the wash . 295783_301553
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along . 301640_305090
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her . 305108_311008
and so it appears as though the [//] <he's strapped> [//] he's got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot . 311159_322749
he's &-uh holding onto a branch that's hanging into the rushing water . 322796_328326
and he is attempting the rescue . 328515_330345
no ‡ I'm not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but I'm assuming that's the belt for helping her . 336036_342696
I don't know . [+ exc] 343086_343586
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer . 345636_352346

goes through the window . 365648_366488
knocks over the lamp . 366541_367641
scares the neighbor . 367718_369028
the neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it . 369139_372179
and he's got the (.) soccer ball in his hand but he can't seem to find who kicked it . 372273_378933
but I'll bet ya [
the end . [+ exc] 383375_384685

well ‡ there he goes out . 410690_411740
and what's happening but his mom was right . 411763_414553
it starts to rain . 414601_415751
first just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder . 416235_420645
and the puddles are deep . 420699_422239
and when he comes home he is soaked to the skin . 422293_425223
his mother is very angry with him (be)cause &+sh he did not listen to her and take the umbrella . 425371_431151
so ‡ the next time that this occurs and there's rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry . 431887_439167
that was a lesson learned . 439560_440840

she uses her as a servant . 467529_469049
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning . 469102_471122
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along . 471900_475580
and &-uh the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals &-um were not treated as well . 475627_482757

and [/] &-um and they all loved her . 488244_490774
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle . 491417_501507
"&-um in the castle there was a wonderful prince, handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married . 502177_510907"

and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery . 525046_531316

she only considered her daughters and she didn't consider &+sa Cinderella at all . 539430_543860

and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress . 554858_559628

&-uh actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store . 77644_82314

very lazy . [+ exc] 94769_95519

the good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread . 97839_101579
cut it in six inch long pieces . 103091_104731
slice it longways so_that it's open . 105694_108324
it's nice and crunchy on top . 109417_110947
it's very soft on the interior . 110967_112797
you take your peanut butter . 112846_115076
crunchy and [!!] [/] &+so and regular . 115784_118894
you mix those together . 119728_120868

and I [/] I like strawberry . 136197_138567
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together . 139243_141583
I put it on there . 141700_143160
and then I take that &+a sandwich . 143208_145558
and I put it in the microwave . 145688_147088
and I heat it so_that the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together . 147788_154538
I still have crunchy on the top . 154586_156836

it is the little boy's birthday . 44446_47776
he's having his birthday party today . 47793_49553
but the dog found the cake . 49573_52653
and ate a big chunk out_of the cake . 52840_54560
and left caky doggie footprints &=laughs all the way under the couch . 54575_59905
the mother is ma
she's got the broom . 62320_63350
I think she's gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why it's hiding . 63365_67615
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived . 67638_71748
so ‡ they are coming in with their presents &-um seeing a [/] a mangled cake for the birthday . 71818_78278
oh ‡ and it looks like the little boy is crying . 78330_81140
&-um okay ‡ so ‡ I was hospitalized well sort_of &-um in November for abdominal surgery . 82306_93006
and &-um I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before . 93028_101588
but it kicked in really fast . 101605_103475
&-like they tell you to take three deep breaths . 103613_105923
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out . 106013_108393
&-um and it was kind_of like taking a long blink . 108470_112420
and then I opened my eyes . 112441_113681
and it was like three hours later . 113700_115290
which was really strange because usually &-like you_know when you sleep you can feel time passing . 115680_120840
&-like it didn't feel like any time had passed . 120860_122690
so ‡ it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that you_know three hours had gone by . 122711_128390
everything was all over with . 128411_129701
&-um and then I was on pain meds [
I stayed overnight . 134438_135738
&-um and then I went home . 135911_139161
I was on pain meds [
&-um but then I [/] I was able to go off of those . 142223_145333
&-um I'm not sure what else you wanna know about it &=laughs . 145356_152346
&-um no not off hand . 153968_157608
&-um okay ‡ so ‡ I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator . 157655_163805
&-um she would hold things in . 163828_166828
and you_know you could just feel the energy that she was upset . 166845_171095
but &-um she wouldn't talk about it . 171113_173933
I asked her on numerous occasions to [//] you_know if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her . 173953_180043
"she always said +""/. 180621_181051"
"+"" no . 181186_181856"
&-um and then &-um she kind_of passively aggressively started you_know not participating in things or you_know just kind_of being rude „ I guess &=laughs . 181903_196553
so ‡ it finally you_know broke my last little straw . 197510_201280
and I yelled at her one day . 201300_203220
and kicked her out_of the group . 203270_204900
so ‡ &=laughs that's what I did about it &=laughs . 205065_209105
okay ‡ well ‡ I'm afraid of heights . 209675_211695
even little heights . 211793_213053
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder . 213186_215646
so ‡ I decided &-uh one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving &-um <you_know thing> [//] you_know jump [//] <I guess that's what you call it a jump> [//] for his birthday . 215670_227620
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too . 227636_230526
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights . 230548_232998
so ‡ we went sky diving . 233540_236590
and it was terrifying . 237115_238345
and <when I> [//] when we jumped out_of the plane you_know you're attached to someone else . 238390_243810
so ‡ when we jumped out_of the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute &=laughs while we were free falling because I was just &-like &=ges
&-um and then the parachute opens . 255495_258295
and then you start gliding which is kind o(f) nice . 258373_260413
<that was> [/] that was better . 260430_261721
it was a little bit more like being a bird you_know and flying . 261745_265445
&-um so ‡ that was nice for a little bit . 266041_267641
and then we landed . 267660_268490
and then that was that . 268508_269418
and I said I'm glad I did it . 269436_270506
and I'll never do it again &=laughs . 270530_272660
and I'm still afraid of heights &=laughs . 272680_274740
&-um so ‡ the story starts with the flood . 275576_280086
there's lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city . 280101_284611
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went <looking for her cat> [//] &-um to save her cat from the flood and the rains . 284660_295790
so ‡ she got caught in the flood . 295813_296763
she got swept downstream . 296781_298381
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out . 298403_302473
and she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her . 302493_306193
&-um someone saw her . 306353_308153
called the fire department . 308203_309553
and now the [/] the firemen are there . 309686_312536
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on . 312553_317383
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him <I think that's what that looks like> [//] &-uh to get her out_of the water . 317430_325360
and that's the end . [+ exc] 325380_329530
okay ‡ the boy is playing soccer outside . 330268_332998
he kicks the ball really hard . 333016_334586
it goes crashing into the window . 335116_336906
&-um it crashes through the window into the lamps [* m
&-um he jumps up . 343483_344833
he grabs the ball . 344853_345893
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it . 345916_348736
yep . [+ exc] 351848_352008
the boy is leaving for school . 352796_355716
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella . 355736_359376
it might rain . 359400_360080
"and he says +""/. 360101_360501"
&=head
"+"" I'll be fine . 362493_363093"
"+"" bye mom . 363203_363853"
so ‡ he leaves . 364356_365426
he goes outside . 365476_366376
and it's sprinkling a little bit . 366396_367936
and then it's r
and there's puddles all over . 370265_371565
and mom was right . 371668_373028
so ‡ he's running back home in the rain . 373178_375288
he comes home all sopping wet . 375340_377520
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face . 377761_380661
and he gets the umbrella . 380685_382815
and leaves again for school with the umbrella . 383086_386016
okay ‡ well ‡ the father his wife dies . 388440_391590
and he is left in the care of his &-um single daughter . 391613_395803
and he remarries . 395821_396961
and he remarries &-um &-uh evil [//] but &+ee she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella . 397013_404353
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own . 404376_408096
and they live together . 408165_410135
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen . 410185_418145
and the dad is kind_of nowhere in this <part of the story> [=! laughs] &=laughs . 418906_423536
and then &-um there's [//] Cinderella [//] let's see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them . 423880_434160
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream . 434176_439536
so ‡ then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married . 440046_446426
and he must have a ball to find his wife . 446441_448571
so ‡ they send out invitations to [//] around the town . 449091_453371
and the stepmother gets the invitation . 453421_455821
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince . 455845_460175
so ‡ they get ready . 460820_462290
Cinderella has the [/] the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress . 462308_466628
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them . 466651_469951
but her sister's say no she can't go . 469973_472593
she hasta stay and clean . 472666_474126
and they rip her dress . 474148_475248
she goes back up to her room crying while her <sisters and> [//] stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball . 475908_482098
&-um then the [//] &+fair her fairy godmother appears . 482816_485926
and says she will create (.) the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball . 486033_493533
but she has back by midnight or she'll turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin . 493556_500296
so [//] and she gets glass slippers . 500978_502688
so ‡ she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers . 503168_505188
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her . 505395_508755
and her stepmother and the sisters don't know who she is because she looks so different . 508773_514143
and then it gets to be midnight . 514164_516254
"and she says +""/. 516476_516916"
"+"" oh ‡ I needta go home . 517265_518515"
so ‡ she runs away from the prince . 518635_520135
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs . 520265_523615
and she runs home . 523668_525428
and the [//] her dress turns back to rags . 525443_528973
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin . 529066_530626
but she still has her glass slipper . 530645_532225
then the next day the prince sends out &-um someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was . 532275_547675
so ‡ they show up with the slipper at her house . 548108_550548
and the stepmother <locks her in the room> [//] locks Cinderella in the room . 550665_554145
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsister's feet which it doesn't fit because they have big feet . 554165_560255
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room . 560300_566630
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper . 566651_570191
and lo_and_behold it fits . 570243_571813
so ‡ they bring her back to the prince . 572210_574990
and they get married . 575045_576275
and they live happily ever after . 576291_577851
&-um the little girl's pet cat is stuck up in the tree .
she's gotten off her tricycle and is concerned .
jumping up and down trying to get the cat to come down .
the father decides to help .
so ‡ he gets the ladder .
climbs up the tree .
and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down .
and the dog is barking at him .
and is probably going to bite him when he comes down .
&-um but in the meantime the fire department is coming .
they're on their way with the ladder to come save both the man and the cat .
&-uh you take &-uh some bread . 60_5030
you take some peanut butter . 12381_12701
you take some jelly and a knife .
and you get two pieces of bread .
you take the knife . 12701_12711
spread the peanut butter on one piece of the bread . 18138_18148
take the knife .
and spread &-uh the jelly on the other piece .
and put the two pieces together .
&-uh there's a birthday cake on the table .
and it's the little boy's birthday .
but when you look at the cake you see that there was <a big hole> [//] &+t a big bite taken out_of the cake .
and there are &+d paw prints going to the dog that's hiding under the couch .
so ‡ the mother is mad and chasing the dog with the broom (be)cause she's upset .
and at the same time that she's chasing the dog and upset about the cake being bitten into &-uh the little boy has friends arriving for his birthday party with gifts .
&-um &-um &-uh one time I was playing with some weights at a gym .
and &-um I was trying to fix something .
and the weights came down and smashed my thumb .
&-uh I remember it was throbbing . 81655_81695
it hurt . 81975_82025
but it healed and got better .
&=head
&=head
&-um &+w &-uh I've spent time out_of the country with people that didn't speak English .
and I usually ended up acting things out like I was playing charades to get myself understood .
(..) or scared +...
&-uh yeah ‡ I useta live in California .
and I was there for the big Northridge earthquake .
that was pretty scary .
&-um &-uh yeah ‡ it was about five in the morning and my dog started barking .
and &-uh he usually didn't get up that early to start barking .
so ‡ I was a_little alarmed . 160361_160471
and I turned around . 161658_162348
and before I could open my mouth to say “what is it” “what do you hear” all_of_a_sudden I started to feel the ground shake . 172111_172211
and you could feel it .
and then I heard crashes and boom and crash and boom .
and &-um I lived in California on a hillside .
and so <I was> [/] I was in the back of the house .
and I was only afraid that the front half of the house had fallen off and fell down the hill .
&-um but when I've [//] it seemed like it stopped .
and it seemed like it went on for a long time .
but I'm guessing it was probably ten seconds .
&-um but when I finally got up to go look &-um my kitchen was a mess and [/] and half the things in every cabinet had fallen on the floor but the structure of the house was intact .
but &-uh I had a_lot_of stuff to clean up .
&-uh there's a girl caught in the water in a current .
and &-uh she's stuck . 228065_228145
and &-uh the guy with the life jacket on is holding onto a tree and trying to rescue her .
&-uh there's a boy outside kicking around a soccer ball .
he kicks the soccer ball . 261185_261266
it hits the window . 263345_264195
breaks the window . 265140_265380
and goes into the house . 268211_268261
it knocks over a lamp where a man is sitting . 273985_274035
and the man gets up . 274105_274185
takes the ball . 274596_274676
and goes to look over the window to see where the ball came from .
&-uh there's a little boy who's leaving for school .
and his mother's handing him an umbrella .
&-uh he tells her he doesn't need the umbrella .
and he leaves . 301271_301351
while he's outside walking it starts to rain . 307965_308015
and then it's coming down even harder . 308635_308725
and he's coming home . 309205_309255
and she looks at him (be)cause he's all wet . 373463_374123
and he gets the umbrella and goes back out .
now he has the umbrella to protect him .
now you're really testing my memory &=laughs .
&-um &=clears_throat there was a [/] a woman with two daughters .
and she married a man who had a daughter . 390226_390236
and once they got together &-uh the woman's daughters &-um turned the man's daughter into sort_of <their housekeeper> [//] their servant and treated her very poorly .
&-um and &-uh she was never very happy . 417716_417726
&-uh then the mother got an invitation to a fancy ball that the king was having and the prince was having at the land .
and &+sh the woman was getting her daughters ready .
and Cinderella was looking at some pretty dresses and trying to decide what to wear .
and the stepsisters were taking her clothes and taking parts of her dress .
and she was all upset .
and they were getting all dressed to go to the ball .
and then a fairy godmother came and found Cinderella upset .
and &-um waved her magic wand .
and gave Cinderella a gorgeous dress .
and made her all pretty .
and she went to the ball .
and she spent most of the evening dancing with the prince .
and &-uh she had been told by the fairy godmother at the stroke of midnight she must leave .
and so when she heard the clock strike midnight she started to run out_of there .
and as she left &+sh one of her glass slippers fell off .
and &-um so she &-uh went home .
and the prince was trying to find her .
but she was gone . 417986_418036
and one of his servants found the glass slipper and gave it to the prince .
and then he starts going around looking for who it fits .
and when he got to her house and found Cinderella and put it on her foot he saw it fit .
and &-uh the stepmother and the stepsisters were all upset that it turned out it was Cinderella .
and then she and the prince got together and lived happily ever after .
&-uh there's a little girl who owns a cat .
and her cat went outside and started climbing up a tree .
the cat got stuck in the tree .
so ‡ she went and told her dad .
and the dad came out .
and brought a ladder .
and climbed up the tree to get the cat .
while he climbed up the tree the ladder fell on the ground .
and he's stuck up in the tree with the cat .
&-uh the dog is barking up the tree trying to get them .
but he can't do anything .
so ‡ someone must have called the firemen .

we were really scared we weren't gonna get Benita out . 270568_272558

&+brea breaks a lamp . 326311_329011

okay ‡ Cinderella was an only child . 367175_371995

&-um but Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life . 408346_415926

he was a mean old cat . 421136_422216
that was the stepmother's cat . 422231_423491

so ‡ I was in the hospital for four days with no tv . 204998_207878

&-um my mom &-uh when I was twenty one had a brain tumor . 211576_221636
and she went in for surgery . 222440_224280
and when she came back out +//. 224300_225760
&-uh this is in the late seventies . 226610_228630
they did the surgery . 228765_229865
they got the tumor out . 229881_230961
but at the same time it caused some damage to her ability to speak well and to &-uh understand well . 231011_240901
&-um it [/] it was difficult &-uh trying to develop &-uh lists of things that she wanted done around the house . 241381_252201
&-um but we managed to work out a pretty good system of &-uh you_know +... 252295_260685
she'd write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper which she always kept with her . 260891_267591
and that seemed to help a_lot because you_know she could remember something short term but an hour from now forget it . 268043_275433
but just by carrying that pad around with her all the time she was able to make lists of things so when I came home I knew what she wanted done . 275891_285041
and we were able to you_know bridge the gaps for awhile until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home . 285093_292363
I've had a stress free life &=laughs . 292446_296976
okay . 297233_297883
when I was in high school I was out with some friends at Presque_Isle . 297943_304463
there's no death in this story . 304648_306538
&-um and &-uh we were walking along . 308058_312018
and it's all rocks along the edge of Lake_Superior . 312038_314538
it's not a beach at that particular spot . 314590_316780
and it was a big rock cliff on one side &=ges
and I looked over at it . 320698_321778
and I thought I could climb it . 321800_323450

and I got up within about five ten feet to the top and then ran out o(f) hand holds . 339366_345536
and I was looking down &=looks
I didn't wanna look down anymore . 348653_350723
it was way far down . 350773_352523
but I was able to move off to one side . 352571_355991
and there was a tree that was actually &=raises
and I was able to reach up with one hand &=raises
but at that point I was pretty darn scared because I didn't know how secure that tree was . 366046_373996
but there was only one way to find out . 375783_377283
and it was strong enough since I'm here &=laughs . 377816_381186
&-uh this woman was walking . 384716_388946
and all_of_a_sudden a flash flood came up and swept her down stream . 389626_394716
fortunately she was lucky enough to grab on to a tree branch and hold on . 394771_400031
"and a rescue (.) worker came along looking to see if there are any victims in the flood, saw her out there begging for help . 400080_409510"

and brings a belt <so_that they'll be able to> [//] with a rope attached to it that so_that they'll be able to pull her back to shore safely . 414728_421568
and boy she looks cold . 422268_423968
little boy is getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella . 427061_430151

it starts raining harder and harder . 448305_450075
"he turns around, runs back and runs into the house . 450681_454071"

so ‡ he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school again . 468506_475376
there's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can . 475430_483950
the ball sails quite a ways . 484003_486053
in_fact ‡ it sails &+s so far it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room . 486168_492008
when it comes through the glass after breaking a window it even knocks over a lamp in the living room . 492526_497616
"the man who's sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through jumps up, grabs the ball and looks out the window . 497665_507065"
but the boy's run away . 507115_509105
there once was a young girl called Cinderella . 512371_515541
she had three ugly stepsisters . 516010_518500
and her family (.) didn't like her very much and made her do all

&-um one day the prince was gonna have a big ball . 537641_544651

"+"" well ‡ you're gonna need <a horse or> [//] horses and a coach to ride . 585718_589518"

and she <gives her> [//] gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball . 599350_603910

she's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince . 619268_622608
he just wants to dance with her all night . 622625_624425
when she all_of_a_sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight . 624888_628948
oh_goodness . 628970_630420
so ‡ she turns and races out_of the ball . 630585_632835
and in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers . 633448_636968
falls off of her foot . 637191_638541
hops into her carriage . 640131_641081
and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight the horses change back into mice . 641191_647021
the carriage changes back into a pumpkin . 647070_649890
and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen . 649906_654126
she sneaks into the house . 655471_656591
and all her stepsisters &+wha were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady . 656741_665901
he tries to find her . 667323_668403
and all he hasta go by is the one glass slipper that she &+f lost behind her . 668638_675238
he goes around . 676206_676726
he tries every girl is town to see whose foot the slipper will fit on . 676746_680926
the three &+step [//] stepsisters all try to squeeze their feet into that glass slipper as hard as they can . 680978_687168

there was a cat that was walking outside when all_of_a_sudden a dog came along and chased the cat right up a tree . 708741_716371
a little girl on her tricycle saw that her cat was up the tree . 718238_722818

dad &+deci came out to see what all the commotion was about . 727306_732246

unfortunately once he got up the tree the ladder fell down . 740360_745260

they'd seen the river ride for many many many years . 420906_423696
and never felt like they were threatened . 423761_426431
well ‡ this day the river rose up . 426476_428556
and came up to the bottom level of their house . 428715_431865
they decide to move upstairs . 432268_434238
and the water was still rising . 434291_436441
the rain was still coming down . 436456_437636
it was becoming &+nar nighttime . 437656_439186
they moved up to the top of their house where they were able to sit on the roof . 439276_442866
and &-uh Mister and Missus Jones looked aroun(d) . 443580_447690
and they didn't see their daughter . 447748_449628
their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddy_bear . 449796_453126
and the water had already risen that high . 453180_455600
so ‡ she had been swept away by the river . 456110_458460
the parents suddenly realized . 458573_461633
they heard a yelling and a screaming . 461681_463931
they looked from the rooftop . 464010_465890
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river . 465936_470976
luckily with our technology the Jones had a cellphone . 471828_475088
they dialed nine-one-one and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid . 475106_480636
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out . 480685_485865
they threw out a line across the river . 486111_488181
it was secure . 488241_490461
he climbed out clinging to the rope . 490521_493351
and saw the Jones' daughter . 493443_494213
he reached down . 495408_497058
grabbed her . 497110_498590
she grabbed ahold of his arm . 499363_500633
he wrapped a &+th &+s &-uh device around &+hi her waist to secure her body to his . 500650_505260
and climbed back across the rope back to the riverside . 505495_509615
Jessica was safe . 509666_511926
the family were delighted to see that she was okay . 513299_515570
but they learned a lesson . 515592_516693
next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home . 516715_521835

so ‡ water &=shows
people drink colas and +...

my wife and son are coming next week .
"+"" and oh_my_god here I am in the hospital ."
so ‡ <I was really> [//] I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it .
(ex)cept [//] for the first time in my life ever .
not death but enough to the point where something seriously wrong here .
that [/] that was the point of my story .
I [//] I've never had that . 227455_227535
at forty eight years old I'm too young for this .
in nineteen ninety six I was living in Japan .
and I was contacted by a local city .
a city named Uwajima which is very near where my wife's &-hm traditional home town is in the mountains of a small village area .
&-um their local high school fishing cooperative ship kind_of like the sail USA or go around the world &=ges
up [//] the submarine came up &=ges
&-um this went on for months .
and the Japanese government demanded an apology .
the US government didn't wanna apologize nor the xxx of the US Navy .
at the end of the day they didn't know what to do .
"at the local government some friends of a friend of a friend of a friend found me and said +""/."
"+"" we are not able to communicate with them ."
"+"" can you please explain to me what the difference is to an American of “I'm sorry” ."
"+"" what does “excuse me” mean ?"
I am talking about having a meeting with the secretary of the Japanese self-defense .
so ‡ kind_of a &-hm secretary of defense who I would never normally meet .
"and the mayor, two <congress people or> [//] parliament members +//."
sorry .
&-um and about forty very very very pissed off Japanese parents who had lost children wanting [//] demanding to understand what the English concept or the western concept was “I'm sorry” .
I hadta prepare a presentation for this .
"and then I thought +""/."
how am I going to explain what is “I'm sorry” ?
it's like movies and songs we use this so often .
yet it [/] it has very very traditional deep meanings and depending on the level of the insult &+pesh perceived or injury perceived or not there are different ways to apologize in Japanese and all cultures .
as we [/] we have levels of formality .
anyway my next job was then I was to go to the US Navy representative through the US Embassy &-um to ask could they apologize .
&=laughs I'm not a diplomat and I don't pretend to be .
but I was also in the US Navy .
so ‡ one thing led to another and I met with the people .
I was flown over to Hawaii with several of these Japanese to act as an intermediary watching these two groups try to communicate over a week period over something that was just the most absolutely dreadful topic for them .
dead school children .
clearly <a mistake by one> [//] an accident .
and how do you get beyond it ?
all they would've been happy with <if that captain of the US Navy had> [//] &+all if the US Navy had allowed the captain to do what he wanted . 405558_405568
he wanted to apologize but he was &+n not allowed .
he was prohibited . 405608_405788
US government policy .
that's fine . 408923_408973
"but because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing, &-um the communication never developed ."
two years after the man was fired ?
the captain ?
"he came back to that area by himself, his wife and his children and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the US government even more angry ."
"so ‡ I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends, the Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends, but what was caught in the middle were some families and a &+s truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble ."
stupid . 450758_450878
&=laughs .
&-uh when my wife was seven months pregnant we got news from her family that her mother in-law was dying of intestinal cancer .
we were living away from them at the time .
we were living in Japan .
&-uh excuse me .
we were living in Germany but they were back home in Japan .
the [//] my wife's &-uh pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy .
and it was her first child .
so ‡ I hadta go back to represent her in the Japanese mind anyway for my wife and I [//] to see the mother in-law .
in a period of three months I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about .
&-uh the biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die .
I talked to the doctor . 517717_517977
&-uh but the father didn't know . 519965_520025
they kept that information from the father .
they didn't wanna tell him .
I've never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying .
the mother didn't know she was dying .
so ‡ I was afraid that my wife couldn't get home .
&-um the sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary .
and I will never be able to answer that question of “what if” .
so ‡ that to me is a scared &-uh situation that I clearly remember .
okay . [+ exc] 557550_557620
after a series of unusually <late spring &-uh excuse me> [//] late winter early spring storms and a very quick warm [//] warming period the rivers and [/] and the local area overflowed .
&-um there were flash floods and several people were trapped or swept away .
in this case the [//] a young woman was trapped in the river and holding on to a tree for probably a very long time .

well ‡ sure enough mother knows best .
just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour .
and the boy was running back home to get his umbrella .
when he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him .
"+"" I told you ."
and he then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school .
nothing that any other boy probably hadn't done in their life . [+ exc]
"&-uh the young boy's in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing, breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television, upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window ."
"well ‡ in the tradition of good old story books, once upon a time there was a <huh what> [//] landowner, well [/] well endowed family who adopted a little girl ."
&-uh the little girl came into a family in which the mother and <the two sisters> [//] the two daughters <pardon me> [//] did not really appreciate having her around .
and as she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse .
&-um but &+n she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself .
&-uh &=clears_throat one day after +//.
&-uh excuse me . [+ exc]
the [//] <in the> [/] in the castle there was a prince and a king .
and the king was adamant that his son get married and &+k had been insisting and insisting .
and in order to help the son decide who might be a [//] &+suf &-uh an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a &+di dance .
invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom .
one day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that I mentioned .
"and the mother and the evil sisters &-uh were all happy to realize and think +""/."
"+"" here's our chance . 799823_800423"
"+"" <one of us> [//] we can get married to this handsome prince ."
and so they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would &+k &-uh go to the party .
"and meanwhile Cinderella had been listening and thinking +""/."
"+"" oh ‡ that's too bad . 815961_815991"
she was very sad about herself .
but [//] and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book .
and &=clears_throat one thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help Cinderella realize her dreams .
she tried to create a dress and give hope to Cinderella that she too could have a better life .
unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what Cinderella had been hoping .
and they ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others .
so ‡ Cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made Cinderella &+wa to be a very very attractive woman .
<on the eve of the> [//] on the night of the dance Cinderella attended the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person .
noone could recognize that it was Cinderella because indeed she had changed so much .
&-uh however the fairy godmother had reminded Cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because that's when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be [//] revert to their original shape or character .
so ‡ at the stroke of midnight Cillarella [
"he then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman, mystery woman ."
he carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom .
when he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where Cinderella lived he of_course wanted to have everyone try it on .
and of_course the mother tried but it didn't fit .
and the sisters tried and the shoe didn't fit .
and Cinderella tried and it fit .
and from then on love took over .
and they lived happily ever after .
yesterday I was watching the news when I saw this crazy story .
&-uh turned out that this man was going to help &+h his cat that was stuck up in the tree .
so ‡ he took the ladder out .
and the daughter was very happy that they were gonna be able to save the cat .
but once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down .
and the girl started panicking .
so ‡ she ran and called her mother .
and the mother called the fire department .
and the fire department came to help him down .
&-uh well ‡ it's birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old .
and &-uh maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite out_of cake which he obviously knew he wasn't sposta do because he's hiding under the couch . 16440_16730
and the boy's crying . 16730_16950

&-uh so ‡ I can't say that <I really> [//] other_than saying “hi Julio how are you” I never really went much beyond that .
and plus at the time <I couldn't excuse me> [//] I couldn't hear well .
so ‡ I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway .
so +...
that's about it . 111696_111916
one time I was just &+m moseying down the street in a car and &-uh was preparing to turn left .
and I thought I had my signal on .
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough .
but then somebody else who I don't even know where he came from I think he was walking out_of the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done .
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something .
&=laughs thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didn't [//] you_know wasn't upset .
"he just said +""/. 151690_151740"
"+"" oh ‡ I ran into you ."
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness .
oh apparently &-uh this girl has fallen into some water that's [//] maybe there's a flood or a storm .
and a man &-uh is trying to rescue her .
apparently she's been holding onto a tree branch .
and he's trying to get a hold of her .
but she won't let go of the tree branch probably .
about all I can say . [+ exc] 178401_179791
well ‡ hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window .
it's really improbable . [+ exc]
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp .
&-um but &-uh obviously the boy has ran away because the man can't see him when he goes in at the window .
this is kind_of improbable too . [+ exc] 200090_200120
the mother wants to give the [/] the boy an [/] an umbrella .
he doesn't want it . 204735_204835
so ‡ he goes off and gets wet . 205733_207003
&-um this is the improbable part . [+ exc] 209305_209395
he doesn't like getting wet . 210000_210280
he runs back to his mom who's mad .
and he's wet so he takes the umbrella .
now my son would love getting wet . [+ exc]
&-um &=laughs looking at that I can hear the music &=laughs from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old .
&-um Cinderella &-uh is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother .
&-uh wicked and stepmother always go together . [+ exc]
she has <two ugly> [/] &+sist two &+ug ugly stepsisters .
I can't remember their names . [+ exc]
one of them (i)s Drizella or something equally ugly .
&-um anyway &-uh Cinderella is forced [/] forced to work like a drudge for the [/] the rest of the family who are cruel to her .
&-um but an edict comes from the &-uh +... 254706_254976
I think I'm spinning tales here . [+ exc]
an edict comes from the prince that they're going to have a ball .
and every maiden is &-uh eligible to go to the ball .
&-uh but Cinderella's mother [//] stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready .
&-uh and at last the girls drive away &-uh in their carriage and Cinderella's left behind &-um crying in the cinders .
&-um then the little mice come to her aid and start &-uh +...
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working .
&-um and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because &-uh yeah they didn't want her to go . 317331_317381
so ‡ then the fairy godmother enters the picture .
&-um this is not in sequence at all . [+ exc]
&=laughs &-um and of_course she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the [/] the pumpkin carriage .
&=laughs oh yeah . [+ exc]
"and she goes off to the ball where of_course she is the bell of the ball, meets the prince ."
the prince falls in love with her on sight .
but at twelve o'clock she hasta run off .
she leaves her slipper . 328263_329133
&-um I guess that story goes all the way to the end . [+ exc]
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the [/] the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper .
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they don't fit .
so ‡ he find [* m
here's one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree .
and then this &-uh the [/] the father has climbed up to rescue the cat .
and now he needs to be rescued .
for some reason (.) the ladder is on the ground .
and nobody has put it up there .
so ‡ here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad .
that's all . [+ exc]
yeah ‡ well ‡ get your slice of bread whether wheat or white . 903_3713
&-uh what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first . 4395_7105

<take it out_o(f) > [//] &-uh open up the jar . 7870_9560

&-uh put that on the other slice of bread . 22819_24769
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter . 25053_27403
spread it over the bread . 27490_28630
and put the two slices together . 28737_30457
a little girl was &-uh (.) riding through the neighborhood on her bike . 32232_37913
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree . 38541_41181
&-uh (..) &-uh her father came along . 42180_46850

father &=sniffles went and got the ladder . 52497_54077
climbed up the tree . 54130_55240
and then a neighborhood dog came by . 55454_57314
and noticed a man up in a tree . 57330_58850
and started barking at the man up the tree . 58940_60900
and accidentally knocked down the ladder . 60923_62463
so ‡ the man was stuck in the ladder along &=laughs with the cat . 62849_65519
and the fire department hadta be called to &-uh rescue them both . 66052_69202
&-uh it was <about I guess> [//] about seven years ago I really hurt my back . 70373_74283
there's this family that I go and visit that has a little child . 74520_78260
and from the time that child was born as a little boy &-uh I always picked him up and swung him around . 78774_85184
&-uh but <as this boy was getting older> [//] as I was getting older <I [/] I guess> [//] I can't do some of the things that [/] that &-uh I &+n normally do . 85840_96010
&-uh this particular &-uh time I picked the boy up . 96518_99928

&+m &+b swingin(g) [//] pickin(g) him up by the arms . 102311_104381
and I spread my legs wide open . 104524_106594
and I was swinging him &-uh backwards and forwards . 106648_108948
and I felt something snap in my back . 109333_111633
&-uh I was in excruciating pain . 112687_114657
I almost dropped the kid &=laughs . 114679_115819
&-uh I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids . 117022_124032
but this was pain like I have never felt before . 124088_127188
because even just to walk or [/] or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms it's all tied into the back . 127238_137288
it would be like a knife was twisting so . 137440_139770
that's [/] that's the injury . 140778_141678
and it put me out_o(f) commission for a couple o(f) weeks . 141700_143700
&-uh and &-uh the thing that comes <to the> [/] to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating wit(h) someone else . 147277_154097
&-uh it's the family that I described earlier with a child . 154703_157783
they're Hispanic . 157800_158670
and their English is not very good . 158839_161249
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school . 161294_165444
&-uh but whenever &-uh oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want +... 165929_172829
I help them with their homework . 172844_174194
my wife she speaks Spanish . 174209_175589
so ‡ it's alright when she goes over there . 175606_177196

&-uh and &-uh trying to convey my wants and desires . 180791_184501
and also me trying to listen to theirs . 184555_186625
I don't always understand what they're talking about . 187039_190449
or [//] <and then> [//] and they don't understand what I'm talkin(g) about . 190970_193170
yeah ‡ in high school <a friend of mine> [//] myself and a friend of mine we ditched &-uh class so_that we could climb Camelback_Mountain . 195441_201921
neither one of us had ever climbed Camelback_Mountain . 202297_204537
so ‡ we didn't realize exactly you_know where to go or where to start . 204637_208567
&-uh we just picked a spot on the &-uh northern side of the mountain . 209519_214279
you_know ‡ walked in between some of those &-uh very expensive homes . 215125_219425
and started climbing . 219495_220615
little did we know &-uh we really had gotten ourselves in [/] in a_lot_of trouble doing that . 221316_227546
&-uh there were times where we were actually &+ch hanging onto cliffs or tryin(g) to c(l)imb up cliffs you_know &-uh &-uh <just to> [/] just to get from one point to another . 227563_239113
&-uh about halfway up &-uh we're sittin(g) on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot . 239580_246240
"and &-uh I said to him I says +""/. 246833_248693"
"+"" man there's no way we can go back the same way we came . 248828_251118"

"+"" so am I ! 253767_254477"
and so <we knew the only way> [//] <the only thing> [//] we [/] we figured what we hadta do is &-uh make it to the top . 254948_260017
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side . 260072_263042
but then we would still hafta hike all &=laughs the way back around the mountain to get to our car . 263540_267200
&-uh (.) to make a long story short . 267254_271214
&-uh you_know ‡ we were all scuffed [/] &+k scuffed up . 271381_273471
we were tired scratched up &+chlor clothes torn . 273522_276782
&-uh but &-uh we could finally see we were kind_of getting to the top . 277842_280992
as we were approaching the top we saw more people &-uh up there . 281159_284639
and &-uh older people younger people . 285425_288375
&+a we couldn't believe it that you_know <these people> [//] all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time . 288722_294742
"so ‡ when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we [/] &+sa we asked them +""/. 295372_299172"
"+"" how'd you get up here ? 299358_300268"

&+a and &=laughs we couldn't believe that there was a trail . 303649_306609
&=laughs so ‡ &-uh &-uh after that experience &-uh you_know I thank God for helpin(g) us through it . 307188_313538
&-uh because it [/] &-uh <it really> [/] it really made me understand why people hadta be rescued from Camelback_Mountain . 313987_320177
and I understand how people can get stuck . 320200_322240
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges . 322488_325768
but prior to that experience &-uh I [/] I [/] I couldn't understand how could people &+n get to a certain place and not get back down the same way . 325815_333645
&-uh a couple decided they would go &-uh white water rafting . 338379_344539
&-uh (.) and so (.) &-uh they were white water rafting . 345200_351830
the man told his girlfriend to put on her vest . 351853_355503

fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to [/] to stay afloat &-uh &+a and last long enough to [/] to float to the edge and grab a branch . 398075_408575
his &-uh girlfriend was coming quickly behind him . 409174_411954

(.) an(d) then the father died . 400846_405456
(.) an(d) so Cinderella was &+l left in the care of the wicked stepmother . 407276_411436
an(d) she was very mean to her . 412381_414351

an(d) I think called her names an(d) made her do all their chores as_well . 424514_429664
an(d) so she [/] she made friends with all the animals . 430528_434068
an(d) [//] because she was lonely . 435740_438730
and [/] (.) <an(d) then> [/] &-um (.) an(d) then an announcement came . 438810_446010

an(d) so they all got excited an(d) wanted to go to the ball . 453622_457202
an(d) since Cinderella was prettier than the other two &-uh stepsisters the mother (.) didn't want her to go . 459071_468571
because she wanted (.) one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince . 468683_474853
so ‡ she locked &-uh Cinderella in the tower . 476319_481579

and (.) so

an(d) that's what infuriated the stepmother . 510928_513018
an(d) she tore up the dress . 513038_514258
an(d) then locked her in the room . 514318_516707
an(d) then Cinderella was crying . 516727_518227
an(d) <then she> [//] then the fairy godmother came . 518241_521121

turne(d) mice into white horses . 539670_542540
and &-uh the dog into a coachman . 543762_546452

an(d) she met the prince dance(d) with him . 550745_552345
an(d) the &-um fairy godmother told her that she hadta leave by midnight or she [//] everything would return as it was . 553650_562430

&=tongue_clicks an(d) she ran an(d) ran an(d) got back in the coach . 577551_581141
an(d) they started goin(g) down the road . 581160_582500
an(d) then every ding when the clock struck twelve turne(d) back to the way it was . 582520_586620
an(d) she was very sad but she had a good time . 587687_590017

an(d) so &=tongue_clicks she went home . 595183_597843
an(d) then the next day +... 597893_599883
an(d) the prince really liked her so +... 601078_603558
an(d) he had this glass slipper so (.) &-um +... 603579_607499
so ‡ he sent out a decree to find this woman with the &=laughs glass slipper . 608753_613983
an(d) so they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyone's foot . 615185_622025
an(d) it wouldn'(t) fit anybody . 622047_623507
an(d) &+k (h)e finally came to Cinderella's house . 623523_625653
an(d) they tried (.) the &-um slippers on the stepsisters an(d) [/] an(d) it wouldn't fit . 625710_632020
an(d) then &+cin they were gonna try it on Cinderella . 632070_637120
an(d) the stepmother tripped the [/] the [/] &-uh the little guy with the slipper . 637142_643902

<a little girl has taken her> [//] <not neccesarily taken but> [//] a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree . 31796_31856
<and the> [//] &-uh apparently a man <has brought> [//] has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder .

a dog may well have accompanied him .
there was a dog there . 31896_31936
and the &-uh fire department has also arrived (.) with their ladder .
and they are approaching the scene .
and they are certainly going to get the cat down <and well> [//] along with the man more than likely .
&=shrugs and everything will be just fine .
the first step is to assemble the items you need .
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a &-uh knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread .
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread .
and <you would> [//] how I would go about doing it <I was> [//] I would put [//] &-uh spread jelly on [/] on one slice of bread .
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread .
and I would put the two of them together .
and then &=shrugs &+m eat the sandwich . 85043_85443
my recollection I haven't ever been seriously injured but &-um one of the [/] &-uh the typical but more unusual things I've encountered would be chicken pox .
not that that's unusual but for me a seriousness .
and I don't recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that .
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience .
not excruciating pain but [/] but quite a bit of &+unc discomforts .
+< and the &+applica application of calamine lotion (.) to &-uh ease &-uh <the sores> [//] the itchiness [>] of the sores .
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didn't obey mother's advice fully of not picking at the scabs .
so ‡ that's my recollection of chicken pox .
the person who I've had the most difficulty communicating with was my father .
<and I> [//] in part due to he suffered from a [//] some type of ataxia .
and [/] and <he was> [//] well <I was> [/] I was born when he was in his forties so I_mean <he was> [//] <by the time I was> [//] he was <quite elderly by the time> [//] not quite elderly but up there in years [>] by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so .
but he [//] &-uh (.) <in part I> [//] he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of <his failing> [/] his failing ability to walk adequately and &-uh +...
but he was very [/] (.) very [//] &-um (.) little bit short tempered I'd say .
+< and <just wanting> [//] he badly wanted to do things himself .
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind o(f) thing .
but he couldn't do it . 189038_189138
so ‡ he'd ask for help . 190403_191053
and then you'd try to help . 192505_193005
and he would put his hands <in the> [/] in the project .
and it was just more trouble .
and &+wh when you tried to say you_know .
"+"" I hafta do this myself ."
he would get frustrated .
and it was just &-uh very difficult time trying to communicate [>] that we both can't do this .
so ‡ and just [/] just an overall (.) difficulty .
occasionally it would brew into an argument .
and there would be some walking away because it's either you do this or I do this .
and we both can't do this .
and you_know I know you'd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but &-um +/.
it's &+ju you [/] you just try to remain calm .
and [/] and just explain the situation as best you can .
and [/] and try to resolve it .
and of_course there were good days and bad days .
you_know ‡ days where he'd be more tolerant of [/] of that kind of thing .
but [/] but just &+a it was more of a communication issue (.) that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do .
"so ‡ even_though he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied &+wi &+j &+th &+s &+in &+a assistance because it was more +""/."
"+"" I wanna be able to do this ."
so +...
the [//] &-uh not too long ago maybe a couple of years ago .
my girlfriend and I had taken a trip to Flagstaff to go into the lava tubes .
there was something there called the lava tubes .
<it's a> [//] &-uh it's [/] &+na it's near &+fr Flagstaff .
and it's [/] <it's just an underground> [//] well it was produced by volcanic activity .
and it's a very large crevice in the ground .
kind_of a [/] a tunnel . 293113_293183
and &-um we had gone in it then . 295323_295733
I believe it was a Sunday afternoon .
and it was rather late in the day .
and by the time the &-um +...
and in the center of this [/] this thing +...
it's basically a straight tunnel .
+< but in the center there is a [//] &-um and [//] somewhat of a (.) I [//] &+re you'd call it a pole .
it's not really a pole but it's [/] it's +//.
the [/] &-um the tunnel splits off in the center [>] and goes around another chunk of rock .
<so you have it> [//] it splits into a wide fork .
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel .
well ‡ we didn't look at the map adequately .
and we got in there . 328190_328260
and [/] &+th &+h and the [/] the flashlight started to dim .
<and we were> [//] &+tur we had gone all the way to the end .
and we turned around . 333983_334083
and we were unaware of this thing in the middle .
and happened to be turning around it in circles .
and the flashlights were going dim .
and by that time the other people who had visited had left .
so ‡ we were in there alone .
and at that point going in circles in <the dark or> [//] the dim lights .
you're kind_of like you_know how do you get out_o(f) this place ?
and it became quite [/] quite fearful .
not [//] I wouldn't say terror but the [/] the &-uh belief that maybe we'll be spending the night in here .
and obviously it's you_know you don't think you're gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes .
but its certainly you don't have food you don't have +...
so +...
I cannot be certain of what happened . [+ exc] 378530_378660
this is a photograph . [+ exc] 380518_380718

and I really cannot give an end to the story because I don't know what the outcome of the situation was . [+ exc]
I assume she was saved . 427793_428033
but there's no &=shrugs telling based on this photograph . [+ exc]
there is <a boy and> [//] a young boy . 437230_437820
he's outside . 439598_439708
and he's kicking about a soccer ball .
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house .
shatters a window . 448003_448093
lands inside . 449805_450365
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it .
he is quite startled . 457890_458030
we then see him with the ball in his hand .
he's looking out the broken window .
&-uh he [//] I can't tell that he's glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption .
and he's certainly not happy .
I'm not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother (.) removed it from his hand .
+< and he is still asking for it .
and she is reluctant to give it to him .
he's then outside with +//. 487723_487843
well ‡ he has a backpack on so I assume he's headed off to school (.) but not necessarily .
and &-uh he's outside . 494930_495020
and he's walking .
and he sees raindrops falling .
and the rain picks up . 498825_498995
and he is getting soaked . 499911_500491
and &+h it &-uh appears he's turned around .
and he's returned home . 505215_505425
his mother is looking at his [/] his drenched body .
and then he &-uh was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain .
(o)kay the story of Cinderella .
<well Cinderella is> [//] &-uh (.) she's one of three sisters .
and two of them are (.) rather in modern terms stuck up .
and [/] and well they're high on themselves .
and they [//] &-um their mother is somewhat the same way .
and she [//] &-uh as the story progresses <there is a> [//] one of the wealthy gentleman .
the &-uh uppity ups in [/] in the area . 551066_551276
he &+b is trying to I believe marry off his son .
and &-uh there is a ball being held . 559763_559823
and Cinderella is not invited because she [/] she has been rather outcast by the family as just the [/] the servant girl .
and [/] and she's to wait on everybody else .
so ‡ she's rather lower class in the family .
and &-uh it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the [/] &-uh (.) the ability to go to the ball I suppose you'd say .
and she goes there in this fancy [/] fancy &-uh vehicle .
and she's [/] she's wearing glass slippers .
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the &-uh son of the [/] the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son .
so ‡ she's [/] she's dancing with the son and it [/] &+f it turns out that the son is [/] is rather enamored by her .
so [//] but &-uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by &-uh I believe it was midnight something &=shrugs .
or else she turns into &=shrugs a pumpkin &=laughs something like that .
I'm not exactly sure what the [/] the gist of it was . [+ exc]
but regardless she [//] &-um it gets close to midnight .
she realizes this . 621953_622073
and she darts off . 623031_623141
and leaves the [/] &-uh the prince &=shrugs or the son &=shrugs of the wealthy landowner whoever he was &-uh kind_of depressed that she hadta leave early .
and &-um she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers .
and these glass slippers are magical .
and &-um <then she> [//] &-uh the &-uh prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her [/] her foot .
so ‡ and then <he's again> [//] you_know they're together again .
and he's happy to have found her .
and the [/] the other sisters are [//] who had planned on one of them getting the [/] &-uh the guy they're kind_of left in the dark .
and [/] and everyone kind_of gets their [/] their comeuppance .
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after .
well ‡ you go to the cabinet . 800_2360
get the peanut butter and the jelly . 2380_4540
the jelly's usually in the refrigerator . 4561_6811
and a slice of bread . 6910_8590
an(d) &-uh put the jelly and the peanut butter on the bread . 9306_13146
an(d) fold it over . 13163_14083
an(d) eat it &=laughs . 14106_15226
the cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog . 15388_22138
"and the dad said +""/. 22630_23740"
"+"" well ‡ . 23941_24411"
to the little girl (be)cause she was crying her cat was out in the tree . 25008_27818
"+"" I will get the cat down for you . 28381_30731"
so ‡ the dad got up on the ladder to <get up> [/] get up the tree to get the cat . 30748_36378
but the ladder fell down . 36400_38020
and so here [//] <the dog> [/] the dog is &-uh barking at the tree to get the cat . 38833_43303
the dad is &-uh caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down . 43326_48326
so ‡ <the police> [//] the firemen have been called . 48346_50936
and they're coming in to bring another ladder (.) to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy . 51360_58320
and &-um there is a bird singin(g) in the tree . 59296_61786
so ‡ the bird is happy . 61875_62985
so ‡ it all ends when the firemen get &-uh the dad and the cat down . 63000_67290
okay [<] ‡ I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had Guillain_Barre syndrome . 75340_83440
and that's a type of &-uh (.) paralyzing +//. 84218_87498
<it's kind_of> [//] &+g it's [//] I think it was called French polio (be)cause the men were &+f from France . 87520_92320
and &-uh I was on a vacation out over in San_Diego with friends . 92831_97741
and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet . 98140_102400
and &-uh I was stumbling . 103328_105178
I was having a hard time walking . 105200_107310
and I knew something was wrong . 108195_110165
and <I just> [//] &-uh I really kind_of thought it was fate . 110465_115095
I thought maybe I'd a brain tumor or something really pretty serious . 115148_119368
but my daughter was with me . 119833_121713
and we had planned on going to &-uh Universal_Studios . 121736_127536
and I wasn't in pain . 127551_129451
so [//] but I was just having a hard time walking . 130298_132908
Guillain_Barre starts at your fingers and toes . 132930_135240
and then works [/] works in . 135260_136510
so ‡ <I can't> [//] I can remember this going to Universal_Studios in a wheelchair &=laughs . 137448_144848
so ‡ by that evening by the time we all go back to &+th [//] our hotel I was really &-uh quite concerned . 145505_153425
I did sleep . 153441_154261
and the next morning they took me to &-uh Scripps_Medical_Center in the San_Diego area . 154281_160381
and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Guillain_Barre &-um &+a affects [//] it's [/] it's a autoimmune disease . 161140_172200
and he asked me if I had had the flu recently . 172310_175890
and I had . 176315_177035
and so the [/] the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system . 177675_184695
and this was what was happening . 185113_186703
so ‡ <they told> [//] first they wanted to admit me to the hospital . 188345_190985
"and I said +""/. 191100_191640"
"+"" no way . 191795_192285"
I [/] &+w &=laughs I was going back ta [

I couldn't do that . 198980_199790
&+m and &-uh snap &=ges
I couldn't do that . 201955_202625
so ‡ &-uh got back in the car with my friends . 203851_207161
and &-uh my daughter was with us . 207256_209276
"and &-uh he said +""/. 209430_210880"
"+"" if you have trouble breathing . 211060_212590"

"+"" to &-um find the nearest hospital . 217985_220385"

and &-uh it took me about oh six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery . 222565_231895
for about six weeks I couldn't drive the car . 232428_234818
<I couldn't> [//] &-uh I could feed myself but I couldn't cut &=ges
I could shower but I couldn't &=ges
I had no strength in my hands or my feet . 244721_246911
I couldn't &-uh stand on my toes . 247488_250568
any of that kind o(f) thing . 250590_251490
<so then I started> [//] <&+i it> [//] wherever it goes you_know &=ges
and then it stops and <it's just> [//] your body stops [//] starts healing again . 259803_264243
then it was a slow &-uh recovery . 264860_267250
I would start walking just out around the block a little bit . 267460_271710
but I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister . 271726_278686
she was living with us at the time . 278731_280531
and I just felt like an old lady . 280578_283948
and this was (.) over (.) twenty years ago . 283966_287766
so ‡ I was in my forties . 287855_289035
and I was just holding &=ges
and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over . 296628_299948
but it [//] &-uh I recovered . 300520_303270
I still have a little weakness (oc)casionally in my hands . 303820_306250
I [/] I can occasionally have a hand tremor . 306568_309558
but I feel like I'm ninety nine percent (.) better . 309573_313173
so ‡ that was it &=laughs . 314073_315773
yeah . 316860_317240
oh yes . 323778_324428
well ‡ okay . 328019_328348
&-uh my mother who I lost about a year and a half ago had Alzheimer's . 328846_333616
so ‡ we went through this process . 334903_336653
and &-um &-uh she was oh about eighty when we first +//. 336708_342988
and it was kind_of interesting . 343056_344266
my daughter +//. 344290_345180
like I said my kids come just every other year for Christmas . 345200_348060
and my daughter from California was home . 348670_350620
and within two hours . 350671_352571
they were all at my house . 352655_353715
"Susie came up to me and said +""/. 354088_355488"
"+"" Mother something is wrong with Grandma . 355583_357773"
and we had noticed a little bit . 358501_360351
but it [/] it just got worse and worse . 360396_362216
and then [/] then &-uh my mom and dad were in assisted living out in Fountain_Hills . 362271_367651
then we lost dad . 367671_369751
so ‡ we put mom into a [/] &+n &-uh a nursing home &-uh up in Flagstaff where my sister lives . 369803_376723
and she was up there for four years . 377448_379188
and at first she could talk . 379260_381310
she went through all the different stations [/] &+stay &-uh &-uh stations of you_know aggression and meanness . 382508_389228
and she would call me or dad would actually (be)cause she couldn't really dial . 389370_393540
but dad would call . 393558_394478
and she'd grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes . 394500_400390
and she was much thinner than I was so . 400436_402426
or taking money . 402738_403838
dad would call and [//] (.) hiding in the garage and this mother who's &+mak &-uh maybe a hundred and ten pounds at the most you_know . 404436_412596
he was kind_of frightened of her because she got really mean . 412620_416180
but then she got back into a very calm (.) &-uh state . 416195_421465
and &-uh slowly (.) began to really make no sense whatsoever . 421705_427045
but I've [//] I learned . 427883_428993
and [/] and Dad and I went to a Alzheimer's support group which really really helped us . 429011_433791
&+a (e)specially dad . 434478_435698
and &-um because my mom had done everything . 435828_438518
I_mean she had been the one to do all the shopping send out the cards . 438536_442746
and I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards . 443255_446905
but &-uh finally there was a point where [//] &-uh when dad died that she needed full care . 447001_453371
so [//] and the last six months she [/] she couldn't talk or do anything . 453968_459098
&+sh and she broke her hip had a fall . 459343_461703
and the saddest thing was that up until the last year she was very [//] physically very healthy . 462376_467476
so ‡ she died at age eighty seven . 468105_470285
+< so ‡ that's my story &=laughs on that . 472073_474333
&-uh
so ‡ (.) &=sighs . 485595_486395
I guess &+l a long time ago . 489525_492575
+< xxx .
<tell me the story start from the beginning> [>] .
<I was in an &+er &+er earthquake> [<] in California . 494675_497045
and one of the major ones . 497666_499276
this was in (.) the fifties . 499510_502580
and &-uh <it was> [//] it [/] <it was> [//] &-uh we were visiting <my dad's aunt or> [//] my dad's sister my aunt out in California . 503076_512336
and it happened in the middle of the night . 512356_514446
and <it was> [//] &-uh it [//] it's listed . 514994_517953
I think it was maybe a seven pointer (.) somethin(g) . 518169_520690
<I_mean it> [//] the house was definitely &=laughs moving . 520710_523520
the bed was moving . 523788_524668
I was &-uh sharing a bed with my cousin . 525371_528391
and &-uh when I woke up at first I just thought she was shaking the bed around . 528411_533001
but it was dark . 533018_534028
it was early early morning . 534046_535786
and so there was a_lot_of flashing because the transformer's going off . 536623_540223
and &-uh &+ma &-uh my aunt and uncle had a [/] a doorbell chime . 541510_546580
the kinds that two hang &=ges
and &=ges
so ‡ &-uh we were up for the rest of the morning . 551186_554456
this probably happened (.) oh five o'clock in the morning something like that . 554473_559273
there were a_lot_of tremors afterwards . 559290_561350
and &-uh I remember back then (.) in the fifties the newspapers useta do extras . 561641_568031
and there was an extra out that day on the earthquake . 568341_571571
so ‡ it was [/] it was a_little frightening at the time (be)cause you just don't know what's going on . 572356_577196
so ‡ it scared me . 577856_578446
but I haven't had too much to frighten me in my life . 578671_581411
yeah &=laughs . 582828_583368
well ‡ there was a flash flood in the deserts of Arizona which happens frequently . 585645_592705
and people are a_little careless . 592770_595020
and they think they can drive their car out through this dry wash bed that all_of_a_sudden has a trickle o(f) water . 595238_602988
and they get their car out there . 603485_605015
and the trickle becomes a flood . 605030_607180
and they hafta get out_of their car . 607698_611198
and they are standing on the roof . 611885_614665
and <the paramedics> [//] &-uh <the or> [//] the &-uh firemen come . 615313_619863
the rescue people come . 619890_621260

and she's holding onto a branch . 627231_630091
and the &-uh firemen come out and rescue her . 630720_635540
she's extremely scared . 636568_638278
the boy is playing soccer out at his yard . 649113_652443
and he kicks the ball . 652508_654008
and it breaks one of the windows . 654806_657436
and it lands in the living room where the dad is sitting . 657458_660818
it breaks the window . 660836_663006
but it also breaks the lamp . 663030_665490
and the dad (.) gets up . 666230_669840

and he gets soaking wet . 707711_709211
it's raining very very hard . 709230_710940

an
&=inhales I'd probably use a_little less jelly than the [/] the peanut butter because I'd rather have more peanut butter . 56440_60650

&=inhales there's a girl up there &-uh reaching up for &-uh (.) probably her cat . 120430_125130

(a)n(d) you_know why I have no idea what dogs do . [+ exc] 141335_143975
&=inhales and then there's a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree . 143990_147780

an(d) there's a firetruck . 151490_152620
an(d) there's a couple fireman &=inhales carrying a ladder &-uh towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there . 152730_158660

not too much but some . 183296_185936
&-uh tends to help &-uh make the thing a little bit &+m more moist than usual . 186161_191661

"now &-uh having done so , what a_lot_of people fail to have ever learned is &-uh you_know regardless of how much &-uh bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof o(f) your mouth ."

that's how I handle that . 700274_703394
you bet I have . 710232_711402
the beginning is &-uh <this occured in> [/] &-um &=laughs this occurred in &-uh Louisiana . 715470_728670
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana .
and &-um &-uh we were then flying . 732573_736473
I was a fighter pilot . 736561_738281
we were then flying the [/] &+sw the &-uh swept wing version of the F@l eighty four known as the F@l eighty four F@l . 745461_745471
&-uh and <we were> [//] &-um we had been <out or> [//] &-uh on a [//] you_know a series of missions . 745471_754541
&-uh and we were just returning to the base . 758320_760050
well ‡ &-uh actually I was by myself . 760123_762903
"I was flying solo, not in formation with anybody . 763011_766381"
<it was> [/] it was <just a> [/] &-uh just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane . 773981_774071
and also proficiency . 774631_775801
just practice . 776537_776917
practice this practice that . 777321_778741
well ‡ &-uh in those times we [/] &-uh &-uh we had a [/] a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at &-uh three hundred and forty knots air speed . 831323_831793
"<when directly over the air> [//] when we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back, &=ges"
and &-uh &-uh that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees . 832473_836153
after that the airplane is slow enough so_that <we would> [/] &-uh we would have not have touched the throttle .
in other words it cut power completely . 844256_845476
and just bring it on around &=ges
well ‡ &-um the [/] &-uh &+th &-um the [/] the legs <of the> [//] <of a> [//] &+f of the pattern are called the approach . 854043_866343
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind . 868049_870679
ninety degrees from that is the base . 873621_874341
and &+f &+f following that is the final . 875074_877494
so ‡ <it's just &+frel if> [//] &=ges
well ‡ here I am on the base leg with no power . 881471_883711
all the garbage is out . 885252_887022
we call it garbage . 887826_888426
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear . 888922_891422
and all_of_a_sudden I'm about <I don't know> [//] three four hundred feet off the ground . 891488_896118
no ‡ &+m more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet . 896865_900105
something like that . 900168_900808
I'm not really sure . 900825_901635
the airplane started to shutter . 901736_902556
&-uh shuttering is the sign of a stall . 903928_906808
<that means the air> [//] &+w <when an> [/] when an airplane stalls it means it's falling out_of the sky .
and I knew immediately people do not survive these [//] a situation like this . 918782_919002
and yet <I automatically didn't even> [//] I [/] I almost didn't have time to think . 919342_925272
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway . 934338_934348
I didn't want that to happen . 934348_935198
well ‡ what did I do ? 936592_938402
I gave it full power which did not catch in time . 938459_941799
I pulled in the [/] the landing gear . 942923_945953
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone . 946465_956025
well ‡ with low r_p_m there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended .
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down . 966996_971016
I overshot the runway . 971168_972228
but <I wouldn't> [//] I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side .
and &-um &=laughs the F@l eighty four F@l has a [/] a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that &+th the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left &=hand
you can't predict it but it will do that . 994447_995307
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe (be)cause its a jet .
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward &=ges
well ‡ pretty soon there came the ground . 1020995_1024265
in retrospect I can remember very well that the [/] the horizon was jumping up and down . 1036145_1036234
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction &=ges
it yawed . 1041768_1043208
and as I say &-uh I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on .
well ‡ eventually <it did> [/] it did &-uh come to rest . 1055814_1060294
<it had> [//] the [//] it had yawed to the right so_that at full power <the engine was or> [//] the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway <which is frequently in> [//] &+pla which is always in place &-uh for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up .
well ‡ &=laughs they about panicked . 1081245_1082685
well ‡ at which I followed the proper procedures . 1084540_1086070
"&-uh I cut all power, turned everything off . 1086777_1091077"
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I [/] &+th I [/] I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing .
I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again . 1103502_1107572
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground . 1107720_1111760
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels . 1112000_1115030
&-uh and it [/] &+d &+i it did fly again . 1115154_1118064
so ‡ did I of_course . 1118146_1118376

I walked away . 1136050_1136580
it was later determined that &-um while <I was> [/] I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots +...
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone . 1148874_1153654
and he's [//] <he was> [//] &+h &-uh his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating .
but he could tell that he was overtaking me . 1165886_1168716
so ‡ obviously it was an air speed problem . 1168969_1172129

&-um he appears to be quite &+mucu muscular . 1225282_1227602

that's as much as I can tell you . [+ exc] 1232546_1233646
&=laughs a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks . 1246685_1251305

although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which <remains as I say> [//] remains on the ground . 1688357_1698567
&-uh that's [/] &-um <that's what we> [/] &+s <that's what we> [/] &+ap that's what we see to the left [/] left side of the trunk of a tree . 1698585_1707055
on the right side is another branch &-uh which had a few leaves on it . 1707100_1711930

"at the same time we see <in the> [/] in the distance directly &-uh to the right of the truck a firetruck and two [//] what appear to be two firemen each [/] each &-uh carrying an end of a ladder which presumably <is going to be> [//] they will use &-uh to climb the tree , rescue the man &=laughs and &-uh probably the cat as_well . 1717790_1745400"
okay ‡ it looks like they have problems with their pets . 610_5360
and I have a cat . [+ exc] 6376_8306
so ‡ I know that cats climb anywhere . [+ exc] 8398_10608
and all_of_a_sudden it's in a high tree . 10653_13053
and it doesn't look like the cat is stressed . 13105_15895
but <the kids are &+s or> [//] the little girl is stressed . 16456_18906
so ‡ Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat . 19540_24840
but I don't think he's able to . 24856_26316
so ‡ he calls the firemen . 26380_28180
and the firemen look like they're going to get the cat down . 29318_32607
and I'm just gonna assume that they got the cat down . 32753_35954
and the little kid is gonna be so excited . 36533_39353
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down . 39995_42625
and they live happily ever after &=laughs . 45235_47595
okay ‡ you take the [/] the loaf of bread . 50191_53351
and you open the bag . 53375_54955
and take two slices out . 54976_57566
you get your peanut butter jar . 58475_60055
you unsc(r)ew it . 60196_60986
and you get your knife . 61005_63115

well ‡ I [/] &=clears
and when I found out I had breast cancer . 103533_106353
which runs very prominently in my family . 106506_109126
"&-um my husband &-um said +""/. 109976_113876"
"+"" we're gonna whip this thing . 114053_115573"
and so I had a mastectomy . 116628_119528
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours . 120145_124085
"and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said +""/. 124968_132218"
"+"" we're going off to war again . 133068_134948"
"+"" and we're gonna beat it . 135090_136180"
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing . 137088_140488
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband . 141150_147680
and my husband was &+b trying to be strong for me . 147846_150606
so ‡ we always had a positive attitude . 151261_153791
and we [/] &-uh we never thought negatively . 154451_158941
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors . 159440_164870
yes . 173803_174123
okay ‡ well ‡ my mother was eighty nine when she had her &+s breast cancer . 179433_186703
and she came through that fine . 187678_190088
but then <after that> [//] a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes . 190570_197040

"+"" I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab . 200575_203895"

and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in [//] near my sister in Dallas . 215236_220836
and so then I went there once a month to visit her . 221648_225788
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well . 226705_233175
she &-um she would start sentences . 233788_237738

"and she would say +""/. 239260_240160"
"+"" would you +... 242253_243313"
and then she wouldn't be able to [/] to finish the sentence . 243745_246535
so ‡ it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted (.) us to do . 246585_253775
but we didn't really know what to do . 253820_256579
so ‡ the only thing my sister and I did was we just &-um smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf . 256673_267333
so ‡ we talked slowly and loudly . 267685_270955
and we always had a big smile on our faces . 271533_274393
and &-um we just showed her that we cared . 275078_279238
and we would always &-um read her mail to her . 279256_283626
and we knew two favorite people of hers . 284256_286466
so ‡ we would always read those &-uh more than once . 286488_290678
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her . 291155_295845
okay ‡ (.) &-um &=clears_throat when I was working for this man <he was the> [//] &-um he was a member of Young_Presidents_Organization . 309151_327611
and it was made up of presidents from around the world . 328455_332125
and they had &-um a [//] not a seminar but a [//] &-um they called it a university . 333160_343650
and it was &-like a week long . 343753_345463
and it would always be one would be in the United_States . 345956_348796
and the second one of the year would be outside the United_States . 349141_351981
and this year it was going to be in San_Francisco . 352786_355416
and &-um it'll be twenty years ago next month . 356406_361256
and &-um my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening . 362291_368401
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a_lot of the background work . 369545_375285
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working &-uh week . 376396_386336
and so Don stayed here . 386800_388390
and my sister from Dallas &-uh flew in . 388663_391283
and that was the week that they had the San_Francisco earthquake . 392188_397238
and &-um so we were at Fisherman's_Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free . 398216_405516
and &-um we were waiting to go &-uh on the trolley cart back to &-um <Saint_Francis> [//] the Westin_Saint_Francis . 406508_416438
and as we're waiting in line the earthquake hit . 418498_422078
and &-um it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that . 423020_428530
and so my sister (.) just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down . 429006_435376
"and she said +""/. 435926_436366"
"+"" that was probably a two or three . 436520_438180"

but that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing . 445166_448046
well ‡ the electricity was off so nothing worked . 448838_452268
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel . 452881_458341
and &-um in San_Francisco you_know it's pretty hilly &=ges
and so &-um I_mean <it was> [/] it was &-uh quite a jog back there . 464096_468906
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel . 469753_473163
so ‡ we sat outside this big &-uh park area &-um for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in . 473720_484150
and &-uh the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was +... 484170_488880
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there . 488970_495800
and we wanted to also call our two husbands . 496448_498808
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news . 499576_507036
she doesn't like to hear &-uh the bad news . 507120_510120

okay ‡ &-um I'm going to tell you about the time that I had cancer (a)n(d) began my treatment . 50000_58957
&-um I was thirty seven years old . 58957_61449
an
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my &=shows
&-uh I had a modified radical mas(t)ectomy . 69684_72828
a
so ‡ within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo [
&=lips_smack they worry a_lot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects of_course . 80878_88659
so ‡ I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two . 88659_92040
I did not &=head
and &-um so after that first initial treatment &-um (.) &=head
&-um &=head
they told me not [//] to eat lightly on the days of my treatment . 109952_114296
&=clears_throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat &=laughs &=shrugs normally . 114296_119091
and [//] &=head
so ‡ evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses . 125529_130842
&=lips_smack &-um (.) the person <that I> [/] that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the condition's getting worse is my husband's mother . 135835_146300
&=lips_smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have &=ges
so ‡ it did affect her ability to communicate because she can't (.) hear what you're saying to her most of the time . 153400_159245
&=lips_smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her . 159245_164445
speak directly to her . 164445_165790
I think she's become very adept at reading lips and &=ges figuring out what you're saying without hearing it . 165790_171982
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation . 171982_176791
&=head
so ‡ that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad . 178086_182327
&-um she now has the beginnings of &-uh &=shrugs basically &-uh Alzheimer's of the dementia type . 182327_191336
&=lips_smack so
an(d) you can see her now and see her again in (.) thirty minutes and she won't remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually (.) as a normal rule . 196829_204778
she does recognize us you_know and is able to communicate &=hand
but basically
otherwise you're [/] you're having to repeat everything so many times . 216721_220880
you don't know if she's heard you or not . 220880_222601
so ‡ that's about all you can do with that . 222601_225145
is just (.) make sure you have &=ges
(.) (w)ell ‡ let me think &=laughs . 234283_238362
lots of (th)em &*INV
but how frightened or how scared ? 241242_243030
that's the trick . 243030_243994
&=laughs okay ‡ &-um I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young (.) girl . 248255_256954
and &=clears_throat <my parents &-um had a> [//] &+liv we lived on a farm . 256954_262832
and my sister and I slep(t) in the (.) bedroom that was farthest &=ges

so ‡ at night when we would go to bed we had &=ges
and I would &+la lay there and try to go to sleep . 294285_296749
&=ges
but then I would go to sleep . 302901_304266
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the &=points stairs . 304266_308650
and since the &=ges
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was &=ges next to the main part of the house . 318883_324110
and there was &=ges no way to get there except going by &=ges
&=lips_smack so ‡ I [/] I lived several years in fear . 327854_332271
I &=head
and eventually the [//] we &=ges

so ‡ I hadta (.) &=points sleep next to the door . 344699_347556
and I hadta protect my &=laughs little sister . 347556_349604

&-um let me see . 120965_124325
&-um there was a time I remember &-like a car accident next to me that was really scary . 124485_128395
all_of_a_sudden there was you_know just this crunch of metal laying next to me . 128500_132520
so ‡ you_know it was startling . 134106_135536
&-uh both [/] both drivers seemed to be alright . 141825_144125

my lane was stopped at a light . 152163_155123
and just it was time to drive on . 155173_158693

but he [/] he &-like mumbles . 196520_197750
he can't really enunciate very well . 197858_199388
and so I just ask him I just ask to repeat what he said when I don't understand it . 199436_204416
it works . 205403_206503
okay ‡ so ‡ &-uh a girl got caught in a flood . 213678_217788
and a &-uh guy came to &-uh rescue her . 218571_223131
he's got &-like rescue harness kind_of stuff and is having some trouble getting her out_of the water into the harness because of a tree in the way . 223316_230236
so ‡ that's where we are . 230551_232991

and then it starts raining on him . 266038_267928
and it's raining really hard . 268131_269011
so ‡ he turns around and goes back home . 269066_271676

but the prince at the ball liked her and has one slipper from when she ran off . 326425_332305
and so he &-like finds her and &-like sees that she fits the slipper . 332593_339793
and so then they run off together . 339920_342310
"alright, peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 838_908"
&-um you'd start with two pieces of bread .

as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm . 560335_566565
&-um one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son . 567200_574420
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that &-uh somebody was [//] would be &-uh able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king . 574498_584898

the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party (be)cause <he was> [//] his heart belonged to her now . 695890_703690

&-um the whole thing probably lasted (.) maybe two minutes . 409006_414966

so ‡ she's not out . 511031_512051
she's not socializing . 512075_513085
