and I couldnt say anything,0.0,neutral
and I said,0.0,neutral

because I think I understood everything that was happening during this whole thing that was happening,0.2,positive
and so thats pretty good,0.475,positive
okay well I was at I was at Baystate,0.5,positive
and I was there for ke I think it was eight days,0.0,neutral

and they actually after like two days they said,0.0,neutral
so I was actually talking I talked to this woman that was the speech therapist,0.0,neutral
and I talked with her for like nine days I think,0.0,neutral
and then the last day I was there I think the ninth day I think I they had this group of people,0.0,neutral

that you would this one woman had I think you probably knew her because she was from Umass,0.0,neutral
and she was going at that time,0.0,neutral
shes still going atleast almost a year,0.0,neutral
she was going to be youknow helping at Umass,0.0,neutral
so we had this group of people that suffered from speaking well,0.0,neutral
and I listened to youknow I listened to what she was saying,0.0,neutral
actually the whole group of e of people,0.2,positive
and apparently they do that every,0.05,positive
I dont know if they come every month or something,0.0,neutral
and they talk to people about that,0.0,neutral
so and then after ten days I was there,0.0,neutral
we c decided that we went to in Amherst,0.0,neutral
and it was like rust,0.0,neutral
and youknow what happened is that the speech therapist would come,0.0,neutral
and she was there for like fifteen minutes,0.0,neutral
and shed do the same kind of testing that youve been doing,0.6,positive
and is like the same thing,0.0,neutral
and youknow it was like I had seen it,0.0,neutral
and the next day another speech therapist,0.0,neutral
I think there was only a couple of people,0.0,neutral
and she started the whole thing all over again,0.2,positive
right,0.2857142857142857,positive
and she wasnt here that long,-0.05,negative
and then the next day this other person came again,0.0,neutral
and we were doing the same thing,0.0,neutral
but none of them,0.0,neutral
it was only very short period of time youknow maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving,0.0,neutral
and so I think FirstnameG and I we actually went for a walk youknow because where she was isnt really that far away,0.05,positive
so in the center of town we went to dinner,-0.1,negative
and we were talking,0.0,neutral
and she was saying,0.0,neutral

and she was and she was shes getting a new job,0.13636363636363635,positive
she was gonna lose she was gonna leave,0.0,neutral
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks,0.0,neutral
and now its getting youknow its the middle its the beginning,0.0,neutral
so I when would it was I just had I had a birthday there that week,0.0,neutral
and we were thinking that maybe we would stay,0.0,neutral
and I was gonna stay with FirstnameP and FirstnameYs house,0.0,neutral
I was gonna stay there,0.0,neutral
because I think what happened is that we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse,-0.2,negative
the nurse,0.0,neutral
and the thing is that this,0.0,neutral
and this is what,0.0,neutral
they wanted to youknow if I wanted to go to the to have my bath and stuff like that,0.0,neutral

no problems whatsoever,0.0,neutral
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the NewYorkTimes,0.2,positive
thats basically the only thing I hadta try to read,0.0,neutral
and I would say if I read something like one section of the NewYorkTimes it would probably take me maybe it would take me an hour just to read one,0.0,neutral
and then Id only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read youknow,0.0,neutral
ofcourse if it was maybe if it was an newspaper that was easier to read I might do better,0.5,positive
but it was still the NewYorkTimes and the i editorials and things like that,0.0,neutral
I was having a hard time understanding it,-0.2916666666666667,negative
but I had an ideara,0.0,neutral
so FirstnameG and I were going we were at we were having supper,0.0,neutral
and she said,0.0,neutral
what she should do,0.0,neutral
I said,0.0,neutral
so then she tried to find people in that area that would they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist,0.0,neutral
and this one woman came,0.0,neutral
and I really I thought she was quite good,0.44999999999999996,positive
but youknow what happened,0.0,neutral
I think they found one in Athol,0.0,neutral
and then I started to drive too,0.0,neutral
and if I could drive then you see you couldnt have a person that would come to my house,0.0,neutral
right,0.2857142857142857,positive
so what happened,0.0,neutral
I really liked this woman the speech therapist,0.6,positive
but I hadta give her,0.0,neutral
and she had all of the she had all of this she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could I could probably learn with this,0.0,neutral
how do you say the right term,0.2857142857142857,positive
we I started doing that,0.0,neutral
youknow she would do things like writing a picture,0.0,neutral
thered be pictures or something like that,0.0,neutral
and wed be like,0.0,neutral
youknow and the clock would be wed be on like a twelve,0.0,neutral
and itd be on six,0.0,neutral
and itd be on three,0.0,neutral
it would be on youknow it would be on eight or something,0.0,neutral
and I would hafta write it down which one it was,0.0,neutral
so that was how I started doing with the speech therapist,0.0,neutral
but then I couldnt youknow I couldnt drive,0.0,neutral
youknow Id we cant let her keep on coming,0.0,neutral
and she knew I could drive,0.0,neutral
and its and Im gonna still Im gonna go Im going three times a week to see FirstnameE,0.0,neutral

and youknow and you in the beginning it was pretty easy,0.3416666666666667,positive
and then ofcourse the words got more difficult,-0.5,negative
and so Imean that was alot of the work that you did,0.0,neutral
and I think the reason why you were involved that you were involved with that is that we were worried that we couldnt even find a speech therapist,0.0,neutral
and I think thats how FirstnameY found you youknow,0.0,neutral
and then we finally then we did find someone to go down to Athol,0.0,neutral
so and then you were also telling me that because I had recently had that problem having trouble with the what had happened in that part that my then I needed everybody to ke to become,-0.1,negative
what do you what did I hafta say what it,0.0,neutral

the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that,0.0,neutral
so it didnt work for them,0.0,neutral
so it came to him,0.0,neutral
they just told him,0.0,neutral
so it came on to him,0.0,neutral
it goes to that,0.0,neutral
Im not done yet,0.0,neutral
the guy hes the one guy that I saw,0.0,neutral
the two sing with him and play and stuff like that,0.0,neutral
thats where he was that night,0.0,neutral

the peanuts,0.0,neutral
thats not the same thing,0.0,neutral
they sit in the its in the kitchen,0.0,neutral
put on a bread,0.0,neutral
and put it on a probably put it on a plate,0.0,neutral
go over sit down on the table,0.0,neutral
and have something to eat,0.0,neutral
I guess thats it,0.0,neutral
how it was,0.0,neutral
mostly when I started,0.5,positive
I had a month I dont even remember anything about it,0.0,neutral
but it was like ten days,0.0,neutral
they finally got me in there to I finally started Imean I could actually talk or anything like that,0.0,neutral
but I had to remember how to remember everything,0.0,neutral
and were everything is gone back,0.0,neutral
I mean everything about abck all that kind of stuff like that,0.14375,positive
everybodys name,0.0,neutral
everybody the computer on there,0.0,neutral
the Coke sitting there,0.0,neutral
everything,0.0,neutral
the wrong about it,-0.5,negative
you have nothing about it,0.0,neutral
you hadta remember everything about it,0.0,neutral
so we went to,0.0,neutral
I had like thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first,0.3333333333333333,positive
and then we went to,0.0,neutral
after that thats when we started to talk and to get in the sort of thing,0.0,neutral
make sure Im forget something,0.5,positive
its ten years before,0.0,neutral
but we did start ke abck one two three or something like that with my mom,0.0,neutral
started to its in books,0.0,neutral
I went there,0.0,neutral
there is someone we got a talk over there,0.0,neutral
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abck one two three and stuff like that,0.0,neutral
and it took a long time,-0.05,negative
it was about a year the start over that,0.0,neutral
and Ive gone down,0.0,neutral
it was Monday to Friday,0.0,neutral
now its down Monday Wednesday Friday,0.0,neutral
then after that theres a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks,0.0,neutral
just try to talk alittle better and that,0.5,positive
because Imean at this time I could talk alittle better,0.5,positive
but it just hard to get back everything outof there,-0.14583333333333334,negative
so that helped different things about it for those six weeks,0.0,neutral
and youre trying with computer,0.0,neutral
or trying to try to write on there,0.0,neutral
trying to do something about it get alittle better there,0.5,positive
and thats how they tried to,0.0,neutral
after that they started IU,0.0,neutral
and thats when they started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that,0.6,positive
theres so much you couldnt remember anything about it,0.2,positive
but its you just take your time trying to,0.0,neutral
me and my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that,0.0,neutral
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things,0.7,positive
so it doesnt keep everything in there the whole time,0.2,positive
so you just gotta keep everything keep where youre getting things youre doing there and still be able to talk,0.5,positive
mostly taking my time,0.5,positive
so if I talk too much people have no idea what Im doing,0.2,positive
and they talk to me real quick,0.5,positive
this is kindof weird because if one person talk,-0.5,negative
if theres three people I can understand other people,0.0,neutral
I can understand more of this,0.0,neutral
but so it takes time getting around everything,0.0,neutral
so its just it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting alittle better,0.5,positive
I dont know how long I can go,-0.05,negative
but its just it seems like Im still doing something with it,0.0,neutral
so and it keeps going over time,0.0,neutral
so I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that,0.19999999999999998,positive
and the and its my moms very helping,0.0,neutral
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too,-0.1875,negative
they need to do something like that,0.0,neutral
but I have my brothers too,0.0,neutral
one of them Imean one I dont see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other,0.7,positive
so it just its not it as it used to be,0.0,neutral
I knew alotof people and all that kind,0.6,positive
now Im kindof move down ke acouple people I knew and just take my time,0.0,neutral
so its alot easy as how it was,0.43333333333333335,positive
I dunno,0.0,neutral
is that come around or,0.0,neutral
xxx about it was like I said I had to remember everything,0.0,neutral
Imean I wasnt really didnt get me out that bad because I said,-0.24999999999999992,negative
so you hadta restart everything to get back on there,0.0,neutral
so you took your time and tried to get through it,0.0,neutral
and Imean if youre going to yell at it its not gonna do anything for it,0.0,neutral
so youre the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that,1.0,positive
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that,0.2857142857142857,positive
Id be outside and doing stuff like that or youknow,0.0,neutral
but it really doesnt bother me that much,0.2,positive
Imean I just take my time during the day,0.0,neutral
ke Im gonna dry s,-0.06666666666666665,negative
and I might go outside and working on the a branch or something like that,0.0,neutral
just keep going back and forth,0.0,neutral

I get her on almost every times for a week,0.0,neutral
and maybe ke one day of the week and well see her,0.0,neutral
but I get her on the phone every day,0.0,neutral
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving,0.0,neutral
and its another way to get through to me and everybody else,0.0,neutral
Imean alotof them cant understand what Im doing,0.0,neutral
but alot I know they know everything about it,0.0,neutral
so its easy about it so,0.43333333333333335,positive

I thought it was kindof totally different when I restarted here,0.0,neutral
I hadta remember how to do everything,0.0,neutral

it is another way I tried to keep doing what Im doing,0.0,neutral
but it also is doing whatever I need to do,0.0,neutral
Imean I hadta do everything like that anyway,0.0,neutral
so it took some time on that,0.0,neutral
and its it was a long time to do,-0.05,negative
but you had just took your time and do whatever youre doing I think,0.0,neutral
its I dont know how to,0.0,neutral
youre not gonna too quick,0.3333333333333333,positive
and you hafta do sometimes,0.0,neutral
so you just kinda do whatever youre doing but then a little bit farther,-0.1875,negative

but she left,0.0,neutral
and he was worried about that,0.0,neutral
but she did drop one of her shoes,0.0,neutral

so they went back,0.0,neutral
she was going back her place where she was just n not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff,0.4666666666666666,positive
but her cousins,0.0,neutral
and they put them on there,0.0,neutral
and her feet are huge,0.4000000000000001,positive
so it wasnt gonna work on that,0.0,neutral

my speech,0.0,neutral
I think its alot better than what it was,0.5,positive
and Im hoping that it gets better,0.5,positive
actually Im hoping that it gets back to where it was,0.0,neutral
yes but to be honest with you I if what youre asking is I think that I didnt exactly understand what had all happened youknow,0.425,positive
and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and alot of it,0.0,neutral
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were kindof funny or werent making sense,0.25,positive
so I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand,0.0,neutral
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would remember everything,0.0,neutral
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought,0.0,neutral
there I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset not upset sad,0.10000000000000002,positive
and then but then,0.0,neutral
anyway sorry,-0.5,negative
well most of the time Ive been pretty happy sorry because Im very fortunate that Im still here and have a second time to be alive and be with people that I care about,0.17500000000000002,positive
but its just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything,0.4,positive
I was home when it happened,0.0,neutral
and I it just really hurt,0.2,positive
for me it was on my left side,0.0,neutral
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down,0.0,neutral
but right away I could tell something wasnt right,0.2857142857142857,positive
and then I my wife realized more stuff that was going on,0.0,neutral
and she was able to ask me es quite a few questions,0.5,positive
and after a few questions she could realize I wasnt making sense,0.0,neutral
so I guess thats the answer,0.0,neutral
sure alot,0.5,positive
Im trying to think where to start,0.0,neutral
from the time that I was at the,0.0,neutral
I cant even think what its called,0.0,neutral
where was I at,0.0,neutral
after the stroke happened at first,0.25,positive
yeah icu and then the,0.0,neutral

where I was for awhile,0.0,neutral
yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me,0.0,neutral
yeah rehab thats the one,0.0,neutral
its hard for me to answer when I cant think how to say it,-0.2916666666666667,negative
rehab,0.0,neutral
and they were helping me,0.0,neutral
and they were very kind,0.6,positive
and my wife was wonderful,1.0,positive
and they were just telling me things that gave me it gave me alotof hope that they realized I was pretty much I was alittle weak,0.025000000000000005,positive
but I was physically able to walk around and do alot,0.5,positive
and that remember I told yesterday I could remember alotof like well how to play a guitar and kindof singing,0.0,neutral
although I guess you would know how this stuff means,-0.3125,negative
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was,0.45,positive
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something,0.21428571428571427,positive
but that gave me alotof hope,0.0,neutral
and then I got back home,0.0,neutral
and Ive worked with a whole lot of things,0.2,positive
Ill show you one of them,-0.5,negative
xxx,0.0,neutral
here it is,0.0,neutral
one of these things,0.0,neutral
so not every day but for alotof days I just go back,0.0,neutral
and I look at this,0.0,neutral
and I started going backwards just to try to read it,0.0,neutral
youknow dog and cat,0.0,neutral
so theres a whole bunch of these things that they had,0.2,positive
and then some of those in the other room that I cant always get a hold of but I managed to get a hold of these,0.0,neutral
I usually I can usually get them,-0.25,negative
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something,-0.4,negative
and when I started playing,0.0,neutral
is it okay if I keep blabbing for a minute,0.5,positive
this is actually I guess my wife can tell me I kinda blab,0.0,neutral
so I dont mean to be that way,-0.3125,negative
but youknow I guess she realized soon,0.0,neutral
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing,0.2,positive
and after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with older people,0.16666666666666666,positive
and then it made me think more about that after something I was going through,0.0,neutral
and I really wanted to just sing,0.2,positive
I realized that I missed that,0.0,neutral
so we were talking about me doing that,0.0,neutral
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened,0.5,positive
somehow one of them got missed,0.0,neutral
and so it was about a month I guess later,0.0,neutral
yeah July,0.0,neutral
one well Im forgot to say it,0.0,neutral
bottom line is one of them called not long before,-0.05,negative
ohmygosh youknow we didnt tell him s,0.0,neutral
and so I still said,0.0,neutral
so I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs,-0.17083333333333334,negative
and I did it,0.0,neutral
and I was nervous,0.0,neutral
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to start doing it again,0.5,positive
and I did a whole lot of shows again,0.2,positive
and I think that really helped me because it started remembering and alotof that,0.2,positive
so I guess thats the answer to alotof it,0.0,neutral
yeah and I was feeling so good,0.7,positive
I musta done a hundred shows at least,-0.3,negative
she could tell you,0.0,neutral
there was a ton of them I did,0.0,neutral
and pretty much not having any problems,0.225,positive
but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing,0.0,neutral
and I was singing all not making sense,0.0,neutral
and that just destroyed me,0.0,neutral
Imean I just that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I was back,-0.2,negative
and then that happened and the next thing I knew were going to the hospital,0.0,neutral
and I just couldnt believe it,0.0,neutral

and that was probably the worst,-1.0,negative
but then came back around again,0.0,neutral
so I was doing better again,0.5,positive
and then allofasudden Covid came in,0.0,neutral
so since its been so many weird things in my life becauseof just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything,0.0,neutral
and then thats come along,0.0,neutral
and its just every were all going through that,0.0,neutral

I dont know where to start with that,0.0,neutral
I can only tell just the one huh,0.0,neutral
well I would talk about my wife and I getting married,0.25,positive

thats pretty much what I have,0.225,positive
okay so first Im going to look at what I see,0.375,positive
and then theres alot going on there in there,0.0,neutral

I can point to it,0.0,neutral
but I cant say it,0.0,neutral
there is a thing that which the young girl could take with the man,0.1,positive
and he could walk down there,0.0,neutral
cant think of what its called,0.0,neutral
okay,0.5,positive
on the right see is a,0.2857142857142857,positive
crud I forgot what thats called,0.0,neutral
Ill skip that one,-0.5,negative
at the bottom there we do see there is a acouple guys a person people who are gonna probably help him,0.0,neutral

I got it,0.0,neutral
with a fire person whos gonna come and probably help him up there,0.0,neutral
thats what Ive got,0.0,neutral
okay,0.5,positive
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella,0.5,positive
but Cinderella starts with she was had a wonderful mom and also dad father and mother,1.0,positive
and they were loving and kind,0.6,positive
and she was too,0.0,neutral
and something happened which alot lot of,0.0,neutral
and that was her sorry her ke mother,-0.5,negative
so her dad her father met this other woman and decided to hed like to have him and her get married,0.25,positive
and as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go,0.0,neutral
but he did,0.0,neutral
and that person had a couple like sorry acouple ke daughters that she owned,-0.5,negative
and its showing that theyre all very mean not only to Cinderella but even to themself,-0.3125,negative
they just theyre just very all they think about is themself,0.0,neutral
and the mother is just interested in trying to make alotof money when she gets married,0.25,positive
so they realize that Cinderella is just is a very beautiful person,0.85,positive
Imean shes very pretty and beautiful,0.55,positive
but shes inside shes just a really sweet person who cares about people,0.35,positive
so the oh I think its called stepmother,0.0,neutral
I think thats what its called,0.0,neutral
realizes they need to she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters,0.0,neutral
and so Cinderellas life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that shes m,0.26666666666666666,positive
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy at least for the most part and just doing alotof lovely things in taking care of them,0.3333333333333333,positive
and so around that time the prince,0.0,neutral
let me see,0.0,neutral
his dad,0.0,neutral
I cant think of what thats called,0.0,neutral
wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all,0.0,neutral
who would be just a lovely ke a girl,0.5,positive
and so they have this ke ball,0.0,neutral
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that youknow,0.38333333333333336,positive
but they showed that the other two stepmothers,0.0,neutral
and that their mom,0.0,neutral
and theyre excited that they can maybe be the one thats chosen,0.375,positive
woo this is hard,-0.2916666666666667,negative
but the mom realizes,0.0,neutral
so Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready,0.2,positive
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful,0.5425,positive
so they made is made her beautiful thing,0.85,positive
but then the stepmother got where she couldnt go,0.0,neutral
and so then Cinderella was really crying,0.2,positive
as I remember thats the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken,0.225,positive
and youknow how could they not even let me do anything,0.0,neutral
and then theres fairy godmother person pops outof nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what shes going to wear and where she can be driven,0.85,positive
she gets there,0.0,neutral
and she can dance,0.0,neutral
and he sees her and wants to dance with her,0.0,neutral
and hes captivated by her,0.0,neutral
and allofasudden Cinderella realizes ohno its by this midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back,0.0,neutral
so Cinderella gets home,0.0,neutral
and shes still kinda happy,0.8,positive
which is I thought that was always amazing,0.6000000000000001,positive
she was still she just happy and so honest about,0.7,positive
and she thinks thats the end that would ever be,0.0,neutral
but she was still happy,0.8,positive
and so then with the prince he is like,0.0,neutral
which I wouldnt really blame him,0.2,positive
ofcourse hes gonna wanna meet her,0.0,neutral
and goes he wants to he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her,0.5,positive
so he hasta go has a decree I guess that popped in decree to every single unmarried person,-0.07142857142857142,negative
hasta be figure out who that was because,0.0,neutral
oh yeah I forgot when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things,0.0,neutral
I cant think what its called,0.0,neutral
behind your foot thing,-0.4,negative
so they know that if they can go to each person theyll find out who that was who that fits,0.4,positive
so they go,0.0,neutral
and at the end Cinderella its obvious that shes the correct one,0.0,neutral
so they get married,0.25,positive
and then shes happily ever after,0.8,positive
thats it,0.0,neutral
my brain is like,0.0,neutral

and take one and put it around the peanut butter,0.0,neutral
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three or four,0.5,positive
and thats how I would say,0.0,neutral

well for the most part or I guess Id hafta say most of the time I think its doing alot better than it had done,0.5,positive
and were talking ofcourse after my stroke right,0.2857142857142857,positive
hopefully I wouldnt have,0.0,neutral
yeah so I think I Im doing better,0.5,positive

but I think Im doing better,0.5,positive
Ive been trying really hard to think,-0.2916666666666667,negative

and it really hurt,0.2,positive
and for me it was youknow my left side I guess,0.0,neutral

and theyve been very patient about this when I get stuck on something,0.0,neutral
and every now and then I get a little bit upset,-0.1875,negative

and there is a,0.0,neutral
something else I forgot what its called,0.0,neutral
oh what is that called,0.0,neutral
we see that where they would use to have gotten around there,0.0,neutral
I cant think what its called,0.0,neutral
and the last thing on the very top of that is a bird,0.25,positive
thats the best I can do right now,0.6428571428571428,positive
the story of Cinderella,0.0,neutral
I guess it starts off,0.0,neutral
as at least the way I remember,-0.3,negative
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very good people,0.7,positive
and they treated her as they should very kind and with alotof love,0.55,positive
and that would ofcourse have been great except her ke mother died,0.8,positive
and I guess alot of those ke Disney shows do that sometimes,0.0,neutral
and so the dad was a good man,0.7,positive
but like alotof people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else,0.0,neutral
and so that ends up happening,0.0,neutral
and really messed up by marrying this other woman,0.2,positive
who ends up shes just so cruel and so selfish,-0.75,negative
and oh okay what I should say before also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life,0.43333333333333335,positive
and so what I mean now is that the,-0.3125,negative
what is it called,0.0,neutral
the other woman she now has the power I guess where shes really being awful with Cinderella,-1.0,negative
and I guess maybe even the her dad mightve died,0.0,neutral
I dont remember about that,0.0,neutral
anyway so theyre showing they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed,0.0,neutral
she went through a really nice life which was deserving to her because she was a very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldnt hurt anyone,0.6100000000000001,positive
so now that the other mother is now there the other mother makes Cinderella do everything,0.0,neutral
all the washing and everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do,0.0,neutral
and these those two sisters the k s the other,0.0,neutral
what are those called,0.0,neutral
those two other girls are just so mean to her and so just very ke very snotty horrible,-0.65625,negative
dont even care about Cinderella at all,0.0,neutral
only that they can get whatever they want,0.0,neutral
they make her do everything,0.0,neutral
but even so she still seems to still have an amazing way to be lovely and sweet and caring,0.4833333333333334,positive
and so I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place,0.0,neutral
I cant think what its called,0.0,neutral
beautiful place,0.85,positive
so sorry somebodys walking back here and Im getting this for,-0.25,negative
okay so okay I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman,0.3071428571428571,positive
I guess,0.0,neutral
so oh this is hard,-0.2916666666666667,negative
so the ke,0.0,neutral
hows that Im in track where they are,0.0,neutral
so the so its made by decree that they should have they should have this ke yeah okay this ke ball,0.5,positive
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta hasta come there,0.25,positive
and then theyll be able to c to figure out whos the best one that he should marry,0.75,positive
so then they showed in the picture if I remember right his,0.2857142857142857,positive
and shes excited because she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will be that they will want one of them,0.375,positive
so theyre all excited including Cinderella was excited,0.375,positive
but loandbehold I think it showed that the other mother says,0.0,neutral
seems to me ke I remember ke the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear I think,0.6,positive
anyway so Cinderella part of her part of how shes just so lovely and kind even the little a little ke sorry ke nblu,0.04500000000000002,positive
so they even do what help to try to make her what she can wear,0.0,neutral
and I think Im what happened with that,0.0,neutral
anyway yeah then it gets messed up,0.0,neutral
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think thats where it shows Cinderella really for the first time really crying,0.15,positive
really just destroyed because its like,0.2,positive
Im being its like they think shes just nothing,0.0,neutral
and she doesnt deserve any of that,0.0,neutral
and then allofasudden the fairy godmother pops outof nowhere,0.0,neutral
and she makes a beautiful outfit,0.85,positive
and then she,0.0,neutral
ohboy the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where,0.0,neutral
yeah with its ke a pumpkin,0.0,neutral
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in,0.0,neutral
and the animals are made to look like theyre people,0.0,neutral
and just the fairy godmother has told her,0.0,neutral
so I think it showed Cinderella arrives,0.0,neutral
and they can see that the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like,-0.7,negative
and then the,0.0,neutral
why this is really hard to explain this,-0.2916666666666667,negative
then the guy,0.0,neutral
I cant think what hes even called now,0.0,neutral
oh how embarrassing,0.0,neutral
I cant think of the name of the guy,0.0,neutral
the young man whos gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her,0.55,positive
and he is very interested in her ofcourse,0.25,positive
and he seemed like a nice man like a good man,0.6499999999999999,positive
and she ofcourse is a absolutely very wonderful and very good girl,0.85,positive
and they get to dance,0.0,neutral
and its just almost magical,0.5,positive
theyre just obvious those two are meant to be ke in love,0.25,positive
so then Cinderella leaves or sees,0.0,neutral
so she has to suddenly run,0.0,neutral
hes thinking,0.0,neutral
and as shes running down her slipper a grass,0.0,neutral
and she hasta keep running,0.0,neutral
so then I think the pictures show that shes back home,0.0,neutral
and shes just happy that she got to do something,0.8,positive
and then they find out that,0.0,neutral
boyco my brain,0.0,neutral
that there was a grass,0.0,neutral
or theyre gonna find who was that woman who we actually would ofcourse have been n Cinderella,0.0,neutral
and so they go to every unmarried young woman,0.1,positive
and none of them it doesnt fit right with any of them with the slipper grass,0.34285714285714286,positive
I cant talk right,0.2857142857142857,positive
with the slipper,0.0,neutral
and it does for Cinderella,0.0,neutral
and so she becomes married,0.25,positive
and I think I missed one thing in there,0.0,neutral
seems like the mom ends up breaking that or something first,0.25,positive
I dont remember that,0.0,neutral
but anyway they find the other one like I say,0.0,neutral
and that fits,0.4,positive
thats the only one that fits right,0.34285714285714286,positive
and its obviously shes the one,0.0,neutral
and then it shows that they get married,0.25,positive
and theyre happily ever after,0.8,positive
I think thats it,0.0,neutral
yeah youd open up each of the each of the ke sorry each of the ke jellies,-0.25,negative

and instead of going through the little capillaries and everything it doesnt go through the capillaries,-0.1875,negative
it goes directly into a vein,0.1,positive
so theres no filter there to slow it down or youknow,-0.30000000000000004,negative
and so that con,0.0,neutral

and again its on the tip my tongue,0.0,neutral
that I wanna say what it is,0.0,neutral

infact about the blood was about three quarters of my brain,0.0,neutral

I youknow I couldnt talk,0.0,neutral

and they,0.0,neutral
I was at that point I was in the I was in a rehabilitation center a rehab hospital,-0.1,negative
and they took me by ambulance because I felt I could feel that something was going on,0.0,neutral
and I was afraid it was stroke,-0.6,negative
but I couldnt say it was a stroke,0.0,neutral

but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldnt see with both eyes,0.0,neutral
I can steer with both eyes,0.0,neutral

and I remember telling me telling FirstnameS,0.0,neutral
I said,0.0,neutral
and I sure enough I could,0.25,positive

yeah,0.0,neutral
and so I started working really hard,-0.2916666666666667,negative

the guy is sitting there probably watching tv or something,0.0,neutral
but he gets up picks up the soccer ball walks over to the window,0.0,neutral
and youknow the window,0.0,neutral
I think we talked about this last time,0.0,neutral
the window is there,0.0,neutral
the lamp where the soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore,0.0,neutral

and I think he doesnt know where it came from,0.0,neutral
but I am sure hes probably going to find out,0.5,positive
and hes probably going to make somebodys pay for the window,0.0,neutral
so the moral of that story is if youre gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesnt go through the window,0.25,positive
the end,0.0,neutral
oh I forgot the beginning and the end last time didnt I,0.0,neutral
okay the beginning is that they the little kid,0.15625,positive
I think its a boy,0.0,neutral
is going off to school,0.0,neutral
and the mom tries to hand him a an umbrella,0.0,neutral

and hes kinda holding his hand up over his head like asthough hes gonna be able to stop the water off his head,0.5,positive
but he runs home,0.0,neutral
and you can tell the say the mom is a little alittle perturbed but he get because he wouldnt take the umbrella,-0.1875,negative
so there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet,-0.10000000000000002,negative
and the mom just kinda looks at him like,0.0,neutral
he said,0.0,neutral
so she gives him r umbrella,0.0,neutral
and he head heads back to school,0.0,neutral
and its still raining,0.0,neutral
its still raining pretty hard,-0.020833333333333343,negative
its coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was,0.0,neutral

and hes walk hes got his backpack,0.0,neutral
and hes walking off to school,0.0,neutral

she knows best,1.0,positive
the end,0.0,neutral
oh yeah Ive seen this one before okay,0.5,positive

so the beginning is the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree,0.0,neutral

like I said shes riding that little ik tricycle,-0.1875,negative
the cat wont the cat wont come down,0.0,neutral
so apparently the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down,0.05,positive
and he leaned the ladder against the tree to crawl up there,0.0,neutral
and something happened,0.0,neutral
Im gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree ran into the ladder or something,0.0,neutral
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down,0.0,neutral
the dads stuck in the tree,0.0,neutral
and I dont know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone,0.0,neutral
maybe its maybe,0.0,neutral

alright well at the beginning I dont know if this is true or not,0.35,positive
I dont know if this is really what happened in the story,0.2,positive
but looks like it looks like that for some reason maybe somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else,0.13636363636363635,positive
and I dont know the story behind that,-0.4,negative
but thats what it looks like,0.0,neutral
and then so she says,0.0,neutral
well when shes gone it turns out that Cinderella actually became more of a servant than a friend,0.0,neutral
she musta been sleeping in the out in the stable with the animals I guess,0.0,neutral
she in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters,0.0,neutral
she was doing their laundry,0.0,neutral
she was doing all the work,0.0,neutral
and like I said she had become more of a slave than anything else,0.0,neutral
so they lived in the shadow of the castle,0.0,neutral
and I think she dreamt about the castle,0.0,neutral
looks like she was in the one picture it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that,0.0,neutral
thats what it looks like anyway,0.0,neutral
and so it turns out that the king little short fat king,-0.09375,negative
I dont know why the little short why the king is always short and fat but he is,-0.0625,negative
is looking for somebody to marry his daughter,0.0,neutral

but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball,0.0,neutral
and theyll have a chance to show off to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him,0.0,neutral
so he sent out this invitation,0.0,neutral
and ofcourse the wicked stepmother or the whatever she is the mother she ofcourse doesnt let doesnt want Cinderella to go to the ball,0.0,neutral
so the other girls go off to the ball,0.0,neutral
and Cinderella stays home,0.0,neutral
and shes gotta tend to the animals or whatever,0.0,neutral
so the fairy godmother came along,0.0,neutral
and Im not sure how she got into the story,0.5,positive
but she came along,0.0,neutral
the fairy godmother showed up and with a carriage a pumpkin,0.0,neutral
it was that the I guess fairy godmother turned the turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a for the r for Cinderella to ride in,0.0,neutral
they went to the went to the ball with the two horses and the footman and the driver and all that,0.0,neutral
they went to the went to the ball they went to the ball but they went to the ball,0.0,neutral
and the nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful,0.85,positive
so she the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the pumpkin,0.0,neutral
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is,0.0,neutral
they up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see its about a minute before midnight,0.0,neutral
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while its still a carriage,0.0,neutral
runs or runs and dnu,0.0,neutral

she was running down the stairs,0.0,neutral
the slipper fell off,0.0,neutral
and she didnt have time to go back and pick it up I guess,0.0,neutral
so she went on got in the carriage with youknow the carriage and went home,0.0,neutral
the prince was heartbroken because he and me because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the who had come to the ball,0.675,positive
and nobody knew who she was,0.0,neutral
but he had fallen in love with her,0.5,positive
and so he sent eryb he sent his man or servants or whatever out to find this the person whose foot would fit in the slipper,0.4,positive
and so they went to Cinderellas house,0.0,neutral
and ofcourse the two sisters there they tried it on,0.0,neutral
and ofcourse it didnt fit,0.4,positive
and so the Cinderella was there as a servant,0.0,neutral

and sure enough it fit perfectly,0.475,positive

and they werent fitting,0.5,positive
so I was having trouble,-0.2,negative
I dont carry alotof keys on my ring,0.0,neutral
but I couldnt figure out which key went into the lock,0.0,neutral
so finally I thought,0.0,neutral
and we when we went down the road I dont remember who or,0.0,neutral
but I think I went to the best possible one,0.5,positive
and when we got there it was like four of,0.0,neutral
we call this hospital row,0.0,neutral
so my street is always the first in the city to get paved,0.25,positive
well maybe the governors and then mine,0.0,neutral

she I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didnt,0.0,neutral
and I saw the red lettering,0.0,neutral
and I couldnt read it,0.0,neutral
that was so significant to me because I remember I could not,0.375,positive
I knew what the word was,0.0,neutral
but I couldnt say it to save my life,0.0,neutral
but well I could say it,0.0,neutral
I just couldnt read it,0.0,neutral
and so I pointed,0.0,neutral
and I said,0.0,neutral
and so I wasnt reading it youknow,0.0,neutral
it was like,0.0,neutral
and so we got to the entrance,0.0,neutral
and there was ke I wanna say a canopy but not,0.0,neutral
and I caught the eye of a policeman that was sitting or,0.0,neutral
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the,0.0,neutral
and I waved at him and motioned for him to come,0.0,neutral
and he did,0.0,neutral
and I told him,0.0,neutral
and I dont know when I determined that was a possibility,0.0,neutral
dont even remember,0.0,neutral
but and I said,0.0,neutral
and I was walking fine,0.4166666666666667,positive
but I just never had a stroke before,0.0,neutral
so I didnt know if maybe Im walking fine now,0.4166666666666667,positive
and allofasudden I cant youknow,0.0,neutral
I didnt know,0.0,neutral
so I was afraid to walk,-0.6,negative
and so he said,0.0,neutral
and a nurse came out real fast,0.30000000000000004,positive
and she brought out,0.0,neutral
she came out first,0.25,positive
and then I told the same thing to her,0.0,neutral
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair,0.0,neutral
I think it was just inside the door,0.0,neutral
then so she got me in the wheelchair,0.0,neutral
and we went in,0.0,neutral
and I remember looking at the people in the waiting room,0.0,neutral
it was pretty full,0.3,positive
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of,-0.5,negative
and I almost wanted to say,0.0,neutral
but youknow just not appropriate to really say anything,0.35,positive
I just felt bad,-0.6999999999999998,negative
and so then the intake person wanted my health insurance,0.0,neutral
so I gave her that,0.0,neutral
and she asked me,0.0,neutral
and I remembered the Metformin,0.0,neutral
but I called it Glucophage,0.0,neutral
I think Glucophage is I think thats the name brand for it,0.0,neutral
but I couldnt think of Metformin,0.0,neutral
and there were alotof supplements I useta take and,0.0,neutral
but I couldnt remember the name of them for the life of me,0.0,neutral
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if,0.0,neutral
and but I just was just struggling,0.0,neutral
I couldnt remember the name of them,0.0,neutral
and I it surprised me that I couldnt remember them,0.1,positive
and then I got put in a room right away and just waited,0.2857142857142857,positive
and that same nurse came back,0.0,neutral
and she asked me,0.0,neutral
and I said,0.0,neutral
but I didnt think a long time had passed,-0.05,negative
and so she was alittle irritated with that and went back and,0.0,neutral
and they were back there very quickly,0.16666666666666666,positive
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do,0.0,neutral
and they had one test where they were gonna need to put me,0.0,neutral
theyre trying to find the origin of the stroke,0.0,neutral
I think at this point they know what happened,0.0,neutral
they just cant figure out,0.0,neutral
and they never figured it out,0.0,neutral
but so they put me to sleep for that,0.0,neutral
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to,0.2,positive
I dont like to be put under,0.0,neutral
I like to know whats going on,0.0,neutral
and then theyre gonna put this thing down my throat,0.0,neutral
and I know that there is the possibility,0.0,neutral
its so slim,0.0,neutral
but possibility that something could go wrong there,-0.5,negative
or would some permanent damage could happen,0.0,neutral
so I was pretty freaked out about it,0.25,positive
but I thought I gotta submit to this,0.0,neutral
so they did that,0.0,neutral
and when they did either a ct scan or the mri,0.0,neutral
I dont remember which when they,0.0,neutral
Ive had those done before not on the brain though,0.0,neutral
and they told me it was really important that I that,0.4,positive
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it,0.6,positive
so Im not gonna flinch,0.0,neutral
and so anyway then began nine days of in hospital stay,0.0,neutral
okay,0.5,positive
a speech therapist told me either that day or the next,0.0,neutral
and for a moment I thought,0.0,neutral
and then she explained what it was,0.0,neutral
I was like,0.0,neutral
and so while I was in the hospital she provided alotof,0.0,neutral
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next,0.0,neutral
and it was ke really important to me,0.4,positive
I was just super motivated,0.3333333333333333,positive
and then when I was released it was gonna be a month,0.0,neutral
and so I contacted her again,0.0,neutral
and I said,0.0,neutral
and so she sent me alot,0.0,neutral
and she just like in the hospital she was willing to send,0.25,positive
and I was so thankful for that,0.0,neutral
and so I just worked on it,0.0,neutral
and then and so Im not in the hospital,0.0,neutral
so I didnt give it to her to check it now,0.0,neutral
I just figured,0.0,neutral
and I got adult coloring books becauseof a high fine,0.2255555555555556,positive
and I went to a teacher supply store and got some kids,0.0,neutral
thats where I estimated my level was at the time,0.0,neutral
and so because when I looked at higher grades like,0.25,positive
but third or fourth it was like,0.0,neutral
and so I did that,0.0,neutral
and I got puzzle books for kids to do,0.0,neutral
and so I did those,0.0,neutral
and I always did like to cook before,0.0,neutral
but now I had a special interest in cooking healthy food,0.4285714285714286,positive
and I want it to be food that tasted good,0.7,positive
and so I got some healthy recipes,0.5,positive
and worked on those,0.0,neutral
and I was surprised to see that I struggled with,0.1,positive
like a jar of garlic,0.0,neutral
half a teaspoon is one clove,-0.16666666666666666,negative
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that,0.0,neutral
I was like,0.0,neutral
and so I didnt know initially that I could use one teaspoon,0.0,neutral
so I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work,-0.16666666666666666,negative
and so and I learned to highlight in the cookbook,0.0,neutral
everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would,0.25,positive
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would,0.0,neutral
and so I did really well with the cooking,0.2,positive
and just as time went on it was no longer a struggle,0.0,neutral
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like,-0.1,negative
I never did figure it out,0.0,neutral
but I was like,0.0,neutral
but I went to therapy,0.0,neutral
and I went to two different therapists,0.0,neutral
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I,0.2,positive
and so I thought,0.0,neutral
so both therapists would see me twice a week,0.0,neutral
and so and there was two different locations,0.0,neutral
and so I went to them,0.0,neutral
and it was exhausting,-0.4,negative
I went back to work at about seven eight seven weeks,0.0,neutral
and it took me eight weeks,0.0,neutral
but I took seven off,0.0,neutral
and so youknow I was leaving work to go to therapy,0.0,neutral
or I would go,0.0,neutral
no I didnt do it xxx,0.0,neutral
I would did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the,0.125,positive
and my employer bless his heart said,0.0,neutral
and I thought,0.0,neutral
I cant I was exhausted as it was,-0.4,negative
and I was like,0.0,neutral
but I just agreed to it,0.0,neutral
I know he didnt have time to check up on me,0.0,neutral
so I said,0.0,neutral
so then I just did all this therapy,0.0,neutral
and my there was one therapist,0.0,neutral
well first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was,0.25,positive
and I think Id been seeing her for maybe youknow two weeks to a,0.0,neutral
and when she was there one evening she recognized me,0.0,neutral
and she called me by name,0.0,neutral
and I just politely acknowledged her,0.0,neutral
but I had no clue who she was,0.0,neutral
and now Ive learned that since my stroke theres some,0.0,neutral
now if the person has something very different about them Ill,-0.25,negative
youknow somebodys got a huge nose or a big old wart at the,0.1666666666666667,positive
just something that would make me remember them then,0.0,neutral
but just yeah its very easy for me to forget who I just,0.43333333333333335,positive
and so I remember her pointing that out at the next,0.0,neutral
she says,0.0,neutral
and I said,0.0,neutral
and so but anyway she worked with me for maybe two,0.0,neutral
and then she moved,0.0,neutral
and then so another person took her place,0.0,neutral
and wasnt real crazy about that person,-0.8999999999999999,negative
but and in hindsight she probably didnt do anything,0.0,neutral
it was just I was just struggling with my confidence,0.0,neutral
and it but then I went to another therapist,0.0,neutral
and that lady was young,0.1,positive
and she was very upbeat and very positive and encouraging,0.22727272727272727,positive
and so that was helpful to me,0.0,neutral
and so we did alotof focusing on short term memory and,0.0,neutral
I did that with her,0.0,neutral
she taught me some card tricks to do that Ive since,0.0,neutral

I dont remember what it was,0.0,neutral

neither one of them did because I worked,0.0,neutral
and they felt like,0.0,neutral
and I was actually kindof relieved because I was just I,0.0,neutral
the fatigue was just crazy,-0.6,negative
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because I,0.0,neutral

they did alotof traveling and everything,0.0,neutral
and I had a s and I have a son too,0.0,neutral

and then my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida,0.0,neutral
and by this time youknow I realized through some,0.0,neutral
and I was always super protective of my kids,0.3333333333333333,positive

that thats kindof it,0.0,neutral
those are the two accidents in a at,0.0,neutral
West Tenth going into West Tenth and,0.0,neutral
okay,0.5,positive
the after the first the eighty four incident,0.25,positive
what had happened was that the eighty four laptops,0.0,neutral

Ill call it,-0.5,negative
I wont say leisure work play with,0.0,neutral

oughta be able to know how to use that,0.5,positive
and so they brought this my boss brought,0.0,neutral

selectq,0.0,neutral
well had we never had any training in a in,0.0,neutral

theres one feu,0.0,neutral
select meat,0.0,neutral
an aphasia,0.0,neutral
selectq meant what they meant by,0.0,neutral
I just could not,0.0,neutral
there was no way,0.0,neutral
Im extraordinary troubled really troubled by that,-0.22222222222222224,negative

thats what they meant by selectq,0.0,neutral
well hell that was never described in the manual at all,0.0,neutral
and that really that threw me for a loop,0.2,positive
and so I became very questioning as to whether,0.0,neutral
and so finally the like I say the,0.0,neutral
the most basic of terms which the,0.0,neutral
or my no this is DOS not Microsoft,0.0,neutral
this is before Microsoft existed,0.0,neutral
this DOS manual it did not comprehend,0.0,neutral

Imean just being able to write things down,0.5,positive
so I carry a small,-0.25,negative

the I think I mentioned to you last week,0.0,neutral
y possibly I didnt,0.0,neutral
but the time Id spent some time as a at the rehab,-0.1,negative

you just youre able to survive,0.5,positive
just a the thing youre able to just could just check,0.5,positive

and over the course the next twenty years wife and I,0.0,neutral
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five,0.0,neutral
thats what theyre telling people even fifteen years ago,0.0,neutral
and so I wanted to share that with,0.0,neutral
but it is takes a long time,-0.05,negative
and in oh,0.0,neutral
hey you dont stop recovering,0.0,neutral
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly,-0.025000000000000022,negative
but you never stop recovering,0.0,neutral
I had a in the eight the eighty four,0.0,neutral

Imean ke I Ive gone to a bunch of doctors,0.0,neutral

so it took about maybe three or four hours to have youknow go through,0.0,neutral
they did some task,0.0,neutral
and I think they have a good stroke thing,0.7,positive

and I never saw her again,0.0,neutral
and becauseof my medical insurance when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before they could start my speech therapy,0.0,neutral

looking around the room,0.0,neutral
looking at each object in the room,0.0,neutral
naming it,0.0,neutral
trying to find the word and say the word out loud,0.1,positive

and I found when writing I taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldnt spell properly anymore,0.0,neutral
and youknow that was something I had to work at,0.0,neutral

and with a notebood,0.0,neutral
it has a spellchecker and a ell,0.0,neutral
not Im not sure what youd call it necessarily,0.25,positive
a checker,0.0,neutral

so that sometimes helped alot aswell writing,0.0,neutral
so Ive done alotof that,0.0,neutral
but its mainly working with seeing what seeing the words and then saying it out loud,0.13333333333333333,positive
thats done more I think better than anything else,0.5,positive
and I worked hard at it for a long time,-0.17083333333333334,negative

smack by the time I,0.0,neutral
I could listen to the news and understand what I was hearing,0.0,neutral
but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do,0.0,neutral
so I tried to cope with it by asking my wife,0.0,neutral
and I started trying to work one line at a time in one column,0.0,neutral
that was difficult,-0.5,negative
but when I felt I could repeat that and say it then I would try to get,0.0,neutral

now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was,0.0,neutral

and I had jumbled,0.0,neutral
and I even saved it because it was very jumbled,0.0,neutral
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after it was very jumbled,0.0,neutral
and so thats when I heard about the StrokeComebackCenter from the traveling nurse that came by to attend me,0.0,neutral
and she said,0.0,neutral
and I said,0.0,neutral
and so I came here and was starting on a once a week schedule,0.0,neutral
and I felt it was a very good experience because I started making progress,0.7,positive
and what I l Ive always said about with FirstnameM and the center as a general is they seem to have a very good way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge but not over not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it,0.2875,positive
so if it was,0.0,neutral
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and,0.0,neutral
and this sorta,0.0,neutral
so it was a,0.0,neutral
and then she said FirstnameM said,0.0,neutral
so I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students,0.0,neutral
and after,0.0,neutral
I decided I would start to write a maybe a little journal of my experiences from the day as I recalled it from the day I had my first stroke and to the recovery period,0.03125,positive
and I ended up doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester,0.0,neutral
and I ended up labelling it as Firstnames aphasia journal,0.0,neutral
and I would write a little section each week,-0.1875,negative
and then she would kindof react respond back to me,0.0,neutral
but I would build on it and finally ended that up,0.0,neutral
and she turned it in as her theme her project for the me for the semester,0.0,neutral
and hadta give a presentation on this interaction,0.0,neutral
so all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this,0.2,positive
but I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again,0.0,neutral
and thats when xxx sent me in and dgmostu,0.0,neutral

but that is probably why I caught the clot,0.0,neutral
and xxx,0.0,neutral
