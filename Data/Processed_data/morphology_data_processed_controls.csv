sounds like a ten minute interview,33.33333333333333

it was important to me to get into law school,50.0
that was something that happened that was very important,66.66666666666666
I have no idea why I was accepted because I dont think I met any,62.5
thirty two,0.0
I was thirty two when I started,57.14285714285714
so I guess I was thirty one when I applied,50.0
and in my year the median age was twenty two,40.0
so I was one of the oldest in the class had nothing in common,57.14285714285714
Imean they still remembered highschool,20.0
who thought about highschool,50.0
and they all knew eachother from highschool,42.857142857142854
and they were there because they didnt get into medical school or,46.15384615384615
and I was just flummoxed,40.0
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came,53.84615384615385
they were just there because,60.0
well I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the,64.28571428571429
and I was there because I just really cared,44.44444444444444
and so I really didnt fit in really,33.33333333333333
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real,60.0
up until then I was friendly with people but I didnt understand,53.84615384615385
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study,46.15384615384615
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what,50.0
ke they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious,40.0
why would anybody say the obvious,66.66666666666666
so people said the obvious,20.0
and they were rewarded,50.0
so those were the people sought after to be in the study groups,53.84615384615385
not me,50.0
so I did almost everything alone for the entire year,40.0
and when I asked to borrow one of my friends notes she said she,42.857142857142854
so I said,33.33333333333333
thanks but no thanks,25.0
dont bother,33.33333333333333
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didnt,38.46153846153847
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it,54.54545454545454
so that was me,75.0
so I was part of that group for some classes,60.0
at the end of the year in the subway station I met someone who,64.28571428571429
but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy,41.66666666666667
and she was in the other group,57.14285714285714
so I never saw her,40.0
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I,38.46153846153847
and that was good,50.0
ke once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one,28.57142857142857
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the,58.333333333333336
and he said,33.33333333333333
please when you write your exams dont think that your mark is,53.84615384615385
and I thought,33.33333333333333
wow it is so amazing to hear something like that,50.0
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged,58.333333333333336
it was in law school that I learned that competentq was a,66.66666666666666
oh hes a competent lawyer,33.33333333333333
and that the positive term was brightq,42.857142857142854
if you werent bright you were nobody,75.0
so because he wasnt bright the students didnt respect him,50.0
and I made the mistake of saying to someone,55.55555555555556
youknow yeah okay but hes decent,14.285714285714285
ke hes a decent person,33.33333333333333
he has a heart,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
a heart,50.0
I didnt come to Oz where this one doesnt have a brain and this,50.0
I came to law school,40.0
didnt talk to her again,50.0
UofT,0.0
UofT was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada,33.33333333333333
I dont know why,60.0
and I also didnt understand that law schools had their own kind of,28.57142857142857
but I didnt I didnt know that,44.44444444444444
I didnt even get it until after I left,60.0
so really it wasnt the right school for me,50.0
I really should have gone to York,57.14285714285714
but when I came to Toronto people were saying,44.44444444444444
oh UofT,0.0
its the best school,50.0
and why would you wanna be way out at York,50.0

well whats happening is that firefighters are rushing,55.55555555555556
but it looks like what happened is that the little girls cat was,53.84615384615385
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat,40.0
and then he got stuck,20.0
and then the firemen are coming to save the man,30.0

one day the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an,30.0
Cinderella thinking shes a member of the family thinks she can,50.0
but she cant,50.0
so she has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get,18.181818181818183
and then they go,25.0
after they leave shes very disappointed because she really wanted,45.45454545454545
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her,27.27272727272727
so she gives her a beautiful dress to wear lovely new shoes and,23.076923076923077
and the only rule is be back by twelve,44.44444444444444
so Cinderella went to the ball,33.33333333333333

following that the prince found the missing slipper,37.5
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper,41.66666666666667
so he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on womens,41.66666666666667
it didnt fit anybody,60.0
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly,46.15384615384615
and he tried it on their feet,57.14285714285714
it didnt fit any of them,71.42857142857143
and he saw Cinderella and said,16.666666666666664
why dont you try it,66.66666666666666
or possibly she said,25.0
why dont I try it,66.66666666666666
and he tried it on,60.0
and it fit,33.33333333333333
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after,64.28571428571429

I just did it because I felt I could do it,63.63636363636363
and it was immensely challenging,40.0
but I struggled through it,60.0
and I was very successful,40.0
a typical day a workday,40.0
Ill describe a typical workday,20.0
Im up at five am,33.33333333333333
Im just I just got useta getting up really early,27.27272727272727
and I would have a cup of coffee,50.0
and I would brush my teeth and shave and shower,30.0
and then I would put on my sweatpants and tshirt,40.0
and if its the wintertime Id get on my jacket and winter,38.46153846153847
and I would go around the block for a walk a couple two,53.84615384615385
pe especially when its colder you kindof,57.14285714285714
and so by the time Im Ive done I would go out go out,62.5
by then Im sweating,60.0
so that gives gives my my it revs up my whole,54.54545454545454
and thats thats great because it just jumpstarts my whole,41.66666666666667
and then Ill just undress and cool down and then get,9.090909090909092
and I dont typically have a morning breakfast,33.33333333333333
its just something I got used to,57.14285714285714
and it works really well for me,42.857142857142854
I I dont consume dairy products because Im lactose intolerant,41.66666666666667
and so Ill walk to work,0.0

well maybe almost a full cup but with brown sugar again,18.181818181818183
and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative,50.0
and you check your email and other voicemail and all these,36.36363636363637
so administration consumes alotof time,0.0
and by then its eight oclock,33.33333333333333

whatever is whatever I have on my desk or whatever is,72.72727272727273
and so that will take up consume most of my morning,45.45454545454545
I tend not to eat or snack in the during the day,41.66666666666667
I Im Im a little bit disciplined with that,54.54545454545454

and it didnt work well for me,50.0
I was very overweight at one time,42.857142857142854
and I it didnt work well for me,55.55555555555556
so I and and then I sit down all day,40.0
and so thats that became a problem because I was,54.54545454545454
so I really hadta get rid of the weight,44.44444444444444

and his mother is looking at him saying,50.0

so anyway the,33.33333333333333
no Im sorry,25.0
then it looks like he used the ladder,50.0
and the ladder has fallen,40.0
and he is stuck in the tree,57.14285714285714
and the dog is barking because they are all up in the tree,53.84615384615385
and the firemen hafta come and rescue,14.285714285714285
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house,58.333333333333336
and there was a stepmother,40.0
and the stepmother had two daughters,16.666666666666664
the father dies,33.33333333333333
and the daughters the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they so to speak,36.666666666666664
so Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and and all of that,47.368421052631575
and then the the the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes,35.714285714285715
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella,16.666666666666664
and then comes the the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the for there to be a dance,47.82608695652174
and everybody is all is all youknow looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the the perfect outfit,52.38095238095239
and and Cinderella is not going to go to the ball,27.27272727272727
and she is at home,60.0
and and and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot,20.0
so they find I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the in a in a hope chest or I guess what I would call now a hope chest,50.0
and so that becomes,25.0
I dont wait a minute,50.0
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing,54.54545454545454
so the sisters go to the ball,42.857142857142854
and and poor Cinderella is home with her mice,33.33333333333333
and and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe,27.27272727272727
so the fairy godmother creates the the carriage to take her in,41.66666666666667
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect,40.0
and and her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball,30.76923076923077
so when when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there,57.14285714285714
and everyone is just,50.0
takes her breath away and she takes their breath away,30.0
and she meets the prince,40.0
and they dance,33.33333333333333
and they have a wonderful time,33.33333333333333
but what happens is the clock strikes twelve,37.5
and she needs to be home,33.33333333333333
and she is running out the door,57.14285714285714
and her slipper is her shoe is left behind,55.55555555555556
so she goes home,25.0
the sisters and whatnot they all go home,37.5
and and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper,46.666666666666664
and he combs through the village,50.0
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers,33.33333333333333
and it doesnt work,40.0
and then loandbehold he finds Cinderella,16.666666666666664
and the shoe fits,25.0
they get married,33.33333333333333
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
the end the end,50.0
and way too many girls are looking for Princecharming,22.22222222222222

I could eat my youknow my crinkle cuts my shoe strings with pasta,46.15384615384615
I could do anything,75.0
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say,53.333333333333336
my my my obstetrician youknow during the the buildup to this would say youll be sorry,70.58823529411765
and I said youknow I cannot imagine regretting this,40.0
youknow Im eating Im making ice cream sandwiches with the the the the,60.0
its two pieces of pound cake youknow with the HagenDazs in in the middle,50.0
so then I get to the hospital,42.857142857142854
and it was really nasty,40.0
it was really it was probably the worst experience I ever had,50.0
I was told that if I had automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward,55.00000000000001
thats what I was told,66.66666666666666
and I did it did spark revenge in me that I actually carried out,64.28571428571429
youknow my my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook,50.0
he said,50.0
well were just going to break your water,25.0
itll move things along,60.0
I said,50.0
no,0.0
dont,0.0
step back,0.0
step back,0.0
just leave me alone,25.0
I can do this myself youknow,66.66666666666666
and then he kept saying,20.0
relax,0.0
I dont understand while youre not relaxed,55.55555555555556
and this is psychological Im sure,42.857142857142854
every time he said relax I became even more infuriated,30.0
youknow this is the effect it had on me,66.66666666666666
and he wasnt listening when I said stop saying that,45.45454545454545
when you tell some one to stop doing X you expect them to stop doing that,37.5
so anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful,22.22222222222222
she was born smiling right away recognized my voice,33.33333333333333
it was just the the most special experience of my whole life,50.0
and so now I went for my first postpartum checkup,30.0
and Im sitting on the table,57.14285714285714
and he youknow does the finger pricks and to get some blood out,30.76923076923077
and he turns around,50.0
and he puts the little tube in the machine,44.44444444444444
and then he turns it on,50.0
and the machine is whirring,40.0
and I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock,46.15384615384615
it happened really fast,25.0
and I threw him on to the table,62.5
and then I jumped on top of him put my knee in his groin,50.0
and I was,66.66666666666666
his glasses were askew,50.0
and he his tie was crooked,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
relax,0.0
relax,0.0
I dont understand why youre not relaxed,55.55555555555556
whats the matter youknow,40.0
it was such a calamity,80.0
and although youknow it was all in good fun because later on youknow he,57.14285714285714
and his wife useta work in his office,37.5
and they had a nurse too,33.33333333333333
and they said,33.33333333333333
selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives,50.0
its really selfish on I on our part,62.5
so that was it,75.0
thats it Keli,50.0
that was a big big experience youknow PeeWees big adventure,30.0
well it seems theres a boy out playing,44.44444444444444
kicks the soccer ball,25.0
unfortunately it goes right into the window breaks it,44.44444444444444
Im gonna guess thats his father sitting there,36.36363636363637
now he gets the ball,40.0
and hes looking at the surveying the damage and his son I guess,50.0
and it doesnt doesnt look like its going to end too too well,33.33333333333333
might be a problem,75.0
okay well heres this little child I guess leaving for school,27.27272727272727
mother saying,0.0
take your umbrella,33.33333333333333
child says,0.0
no no I dont need an umbrella,37.5
very optimistic,0.0
I do the same thing,40.0
now its raining,33.33333333333333
and now its pouring,25.0
and then the child comes home youknow obviously soaking wet,10.0
the mother is kindof in her Itoldyousoqadj mode,50.0
and the little the little boy I guess it is he learned a lesson,50.0
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella,54.54545454545454
life is learning from ones mistakes,33.33333333333333
listen to your mother,50.0
well the cats up in the tree,57.14285714285714
they get stuck in trees I guess,42.857142857142854
Ive Ive heard stories like that,75.0
I guess its the the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like shes ready to catch the cat,41.37931034482759
the little dog ofcourse wants the cat down for different reasons,36.36363636363637
and then the fire department shows up,28.57142857142857
which theyre good like that,66.66666666666666
they got the ladder,50.0
and all is well,50.0
so Cinderella is sent to live with this with a family,45.45454545454545
and she is basically a a maid,57.14285714285714
and they there are the two epsis the two,44.44444444444444
I think its the wicked stepsisters if I recall,55.55555555555556
and they were they were rather homely,57.14285714285714
and Cinderella ofcourse was very pretty,16.666666666666664
and shes very youknow sweet and helpful,12.5
and these two are kindof spoiled and youknow not very pleasant,27.27272727272727
and theres going to be a ball,50.0
and I I believe invitations go out,42.857142857142854
and the two sisters are going to theyre going to go to the ball,46.666666666666664
and Cinderella is not invited,20.0
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in,28.57142857142857
and Cinderella ends up with,40.0
well its all magical youknow right,33.33333333333333
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach,55.55555555555556
and by dint of youknow luck and good favor from the fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball,36.84210526315789
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight,57.14285714285714
so shes dancing with the prince having a wonderful time,45.45454545454545
the other two sisters I I forgot where,50.0
they just kindof melted into the background,57.14285714285714
they werent very popular,40.0
I could have told you that from the beginning youknow,70.0
but anyhow Cinderella finds out what time it is,44.44444444444444
and she needs to leave youknow to get into the the the carriage to go back before midnight,33.33333333333333
and she her slipper fill,40.0
and the prince finds it,40.0
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that youknow he wants to find this this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper,42.42424242424242
I remember the details now from my own picture book,40.0
put it on,66.66666666666666
when when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet,46.666666666666664
and the slipper was ke even half not even half the size of her foot,40.0
so anyway they locked Cinderella up,33.33333333333333
I think nobody wanted them to find her,50.0
and the mice helped,25.0
they brought the key,50.0
and the mice she youknow the animals loved her,44.44444444444444
they were her friends,75.0
and ofcourse it all ends happily ever after,37.5
she does it does it is discovered that the slipper fits her,66.66666666666666
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince,40.0
just the way we all live,50.0
its exactly what my experience has been,71.42857142857143
its the same thing,50.0
its like they its like they met me,75.0
and they ali youknow they they it was the youknow really it was like they knew me,64.70588235294117
its so uncanny,33.33333333333333
alright well first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture,47.05882352941176
now when I make a sandwich,50.0
and its not just with peanut butter and jelly,22.22222222222222
I I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up youknow,47.61904761904761
its got to be just right,33.33333333333333
so anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter,42.857142857142854
again two slices of bread is nice but for this well put the peanut butter on first with a knife,40.0
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around,52.63157894736842
and it it just works better than with the knife,50.0
and thats it,50.0
youknow in this case you could cut it in half fold it in half get another piece,52.94117647058824
youknow if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle youknow like that,54.166666666666664
and thats it,50.0
I like a good smdu,40.0
oh gee,0.0
actually I fainted once,25.0
and thats a terrible feeling,33.33333333333333
and I guess youknow I guess we could compare that to a a stroke in the sense that its a sudden onset,59.09090909090909
and you do have a a short window if its the same as a stroke,60.0
there in my case theres a short window of realizing something is really wrong,46.666666666666664
and you do have time to to be cognizant of being in big trouble,42.857142857142854
infact I remember one time I I I fainted,44.44444444444444
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house,54.54545454545454
and that was I was really afraid of of the fact that I was in a hard tile room,63.1578947368421
and my daughter was downstairs,40.0
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight,30.0
and I just in a panic I said,50.0
Dolly call nineoneone,0.0
so I knew I was in trouble,57.14285714285714
and I I then I I was able to just slowly go down myself,50.0
and then I went outof the picture,28.57142857142857
and the paramedics did take me to the hospital,55.55555555555556
and I had food poisoning,20.0
and when I got,50.0
now that was really frightening as youknow they theyre racing me through the the er,62.5
theyre asking me youknow all sorts of information,55.55555555555556
and and the pocketbook disappears,20.0
and then youknow testing and monitors and all that,22.22222222222222
and they said,33.33333333333333
youknow your potassium level is in the basement,50.0
so it was really a,60.0
and youknow you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either youknow in the hospital or even dying,30.434782608695656
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to those sortof sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly,40.909090909090914
so it was truly an emergency situation,42.857142857142854
so and my daughter as young as she was youknow I credit Natalie with youknow the fact that it wasnt worse,45.45454545454545
that she she just listened to me and didnt question it and dialed nineoneone,46.666666666666664
yeah so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice I think,37.5
right,0.0
and thats probably as scary just like that,33.33333333333333
yeah yeah,0.0
I was in the hospital for the night,75.0
and they gave me a liquid potassium,42.857142857142854
and then in ivs,25.0
and then I left the hospital with,42.857142857142854
well before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions youknow to to call,36.84210526315789
but it was liquid potassium and ivs for many hours,30.0
and they were monitoring me and youknow taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that,29.411764705882355
so but youknow I was out youknow by the next morning,36.36363636363637
but still,0.0
I felt really weak and tired,16.666666666666664
Imean you needed to recover,20.0
the the the rest of that day was really kindof not on the map youknow,53.333333333333336
but Imean I I just felt really really tired,22.22222222222222
and wiped out maybe is better,33.33333333333333
tired tired doesnt capture it,33.33333333333333
youknow it was scary,50.0
youknow when you see these stories right,42.857142857142854
you you hear them,75.0
somebody died,50.0
ke how do they die,60.0
right right,0.0
it can be serious,75.0
and I had been doing a good deed that day,50.0
I was at the YogiBerra stadium,66.66666666666666
at the time and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation,57.89473684210527
and I was at the YogiBerra stadium working an event,50.0
it was family day,50.0
and they had I had some chicken,42.857142857142854
and thats thats what did me in,55.55555555555556
trying to do a good thing right,14.285714285714285
they almost killed me,50.0
yes,0.0
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it,57.14285714285714
a very dear friend of mine was was had cancer and was dying,38.46153846153847
youknow she was at that youknow close point,50.0
and she I guess it was the liver starting to shut down,50.0
youknow the again the organs the the kidney and liver especially the liver,38.46153846153847
and she was incoherent,50.0
and she was speaking to me,66.66666666666666
this was a very strange experience,50.0
she was speaking to me,80.0
but I couldnt understand a single word that she said,45.45454545454545
and it was just gibberish,40.0
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way,50.0
and she would it would be frustrating for her that I wasnt understanding what she said,70.58823529411765
and it sounded like words too,33.33333333333333
but it wasnt,50.0
and I spoke with the the nurse who was caring for her,66.66666666666666
she was at home,75.0
and I was told that when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen,47.05882352941176
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of youknow the medical sequence of events,43.75
but but that thats very frustrating to be,33.33333333333333
and I could see the frustration on her face,55.55555555555556
and then I feel badly,20.0
and I feel frustrated too because I I really wanna understand and and cant,40.0
well you could only have simple communications at that point sortof like point to things,40.0
and then I would I would I would tell her at different ver intervals,57.14285714285714
I cannot understand what youre saying,62.5
and she would feel even worse,33.33333333333333
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was saying words,46.15384615384615
I I realized that pretty pretty quickly,42.857142857142854
she she thought she was youknow saying things,50.0
so I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or just pretend sometimes I even understood,30.76923076923077
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever,61.53846153846154
youknow then she would it would be pretty clear Im not coming with the water,56.25
but that that thats very frightening,42.857142857142854
and and its frustrating for everyone,50.0
youre imprisoned in your own body in a way arent you,61.53846153846154
yeah that hasta be a hell,50.0
,0.0
something important,50.0
I guess alotof important things sortof happened youknow,12.5
be hard to,33.33333333333333
I think I think in a sense I made my own important things,46.15384615384615
for instance I grew up in a family,62.5
I was one of five children,50.0
and now I dont want this to sound youknow politically incorrect but my father was Italian of Italian descent,30.0
and he had this mind set that girls just dont go to college,35.714285714285715
and unfortunately four of us were girls,42.857142857142854
so he didnt that wasnt a,50.0
he wasnt pleased with that either I dont think,54.54545454545454
and I was the third one,50.0
can you imagine,66.66666666666666
in a row,66.66666666666666
no boys yet,33.33333333333333
so anyhow it was made very clear that college was not on the map,42.857142857142854
and his his his idea was that,71.42857142857143
Ive been supporting you all these years,75.0
and now you owe me,40.0
youknow you hafta go to work and contribute to the household,36.36363636363637
so this was a builtin thing,50.0
at the time I wasnt realizing how grave it was,63.63636363636363
infact there was something that felt almost exciting about it,50.0
that Ill be going to work soon youknow,25.0
and the good news was that I was also an honor student,50.0
and I got to highschool at twelve,28.57142857142857
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete,45.45454545454545
and now I was going to work,28.57142857142857
so my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasnt going to college because I was an honor student,57.14285714285714
she actually wanted to call him,33.33333333333333
and I was very calm about the whole thing,44.44444444444444
I said,50.0
theres really no point,40.0
youknow its youre not going to get anywhere,33.33333333333333
this is the state of things,66.66666666666666
its the state of the art at the Lastname household,60.0
and thats that,50.0
so anyway she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on WallStreet and who worked at a personnel department at what was then the IrvingTrustCompany which no longer exists,44.11764705882353
and they took great pride in that that company,44.44444444444444
they they were at one WallStreet,66.66666666666666
and they considered themselves at the top of WallStreet,55.55555555555556
and this was verbalized,50.0
so anyway she called her friend,33.33333333333333
and Ill never forget her,20.0
her name was FirstnameLastname who I went to see,44.44444444444444
so I I put a suit on went shopping and bought myself youknow a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview,37.5
and I think I was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her,56.25
and so she hired me,40.0
and I ended up in a subbasement,57.14285714285714
not just a basement,25.0
it was a subbasement,75.0
I think I was lower than the vaults,62.5
in a secretarial pool where else,50.0
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool,61.53846153846154
I did,50.0
and good good on me,40.0
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to,58.333333333333336
eventhough I had an academic course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study,47.05882352941176
and I and I I took typing and stenography,33.33333333333333
I thought this might help me,66.66666666666666
and maybe my job wont be so random,33.33333333333333
I have atleast a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up youknow,47.05882352941176
so I end up in a secretarial pool,50.0
and they banks are notoriously very frugal,28.57142857142857
and back then the things were even worse,25.0
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization,50.0
and I I I preface that because they didnt tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because theres a fee involved,46.15384615384615
so if somebody youknow in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches youknow where I was,51.61290322580645
so I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in,38.46153846153847
it was sortof like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at being at any orphanage where a call comes in,60.86956521739131
and they pick you,50.0
so they a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust department on the twelfth floor,50.0
he was a a a senior vice president of the bank,63.63636363636363
his secretary was unexpectedly out,40.0
and they needed a fillin,40.0
so they selected me,50.0
and up I went,25.0
and I walked in,50.0
and you could hear a pin drop in this place,50.0
I could tell it was going to be,62.5
I didnt know how I was going to generate any level of youknow lightheartedness,46.666666666666664
you youknow it it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water,62.5
and you should genuflect youknow before you to sit down at your desk,53.84615384615385
so there I am,50.0
and it turned out that his secretary,57.14285714285714
Ill fast forward alittle,0.0
so here I was,50.0
youknow my skills were good,40.0
Im answering the phone,60.0
Im taking shorthand letters,40.0
things are getting things are humming along,42.857142857142854
everything is great,66.66666666666666
and it turns out that she the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back,56.25
she was pregnant and was having some difficulties some complications so the the absence was going to be long term,50.0
and they hired me,50.0
so now and I had a raise right away,22.22222222222222
I thought this work life is a cinch,50.0
Im here for a week and I got a raise,45.45454545454545
I got outof the subbasement youknow,33.33333333333333
Im in the light of day,57.14285714285714
things were youknow ke things were moving along so quickly that I I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on WallStreet youknow,34.61538461538461
it was the trajectory I was on,85.71428571428571
so one day I was there I was there for about three months I guess,40.0
and I was out to lunch still trying to youknow explore the area,38.46153846153847
its a very exciting place youknow,33.33333333333333
WallStreet,0.0
and I found the NewYork StockExchange,33.33333333333333
and I youknow I was m sortof like a pseudo tourist,45.45454545454545
so I was walking up Broadway one day,37.5
and I encounter the MarineMidlandBank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories,33.33333333333333
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving,37.5
it just youknow it was a great place light and airy modern,33.33333333333333
I went in,66.66666666666666
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was,45.45454545454545
so I was directed there,40.0
I sat down filled out an application,57.14285714285714
and I was drunk with power by then youknow because I had gotten the raise,53.333333333333336
things were moving so quickly,20.0
so I filled out the application,50.0
the interview with the personnel manager went very well,33.33333333333333
she told me about three different types of positions I could have,41.66666666666667
and visited all three of them,50.0
and I could pick whichever one I wanted,50.0
so I picked the one in the international department,44.44444444444444
that sounded really interesting to me,50.0
and was working for an executive there,42.857142857142854
and it was just a wonderful environment,42.857142857142854
and I was in the LatinAmerican division,57.14285714285714
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and Chile,11.11111111111111
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when there was the coupdetat in Chile when SalvadorAllende was,61.904761904761905
and we had lots of money,33.33333333333333
we we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the LatinAmerican area,42.10526315789473
so those were those were some pretty exciting times,55.55555555555556
and I then I was there for a few years,50.0
and my direct boss who was the he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office,54.166666666666664
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor,33.33333333333333
so ofcourse youknow how romance always wins out,25.0
I had a boyfriend,50.0
I didnt wanna move to Paris,42.857142857142854
and many people probably would have said Paris youknow,22.22222222222222
and ke it would have been,66.66666666666666
I look back,33.33333333333333
I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didnt work out either,42.857142857142854
but thats okay,25.0
so I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was alittle more fast moving and exciting,42.857142857142854
I I figured this is a good youknow juncture to get outof banking,38.46153846153847
it seemed very staid no matter where you were,44.44444444444444
so I I I got a an agent,62.5
I had youknow kindof felt my way around youknow how things work down on the street by then,50.0
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms,40.0
so to fast forward,0.0
hope that wasnt too long a story,37.5
then I I I I had my daughter,62.5
I was a stayathome mom,60.0
and the college thing was always on my mind,44.44444444444444
so I applied to MontclairState,40.0
and and I was accepted,40.0
I came in at the time was a second career program,54.54545454545454
and the important thing was that I did it,55.55555555555556
I got my degree,50.0
and I graduated summacumlaude,25.0
and I had marvelous experiences,20.0
and plus I was a day student,42.857142857142854
and that was another thing for me,71.42857142857143
I realized that I could still kindof live the life I might have,53.84615384615385
when I mention a day student its because I was a young always among young mainstream students,52.94117647058824
and I thought,33.33333333333333
gee maybe Ill be sortof ostracized from main society here,20.0
but I wasnt,50.0
and they liked me,50.0
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience,60.0
so I got the degree anyway,33.33333333333333
and here I am,50.0
yeah,0.0
youre welcome,33.33333333333333
yeah this is that same disaster that we had last week,45.45454545454545
disastro,0.0
the boy is outside having fun youknow kicking around the soccer ball,33.33333333333333
and crash,0.0
it goes right through the window,50.0
looks like his father,50.0
knocks the lamp over too I see,42.857142857142854
the father was happen happened to be sitting in the chair,45.45454545454545
and he gets up,50.0
and hes got the ball in his hand,55.55555555555556
he looks out the window,60.0
and seems like the boy is going to have a bad evening,33.33333333333333
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that,55.55555555555556
funny he was just sitting there,33.33333333333333
you dont even see a newspaper or something youknow,40.0
he was just sitting there ke waiting for disaster to strike,36.36363636363637
well we have what looks to be a mother and her child,41.66666666666667
its funny,50.0
my first impression is a girl a little girl,44.44444444444444
but in other pictures I dont know,37.5
I think its a little boy,50.0
maybe its sposta be r generic,33.33333333333333
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella,36.36363636363637
child says no,33.33333333333333
youknow that that whole idea is rejected,42.857142857142854
mother offers the umbrella again,20.0
no bye,0.0
uhoh outside started to rain,0.0
now its pouring,33.33333333333333
child comes in soaked,25.0
the mother is standing there with that youknow Itoldyousoqadj attitude and and kindof annoyed I guess,31.25
but thats what mothers do youknow,42.857142857142854
you wanna protect your child,60.0
and the child they dont like the idea,44.44444444444444
they think youre mean and difficult,28.57142857142857
you just dont want your child to fall down and skin their knee,35.714285714285715
you dont want them to get wet,37.5
you dont want anything to happen to this child,50.0
I know thats how I was,71.42857142857143
and so now its another rainy day,28.57142857142857
or later maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella,40.0
learned a lesson,33.33333333333333
listen to the mother,50.0
and youknow so maybe a lesson learned for the future,30.0
that maybe mommy youknow isnt that bad after all,20.0
trying to protect me,25.0
well we have a cat emergency here,28.57142857142857
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like,60.0
and I guess the father or maybe some well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder,31.57894736842105
got up in the tree,60.0
hes stuck up there too now,14.285714285714285
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to get the cat,31.57894736842105
and now I see the fire department is on the scene,45.45454545454545
and theyre going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after,35.294117647058826
well for reasons that werent entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a being a maid working for this family,54.54545454545454
and it was a mother and her two daughters,44.44444444444444
they were just very shrill and very unattractive young women,20.0
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and just just very nice,8.333333333333332
these two were were very spoiled and and didnt have any appreciation for anything,46.666666666666664
Imean Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard youknow animals loved her,25.0
the horse the whoever was out there,57.14285714285714
mice even youknow,0.0
she was a delight,75.0
anyway theres a a an an announcement comes to the unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their their their mcmansion I guess where they live,55.55555555555556
they werent in a castle,66.66666666666666
they got an invitation to to a ball,50.0
the prince was going to give a ball,37.5
and Cinderella useta she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance,47.05882352941176
and so when news came of this ball she was also silently very excited about it,43.75
but the two girls youknow ofcourse they were going,33.33333333333333
they had an invitation,50.0
and somehow I forget some of the details in between,60.0
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up youknow helping working some magic,35.714285714285715
and Cinderella does go to the ball,42.857142857142854
ke a pumpkin that that that what was that gets turned into a a a carriage and with horses,68.42105263157895
and shes got a beautiful gown on,50.0
and she just looks really just beautiful,14.285714285714285
and she the prince ofcourse youknow sees her right away,30.0
and youknow one of those across the crowded room,44.44444444444444
and they danced all night,40.0
and it was very romantic,40.0
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the that or whoever or that they were,57.89473684210527
was that the stepsisters or was that another story,66.66666666666666
the wicked stepsisters I dont know,42.857142857142854
anyhow those horrible faces like,40.0
so anyway the the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight,42.857142857142854
and you see the the the clock is is striking twelve,54.54545454545454
and shes saying goodbye to the prince,50.0
and ofcourse he doesnt wanna let her to leave,30.0
and shes late,25.0
shes running down this youknow a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe,46.666666666666664
one of her glass slippers,40.0
and the butler or whoever majordomo from the the palace was sent around youknow to the town to find who fits into the shoe,50.0
and Cinderella gets locked up,40.0
youknow the mother the that horrible mother thought that youknow theyd cram the shoe on one of her daughters feet,42.857142857142854
and I remember their feet were ugly too,37.5
and the mice end up getting,33.33333333333333
oh she was locked in this room youknow,50.0
they didnt want her on the scene,62.5
and the mice brought her the key,42.857142857142854
she got out and tried on the shoe,50.0
ofcourse it fit perfectly,25.0
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after,30.0
one hopes,0.0
and I hope they werent the bridesmaids at the wedding those those horrible people,53.333333333333336
okay,0.0
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here,27.27272727272727
otherwise its an open face,40.0
they dont call it a sandwich right,50.0
so be nice,33.33333333333333
well were pretend we have two pieces of bread,33.33333333333333
and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread,52.94117647058824
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread,53.333333333333336
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both,58.333333333333336
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly,40.0
and just gently spread that on,33.33333333333333
close it up maybe cut it in half,50.0
because I love smdzu,50.0
but I dont like a bite of the crust first,45.45454545454545
on a peanut butter its,60.0
so thats why I,80.0
yeah and I like to cut it ke on the diagonal,36.36363636363637
hasta be a particular way youknow,33.33333333333333
yes I had in in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor,47.368421052631575
and he told me that if as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen,50.0
and two days later it ruptured,16.666666666666664
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm,54.54545454545454
and fortunately it was he needed do surgery,37.5
but after that I was fine,66.66666666666666
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain Ive ever experienced,50.0
so thats the first thing that came to mind,30.0
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically,57.14285714285714
and it could not be,60.0
so it was full blown surgery,33.33333333333333
and I remember being I was obviously much younger,44.44444444444444
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience,45.45454545454545
and I hadta go very slowly,16.666666666666664
and I was outof work for a long time which is what I remember the most,56.25
and then little by little I just got my strength back until,33.33333333333333
I had the the privilege of working with a hippotherapy organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who worked with children with multiple sclerosis and and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally,40.54054054054054
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying,45.0
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would would elicit your sympathy,50.0
and you just sortof hadta tell them to youknow to to buck up and do it,25.0
but it was very it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that,44.44444444444444
and now ofcourse here Im doing that in in in a much broader spectrum,40.0
there are several,33.33333333333333
let me think what would be a good story,55.55555555555556
well very recently two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country,30.0
and since we didnt have complete leisure time we v divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every major league un major league stadium in the country,32.5
and in two thousand twelve we completed that,37.5
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in in thirty cities,35.714285714285715
yeah and it was absolutely wonderful,33.33333333333333
and then ofcourse they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami,23.076923076923077
so on Memorialday weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there,38.88888888888889
and in August well be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there,38.095238095238095
so when we hear if you build it they will come we think its meant for us and that were going to go see baseball games,50.0
and eventhough I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had,43.333333333333336
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that wed never seen or never would have seen,40.0
and it was just the the the best six years the best time I can I can recall,55.55555555555556
and we love to talk about it,42.857142857142854
yep,0.0
okay theres a young boy kicking a soccer ball,30.0
he doesnt know his own strength so he kicks it r very far and very hard,35.294117647058826
and it breaks the window,40.0
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball,33.33333333333333
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked,45.45454545454545
oh thats the ball,40.0
Im sorry,33.33333333333333
hes holding the ball,60.0
and hes looking out the window to see who kicked the ball,46.15384615384615
okay a little boy is leaving for school,37.5
and his mother obviously thinks its going to rain or knows its going to rain offers him the umbrella,26.31578947368421
and he says,33.33333333333333
no mom I dont need it,57.14285714285714
see ya,50.0
Im leaving without the umbrella,66.66666666666666
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder,30.76923076923077
and he gets really really wet,16.666666666666664
so he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry,42.857142857142854
and hes hes happier at the end,44.44444444444444
okay the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree,56.25
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree,42.857142857142854
a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat,44.44444444444444
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure,38.46153846153847
and now the man is stuck in the tree aswell,40.0
and the fi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat outof the tree,38.095238095238095
okay Cinderella is a story about a little girl who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled,43.47826086956522
and she is not treated as an equal,50.0
she is treated as a real stepchild,57.14285714285714
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders outof the fire,40.0
and she grows up in that role where her her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not,55.00000000000001
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry,39.130434782608695
and the invitation comes,25.0
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball,52.94117647058824
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball,41.66666666666667
and Cinderella thinks she wont go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball,51.515151515151516
noone knows who she is,60.0
and part of that is the glass slippers,50.0
she has her glass slippers,40.0
and she gets into the pumpkin thats turned into the carriage,58.333333333333336
she rides to the ball,60.0
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight,62.5
so she goes to the ball,50.0
and she has a wonderful time,33.33333333333333
and the clock strikes twelve,20.0
and shes running outof the ballroom,42.857142857142854
and she loses a glass slipper,33.33333333333333
and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry hes going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his his true love,51.42857142857142
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live,46.15384615384615
and the two epsis two stepsisters try on the slipper,30.0
and ofcourse it does not fit,33.33333333333333
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him,35.294117647058826
but the slipper does not break,33.33333333333333
she tries on the slipper,60.0
it fits,50.0
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
and thats about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella,42.857142857142854
I would take a knife,60.0
I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly,50.0
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first,37.5
and then I would spread the jelly,42.857142857142854
and then I would fold the bread in half,44.44444444444444
in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst,37.5
and my doctor had told me that I could just do normal activities and nothing would happen,47.05882352941176
and unfortunately it did rupture,40.0
and it burst,33.33333333333333
and it was February,50.0
and it was an ice storm,50.0
and it was the middle of the night,62.5
and it was very treacherous getting there,28.57142857142857
but I we did,50.0
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic operation,55.55555555555556
and they couldnt do it that way so it was a fullon operation,57.14285714285714
and I remember it was I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time,44.44444444444444
and eventually I just got back to my own my old self,33.33333333333333
I dont remember too much about what I did to get better,46.15384615384615
I do remember though that I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk,42.857142857142854
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown,43.47826086956522
and it required crossing a very busy street,25.0
and there was no traffic light,33.33333333333333
and I remember them being able to cross very easily,30.0
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in in either direction to inch my way through,42.857142857142854
but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to to move,30.76923076923077
and now I dont even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but,42.10526315789473
yes,0.0
okay thankyou,0.0
yes my first experience was back in the late nineteen nineties,36.36363636363637
I worked with a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges,32.0
and the the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they had been,47.82608695652174
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse,50.0
so that was my first experience was was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually substituted for words that could that could not be understood,44.44444444444444
and and the the kids were great,42.857142857142854
and they were youknow they would manipulate because if they didnt know what to do they would just start to cry,50.0
and youd hafta youd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just ke I dont wanna do this,37.83783783783784
and now ofcourse fast forward to here this has been an amazing experience working with both children and and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate,37.93103448275862
and what theyre doing youknow to to make themselves better,36.36363636363637
and Im Ive taken cues from the people with whom Im working what not to do and and what to do,45.83333333333333
and and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps,20.0
so,0.0
yes Id like its something I love talking about,50.0
my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park,31.818181818181817
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year,25.0
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in in the south and then the midwest and,39.130434782608695
and eventhough we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had,45.83333333333333
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something,61.53846153846154
and we were also very sad that it was finished,50.0
but every time they build a new ball park well be going,33.33333333333333
so and and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our Christmas cards our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling,51.515151515151516
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with with the the trip itself,60.0
and the first one it said,33.33333333333333
from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home,50.0
which which was mine,100.0
but it was nice,50.0
and it in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen,55.00000000000001
we saw cities we never would have seen,50.0
and we interfaced with people that we never would have youknow communicated with because theyre very different when you leave the NewYork area,45.83333333333333
so,0.0

and hes kicking the ball in the air,55.55555555555556
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction,36.36363636363637
and the ball goes crashing through the window of a home,54.54545454545454
and theres a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window,50.0

a little boy is leaving the house,42.857142857142854
he does not want the umbrella,50.0
he says bye mom and leaves without the umbrella,33.33333333333333
and as he starts walking it starts to rain,33.33333333333333
and then it starts to rain even harder,12.5
so he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake,30.76923076923077
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet,45.45454545454545
and then he takes the umbrella and starts out again,30.0
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree,50.0
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down,52.94117647058824
so her dad takes a ladder climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat,26.666666666666668
unfortunately the ladder falls,25.0
he cant get down,60.0
theres a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really cant get down,55.55555555555556
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree,39.130434782608695
Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters,40.0
and eventhough they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family,50.0
infact her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders,47.368421052631575
and she is kept down at heel eventhough they are wealthy and snobby,46.15384615384615
and an invitation comes to a ball,42.857142857142854
and the the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going,50.0
but its quite clear that she will not be going to the ball,53.84615384615385
the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife,56.25
and Cinderellas friends from the field make her a dress,40.0
and shes all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say,28.57142857142857
youre not going,50.0
and they destroy the dress,40.0
and shes devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball,53.84615384615385
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears,16.666666666666664
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress,37.5
she turns a pumpkin into a carriage,57.14285714285714
she turns four white mice into four horses,25.0
I could sing it but I wont,62.5
I really could,66.66666666666666
and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken,58.333333333333336
and everything will turn back to the way it is,60.0
she goes to the ball,60.0
she meets the prince,50.0
she dances with the prince,60.0
theyre falling in love,60.0
and the clock strikes twelve,20.0
so she hurries out,50.0
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her,50.0
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman hes fallen in love with,52.94117647058824
so they set out to try the the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in the town the village,50.0
and eventhough the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it they eventually find that it fits Cinderella,31.57894736842105
and they live happily every after,50.0
okay,0.0
I would take I would open both jars,62.5
I would find a knife,60.0
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread,46.15384615384615
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread,42.10526315789473
and since there is only one piece of bread I would just I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich,43.47826086956522
okay I had fallen at one point,42.857142857142854
and I fractured my right wrist,33.33333333333333
and I remember that,50.0
well it was how many years ago,42.857142857142854
it was probably in nineteen ninety two or three,33.33333333333333
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream,41.66666666666667
and I was looking at the sign,57.14285714285714
and then I tripped and fell,16.666666666666664
and I was holding my keys in my right hand,50.0
and so Ive but I got a little fracture,30.0
and I hadta go to the emergency room,37.5
well I was casted for quite a while,62.5
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge I think was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own recovery,52.94117647058824
but it wasnt really a bad thing all in all,45.45454545454545
I had the cast on for awhile,57.14285714285714
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist,53.84615384615385
yes I do,33.33333333333333
I have a very dear friend cousin who is has aphasia,36.36363636363637
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and shes now seventy one,40.0
and I visit her regularly,40.0
and we communicate in a very interesting way,37.5
well I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to,38.46153846153847
and I dont give her many choices,37.5
and we do alotof hand motions,16.666666666666664
and she has a way of communicating,42.857142857142854
shes pretty amazing,25.0
she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats alot,56.25
she she likes to say she wants to go home indicating her frustration with her situation,37.5
but I can see when I speak with her that shes very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts,56.52173913043478
she has the thoughts she if she could only put the words together,53.84615384615385
and it is very very frustrating for her,50.0
but I think that shes kindof come to terms with where shes at,66.66666666666666
its hard,50.0
wow well the first thing that came into my mind because Ill Ill take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place,43.75
and the most so its a trauma event where my grandfather passed away,53.84615384615385
and he was not sick,40.0
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work,58.82352941176471
so he went off on a normal day,50.0
and I remember playing youknow with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital,56.25
and a friend of mine and I made put some cookies together and for when he was going to come home because we didnt entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with the death,52.5
so its kindof a sad story,33.33333333333333
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the o cycle of birth and death and whatnot,44.0
so it turned out he passed away that night,44.44444444444444
and I never did see him again,42.857142857142854
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship,47.05882352941176
and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life,55.55555555555556
and then looking back on it as an adult now realizing that this man was really an angel of mine,50.0
I didnt realize it then but I came to believe,36.36363636363637
and I dont know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there,48.57142857142857
came to learn about that,40.0
and it just served as a a real learning in my life in many different ways,43.75
okay well this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went outof the way and broke the window,30.76923076923077
not his intention but it was an accident,50.0
and loandbehold his dad was sitting in the living room,40.0
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad,37.5
and the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didnt see the boy because the boy ran away in fear,37.5
this is the story about a a little boy who was on his way to school,68.75
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella,23.809523809523807
but he didnt wanna take the umbrella because he didnt wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain,47.82608695652174
so he went on his way,50.0
he got caught in the rain,66.66666666666666
it started to rain very hard,16.666666666666664
he got very wet,25.0
and he came home,25.0
and he got the umbrella,40.0
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom,50.0
ERROR,0.0
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson,47.05882352941176
okay well little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park with her dad,46.666666666666664
and as they were going along they noticed that a cat was running along the field,56.25
and a dog was chasing it,50.0
and dont you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree,40.0
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so,50.0
she encouraged her dad to get the ladder because they lived right across the street,46.666666666666664
and the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree,46.15384615384615
but then he got stuck in the tree,37.5
and looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down,25.0
so Im sure someone had a cell phone in this picture eventhough its not shown,37.5
so the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat,27.27272727272727
and they all lived happily ever after,42.857142857142854
okay once upon a time there was a young girl,40.0
and she hadta go live with her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldnt take care of her anymore,42.857142857142854
so he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived,46.15384615384615
and they took the the girl in,57.14285714285714
and turned out they really didnt treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted,41.66666666666667
and she was sortof like their maid,57.14285714285714
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent alotof time among the cinders by the fireplace,47.05882352941176
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball,43.75
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball,57.14285714285714
so when they got the announcement Cinderella knew about it,50.0
but ofcourse the wicked stepmother wasnt going to let Cinderella go to the ball,26.666666666666668
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball,46.666666666666664
so the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things,43.75
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house,50.0
and then they saw how sad she was,50.0
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such,30.0
but Cinderella I guess she knew in her heart that she couldnt really go to the ball,50.0
so as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go,30.76923076923077
and they had beautiful dresses,20.0
and she hadta help mend them,33.33333333333333
and lets see what happened,20.0
she I think she went out in the garden,66.66666666666666
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad,50.0
and she was crying,50.0
and she really wanted to go to the ball,33.33333333333333
and her fairy godmother had said youknow,28.57142857142857
you may go to the ball just change,50.0
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
fetch me a pumpkin,50.0
and then turned it in to a coach,50.0
and shen,0.0
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin,45.45454545454545
and so she was able to go off to this ball,45.45454545454545
and when she got there the ball was in full swing,45.45454545454545
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the the prince,42.857142857142854
and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious they really werent gracious people,31.25
and one had a tic and a creaky knee,22.22222222222222
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just,33.33333333333333
things that they just didnt know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the prince in a proper way,45.83333333333333
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her,40.0
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince,45.45454545454545
and there was this magical thing that happened that wed like to think is love,37.5
and they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting,22.22222222222222
and suddenly the struck,25.0
and she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight,47.61904761904761
and with that she ran away,50.0
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind,33.33333333333333
she made her way home,40.0
she was alittle sad because I guess she thought shed never see this prince again,40.0
and then the prince found the slipper,28.57142857142857
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper,46.666666666666664
so he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on,52.17391304347826
and then they did come to the home of the where Cinderella lived,53.84615384615385
then they the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot,41.66666666666667
wasnt going to fit,20.0
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe,29.411764705882355
and it fits,33.33333333333333
and they get married and live happily ever after,22.22222222222222
that was not the best version of the story that Ive ever heard,57.14285714285714
well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would open up the freezer and get some glutenfree bread outof there,40.74074074074074
and I would put a paper towel on the counter,50.0
and Id put the slices of bread on the paper towel,41.66666666666667
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly,40.0
put them on the counter,60.0
and I would retrieve from the drawer a implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly,45.83333333333333
and I would then open up the peanut butter,44.44444444444444
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread,42.10526315789473
and then I would close the jar,42.857142857142854
and then I would open the jelly jar,37.5
and I would take a nice heaping,42.857142857142854
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around,46.666666666666664
and then I would put the top on the bread,50.0
Id close up the jelly and put the knife and the spoon in the sink,37.5
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater,36.36363636363637
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate,45.45454545454545
and I probably wouldnt cut it,42.857142857142854
and I would go sit down,50.0
and I would enjoy a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich,27.27272727272727
oh thats right,25.0
I injury I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant,36.36363636363637
I was going to a store to get some an ice cream,50.0
I was really hungry,50.0
I had just worked really hard that morning,37.5
and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying,61.53846153846154
if they sell cheeseburgers Im getting one,50.0
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist,46.666666666666664
and immediately a big ball popped outof my wrist,22.22222222222222
and I couldnt move my fingers,42.857142857142854
so I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast,33.33333333333333
and it was it was it was interesting mainly in my my in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything,64.0
but ofcourse I couldnt work either,28.57142857142857
but it presented a challenge,40.0
I learned how to do things lefthanded,28.57142857142857
I hadta write lefthanded,25.0
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars,21.428571428571427
and that was in I think it was in May,70.0
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in ColumbiaPresbyterian with him with the cast on,56.00000000000001
we have these pictures,50.0
and I remember he had ke a little kindof like a scrape on the back of his head or just not not a ke a bloody thing but a a kindof like a wornout spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast,51.11111111111111
I dont actually remember doing physical therapy,25.0
once I had the cast off I think I was fine,63.63636363636363
and I regained all the strength in my wrist,55.55555555555556
I think six weeks,25.0
yes it was my dominant hand,50.0

youknow my cousin Ann shes seventy one now,22.22222222222222
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six,50.0
and so shes lefthanded,40.0
and so she lost the use of her right side,40.0
her hand is all mangled and her foot also,44.44444444444444
and her communication skills are very limited,28.57142857142857
she its aphasia is what I think she has,66.66666666666666
and shes gotten progressively better over the years,44.44444444444444
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again,33.33333333333333
she useta always say,25.0
zoom zoom zoom zoom,0.0
and I always thought because she was in a car she was sitting in a her parked car when she had the stroke,60.86956521739131
and she doesnt say that anymore,42.857142857142854
but alot of the people where she lives thats her nickname Zoomzoom because she useta say that alot,47.368421052631575
but shes very challenging to communicate with,25.0
and Ill go see her and spend and hour or so,9.090909090909092
and we have lunch,25.0
and things and we try to communicate as well as best as we can with asking her simple questions,31.57894736842105
and she communicates in sortof a roundabout way,37.5
she has three children,25.0
and when she wants to talk about them she cant always get their names but shell say one two or three,31.818181818181817
and thats how we know because sometimes she brings alotof numbers in,46.15384615384615
so when she tries to tell you shes in pain shell take her good hand,37.5
and shell say,0.0
one two three four five pain,0.0
I dont know,50.0
I dont know,50.0
like that,100.0

okay I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather,50.0
because he was the one of the most important people in my life when I was a child,66.66666666666666
and I was it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten,69.23076923076923
it was in July,75.0
and it was just a normal day,42.857142857142854
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street,53.84615384615385
and it was back in the day when there was alotof freedom,50.0
you you went out the door and came in for lunch,54.54545454545454
and then you went out the door,42.857142857142854
and there really werent very many parameters,25.0
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had,30.0
and came home to find out that he had had a,45.45454545454545
he they didnt use the word stroke but thats what he had,50.0
that he hadta go to the hospital from work,55.55555555555556
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home hell have these cookies,32.0
and then the next morning I remember waking up,33.33333333333333
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like,57.14285714285714
I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that you know he wasnt coming home and just as a child an innocent child kindof coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing,41.30434782608695
having that be my first experience with death,50.0
and youknow I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who is in the nursing home,44.44444444444444
she was around because she she kindof lived with us for awhile,66.66666666666666
and it was just she actually I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard,52.94117647058824
everyone went to the all the adults went to the funeral at night,61.53846153846154
I just remembered that,50.0
and I was hysterical crying,40.0
I was so so sad,40.0
and she didnt know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me,37.5
and it worked,33.33333333333333
she wasnt being mean,60.0
but I was beyond being consoled at that point,66.66666666666666
and I I felt very alone in my grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man whos my grandfather,48.148148148148145
but anyway that that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future,57.14285714285714
and I remember a time when I was in sixth grade,54.54545454545454
and we were having a sleepover in my friends back yard,45.45454545454545
happened to be with a a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to u leukemia a the other girl who lost her grandmother,51.515151515151516
and I had lost my grandfather,50.0
and we it was like they they could make a movie about the bond,71.42857142857143
we were all in the tent,66.66666666666666
and and we were just talking,33.33333333333333
I can see us all sitting there,57.14285714285714
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life,50.0
and we put it out there,33.33333333333333
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go,36.36363636363637
and we all just just let it out,50.0
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this,43.75
and its a good thing,40.0
so thats why I think this story is is so important to me was because its something that affected my life youknow as I grew up,66.66666666666666
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didnt know about angels then,46.666666666666664
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe,44.44444444444444
and he can sortof watch over me if you will,70.0
yeah one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball kicking the ball,26.31578947368421
and inadvertently it went through the window of his his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper,50.0
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp,35.714285714285715
and he stood up and looked out the window,44.44444444444444
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window,62.5
he kindof shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing,47.05882352941176
and he was going to go speak to his son about that,50.0
okay well Johnny was on his way to school,44.44444444444444
and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said,46.15384615384615
Johnny take your umbrella,25.0
and he said,33.33333333333333
nope mom,0.0
I dont think its going to rain today so I I dont wanna take it,41.17647058823529
so off he went without his umbrella,42.857142857142854
and sure enough it started to rain,14.285714285714285
and it it started to rain harder,28.57142857142857
and he got wet,25.0
so he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said,14.285714285714285
you were right mom,50.0
I needed my umbrella,50.0
then he took his umbrella and went off,37.5
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of taking her advice next time,40.0
its always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though,41.66666666666667
okay Sally and her dad were walking around the park one day,33.33333333333333
Sally was riding her tricycle,40.0
and as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree,58.82352941176471
and her dad she urged her dad to help the cat,36.36363636363637
and so he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree,36.36363636363637
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over,50.0
and some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the fire department,50.0
and sure enough the fire department came to help retrieve the dad from the tree and the cat,27.77777777777778
and at the end of the day every one was fine,54.54545454545454
once upon a time in a land far away there was a little girl named Cinderella,37.5
and she was brought to the home of a a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her,52.17391304347826
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters,45.45454545454545
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the the mom her stepmom,52.63157894736842
and they actually put her to work,28.57142857142857
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose,45.45454545454545
but Cinderella was happy nonetheless,20.0
and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends the mice and the birds and such,38.88888888888889
and she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella,44.44444444444444
and she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride,48.148148148148145
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom,54.54545454545454
and in her heart she thought,50.0
oh I would just love to go to that ball,40.0
and she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that ofcourse she wasnt going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella,44.0
and but the stepsisters were going to go,25.0
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball,31.25
and Cinderella was sad,25.0
she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said,42.857142857142854
well help you Cinderella,25.0
and they brought out some ribbon and some some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her,44.44444444444444
and she had the dress,40.0
but she had no way of getting to the ball,50.0
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared,63.63636363636363
and it was her fairy godmother,50.0
and her ir my,50.0
dont cry my child,40.0
I know you wanna go to the ball,62.5
and and I can help you,50.0
just fetch me a pumpkin,40.0
and Ill turn it into a coach,42.857142857142854
and your mice friends will be the coachmen,50.0
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the the coachmen,41.17647058823529
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world,46.666666666666664
and when she got there she approached the ball and looked down the stairs,42.857142857142854
and there everyone was dancing,40.0
and they saw her come in,50.0
they turned and looked at her,50.0
and the prince looked,25.0
and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen,40.0
he invited her to dance,40.0
and they just had a nice connection,28.57142857142857
and she engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing,40.0
and suddenly the time had gone by,42.857142857142854
and it was midnight,50.0
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight,56.25
so quick she ran from the castle,42.857142857142854
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper,46.666666666666664
and she found her way home,33.33333333333333
and,0.0
so he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them,46.15384615384615
and everyone tried on the slipper,50.0
and when he came to the house of the where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper,46.15384615384615
and it didnt quite work,33.33333333333333
but the Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs,45.45454545454545
and the mice gave her the key,42.857142857142854
and she got out,50.0
she came down,66.66666666666666
and she said shed like to try on the slipper,40.0
and with that she tried on the slipper,62.5
and her fairy god,25.0
but as it was they she tried on the slipper,70.0
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted,70.0
and they got married,25.0
and they lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
Id like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness,50.0
yes well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of glutenfree bread from the freezer,42.30769230769231
put them on a paper towel on the counter,55.55555555555556
Id get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon,31.25
and Id open up the peanut butter,37.5
and Id scoop out some peanut butter spread it on the bread,46.15384615384615
close the jar,33.33333333333333
Id use the spoon to get the jelly outof the jar,25.0
Id put it on the other slice of bread,50.0
put the jar the lid back on the jar,44.44444444444444
Id put the peanut butter and jelly back,22.22222222222222
Id put the lid,40.0
and I probably would not cut it in half,44.44444444444444
and I would take it to a table,62.5
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich,30.0
I can remember when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing,56.25
I was swinging with a friend,66.66666666666666
and we were standing facing each other,42.857142857142854
and I hit my head,40.0
and I did have a concussion,50.0
and I remember feeling quite ill,16.666666666666664
and my mother was taking some nursing courses,37.5
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight,46.15384615384615
but I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache,42.10526315789473
and then I was fine,40.0
after a day or so,40.0
no I think just rest rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes,31.25
yes,0.0
all different people whove had,50.0
I think youknow Ive encountered people who stutter,44.44444444444444
and I will usually just try to let them finish,30.0
Im pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them,46.15384615384615
and Ive encountered people with aphasia,42.857142857142854
and Ill often do the same,16.666666666666664
unless they really look as though theyre struggling,66.66666666666666
and then occasionally Ill try to give them a cue,20.0
yeah so I would say thats the most that I can think of,57.14285714285714
and children with speech and language difficulties,14.285714285714285
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words,36.84210526315789
mhm I can remember when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas,50.0
it was a couple weeks,60.0
she had been in the hospital,83.33333333333334
and she had not been ill,50.0

and it was a really very difficult time,37.5
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry,42.857142857142854
so it was really something that I think I really remember,54.54545454545454
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father,68.75
and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve,30.76923076923077
we put everything up then,60.0
and then we would get up,50.0
so my mother did have all of us do that,60.0
but I remember thinking how sad my mom was,44.44444444444444
and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers,46.666666666666664
and my dad didnt come home until very late,30.0
and then he was there ofcourse on Christmas morning when we got up,46.15384615384615
but it was a difficult Christmas,50.0
and I do remember that very vividly,42.857142857142854
yeah mhm,0.0
one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball,35.714285714285715
and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbors window,46.15384615384615
his neighbor was sitting watching television,33.33333333333333
and the ball came through knocked over his lamp and caused quite a and caused quite a loud noise,42.10526315789473
his neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off,31.25
one cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school,37.5
he said,50.0
I will not need the umbrella,50.0
however when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard,46.666666666666664
it rained and rained,25.0
he hadta run through the puddles,50.0
and he got wet,25.0
he tried to cover his head with his hands,44.44444444444444
when he got home his mother said,42.857142857142854
look at you,66.66666666666666
youre soaking wet,50.0
and he thought about having an umbrella,42.857142857142854
h and the next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson,50.0
one day a girl was riding her bicycle,37.5
and she saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard,53.84615384615385
she looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat,44.44444444444444
she went and got her dad who brought a ladder,40.0
he started to climb the tree,33.33333333333333
and the ladder fell,25.0
so now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree,38.46153846153847
someone called the fire department,40.0
and they were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad,35.714285714285715
Cinderellas mother passed away when she was a little girl,40.0
and her father was raising her,50.0
and he met a woman that he thought would be a good wife,53.84615384615385
and she had three daughters of her own,37.5
and they got married,25.0
and they lived together,25.0
but Cinderella was not treated fairly there,14.285714285714285
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores,50.0
and the stepsisters would say,40.0
Cinderella get my lunch,25.0
Cinderalla clean the laundry,25.0
Cinderella youknow do everything,25.0
so and the stepmother was not kind to Cinderella,33.33333333333333
and one day an invitation came that all of the unmarried women in young girls in the village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince,54.83870967741935
they needed to find a suitable wife for the prince,40.0
so Cinderella heard about it,40.0
and she dreamt of going,40.0
and she was a friend to the animals,62.5
she was a kind girl,60.0
and the mice and the animals helped her,37.5
and they made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night,41.66666666666667
but when it was time to come they said that she could not go,50.0
and the wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly,25.0
they were very very mean to her,57.14285714285714
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go,33.33333333333333
and they locked her away,40.0
but the mice came and they helped her,37.5
they got the keys,50.0
and they opened the door,40.0
and allofasudden the fairy godmother was there,28.57142857142857
and she helped Cinderella,25.0
and there was a beautiful dress for her,50.0
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen,40.0
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight,56.25
so Cinderella went,0.0
and she danced,33.33333333333333
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her,52.0
but then the clock struck twelve,16.666666666666664
and out Cinderella ran outof the ball,28.57142857142857
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes,57.14285714285714
and then she turned she turned back into Cinderella,33.33333333333333
and she made it back to the to the the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters,57.14285714285714
and a few days later some of the princes men came,36.36363636363637
and they had Cinderellas shoe,20.0
and they said we can try this on,62.5
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince,40.0
and all of the stepsisters tried it on,62.5
and Cinderella I I believe she was she was locked away then too because they had noticed they knew the stepmothers m,50.0
they realized,50.0
so I think they had locked her away at that point aswell,50.0
and they helped her get out,50.0
and she tried on the shoe,50.0
and sure enough it fit,20.0
and she was able to see the prince,37.5
and they lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333

and she had promised that she would wake me up every hour,66.66666666666666

and really trying hard not to finish their words for them or their statements,28.57142857142857
and th also patients with aphasia,16.666666666666664
just really sitting and giving them additional response time,11.11111111111111
and also working with children with difficulty with language and with articulation,33.33333333333333
and mostly with them just modeling correct production for them,40.0

and the prince found it,40.0
and that was all that was left of Cinderella,66.66666666666666

and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella,54.166666666666664
so the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away,30.0
and they tried on the the glass slipper,50.0
but it didnt fit either of them,62.5
and the mice snuck the key under the door to Cinderella,45.45454545454545

it was a long haul,60.0
it was alot youknow alotof discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it,35.714285714285715
and we probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents,35.294117647058826

and we looked into all of her medical records and things,45.45454545454545

they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me,30.76923076923077
and take then I we the field was about half a mile from the school,53.333333333333336
so I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm,41.66666666666667
and and they said my arm was broken,37.5
and they put this harness on me that kindof pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight,41.17647058823529

no really you just its a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and youknow meet up when while they heal,46.15384615384615
and otherwise its just limited activity for awhile,25.0

yeah it did,33.33333333333333
yeah I go I distribute communion in the nursing home once a month,38.46153846153847
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making alotof sense and some are not so communicative,47.05882352941176
and youknow you end up youknow using my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to youknow coax them into talking to you communicating with you,36.666666666666664
and youknow you do alotof different things ke make youknow with trying to make facial expressions and trying to youknow to just kindof jar them back to the present so they can determine whether theyre even ready to take communion,26.82926829268293
but youknow thats kindof its alotof its alot more alot less verbal and alot more youknow trying to make a personal connection with them,28.000000000000004
when,100.0
Ill talk about my other daughter,33.33333333333333
when Erin was born and we it was a little postdated the energy s,50.0
and she was a little bit late so they decided she would they would induce her,62.5
and she we went to the hospital,57.14285714285714
it was all planned,75.0
it was only going to be a couple of hours,50.0
and it ended up being ofcourse like thirteen hours,33.33333333333333
but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileens parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby,46.34146341463415
and it was the first my parents first grandchild so a really exciting time,42.857142857142854
and I have three brothers,20.0
so it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl,38.88888888888889
so youknow it was the whole thing was just that being that we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done,46.666666666666664
and a little but it made it so exciting because we knew our an that the grandparents could be there,50.0
and we could be youknow it could be exciting for everybody,72.72727272727273
yes it was,66.66666666666666
so the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air,40.0
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard,30.0
and it goes through the window of the house,55.55555555555556
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over,33.33333333333333
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily,41.17647058823529
and Im sure hes on the other end running from his father,42.857142857142854
the little boy is getting ready to go to school,30.0
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and because its sposta rain,52.63157894736842
and he tells her he doesnt need it,55.55555555555556
and he walks out the door,50.0
and youknow he just barely gets away from the house,30.0
and it starts really raining hard,16.666666666666664
so he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her,33.33333333333333
you know what you were right,66.66666666666666
I needed the umbrella after all,33.33333333333333
the little girls cat climbed up the tree,37.5
it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog,54.54545454545454
and she so the cat got stuck in the tree,60.0
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out,31.57894736842105
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell,38.88888888888889
so then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father and get the barking dog away from the tree,30.76923076923077
so once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone,38.46153846153847
and the father met a a woman and decided to get married,25.0
and this woman had two daughters,16.666666666666664
and the so the they became a family,50.0
and quickly the new mother who became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters,37.5
so she they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the stepmother and the two the stepmothers two daughters,43.333333333333336
and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody,50.0
and then one day there was going to be a ball,27.27272727272727
the king was going to have a a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife,45.45454545454545
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party,57.14285714285714
and Cinderella wanted to go,0.0
but her ep her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody elses needs were taken care of first eryb her the two sisters dresses were ready and everything else,40.625
so Cinderella got it all ready,16.666666666666664
and in the meantime her the mice sewed a a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear,43.75
so after she got all of everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself,47.05882352941176
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs,46.666666666666664
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her,54.54545454545454
so she thought she wouldnt be able to go to the ball,46.15384615384615
and then she met her she ran out into the back garden of the castle,53.333333333333336
and she met her fairy godmother,33.33333333333333
and the fairy godmother told her that youre going to go to the ball,46.666666666666664
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach,50.0
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown,28.57142857142857
and she put the she turned the mice into the horses,54.54545454545454
and she went off to the ball,57.14285714285714
and the but there was one stipulation is that she hadta be home she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was,50.0
so she went to the ball,50.0
and she met the prince,40.0
and they fell in love,40.0
and then the allofasudden she heard the clock strike twelve,30.0
and she immediately tried ran outof the ball hadta get outof there before she turned back into Cinderella,27.77777777777778
and she lost her shoe on the step of the of the palace,61.53846153846154
but there was nothing she could do,57.14285714285714
she just kept running,25.0
and the next day the kings minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe,46.42857142857143
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldnt fit into it,59.09090909090909
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe,42.857142857142854
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after,30.0
I would put the bread down,66.66666666666666
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread,46.15384615384615
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter,46.15384615384615
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it,41.66666666666667
the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast my right breast,61.904761904761905
and our son Joseph had just been born a year ago a year before the the diagnosis or the concern anyway,42.857142857142854
and so I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him,47.82608695652174
but there was surgery required,20.0
and there was a waiting period,33.33333333333333
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on not on me sothat I could get back to taking care of him,50.0
as it turned out everything was fine,71.42857142857143
the lump was removed,50.0
it was benign,66.66666666666666
and everything was alright,50.0
so but it was a scare for awhile,50.0
and important that I kept the priorities that I thought was were important,53.84615384615385
there was very little recovery,20.0
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasnt too sure whether they had removed the breast or not when I first woke up from the anesthesia,46.42857142857143
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright,47.82608695652174
and I was so busy,40.0
I dont recall anything special otherthan a dressing and keeping up with whatever medications whatever they told me to do,47.61904761904761
but I nothing was was bothering me after it was over,72.72727272727273
yeah,0.0
mhm,0.0
I useta teach English as a second language,37.5
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation exercises that we did,44.44444444444444
I always tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew,38.46153846153847
but yeah theres difficulty when someone is not fluent in in your language,42.857142857142854
sometimes with elderly,33.33333333333333
I took care of my mom and my dad as they were really in advanced years,50.0
nineties,0.0
and sometimes my father would go back to Italian,33.33333333333333
it was a place of comfort I think especially as he was maybe dying,57.14285714285714
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow,20.0
all I al but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking,40.909090909090914
but it was memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another,53.333333333333336
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too,16.666666666666664
but I was very interested in where he was going with with the Italian at the end,64.70588235294117
with my mom she was more more grounded,50.0
sometime it was hearing it was her hearing problem,55.55555555555556
was alotof shouting going on,40.0
so its sometimes for me its that,71.42857142857143
its like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive,16.666666666666664
yeah,0.0
youre welcome,33.33333333333333
oh Ive had so many happy things,25.0
oh whats happy,25.0
Im sure the happiest day was the day Joseph was born,41.66666666666667
we were in EastOrangeGeneral hospital,60.0
I had a wonderful doctor,40.0
my husband Joe who had alittle too much background in language problems that can occur with babies and children made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food,41.02564102564102
whatever the heck his he worried about my doctor removed from the diet,61.53846153846154
so when it was time for Joseph to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural,36.84210526315789
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes,28.57142857142857
so when the day come came I for Josephs birth I was one lesson short of the full of the full course I guess of childbirth preparation,44.44444444444444
so I was going fine without any medication,50.0
it was just taking awhile,40.0
and then I said to them,50.0
this is all I know,80.0
I dont know any more,50.0
so they were laughing,50.0
and they said,33.33333333333333
well take over,33.33333333333333
and they just pushed my head from the pillow and said,36.36363636363637
lets line up the mirror correctly,33.33333333333333
everything was going fine,50.0
still no medications,33.33333333333333
everything was going fine,50.0
DoctorSobol my doctor said,25.0

I was on a high,80.0
I can Ive never been on such a high,80.0
but it was it was such a happy day,66.66666666666666
and everything was fine,50.0
it was the way Joe had hoped without any interference,60.0
he got a really nice Apgar score,28.57142857142857
yes he was a ten right off the bat,55.55555555555556
so I said,33.33333333333333
well did my job,25.0
now comes the scary part,20.0
raise the kid,33.33333333333333
so happiest day,0.0

once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball,31.25
and not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair,37.5
and shocked outof his ennui he looks out the window and with ball in hand has judged correctly that hes going to hafta go outside and speak to little Ned,35.483870967741936
well I think this is my daughter inlaw Tanya,44.44444444444444
and this is Nick,50.0
and Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him to school that day,47.368421052631575
and as hes waving goodbye he is reassuring my daughter inlaw that he surely doesnt need an umbrella independent little soul that he is,50.0
within the first block on the way to school he it begins to rain,50.0
as hes sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he understands what his mom was trying to say after all,36.36363636363637
a bit reluctantly he has returned home and just hasta stand there sopping wet while my daughter inlaw tries very hard not to say,20.833333333333336
I told you so,50.0
but he he happily accepts an umbrella and returns to school in the opposite direction it looks like,44.44444444444444
returns to school,33.33333333333333
umbrella,0.0
and dry,0.0
and happy,0.0

well this is little Mary little MaryBoyle who has noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree,47.368421052631575
and and has called the only person she knows who can rescue Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household,47.82608695652174
and that is her dad,60.0
he has gone to help her climbs the tree,44.44444444444444
but the ladder has gotten away from him,50.0
is falling,50.0
as if things arent noisy enough the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark,38.88888888888889
and so now the neighbors I guess have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue in this order dad Fluffernutter,34.48275862068966
and theyre not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because hes the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with,44.827586206896555
there you go,33.33333333333333
youre welcome,33.33333333333333
there was a a widower with a daughter whose name was Cinderella who had remarried a a mean woman,57.89473684210527
he didnt know that at the time but thats what marriage reveals over time,50.0
she had two two daughters,20.0
and so his stepdaughters were part of the household that Cinderella and her father had enjoyed,43.75
but things changed once they all arrived together,37.5
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude,50.0
the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way,50.0
she performed servile tasks,25.0
at one point an invitation comes to a ball,44.44444444444444
and theyre considering happily going,33.33333333333333
Cinderellas face is lighting up,40.0
but she doesnt realize whats going on,55.55555555555556
the ball was held because the the King decided that his son it was time for the son to marry,55.00000000000001
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town,52.94117647058824
well Cinderella would love to go,16.666666666666664
and it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and the stepmother and the and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves,48.38709677419355
so they prepared had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy,40.0
but she was there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family,52.94117647058824
well theres a book in the picture and the picture book I dont remember at all,38.88888888888889
she discovers a book,50.0
I dont know if thats where she comes across an incantation,61.53846153846154
but a fairy godmother appears,20.0
and because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her,29.629629629629626
fairy godmother helps her,25.0
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too,30.0
and as as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball Im going to just remember that she dances with the handsome prince,53.84615384615385
and at as she runs back tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair,38.88888888888889
I didnt see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though,50.0
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight,10.0
but she hadta get outof there by midnight,25.0
and she does,33.33333333333333
but then theres the there is the return of the slipper the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night,60.0
but as I said the book seems a little bit different,36.36363636363637
theres a key,50.0
and I guess when she lets everyone in finally,55.55555555555556
where is he,100.0
why is the key there,60.0
I dont remember that part,50.0
but as I just remember the story ends happily,33.33333333333333
that he does find her and the slipper,62.5
and theyre reunited,50.0
and so happily ever after,20.0
uhhuh,0.0
well I would keep all my ingredients at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly,52.94117647058824
lay the bread down,50.0
get a nice butter knife,20.0
and I begin with spreading a a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the the well around all four sides sothat when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesnt actually go over the side,50.0
it just stays within the the borders,57.14285714285714
I useta like mine folded over,66.66666666666666
I think I I like it just the one slice,50.0
so it just looks really kindof beautiful with a little wall a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle,40.0
okay,0.0
youre welcome,33.33333333333333
the the most the most memorable event was,50.0
it but I think I did tell you about it,70.0
the the yeah,66.66666666666666
it was about the the possible scare,71.42857142857143
it was just a lump in in my breast,66.66666666666666
and that Im Im pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of of our son to think about,57.14285714285714
and I didnt think because of my age or the the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything more than precaution to do the the procedure,56.25
but as close as I came was youknow the the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and and caring,33.33333333333333
and I I felt supported the whole the whole time,50.0
just that I I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasnt sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so the dressings and bandage were so tight,54.054054054054056
but I just remember thinking the the theyll be Ill do whatever I hafta do on it,55.55555555555556
and whatevers next Ill find out about and take care of,27.27272727272727
so its a moving progression,40.0
I dont usually write the end of a story if its something like that,66.66666666666666
if you tell me Ill say,50.0
oh well go through it step by step,37.5
and well get there,0.0
it was like that,100.0
so Im fortunate that it hasnt been anything worse than that,61.53846153846154
just I can only remember being busy because with with a toddler,58.333333333333336
he was a year old then,50.0
and and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another,27.77777777777778
it was nothing short of show up for a doctors appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done,47.61904761904761
so I didnt think about,50.0
I knew I had it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright,62.5
so it wasnt much to do except youknow just take care of of the healing part and cooperate,31.57894736842105
but I was sure everything was going to be alright,50.0
something important,50.0
well I think I think oddly enough of of meeting and and continuing a a life with Joe,38.88888888888889
it was Im sure the most important thing that ever happened,41.66666666666667
the most memorable day was the day our son was born,45.45454545454545
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how how interesting that all was,50.0
we were students at MontclairState,60.0
and in those days freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus,27.27272727272727
we hadta sing the the almamater,50.0
but the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at at LifeHall,46.15384615384615
and he noticed the sign and said something about,44.44444444444444
I think I had part of it was covered,55.55555555555556
and he said,33.33333333333333
are you a a speech major,66.66666666666666
I said,50.0
no English,50.0
and I I unveiled the the words English,50.0
but he was a senior,60.0
and I was a freshman,60.0
and so I got to meet one of the youknow the upperclassmen got his signature,33.33333333333333
and then later we just had it was an easy conversation,36.36363636363637
we just we talked alittle,40.0
he he continued when I whenever I saw him to say hi,58.333333333333336
and I people would tell me,50.0
hes a BMOC,50.0
youknow hes a he was a a vice president of student government,53.84615384615385
and I said,33.33333333333333
ohmygoodness,0.0
but the more we hadta talk about,42.857142857142854
I was a student leader in my high school,55.55555555555556
and I thought when he when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee,52.63157894736842
but it turned out that he we he was interested,70.0
so our first date I think was the,50.0
it was something like the KingstonTrio or something like that,80.0
some folk group,33.33333333333333
it was really nice,50.0
they were on campus,75.0
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come,33.33333333333333
that was one of his duties,66.66666666666666
but when I just think of how all that unfolded just,54.54545454545454
I knew I I was gonna finish school,44.44444444444444
and so we we paced ourselves I guess youknow to to be logical about things,40.0
get to know each other no surprises along the way,40.0
because you have time with a person and you you see them in all the seasons and all,61.111111111111114
but I think when it finally came to to getting married I dont think there was a formal,47.368421052631575
we we people ask us but this was not even a formal proposal,46.15384615384615
I think everyone around us assumed we would marry,66.66666666666666
so we did,33.33333333333333
and so I I wasnt engaged,42.857142857142854
youknow I we I was pinned,66.66666666666666
and someone said to me the next day,50.0
youknow youre youre engaged to be engaged,44.44444444444444
I said,50.0
no Im not,25.0
and they said,33.33333333333333
well thats what that means,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
oh I thought it meant sortof going steady college style,20.0
they said,50.0
no youre engaged to be engaged,42.857142857142854
I said,50.0
well we have some time to go before,25.0
I said,50.0
it means what it means to the individual couple too,50.0
so I tried to assert myself,33.33333333333333
but I guess they might have been right,62.5
but I dont I dont care,37.5
it didnt mean anything,60.0
but that it when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross Imean thats thats probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married,38.88888888888889
and all that happened at once,50.0
it all converged,66.66666666666666
its alright that weve done this before,75.0
okay same story,0.0
now was it little Ned,40.0
no this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself,46.15384615384615
and the trajectory is off,60.0
it goes right through a window,50.0
and we hear the crash,40.0
and the lamp has gone over,50.0
and and Im assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody whos startled that this intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture,50.0
and he says,33.33333333333333
I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard,41.66666666666667
okay,0.0
its still raining,33.33333333333333
okay in the first picture its about to rain,44.44444444444444
mom is telling little sweetie,20.0
take your umbrella with you because I think its going to rain today,46.15384615384615
and the little little Sammy this time says,25.0
no no no no no I dont need it Im a big kid,33.33333333333333
and as he says goodbye his mom is just offering it one more time,35.714285714285715
he says,50.0
solong,0.0
see you later,33.33333333333333
but as he steps out the door wouldnt you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall,42.857142857142854
and as hes getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says,33.33333333333333
oh drat,0.0
and when he back gets back home and looks at mom I think shes restraining the,41.17647058823529
I told you,66.66666666666666
and hes looking a bit sheepish little Sammy,33.33333333333333
but hes out in in the last frame,44.44444444444444
but hes still going in the opposite direction here,40.0
okay,0.0
were in a time warp youknow,50.0
you guys have not moved forward from last last week,30.0
okay,0.0
groundhog day,0.0
no this is cat up in a tree day,55.55555555555556
ohmygoodness mygoodness,0.0
this is little sweet Sue,40.0
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree,44.44444444444444
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb,45.45454545454545
the ladder that he must have taken to to get to to the cat has fallen,62.5
so hes stranded,50.0
and little Fido is barking and saying,14.285714285714285
what the heck are you doing up there,50.0
but thankfully the the firemen are on their way,55.55555555555556
kindly neighbors must have called and said,28.57142857142857
help help help,0.0
and so theyre rushing along with the ladder,55.55555555555556
they will rescue him shortly,60.0
and I think theyll get dad down before they get the cat down,50.0
I think thats the priority,50.0
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world,50.0
its all going to work out just fine,37.5
alright I think last time it was a combination aswell,40.0
what once upon a time there was a a family where the there was a widow,62.5
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to a woman he had met,57.14285714285714
but the woman had two daughters of her own,33.33333333333333
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after the woman and her daughter the became the stepmother and the stepsisters and joined the the household of Cinderella and her dad,42.42424242424242
Im assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again,61.111111111111114
and she must deal with the family her new family,50.0
and theyre not very kind,16.666666666666664
theres theyre mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother,45.45454545454545
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of Cinderella at every option,38.46153846153847
and so she did the rv chores and she was treated badly,33.33333333333333
simultaneously there is another father and a and a b and a offspring a prince this time,41.17647058823529
and the father is a king,50.0
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son,45.45454545454545
and I assume that its time for him to be married,54.54545454545454
and so the prince a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful maidens who are available,46.42857142857143
an invitation goes out to Cinderellas stepmother to the household,50.0
and everyone is smiling,50.0
and Cinderella I guess assumes that she might be able to go,41.66666666666667
but this is not going to happen,28.57142857142857
this the the book,75.0
and I dont know whats going on with that little book yet,50.0
but she I maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house,50.0
the little animals or begin to help out,25.0
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready,41.935483870967744
and Cinderella now knows that with the help of her godmother she will get to go,43.75
there is a little admonition from after shes dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably,51.85185185185185
be sure youre home by midnight,42.857142857142854
and then it switches to the to the ball,55.55555555555556
and I and the prince sees and falls in love with at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty,44.44444444444444
when he could see all that,83.33333333333334
so they dance and dance,20.0
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase,41.66666666666667
I guess the the the right hand man the the first secretary first VP of the king is running after her to say,47.82608695652174
wait a second,33.33333333333333
wait a second,33.33333333333333
but she runs back to the to to home,44.44444444444444
and then comes the search for who matches the slipper,40.0
and its he in your little booklet the first vice president then who comes to the door,47.05882352941176
and theres a funny little picture of somebody tripping and a cushion,38.46153846153847
but I dont remember any of that from my stories or my film memory,53.333333333333336
but apparently there the key there was a key there that still doesnt mean anything much to me,42.10526315789473
they must have let him in,83.33333333333334
the the match is made when she tries on the slipper,63.63636363636363
and so I I suppose the the fella,50.0
xxx weve got our girl,50.0
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot,54.54545454545454
and I dont know why I thought it was direct,54.54545454545454
but he could afford to hire help to do that so so the help took care of it,33.33333333333333
anyway its a happy ending,40.0
they they get back together again,33.33333333333333
and Im sure its the prince and his sweet Cinderella and p life is happy from then on happily ever after,31.818181818181817

was diagnosed I guess about three months after I retired,40.0
I spent several months in chemotherapy,33.33333333333333
but i prior to that before the chemotherapy started I had an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks,48.0
that was was a StevensJohnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no no burning to my skin,66.66666666666666
it was all a result of the allergic reaction,66.66666666666666
and that stopped the chemo,40.0
I had one round of chemo,33.33333333333333
and then the allergic reaction took place to the dica not the chemo medication but to a medication thats designed to protect kidney function,32.0
so I was in the hospital for three weeks,55.55555555555556
that resolved,50.0
I started chemo again,25.0

that I do know the day of the week in December December ninth,53.84615384615385
and it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that that we found out that we were pregnant that my wife was pregnant,61.29032258064516
hes our only child,40.0
so his his the announcement of the fact that he was that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess are happy memories prompted by as I said today because of of the of SaintJosephs day,58.97435897435898
about the about SaintJosephs day,60.0
its a its a feast day in in the in the RomanCatholic calendar that comes just after SaintPatricks day which I think overshadows overshadows it,56.00000000000001
and its as the Irish celebrate SaintPatricks I think SaintJosephs day is mostly celebrated by the ItalianAmericans and by Italians,40.0
and theres a special pastry that is consumed,44.44444444444444

but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didnt allow fathers in the waiting,47.05882352941176

pun intended,0.0
when push came to shove I couldnt go into the waiting,41.66666666666667

Cinderella is a young girl who whose mother died,44.44444444444444
and shes brought by her father to live with I I think a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderellas age,52.0
father meant well,0.0
but the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully,35.294117647058826
she became their maid essentially and hadta clean the house take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella do the cooking do the washing while they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to to please themselves,32.5
one day the prince,25.0
they they lived in a in a principality,75.0
the prince whose father wanted him to marry was asked to or was told that there would be a ball held at which many of the or all of the single women in the principality would would be invited,58.97435897435898
and the idea would be that he would the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife,60.0
the three Cinderellas three stepsisters prepare for the ball,33.33333333333333
the mother their mothers very excited,33.33333333333333
and ofcourse Cinderella is excluded,20.0
she cannot go to the ball,57.14285714285714
and so shes left at home alone while the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball,42.10526315789473
shes visited by her fairy godmother who grants her her wish of attending the ball,56.25
because Cinderella says,33.33333333333333
how am I gonna get there,42.857142857142854
what am I gonna wear,50.0
so the h fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her outof magic takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach,30.434782608695656
mice become the horses,25.0
I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too,40.0
I forget which animal becomes the coachman,42.857142857142854
they take her to the ball,66.66666666666666
shes not really recognized by her stepsisters and and the stepmother,41.66666666666667
but they the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight,57.14285714285714
otherwise or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was,58.333333333333336
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera,37.5
so she promises to return at midnight,28.57142857142857
but shes having so much fun that shes still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight,45.0
so she panics,33.33333333333333
rightly so,0.0
runs gets back in the coach and is taken home,30.0
but one of her slippers glass slippers that was part of what the fairy godmother made for her is left behind,52.38095238095239
and the prince at at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and wanted to to know who she was,47.368421052631575
because she was going to be the one,62.5
and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind,40.0
so he has all of the young ladies in the nici in the principality try the slipper on,61.111111111111114
it their its brought to each of their houses,77.77777777777779
and the ofcourse the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for the one who was at the ball,61.53846153846154
and sure enough it is Cinderellas foot that fits the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and but to her great delight,34.48275862068966
and the prince marries her,40.0
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
well I would take two pieces of bread,37.5
on one of them I would take a knife and spread the peanut butter,50.0
and on the other piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together,46.666666666666664
and Id have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,20.0
yeah well the big one is my cancer Hodgkins disease,30.0
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven,36.36363636363637
I had symptoms before then but didnt connect the dots,27.27272727272727
I had night sweats,25.0
I was tired and h just didnt think much of it,50.0
but then I noticed that I was losing weight,44.44444444444444
and thats what caused me to seek a doctor,40.0
so I went to,50.0
I hadnt been to a doctor in years,66.66666666666666
so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses,46.15384615384615
shes now both our physician for both of us,60.0
she did an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something the lymph nodes turned out,44.44444444444444
so I went for a sonogram,50.0
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan,37.5
that led to the need for a biopsy,62.5
so at that by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong,57.14285714285714
the decision was gonna be is it,62.5
it it was lymphoma,75.0
but is it gonna be Hodgkins lymphoma or NonHodgkins lymphoma,27.27272727272727
so I went to Mountainside hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasnt enough not enough tissue was obtained,36.36363636363637
so I hadta go into the city into NewYork to Sloan for a more complete biopsy,43.75
and that clinched it,50.0
it was Hodgkins lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two,58.82352941176471
Hodgkinss is much more treatable at a higher success rate,30.0
so I started chemo,25.0
and after the first session I developed a rash,44.44444444444444
and we werent quite sure what was going on,50.0
one of the nurses,50.0
the the oncologist wasnt sure,50.0
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment h for the for the Hodgkins,53.333333333333336
but one of his nurses said,33.33333333333333
this is an allergic reaction,60.0
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol,50.0
I think I mentioned this last time,42.857142857142854
which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney,27.27272727272727
its actually a drug for gout,50.0
but it has a protective effect for kidney function,33.33333333333333
that landed me in the hospital with with whats called StevensJohnson syndrome which is treated like a burn,63.1578947368421
it s people with StevensJohnson are often sent to burn units,27.27272727272727
my mouth was inflamed,50.0
I I it was just awful,66.66666666666666
I couldnt drink water,40.0
it it burned,66.66666666666666
that ofcourse suspended chemo,25.0
I we worked through the StevensJohnson,66.66666666666666
I was looking forward to chemo,50.0
it was it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation,60.0
so and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather,46.666666666666664
but still I I couldnt take solid food for for two weeks or so nor water,29.411764705882355
it was it was the only thing that really worked was was iced tea,57.14285714285714
so I got through the StevensJohnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months,31.25
it ended last May,25.0
had my Pet scan at that time which was clear,50.0
oncologist waited another six months,20.0
had another Pet scan,25.0
that was clear,66.66666666666666
and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed,42.857142857142854
I dont know if you know about ports,55.55555555555556
so that sorta that sorta clinched the the idea that Im youknow home free,46.666666666666664
youknow I hafta be monitored every six months,37.5
and chemo wasnt it wasnt all that bad,30.0
Imean Firstname got me through it if as I said last week,50.0
I broke down,66.66666666666666
she was just super in getting me through all of this,72.72727272727273
and the chemo wasnt bad,33.33333333333333
I I really wasnt nauseous,50.0
my appetite started to come back,16.666666666666664
infact we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo,61.53846153846154
wed send out for lunch,50.0
so the it was it was tired,71.42857142857143
Id I would get tired,50.0
but I had chemo every two weeks,42.857142857142854
and my hair came back,20.0
and thats where I am now,57.14285714285714
not all that much,25.0
Im a Im a very bad eater when it comes to nutrition,50.0
fish,0.0
but it it it wasnt all that much to do,36.36363636363637
the the chemo was the the primary source of of treatment ofcourse,58.333333333333336
the oncologist was very responsive,40.0
and he youknow he he gave me antinausea medication,44.44444444444444
but I didnt I took it once during the whole treatment time,38.46153846153847
and and even then it wasnt because I was starting to to vomit,35.714285714285715
I just felt a bit queasy,33.33333333333333
alotof rest,0.0
I slept alot and had tender loving care from Firstname,20.0
so it I didnt do alot different youknow,33.33333333333333
so I I really cant go beyond that,55.55555555555556
it was the chemotherapy and the rest,57.14285714285714
youknow that was pretty much it,50.0
well I guess one of the most important things,33.33333333333333
I think I think last week I mentioned my sons birth so I I wont go through that again,45.0
another milestone was was getting a job at MontclairState,55.55555555555556
I I had I was a speech clinician doing work as a as a a speech language pathologist,55.55555555555556
but I missed interacting with students,33.33333333333333
I had and and and I I had some experience in doing that because I my undergraduate degree was in history,52.38095238095239
and I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that,38.88888888888889
but then things things sortof changed obviously,0.0
but I I I missed that kind of interaction,55.55555555555556
I worked mostly with children when I was a speech clinician,54.54545454545454
and r Firstname was teaching English at the highschool level,30.0
and she would come back home with stories about youknow working with students and discussions they had in class,36.84210526315789
and I was sorta jealous of that,57.14285714285714
and so when I was invited to to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance,41.17647058823529
that that changed everything,75.0
and I was warned that from from friends colleagues that I was taking a big risk in in doing this because I wasnt going to get tenure,53.57142857142857
that they were h I was gonna be taken advantage of,58.333333333333336
I dont know where they got the idea,55.55555555555556
but that I would youknow I I would work for xl number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldnt get tenure,50.0
but I wanted to be in the classroom so much,40.0
and it was more that than doing research actually,44.44444444444444
it was actually teaching that drew me to it,66.66666666666666
that I said,66.66666666666666
the heck with it,75.0
youknow Im gonna do it,42.857142857142854
and so I I did,40.0
and it it changed everything,60.0
and that was a very very positive event youknow,33.33333333333333
and I spent forty five years after that being here,40.0
yeah,0.0
so yeah,0.0
yeah,0.0
well no lucky for you,40.0

and thats where it ends,50.0
so we dont know if hes gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what,52.17391304347826
but hes just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened,41.66666666666667
this is a story about not listening to your mom especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella,42.10526315789473
mother is suggesting that he he do that,62.5

hes not very happy,20.0
hes soaking wet,50.0
mother is looking at him almost saying,42.857142857142854

and being of no help the dog is barking making a racket,50.0
and someone evidently called the fire department,28.57142857142857
and there are two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder,50.0
and theyre going to try to get him down,40.0
his ladder fathers ladder is on the ground I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him,52.63157894736842
so the fire fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope,33.33333333333333
story of a young girl whose,50.0
I guess shes a teenager,50.0
whose mother dies and father remarries,16.666666666666664
and shes introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters,50.0
and they immediately take advantage of Cinderella,28.57142857142857
she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and hasta attend to their needs and the needs of the household,42.10526315789473
and evidently father was of no help in mediating any of this,58.333333333333336
so the girl ends up being in a household but but being rather a member of the household being a a servant as I said,56.00000000000001
one day a ball is announced,33.33333333333333
she she lives in I guess a principality headed by youknow royalty,50.0
and one day a ball is announced,28.57142857142857
if I recall correctly its because the prince is in need of finding a wife,60.0
his father tells him that its time for him to marry,54.54545454545454
so a ball is organized,40.0
and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend,42.857142857142854
and the three stepsisters and and their h their mother go plan to go,21.428571428571427
and they get their gowns ready,33.33333333333333
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too,37.5
but it turns out that shes not gonna be allowed to go,42.857142857142854
she ofcourse is very sad about that,57.14285714285714
enter her fairy godmother,25.0
they they go off to the ball the the the the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball,63.1578947368421
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella,30.0
youre gonna go too,33.33333333333333
and were gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen,42.10526315789473
and I guess the mice too become horses,25.0

the coach will become the pumpkin,50.0
the coachmen will become the mice,50.0
shell lose her beautiful clothing,20.0
so she goes to the ball promises to to leave by twelve,33.33333333333333
but shes having a great time,42.857142857142854
and the prince is very much drawn to her,44.44444444444444
and shes still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time and gets gets back home in time,36.36363636363637
but as shes running out one of her slipper slippers comes off,53.84615384615385
and the prince picks it up,50.0
and it turns out that shes the one that he wants,58.333333333333336
and he figures hell be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into the into the glass slipper,51.724137931034484
so a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper,43.58974358974359
and the the the stepsisters ofcourse try,42.857142857142854
and they dont fit,40.0
and they try to push their feet into that slipper,40.0
and it doesnt work,40.0

he dances with her,75.0
and they immediately fall in love,33.33333333333333

and she runs from the palace,50.0
and in doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes,41.66666666666667

and but he decides hes going to go to every house to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on,48.148148148148145
and that will be the way he will identify this girl,63.63636363636363
and so he eventually arrives at the stepmothers house,33.33333333333333
and ofcourse the three girls run right over because they they know that theyre gonna one that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly,44.827586206896555
and ofcourse none of them do because their feet are too big,41.66666666666667
and they the stepmother figures out that the the shoe belongs to Cinderella,53.84615384615385
and she tries to hide Cinderella,16.666666666666664
but the I think it was the fairy godmother who who comes along and rescues Cinderella,43.75

and I usually went right off youknow,28.57142857142857
and so a couple of times and I dont land on my feet,42.857142857142854
so I sorta landed on my lower back and so thats caused me problems,40.0
and I didnt go back after that,50.0
but it was really nice while I did it,55.55555555555556
little bit of almost jumping,20.0
the best part was riding the jump trail in RockcreekPark which is a a horse trail that theyve let the little little usually trees fall across,48.148148148148145
and its rough,33.33333333333333
and if you take and my horse because he didnt like his neighbor horses,46.666666666666664
we were always at the end of the line,66.66666666666666
thats not a good place to be when other horses are moving along,35.714285714285715
because horses being herd creatures they wanna catch up,44.44444444444444
and stay with their good buddies,33.33333333333333
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles,50.0
and Im in the back of the line,55.55555555555556
and hes running to catch up,42.857142857142854
and its alittle more exciting being at the end of the line,50.0
but it was really it was really good,50.0
but now I do helicopters and its better,25.0
I presume you needed a special one for that is that right,58.333333333333336
extremely well,0.0
a little bit of French and a little bit of Spanish and some Yiddish,35.714285714285715

it it meant I had a six month old daughter,40.0
and I was paralyzed,50.0
so I did hafta hire someone to help me,44.44444444444444
but I knew that very often people do die from that,45.45454545454545
but I live by,50.0
anything is possible,66.66666666666666
and and it works for me,50.0
it did take several years,40.0
and I did hafta have rehab which was not very effective so many years ago,26.666666666666668
and I I guess I must have had a residual from that because I was doing reasonably well,61.111111111111114
as a matter of fact I I was leading groups as we traveled and organizing trips and so on for MontgomeryCounty,42.857142857142854

I was eight years old,40.0
and we were extremely poor,40.0
and we were dispossessed from our apartment,57.14285714285714
and it was ice on the ground,57.14285714285714
and at that time when that happened I made up my mind that I will never be poor again,57.89473684210527
and that I will not rely on a man,55.55555555555556
that I can make it on my own,75.0
and I certainly have,25.0

and shes really abused in every way,50.0
they take tremendous advantage of her,50.0
shes the cleanup person she wears rags and all that sort of thing,42.857142857142854
anyway they hear that theres a great ball coming up,45.45454545454545
and the two daughters and the mother are going to the ball,41.66666666666667
and ofcourse theyre gonna leave Cinderella home,22.22222222222222
they want Cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on,26.666666666666668
and so she does,25.0
and she thinks about the ball,50.0
and shes really very very sad,14.285714285714285
and she makes a wish,40.0
and the wish is that she can go to the ball,63.63636363636363
when a fairy godmother appears and tells her,37.5
yes you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight,57.14285714285714
and she says,33.33333333333333
okay I will,66.66666666666666
and the fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well,25.0
and she gets into this big pumpkin,42.857142857142854
what can I call it,80.0
anyway its its something that carries her to the ball,70.0
and when she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her,42.857142857142854
and she hears the midnight stroke,33.33333333333333
and she gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise,42.857142857142854
so she goes running down the steps,42.857142857142854
and she loses her shoe,40.0
and she gets home okay,20.0
the prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit,38.46153846153847
and it doesnt seem to fit anyone,37.5
and the the ugly the mean mother has him try on the the shoes on the two ugly daughters,47.368421052631575
and finally Cinderella comes down,0.0
and although the mother doesnt want him to he tries on the shoe,57.14285714285714
and it fits her,50.0
and I believe he he then wants to marry her,40.0
I would try and get good bread like whole wheat bread or something like that,40.0
and Id first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick,28.57142857142857
and then get raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on,14.285714285714285
and put the second slice on top of it,44.44444444444444
and then cut it in quarters for a young child,40.0

oh I think Im a very good English speaker,30.0
everybody tells me Im very articulate,42.857142857142854
just like a smattering of Spanish just really a few words,36.36363636363637

well I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from NewMexico to the east coast,52.17391304347826
it was such an immense change culturally,57.14285714285714
and we also we lived in a very rural area in NewMexico up in the mountains,50.0
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all,47.61904761904761
so when we came here it was absolutely shocking,44.44444444444444
Imean just the fact that they had sidewalks alone,44.44444444444444
they just amazed us,50.0
and the street lamps and everything,33.33333333333333
I think one thing thats different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money,37.93103448275862
its so much richer,25.0
and they can afford to do all of that youknow,50.0
we had alotof unpaved roads out there,14.285714285714285
ofcourse theres the theres alot sparser population,33.33333333333333
so alotof times theyre not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place,29.411764705882355
but here it was just amazing to us all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city,40.909090909090914
it was just indescribable the impact that it had on us,63.63636363636363
I think it took us years to really kindof overcome the culture shock,38.46153846153847
so I Imean I remember that period of my life all the time,53.84615384615385
what just the immense change that we underwent,50.0
in fact we had Spanish accents,33.33333333333333
very heavy,0.0
my parents always did their whole lives,28.57142857142857
but we had such a terrible time at school people teasing us and everything,42.857142857142854
and we really tried hard to emulate English speakers especially,10.0
I used to listen to DavidNiven for some reason,44.44444444444444
I was really crazy about him,66.66666666666666
and I wanted to sound like him,42.857142857142854
so youknow and it really was a it really it had a huge impact on us each in their own way,52.38095238095239

and sure enough it went through the his neighbors window,40.0
his neighbor was watching television,40.0
and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window knocks over his lamp,42.857142857142854

shed been listening to the weather channel,42.857142857142854
she told him to take his umbrella,42.857142857142854
no hes positive that theres not gonna be any problem,46.15384615384615
also he doesnt wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella,50.0
and he says goodbye to his mother,42.857142857142854
and hell be fine,25.0
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain,25.0
so he runs back,25.0
his mothers quite annoyed with him because shed argued with him,54.54545454545454
and he said it was not gonna rain,33.33333333333333
he feels bad,33.33333333333333

okay,0.0
Susan was out playing with her dog,57.14285714285714
and the dog chased a a cat up into the tree,54.54545454545454
and oh I guess it was actually her cat,44.44444444444444
so she became quite upset about it,42.857142857142854
and her neighbor came out and said,28.57142857142857
well thats okay,25.0
dont worry about it,60.0
I have a ladder,50.0
and Ill get up there and get your cat,11.11111111111111
so he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb,53.333333333333336
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground,36.36363636363637
and then he couldnt get down,42.857142857142854
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree,50.0
so somebody hadta call the fire department,28.57142857142857
and they came out and rescued the both of them,60.0
oh yeah,0.0
yeah,0.0
I dont remember these animals,50.0

Cinderella lived with her father and her mother in this little village,41.66666666666667
when she was very young her mother passed away,55.55555555555556
it was just her and her father,57.14285714285714
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry,50.0
he met somebody there in their village,57.14285714285714
and he remarried,33.33333333333333
and then sadly he passed away very shortly after that,40.0
so she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters,45.45454545454545
and it they turned out that the stepmother was not very nicely she was not very nice to Cinderella,47.368421052631575
so she made Cinderella into kindof a little maid who hadta sweep out the,42.857142857142854
sorry,0.0
yeah,0.0
its another one of these turtlenecks,66.66666666666666
these are my favorite things,60.0
so they turned her into a little maid,50.0
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her sisters her stepsisters and her stepmother,35.0
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant,36.36363636363637
she was very unhappy,50.0
but she didnt really know what else to do,30.0
there was nothing else she could do,57.14285714285714
then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son the prince who was,48.0
they were trying to find a suitable bride for him,50.0
so they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoipolloi of the area,53.333333333333336
so the sisters decided theyd go,28.57142857142857
and at first Cinderella thought that she might go,44.44444444444444
and they laughed at her,60.0
told her she didnt have anything to wear,44.44444444444444
she was not pretty,50.0
so they went to the ball,50.0
she was very sad sitting among the cinders,50.0
and her fairy godmother shows up appears and tells her shell get it all set for the ball,38.88888888888889
so she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses,36.84210526315789
and I forget what she made her dress outof,44.44444444444444
so she goes to the ball,50.0
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers,37.5
so she goes to the ball,50.0
and she meets the prince,40.0
the prince falls madly in love with her because shes the most beautiful girl there,43.75
but the fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was,58.82352941176471
so she saw midnight approaching,20.0
so she hadta leave suddenly the prince,28.57142857142857
youknow she hadta run away from him and hide run away jump in her carriage,40.0
and just as she got back she jumped outof the carriage,36.36363636363637
and everything turned back to what it was before,66.66666666666666
so she al thought,25.0
well thats gonna be my one night of happiness,45.45454545454545
but Ill always remember it,20.0
but the i she had left behind the way she was running outof the castle she had left behind her glass slipper,54.54545454545454
the prince had run been running around trying to find her,45.45454545454545
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper,50.0
so he told his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper,41.17647058823529
so they went around to all the villages,50.0
and they they had them try had the women who might possibly be that Cinderella try on the glass slipper,50.0
so they got to the house of Cinderella,50.0
and they asked her,50.0
how many girls do you have,50.0
no I only have two,20.0
because they had found out what was going on,77.77777777777779
they were having them try on this glass slipper,55.55555555555556
so she hid Cinderella forced Cinderella to stay inside her room,27.27272727272727
and she they tried the slipper on to the the stepdaughters,63.63636363636363
and the first one was was the heel was too big,45.45454545454545
so the mother said,25.0
no no that itll fit,50.0
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel,41.66666666666667
but it still didnt fit,33.33333333333333
and they tried on the for the second woman,55.55555555555556
and but her toe is too big,28.57142857142857
and the mother says,25.0
no no it fits,25.0
and she cut off her toe in secret,50.0
but it still didnt fit,33.33333333333333
so they said,33.33333333333333
no this isnt her these arent their shoes,60.0
so then they were leaving,40.0
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there,61.53846153846154
I dont remember exactly who what clued them into that,63.63636363636363
so they insisted on looking around,33.33333333333333
and they found Cinderella,25.0
and sure enough they tried her the shoe on her,50.0
and it fit,33.33333333333333
so they took her back to the castle,50.0
she married the prince,50.0
and she was very forgiving,40.0
she brought her sisters to live with them,50.0
well when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I toast the bread,35.714285714285715
and then I let it cool off,42.857142857142854
and then on one side I smear the peanut peanut butter,27.27272727272727
then on the other side I smear the jelly,44.44444444444444
and then I put them together,33.33333333333333
how do I what,75.0
very well,0.0
excellent,0.0
well I have noone to talk Yiddish to so I dont know whether I should include that,44.44444444444444
well I I can speak some Yiddish,57.14285714285714
but theres nobody to converse with so I dont know whether that would qualify,50.0
no,0.0
would you consider Alzheimers,50.0
yes my husband,33.33333333333333
what,100.0
well it started about six years before he passed away,40.0
I noticed that he was very forgetful,57.14285714285714
he couldnt remember what building we lived in and other things,41.66666666666667
and even driving his driving was erratic,28.57142857142857
and I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and and canasta that he no longer wanted to play,33.33333333333333
he didnt want to we used to square dance quite a bit,53.84615384615385
and then he decided,25.0
he never gave me a reason,50.0
and at first I didnt quite understand,37.5
and he dropped out of alotof the things,50.0
he was a volunteer at the KennedyCenter,71.42857142857143
and he loved it there and they loved him,44.44444444444444
and the next thing I know he wasnt going anymore,36.36363636363637
and I tried to figure out why,42.857142857142854
and he said,33.33333333333333
well they want me to use a different technique when I write up a sale,46.666666666666664
write it sothat he would write it write the sales for by hand,61.53846153846154
and then they put it in the computer,50.0
so the final straw came when I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him,47.05882352941176
and that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts,46.666666666666664
and he got very confused with the different women,33.33333333333333
they all happened to be black,50.0
and so he mixed them up,50.0
and when one wanted to feed him hed push her hand away,30.76923076923077
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldnt handle it and I couldnt handle it,57.14285714285714
and thats when he went into a nursing home,50.0
and he remained there,25.0
and he deteriorated quite a bit,50.0
he forgot how to walk,40.0
he forgot how to teach to feed himself,37.5
he didnt remember whether where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands,55.55555555555556
and so they took good care of him,37.5
he was always neatly dressed and clean outof bed until he reached the point where he stopped eating,38.88888888888889
and he eventually passed away peacefully,33.33333333333333
Ive had so many happy memories I dont even know where to start first,31.25
just one,0.0
I cant think of anything outstanding,57.14285714285714

Cinderella had a stepmother,25.0
two stepsisters,0.0
Cinderella was beautiful,33.33333333333333
the two stepsisters were mean ugly vicious just like the mother,36.36363636363637
and she did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just indulged themselves,50.0
and then they announced that the the king would have a ball in the palace,53.333333333333336
and everybody was invited,50.0
ofcourse Cinderella was not,25.0
and she would have liked to have gone to the ball,54.54545454545454
and along came the fairy godmother,16.666666666666664
and he s,33.33333333333333
well get you dressed up and get you to the ball,45.45454545454545
and she got into a beautiful gown and a a coach,45.45454545454545
but that she would hafta be back by midnight,55.55555555555556
Im improvising,66.66666666666666
and off she went to the ball,42.857142857142854
and the PrinceCharming asked her to dance,28.57142857142857
and she danced with him,60.0
and I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother,41.66666666666667
and at the stroke of midnight Cinderella knew she hadta return home,33.33333333333333
so she quickly ran down the steps to get into the coach and in the process lost one of her slippers,42.857142857142854
and she got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters,46.15384615384615
well PrinceCharming was enamored with her but he didnt know who she was or where he could find her,60.0
so he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball,47.05882352941176
and when they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into them into the shoe,54.166666666666664
and it wouldnt work,40.0
and Cinderella they would not let Cinderella do it,33.33333333333333
however the prince or the attendants said,28.57142857142857
why dont we have this this young lady try on the shoe,53.84615384615385
and they finally did,25.0
and the shoe fit,25.0
and thats when the PrinceCharming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball,61.111111111111114
and she was she went back to the palace,55.55555555555556
and the the king granted a marriage for his son PrinceCharming and Cinderella,38.46153846153847
and they were married,50.0
and they lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333

Cinderellas father married for the second time when Cinderellas mother had died,33.33333333333333
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters,27.27272727272727
and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her clean the fireplaces hence the name Cinderella,46.666666666666664
and do other menial work,0.0
at some point the prince of the whatever principality it was was in need of a wife,70.58823529411765
said his father and the I dont know minister of whatever marriages,46.15384615384615
so they cooked up a scheme to have a ball,50.0
and they sent out invitations to all the eligible young women in the principality,50.0
Cinderella got one but she ofcourse could not did not think she could go because she didnt have the clothes or even transportation,37.5
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with white horses and a footman and soforth,28.57142857142857
so she was able to go to the ball,44.44444444444444
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight,60.0
she went to the ball,60.0
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated,22.22222222222222
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love,36.36363636363637
midnight came,0.0
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be outof there,37.5
so she hurried away,25.0
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her,52.38095238095239
she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth,38.46153846153847
but she managed to get home anyway,14.285714285714285
and later the the prince was very depressed,37.5
he had fallen in love with this woman,62.5
and she had disappeared,50.0
all he had left was a glass slipper,62.5
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else,36.36363636363637
so the his father who I guess was the king and the minister of marriages went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on,47.22222222222222
and ofcourse it would not fit anyone at all including the two unpleasant stepsisters,28.57142857142857
eventhough I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit try to fit in,38.095238095238095
but it still didnt work,33.33333333333333
and it got blood all over the place,37.5
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper,45.0
it was Cinderella,66.66666666666666
and ofcourse she was just a sladeyn,42.857142857142854
but he insisted that she try it on,62.5
and sure enough it fit,20.0
so he had found his bride,50.0
and there was great celebration throughout the land,37.5
and they got married and lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
how I would make a peanut butter and,50.0
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it,66.66666666666666
but I you would I would take two pieces of bread,54.54545454545454
and Id put peanut butter on one using a knife,27.27272727272727
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread,42.857142857142854
and then Id put the two together,25.0
and I would probably slice it,50.0
because it would be for a kid Id probably slice it in quarters,64.28571428571429
well not bad,0.0
Ive given several speeches,40.0
haltingly,0.0
Ive had prestroke incidents,40.0
TIAs,0.0
serious illness yes,0.0
I was flat on my back for a year at age ten with rheumatic fever,53.333333333333336
the days before there were antibiotics,50.0
so there was no way to cure it,37.5
and I was one of the few who survived at that time,58.333333333333336
that was one of the close calls,57.14285714285714
well I I was when when they told me I could get up I was very happy,70.58823529411765
and I was gonna go out and play baseball,30.0
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed,33.33333333333333
I hadta learn to walk again,16.666666666666664
so I got into all sorts of athletic activities,44.44444444444444
my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again,38.46153846153847
and he also bought a one arm printing press because he wanted me to exercise on this printing press,36.84210526315789
so I went into business printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve,26.666666666666668
but I I maintained some form of athleticism all the way up until up up up until the time that I enlisted in the in the navy,62.96296296296296
I was a long distance runner in school,50.0
I played basketball with half hour quarters,28.57142857142857
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time laughs,41.17647058823529
and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and got into as much of that as I could,60.86956521739131
and I think it had a salutary effect,37.5
thats the naval air core flight test which is the toughest physical,38.46153846153847
its four days of physical examinations aswellas academic,25.0
you hadta be at the top top ten percent of your class to get started,40.0
then came the physical,25.0
that was a challenge,75.0
and so thats why I got into the navy,50.0
yeah theres no theres no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever,50.0
the few other people who survived the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort,43.333333333333336
and the first time I went through the navy exam they said,41.66666666666667
well youve had rheumatic fever,33.33333333333333
you have a heart condition,40.0
get out,50.0
so when I went back again I I checked to make sure I didnt,33.33333333333333
and then I went back again,16.666666666666664
and I didnt fill out the paper first,44.44444444444444
I went through the exam and got through got to the end and they said,46.666666666666664
well have you had any conditions,50.0
yes rheumatic fever,0.0
well you you cant be here then,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
well I just passed your exam,33.33333333333333
well alright if you wanna go go,28.57142857142857
oh theres so many,20.0
what kind of a story do you wanna hear,55.55555555555556
well there there was there was one interesting time when I was when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasnt working,39.39393939393939
we we had a we had a good program by all appearances,58.333333333333336
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms,45.45454545454545
and they looked like an army,50.0
and theyd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight,46.15384615384615
and still malaria,0.0
why,100.0
so I went out looking for answers,42.857142857142854
and on this one occasion I drove for across this desert area for about oh musta been six hours,42.10526315789473
Id been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark,46.15384615384615
and Im getting alittle concerned,33.33333333333333
I was also warned about the Danakil people also called Afars,36.36363636363637
very no I dont think youd call it hostile,36.36363636363637
but they didnt have many friends because their their the way they qualify for marriage,50.0
they had these mass weddings that were made,50.0
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body,46.666666666666664
so after about six hours we happened upon this little group of tuplesn round mud houses,31.25
and we stopped the Landrover,40.0
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys,37.5
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars,54.54545454545454
I thought,50.0
boy I shouldnt be here,50.0
and it turned out that about a third of the community maybe more were down with malaria,52.94117647058824
and they assumed that I was a physician because theyd the only white people they had seen before were physicians,52.38095238095239
just by sheer accident I had a car full of medication,36.36363636363637
so for about the next two hours I was a physician laughs,41.66666666666667
peering under eyelids and and baby bottoms and and administering this medicine,16.666666666666664
and at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy,50.0
and suddenly the chief appeared,20.0
seven feet high long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice,18.75
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests,52.94117647058824
I said,50.0
whats that,66.66666666666666
they said,50.0
smoked camels milk,0.0
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days,41.66666666666667
I said,50.0
apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but,50.0
and the driver kicked me and he said,37.5
youve been doing fine up until now FirstnameJ,55.55555555555556
dont ruin it,50.0
so we had smoked camels milk,33.33333333333333
its better than PeptoBismol,50.0
it really works,33.33333333333333
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds,25.0
and the chief got a big smile on his face,40.0
it all ended well,50.0
I dont know whether this is in your interview or not,58.333333333333336
but at my age I very often forget the word that I want to say,40.0

and at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her,50.0
but then hasta flee on schedule to avoid the being converted back into a chambermaid,33.33333333333333

the handsome gentleman upon upon discovering the shoe determines hes gonna look for a person that that that fits,52.38095238095239

and they got ready to go to the ball and left,27.27272727272727
and as Cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses,32.142857142857146
and they went to the ball,50.0
but the fairy godmother said,20.0
you hafta be home by twelve oclock or everything will disappear at twelve oclock,42.857142857142854
so she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time,33.33333333333333
and the prince fell in love with her at the ball,54.54545454545454
and it was just about twelve oclock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes crystal shoes at the ball,36.666666666666664
and she barely made it home,33.33333333333333
and poof the carriage and horses turned back into the pumpkin and mice,23.076923076923077
the prince wanted to find her,33.33333333333333
took the shoe and made a decree that theyd check every girl in the village until Cinderella was found,45.0
and they came to the house,50.0
and her two stepsisters they tried the shoe on but it wouldnt fit,42.857142857142854
and they finally found Cinderella,20.0
and they put the shoe on Cinderella,42.857142857142854
and it fit,33.33333333333333
and Cinderella was reunited with the prince,42.857142857142854

the cat is still up in the tree,62.5
the firemen come to help get the cat outof the tree and her dad outof the tree,29.411764705882355

so Cinderella,0.0
her father remarried a woman after her mother died,44.44444444444444
and this woman had two daughters,16.666666666666664
and so Cinderella came to live with her father and her stepmother and two stepsisters,20.0
and then her father passed away,33.33333333333333
and she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters,45.45454545454545
so they were very mean to Cinderella,42.857142857142854
and she became like a housekeeper for them,62.5
she did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked,50.0
and and they treated mistreated her,33.33333333333333
so one day there was a ball given by the king and queen to find a suitable wife for their son the prince,34.78260869565217
so the invitation came,25.0
and the stepsisters were all excited,33.33333333333333
but poor Cinderella she couldnt go,28.57142857142857
she didnt have the clothes,50.0
her stepmother and stepsisters said she wasnt invited to the kings ball,38.46153846153847
so she she wished she could go to the ball,60.0
but she had no way to do that,37.5
and she was very sad,40.0
and so the night of the ball the stepsisters get to go to the ball,40.0
theyre all dressed up,60.0
theyre very fancy and and ready to go to the ball,25.0
and out the door they go,50.0
Cinderella is down in the basement,50.0
and shes crying,50.0
and allofasudden her fairy godmother appears and asks why shes crying,33.33333333333333
and she says she wished she could go to the ball,54.54545454545454
and so the fairy godmother said that she could,44.44444444444444
and she fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into carriage drivers,40.0
and they had she had horses for the carriage,44.44444444444444
and she casts the spell,40.0
and Cinderella has a beautiful dress,16.666666666666664
and she her hair is beautiful,50.0
she has a beautiful dress,40.0
and she says,33.33333333333333
you will go to the ball,66.66666666666666
go to the ball,50.0
but one one rule is that at twelve oclock midnight you must be home by twelve oclock because all of this magic is going to go away,44.44444444444444
Cinderella goes off to the ball,50.0
she gets there,33.33333333333333
the prince becomes smitten with her when he sees her,60.0
hes dancing with her,80.0
her stepsisters are just seething because who is this who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with,63.63636363636363
they wanted to be chosen by the prince,50.0
and the night is going wonderfully,33.33333333333333
and then she hears the clock strike twelve,25.0
and she remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken,42.10526315789473
and she runs out and down the stairs leaving the prince behind,50.0
and as shes running down the stairs one of her glass slippers comes off,53.333333333333336
because when the fairy godmother cast the spell she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing,50.0
one of them gets left behind on the steps,55.55555555555556
and she runs home,25.0
and she she gets home before youknow as the spell is being broken,53.84615384615385
well the prince is very smitten with her,50.0
and he wonders who this beautiful woman was,50.0
and he wants to find throughout the kingdom where this m who this woman is,53.333333333333336
so he sets out he finds the glass slipper on the steps,50.0
knows it belongs to her,60.0
and he sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper,46.15384615384615
who does that shoe belong to,66.66666666666666
so they go throughout the kingdom trying the glass slipper on all of these women,53.333333333333336
and noone can wear the glass slipper,28.57142857142857
it fits noone,33.33333333333333
so they finally get to the house where Cinderella is living,45.45454545454545
but shes downstairs,25.0
and theyre keeping her in the basement because they know that the prince is coming,62.5
and they dont want her out youknow out and about where she could talk with him,58.82352941176471
and he tries the glass slipper on her two sisters,40.0
and it does not fit,40.0
and hes wondering,50.0
is there anyone else that this could be youknow this shoe could fit,69.23076923076923
and so Cinderella they realize that Cinderella is there,33.33333333333333
and he asks the the the the kings the princes assistant asks for her to try on the shoe,52.63157894736842
she tries the shoe on,60.0
and its a perfect match,40.0
and he takes that news back to the prince,44.44444444444444
the prince summons Cinderella,25.0
he realizes she is the the young lady that he was smitten with,69.23076923076923
and they are married,50.0
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
and she never hasta be the housekeeper for her stepsisters again,45.45454545454545
and so they live happily ever after,28.57142857142857
I would get a loaf of bread,57.14285714285714
and get the peanut butter outof the cabinet and the jelly outof the refrigerator,28.57142857142857
and I would remove two slices of bread from the loaf of bread,46.15384615384615
I would open the peanut butter jar and take peanut butter on a knife and spread it across the bread,40.0
then I would spread open the jelly and spread jelly on top of the peanut butter,37.5
and then take the second slice of bread and put it on top of the first slice that has the peanut butter and jelly on it,38.46153846153847
okay,0.0
I do very well speaking English,33.33333333333333
Im a native English speaker,33.33333333333333
Ive been speaking since I guess the normal age,60.0
when do kids start to speak,33.33333333333333
a couple of,66.66666666666666
young very young,0.0
and Ive been reading pretty young,42.857142857142854
Ive learned sortof selftaught myself to read when I was about four,46.15384615384615
so I was reading pretty well by kindergarten,37.5
my speech is I think fluent and generally understandable,33.33333333333333
I talk alittle fast sometimes,20.0
thats about it,75.0
no not really no,0.0
not that I know of,60.0
yes my mother had a stroke,33.33333333333333
and my grandfather had two small strokes,14.285714285714285
my grandfathers strokes or my mothers,33.33333333333333
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four,50.0
so she was very young,40.0
they think it was because she had blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx in her in her atria,53.84615384615385
and then she youknow unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid,33.33333333333333
and it basically took out essentially a fistsized portion of her left hemisphere,38.46153846153847
so its left her pretty severely impaired,28.57142857142857
my grandfathers strokes were smaller,40.0
I believe they were right hemisphere,50.0
he had some serious apraxia,40.0
but he had no evidence of aphasia,42.857142857142854
he was still able to read and write and did not make alotof effort to speak,18.75
I was fairly young,50.0
and he was hemiparesis and used a wheelchair,37.5
but again he also just was very stubborn,25.0
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all,45.45454545454545
he just sortof refused to do it,28.57142857142857
so he kindof just lived in his own head for the last maybe ten years of his life,44.44444444444444
shes been pretty good,60.0
its been ten and a half years now almost eleven years,27.27272727272727
yeah its been a long time,50.0
shes been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then,33.33333333333333
initially she did about a month,33.33333333333333
initially she was after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute,61.111111111111114
so she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname,57.14285714285714
she was there for about a month,57.14285714285714
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks,27.27272727272727
and actually no sorry she went home,14.285714285714285
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting,36.0
and then after that went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks,46.15384615384615
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT and got to about the,40.0
she was not as cooperative with that,57.14285714285714
she found it very uncomfortable,40.0
and right and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress,38.095238095238095
especially given that she was not willing to to work at home besides doing range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own,39.285714285714285
shes very good about that,50.0
so we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay outof physical therapy,47.368421052631575
and she shes doing that,66.66666666666666
and then but we we continue to do speech therapy,20.0
weve done it here for at this point I guess almost ten years,50.0
and shes done a mix of group and individual,40.0
and she goes to an adult daycare program where shes very social,38.46153846153847
we dont spend alotof time with friends outside of that,54.54545454545454
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then,33.33333333333333
but we hafta make an effort unless shes sick or has something else going on to get outof the house at least once a day even if its just for a small short activity,37.142857142857146
it can its its hard,80.0
it takes alotof time and effort,16.666666666666664
and for her not every activity is easy,50.0
so,0.0
see now you make me wanna think of a really good story,33.33333333333333
well Ive told you about my mom,62.5
thats probably the like the singular event thats most significant,41.66666666666667
okay Ill tell you a story,33.33333333333333
this is a story about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird,52.38095238095239
but its so clear in my mind and it still doesnt make any sense,40.0
so my first semester of my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname,41.17647058823529
but my family was from DC,50.0
and I had a car,40.0
so I would drive back and forth over break time with my car,38.46153846153847
its about a thousand miles,40.0
so it generally takes about two days,14.285714285714285
so the first semester back its winter and Im driving across IEighty which is goes through a bunch of very flat states with alotof corn,42.30769230769231
so it is an extremely boring repetitive drive,37.5
there is alotof youknow driver tunnel vision that happens,22.22222222222222
and its cold and gray so its not even pretty green fields,25.0
its just empty empty empty fields,16.666666666666664
but Im Im kindof proud of myself because its my first semester went well,50.0
I was youknow independent excited,40.0
so Im on IEighty in sortof the middle of Illinois,45.45454545454545
and there is a slowdown,40.0
and its very flat so I can see ahead,44.44444444444444
I dont see that there is construction,50.0
I dont really see an accident,42.857142857142854
but I youknow figure somethings happened probably a minor accident,20.0
it looks like its a rubbernecking delay,57.14285714285714
its kindof pissing me off,60.0
IEighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction,45.45454545454545
and theres ke no exits nothing built along it,50.0
and we get closer and closer and closer,12.5
and I still cannot see whats going on,50.0
Im just like,50.0
what could this be,100.0
and we get alittle closer,20.0
and I see okay it looks like Im in the left lane,46.15384615384615
and then theres a median between the youknow east bound and west bound routes,26.666666666666668
and Im going east,40.0
and I can see that theres something over in the median to my left,66.66666666666666
and it looks as I get closer like an animal,50.0
and I get closer,25.0
and it looks like a fairly large animal,37.5
and Im thinking,50.0
is it a cow,75.0
is it a moose,75.0
Imean there wouldnt be a moose in Illinois,55.55555555555556
but it looks it looks fairly large and theres something unusual about it,42.857142857142854
so Im alittle more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay,30.0
but Im still kindof internally rolling my eyes going,40.0
why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal,53.84615384615385
wasting my time,33.33333333333333
I just wanna get home,20.0
and I get closer and I can see that theres these kindof large hind legs,37.5
so its oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car,50.0
and theres kindof a long tail,42.857142857142854
and its brown,33.33333333333333
and its this big hump,40.0
and Im getting closer and closer and closer,22.22222222222222
and I youknow my mind is doing that thing where its just trying to do the pattern matching going,36.84210526315789
what is this thing,75.0
I dont,33.33333333333333
its not a cow,50.0
its not a deer,50.0
its too big to be a dog,42.857142857142854
and Im literally as Im passing it ke my head is,53.84615384615385
youknow were just creeping along,20.0
my head is sortof like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view,31.25
and its only until its ke at my shoulder and I passed it that it my mind kindof pattern matches and goes,45.45454545454545
its a kangaroo,66.66666666666666
and then youknow again I hafta turn around and look at the road,23.076923076923077
and everythings cleared up behind me,50.0
and I spent like the next five miles going,33.33333333333333
thats no way it was a kangaroo,62.5
but it wasnt anything else,50.0
it was a kangaroo,75.0
it was clearly a kangaroo,60.0
I saw the ears,50.0
I saw the big massive tail,33.33333333333333
I saw the big hind legs,33.33333333333333
I saw the little tiny front legs,28.57142857142857
it was a kangaroo,75.0
and so to this day its this thing where I just dont know,50.0
I just dont know,40.0
I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo,57.14285714285714
Ive even start Imean this was,57.14285714285714
okay so this was the winter of two thousand two thousand one,33.33333333333333
so the internet was a thing but its not like,50.0
Google was around but there werent really if you didnt know how to search,37.5
and I think Ive subsequently every now and then done like kangarooq roadkillq kindof to see if theres any any information about this but no,40.74074074074074
Im pretty sure it was a kangaroo,50.0
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that,58.82352941176471
so its not a significant story,33.33333333333333
but it is kindof a funny story,42.857142857142854
I just dont know how,50.0
I just I am so certain and so uncertain,33.33333333333333
and I mostly just kindof like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going,25.0
what,100.0
it doesnt have a neat little conclusion,37.5
I dont know,50.0
I dont know,50.0
if it wasnt a kangaroo thered be no story of it,61.53846153846154
it couldnt be anything,80.0
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo,55.55555555555556
Imean it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind Imean massive hind feet,25.0
I dont know what else it possibly could have been,63.63636363636363
anything else that it might have been a wallaby or something like that,76.92307692307693
wallabys are pretty small,25.0
it still wouldnt have been in Illinois,62.5
Imean basically if its not a dog or a cow or a deer its something that shouldnt be there,50.0
okay what am I looking at,66.66666666666666
okay,0.0
okay,0.0
a beginning and middle and end,16.666666666666664
alright so theres a little boy named Ralph,22.22222222222222
Ralph is a science geek kid,33.33333333333333
his dad is a former athlete,50.0
his dad is always on Ralphs back about youknow,44.44444444444444
yeah you gotta participate in a team sport,33.33333333333333
you gotta you gotta learn to be a member of a team and to compete,41.17647058823529
and youknow its fine if you like science and you wanna become an astronaut,35.714285714285715
but youknow you still gotta learn some skills,22.22222222222222

and hes got his umbrella,50.0
and hes in the rain,50.0
and he just thinks,25.0
well I guess Im a channel nine viewer now,30.0
the end,50.0
alright,0.0
theres a little girl Jenny,33.33333333333333
she has a cat named Moggy,33.33333333333333
Moggy shes trying to play dressup with Moggy,33.33333333333333
Moggy gets very upset,0.0
he manages to dash outof the door where he encounters the dog named Goldie,35.714285714285715
Goldie starts barking at Moggy,20.0
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard,54.54545454545454
meanwhile little girl Jenny runs after them,28.57142857142857
she starts yelling and yelling and yelling,14.285714285714285
the cat wont come down,50.0
hes terrified little Moggy,20.0
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder and tries to to carry it,31.25
its very awkward,33.33333333333333
into the yard,66.66666666666666
shes dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up,66.66666666666666
he sees her out the window and starts yelling,44.44444444444444

and this whole time this little bird is just singing enjoying the show,30.76923076923077
the end,50.0
sure,0.0
okay,0.0
well I remember Cinderella but I will give it a first shot,41.66666666666667
ohboy,0.0
its very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella,37.5
okay,0.0
onceuponatime there was a little girl named Ella,25.0
she was the daughter of two loving parents,50.0
only one day when shes a little girl her mother dies suddenly,30.76923076923077
its very tragic,33.33333333333333
everybody cries,50.0
everybody loved her mother,50.0
her father in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own,46.42857142857143
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures,25.0
he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps,47.82608695652174
until the father partly outof heartbreak and partly outof just a really bad diet also dies,18.75
at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy,42.857142857142854
they make her run around working all the time then begin mocking her for being dirty,43.75
and they call her Cinderella,40.0
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are,33.33333333333333
so one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other brides all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people,42.857142857142854
or perhaps hes commanded to hold a ball,33.33333333333333
and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball to meet and hopefully find a match,45.45454545454545
so the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this,45.45454545454545
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns,41.66666666666667
Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to youknow get outof the house and to have a bit of glamour,38.70967741935484
but ofcourse they wont let her,42.857142857142854
because they they tell her that she would be an embarrassment,81.81818181818183
but mostly they dont want the competition,37.5
so they go off to the ball,57.14285714285714
and Cinderella is left alone sortof brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house,21.428571428571427
and she begins crying,25.0
and shes crying and crying by the fireplace when allofasudden a woman materializes from the flames and says,42.10526315789473
Cinderella why are you crying,60.0
Cinderella says,0.0
I just I just wanted to go to the ball,40.0
I just wanted one night of happiness and joy,22.22222222222222
and the woman says,25.0
well I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this,53.333333333333336
so can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and some frogs,46.15384615384615
and youre already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do,40.0
and she waves her wand,40.0
and the pumpkin turns into a carriage,42.857142857142854
and her ball her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown and her slippers into slippers of cut glass,33.33333333333333
and youknow none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling,0.0
and she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen,33.33333333333333
and Cinderella is just overcome with joy,28.57142857142857
and she gets into the carriage,50.0
and shes about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says,42.857142857142854
unfortunately my magical power is limited,33.33333333333333
and at midnight when the the chimes go everything will turn back,50.0
so make sure that you are well away from the ball and and out of youknow an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens,43.47826086956522
so Cinderella says,0.0
I will I will,100.0
and she waves goodbye,25.0
she goes off to the ball,66.66666666666666
and she arrives,33.33333333333333
and its even more dazzling than she thought,37.5
and she comes in,25.0
and everybody is just enchanted with her because shes beautiful and charming,46.15384615384615
and in the midst of of her being greeting by by throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up,57.89473684210527
and he sees her,50.0
and he asks her to dance,33.33333333333333
and they begin to dance,20.0
and ofcourse theyre both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that theyd have really cute kids together,43.333333333333336
and the prince is is about to propose to her there and then on the spot,43.75
and the clock begins to strike twelve,14.285714285714285
and she says,33.33333333333333
ohno oh yeah I need to go,14.285714285714285
she she runs off,75.0
and the prince is kindof stumped for a minute,44.44444444444444
hes thinking,66.66666666666666
wait a minute,33.33333333333333
theres a lady running away from me,50.0
what is this about,100.0
so she gets a good head start,28.57142857142857
eventhough shes wearing heels of glass she runs outof the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach the prince chasing after her all the while,51.85185185185185
on the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes,58.333333333333336
she doesnt have time to stop and pick it up,36.36363636363637
she leaps into the coach,60.0
it starts racing outof the palace grounds and and down the road as the clock youknow slowly strikes midnight,31.57894736842105
and on the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and and her clothes back into rags,41.17647058823529
and she hasta run the rest of the way home,40.0
the prince has been unable to catch up with her in time,58.333333333333336
he did not have a coach at the ready youknow being in his own palace and all,52.94117647058824
but he has the shoe,40.0
and he looks at the shoe,50.0
and its its very delicate and tiny,28.57142857142857
and he thinks,33.33333333333333
I have a clue,50.0
and I shall not rest until I find this woman because truly shes the hottest lady Ive ever seen,47.61904761904761
its gotta be her,60.0
nobody else,50.0
so he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest but still a kingdom,35.0
and goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person every woman of eligible age,41.17647058823529
and it doesnt fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason,54.166666666666664
and finally he gets to to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother,38.88888888888889
and he tries the shoe on the first stepsister,44.44444444444444
and it doesnt fit,40.0
and he tries it on the second stepsister,50.0
and it doesnt fit,40.0
and hes about to leave when he he sees in the corner of the courtyard this this little servant girl,47.61904761904761
and shes shes sweeping away all of the dust,63.63636363636363
and he just has a sense,33.33333333333333
he has a sense,50.0
he says,50.0
I dont know,50.0
shes kindof dirty but she looks kindof hot,33.33333333333333
I dont remember if shes as hot as the lady I saw last night but lets give it a go,40.909090909090914
so he he calls her over,66.66666666666666
and the stepmother the whole time is like,50.0
no no it couldnt be her,57.14285714285714
shes just a gutter wench,33.33333333333333
you dont want anything to do with her,55.55555555555556
shes dumb,33.33333333333333
shes ugly,33.33333333333333
shes infertile,33.33333333333333
why not consider one of my daughters,42.857142857142854
youknow theyre they might not be your first choice but theyre a pretty good second bet,38.88888888888889
the prince continues to wave her away,28.57142857142857
and he approaches Cinderella,25.0
and he asks her to try on the shoe,44.44444444444444
and she does,33.33333333333333
and ofcourse it fits,25.0
and he thinks,33.33333333333333
good enough for me,50.0
and he whisks her away,40.0
and they marry,33.33333333333333
and depending on your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters,36.36363636363637
possibly they just feel really bad,16.666666666666664
supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after,41.66666666666667
the end,50.0
well,0.0
lets assume that,33.33333333333333

take two slices of bread,20.0
take a jar of peanut butter,33.33333333333333
again if you wanna buy youknow your organic custom ground at WholeFoods you can do that,43.75

put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing eachother,31.25
not outward,0.0
its not a sticky sandwich,40.0
and then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across,52.63157894736842
and then stick it in your mouth then chew,33.33333333333333
well this looks like theres going to be a little bit of a disaster,53.333333333333336

had skin grafts,0.0

I dont know which was worse pain the wound in back or the skin grafts on my hip,47.368421052631575
but you cant hardly get comfortable in bed,33.33333333333333
you just sleep under lights that dry up the skin wounds,45.45454545454545
and then that was I was outof the hospital,55.55555555555556
I was back at work within six weeks with still the sortof a semi open wound over my spine in the back which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years,48.717948717948715
in order to close the wound on the back they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar take the flaps of skin close them back over the original scar wound,50.0
and so I had for about six weeks a lump on my back where they were infloating,47.05882352941176

I certainly worked in a very large industrial plant where there were certainly dangerous situations all around with mechanics and equipment and furnaces,26.08695652173913
but,0.0
its not anything that was its not scary because you are trained to cope with that but you are working constantly around large equipment,54.166666666666664
and I think probably many times since I was a supervisor I was probably more concerned about a young man working on one of the drill presses or on a lathe that would lose a finger or was injured by a grinder or something happening to one of the men that worked for me,50.0
and then the furnaces in a large plant its always a concern,41.66666666666667
an industrial plant is is something to be very cautious,50.0
not to be fearful of but to be cautious about your people who are working for you and also that your own behavior you dont do stupid things,44.827586206896555
and I worked midnights which was,50.0
I was the only female in the plant,62.5
and that still was not a fearful situation,37.5
but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was and the machinery was working,57.14285714285714
and we never had an accident we never had a fire we never had,35.714285714285715
we had a blizzard,50.0
but they would have never left me alone with,55.55555555555556
Imean they they picked me up at the plant took me back home,53.84615384615385
but not that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in,43.75
but it wasnt it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job,55.55555555555556
you were just more aware of what was going on around you because there was just alotof mechanical equipment and dangerous electrical and that sort of thing,44.44444444444444

it was a sad time because,66.66666666666666
yeah,0.0
and youknow its a sad time but I did have fun,36.36363636363637
the reason its sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years,42.857142857142854
they were litter mates,50.0
and one became very ill and hadta be put down,30.0
and I think it was well February or March,33.33333333333333
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down,42.857142857142854
so those were those were not fun,57.14285714285714
those were not fun,50.0
but had I did have fun in in Florida,44.44444444444444
because we always do,50.0

the banks of a very tranquil lake,42.857142857142854
and we have a sailboat in the lake,50.0
and we have actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite,40.0
a boy little boy playing with a kite,37.5
so its its windy,50.0
its windy enough to keep the flag fluffering,25.0
now we have a cozy little house on the shore,40.0
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade,38.46153846153847
and the car is parked in front of the garage,50.0
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach,43.75
now the beach is very very narrow,28.57142857142857
but its wide enough that the little girl out there can play and shes making a sandcastle,38.88888888888889
and it also has a pier,33.33333333333333
thats where the sailboat comes when its tired,55.55555555555556
and looks like dads on the edge of the pier,50.0
or maybe its Grandpa,25.0

but hes fishing and hes caught a fish,50.0

we have just a two lane highway,28.57142857142857
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees,52.94117647058824
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front,50.0
and the man has a map in his hand,44.44444444444444
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree,44.44444444444444
well its clear,33.33333333333333
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is,50.0
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story,57.14285714285714
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the cars headed,41.66666666666667
off they go,66.66666666666666
we see them receding into the distance,57.14285714285714
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole,36.36363636363637
and suddenly theres the car back in front of the farmer,41.66666666666667

and the little boy looks to be about six,22.22222222222222
and what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table,46.15384615384615
we have the front door open,33.33333333333333
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in,36.36363636363637

the paw prints go across the table onto the rug,50.0
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa,44.44444444444444
and theres a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa,40.0
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom,37.5
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this,58.333333333333336
the little boy is crying,40.0
doesnt look like we had much fun at this birthday party because it leaves it right there,44.44444444444444
but there she is,50.0
everybodys unhappy,0.0
but Im gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down,38.46153846153847
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out that was that the dog chewed on,57.14285714285714
and the little boy stopped crying,16.666666666666664

set the scene here,25.0
here we have what what appears to be an emergency,50.0
and how do we know this,66.66666666666666
because we have a fire truck on the street and that goes by this large tree,50.0
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder,27.27272727272727
,0.0
so we look at the tree,50.0

well what,50.0
wait a second,33.33333333333333
what is he doing up there,66.66666666666666
so we look alittle further and we see a kittycat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man,34.78260869565217
and beneath the kittycat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying,44.44444444444444
go kitty jump,0.0
come kitty come down,25.0
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder,35.714285714285715

cant get down,50.0
dad went up after the kittycat,50.0
got stuck up there,25.0
the dog is yelping,50.0
hes barking,66.66666666666666

I better pay attention,25.0
that is an easy one because its fairly recent,55.55555555555556
the the the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes,57.89473684210527
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition,33.33333333333333
and I remember hearing a womans voice saying,25.0
oo shes a bleeder,40.0
and then I went,25.0
and thats the only thing I remember from the recovery room,41.66666666666667
I me,100.0
is this what you want,80.0
memories,0.0
okay and then I remember being,33.33333333333333
and I remember having a,40.0
I cant remember what it was exactly because I never knew,58.333333333333336
but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it,52.94117647058824
and they said,33.33333333333333
you could push this button whenever you have alotof pain,50.0
you cant push it any less than six minutes apart,45.45454545454545
if you try it wont do anything,62.5
so youre alright,25.0
dont worry about it,60.0
so whenever I l felt that I couldnt stand it I would push that button,56.25
then I remember seeing my daughters face,28.57142857142857
I remember seeing her and her husband,42.857142857142854
and I,50.0
I remember bits and pieces of nurses coming and catheters being inserted and,23.076923076923077

and when I left my daughter asked me several questions,40.0

do you know I remember one day you came twice,40.0
she said,50.0
we came twice every day,40.0

and the nurse came in later and she,37.5
I could hear her,75.0
she was saying,66.66666666666666
boy she fell asleep sitting up,33.33333333333333
and I thought,33.33333333333333
Im not asleep,25.0
Im just,33.33333333333333
youknow,0.0
and that thats pretty much it,42.857142857142854
and I I remember the the therapy afterwards and and youknow pain and the and the medication of the Vicodin,40.0
and I remember saying things that didnt make sense,30.0
and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to,56.25
and I remember asking him,40.0
I had just taken Vicodin,40.0
and I remember asking him,40.0
now who are you,75.0
and I knew very well who he was,50.0
and he would answer very slowly,33.33333333333333

oh hes hes hes hes trying to youknow,41.66666666666667
and Id say,25.0
why am I asking these stupid questions,57.14285714285714
and I was i and I said,57.14285714285714
I could hear myself saying,60.0

and so in due course about three hours later these men showed up,23.076923076923077

I had just taken a pain pill,42.857142857142854
and it was three hours ago,33.33333333333333
and this is the difference between me right after it kicks in,66.66666666666666
so thats what I remember from from that,77.77777777777779
is that any help,75.0
okay,0.0
the first problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese,41.66666666666667
so it was frustrating,50.0
I hadta put children in school,33.33333333333333
I hadta take them shopping to get their uniforms,33.33333333333333
I hadta take a taxi and tell him where I wanted to go and how to get home and,31.57894736842105
so how did I deal with it,71.42857142857143
I studied Japanese,33.33333333333333
every morning five days a week until I got so I could do it,50.0
happened again when I went to Korea,42.857142857142854
it happened again when I went to Guatemala,50.0
so and and and Brazil,0.0
where they did not speak English,50.0
spoke English in Jamaica and they spoke in English in Malaysia at that time,42.857142857142854
but the only time that Ive really had what,50.0
and I hafta communicate immediately and then study at the same time,25.0
and I find I do it by reading body language reading facial expressions,30.76923076923077
and alot of this moving hands and to describe what I want,33.33333333333333
and then as as the language picks up on,55.55555555555556

I was on a boat a ship I should say,70.0
and the USS President line it was President Wilson,33.33333333333333
and we were sailing from I think it was Los Angeles to Tokyo,53.84615384615385
and I had my my husband and my two youngsters were there,41.66666666666667
they were probably third and fourth grade,28.57142857142857
and we came in we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up,58.82352941176471
so the captain youknow notified us,33.33333333333333
theres a,66.66666666666666
well what happened was,50.0
and the,50.0
and our little ship was in the vortex,50.0
I was frightened,66.66666666666666
I was my children one of them was thrown outof her bunk and youknow,50.0
and and I we strapped them in something,62.5
I cant remember exactly because I was miserable,55.55555555555556
I was seasick,66.66666666666666
and I was on the promenade deck,57.14285714285714
and they had,33.33333333333333
so because the promenade youre sposta be able to see but they had these,40.0
and I was strapped in a deck chair that was,60.0
and I was sitting in this chair sick as I could be watching the waves come up over me gpxraises arms above head,56.52173913043478
and then I would hear crashing,33.33333333333333
and one wave would go up real high,25.0
the ship would creak,50.0
it would go,66.66666666666666
I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life,62.5
they had ropes for people youknow if you hadta go to the bathroom or something you couldnt walk so you would do this to try and find your way,46.666666666666664
they had bed spreads,25.0
so that was it,75.0
and youknow we survived,25.0
the boat didnt go down but it I dont think it ever sailed again because it was already thirty years old and it was ready to be,44.827586206896555
which wasnt very helpful being being on it,66.66666666666666
but we survived,33.33333333333333
but Ive never been as frightened before or after,40.0

in elementary school I was rollerblading with my aunt,55.55555555555556
and she took off down a hill,57.14285714285714
and I went behind her,60.0
and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone,53.333333333333336
but I didnt really feel it at all,33.33333333333333
I didnt feel any pain or anything,50.0
I was just happy I had ke avoided,50.0
but when I looked down and saw all the blood,50.0
oh,0.0
and then I kicked into ke a pain association,33.33333333333333
so I hadta go get stitches,16.666666666666664
and a large man carried me into a wheelchair,44.44444444444444
and it was awkward,50.0
and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front,50.0
and she was I think she was pretty spun on something else,58.333333333333336
and she was just shouting having fights with everybody,44.44444444444444
so she came over and attacked us,42.857142857142854
and my friend was she was trying to attack one of my friends,46.15384615384615
so we were trying to get in the way and stop her from doing that,46.666666666666664
and during the whole commotion as we were trying to separate this really upset woman a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with ke just a,44.11764705882353
and and then he was actually,33.33333333333333

and she was just kinda screaming,33.33333333333333
and he was about to knock her out,50.0
so that was a little bit high tension,37.5
hadta break that up and call the cops and all that,45.45454545454545
Ive had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they cant really have a genuine conversation with you because they cant get around their own,54.54545454545454
just very self oriented kindof selfish in a way,22.22222222222222
cant really have a two person conversation because they dont move past a certain point in their mind,45.0
they just loop the track and go right back to another place,33.33333333333333
yeah I try to just be patient and continually try to open those doors of communication,25.0
so its its my mother,60.0
so its a lifetime process,40.0
but maybe in the next twenty years or something we can talk,41.66666666666667
so theres a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better,22.22222222222222
and he still hasnt quite learned,28.57142857142857
so as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house,57.14285714285714
and theres a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened,41.37931034482759
so there is a little boy getting ready for school,30.0
and his mom comes up and says,28.57142857142857
dont you wanna take your umbrella,57.14285714285714
and he says,33.33333333333333
no,0.0
hes asserting his independence and making decisions for himself,50.0
so he doesnt wanna take his mothers good advice,30.0
he goes out for the day and realizes that its raining raining very very hard,40.0
there are puddles everywhere,25.0
its really uncomfortable to be that wet,42.857142857142854
so he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels alot better because now he has some weather protection,28.57142857142857
so there is a little girl whose mother has died,40.0
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her,31.25
so shes introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters,41.66666666666667
shes excited,33.33333333333333
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean,41.66666666666667
and the stepmother is very cruel,33.33333333333333
so all the years as shes raised with them during the beginning few years its its okay,61.111111111111114
its not great,33.33333333333333
and then her father dies,20.0
and shes left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters,36.36363636363637
and they basically make her to be a maid,44.44444444444444
theyre never very kind to her,42.857142857142854
and she hasta do all the work on the farm,50.0
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food,46.666666666666664
so theres also in the same area a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle,45.83333333333333
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince,33.33333333333333
so he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region,64.70588235294117
so an invitation for a ball sothat the prince can choose a bride,53.84615384615385
and they get this invitation at Cinderellas house,37.5
the stepmother reads it,50.0
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited,25.0
they wanna go meet this handsome prince,28.57142857142857
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess,41.66666666666667
so they get ready for the ball,42.857142857142854
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball,15.384615384615385
she wants to go dance and have fun,12.5
so she hangs out with all her little animal friends and is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball,44.44444444444444
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that shes not allowed to go,42.857142857142854
shes not going to go,33.33333333333333
they rip off all of her jewelry,71.42857142857143
they tear apart her dress,40.0
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes aswell,38.88888888888889
so Cinderellas very sad,0.0
she doesnt know what to do,42.857142857142854
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that shes going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny,37.5
so she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride creates a beautiful dress for her gives her these delightful glass slippers and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball,41.46341463414634
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was,58.82352941176471
so Cinderella goes and is very excited,14.285714285714285
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night,55.00000000000001
and the stepsisters are very jealous,33.33333333333333
they dont know who this woman even is,55.55555555555556
and shes having a great time,42.857142857142854
but then she realizes that this the clock is about to strike,41.66666666666667
and so she runs in such a hurry,50.0
and the prince goes after her like,57.14285714285714
wait,0.0
you cant leave,50.0
why are you leaving,75.0
and she just says,25.0
I hafta go,33.33333333333333
and she leaves,33.33333333333333
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind,45.45454545454545
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe,50.0
so Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe,36.666666666666664
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive,40.0
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house,63.63636363636363
but it doesnt fit the fat foot of the sister,45.45454545454545
it doesnt fit the fat foot of the other sister,45.45454545454545
and it sure doesnt fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother,38.46153846153847
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella,50.0
so they know that shes the one that was at the party,61.53846153846154
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after,25.0
I would open the can of or jar of peanut butter,45.45454545454545

it looks like the family caught,50.0
and the father goes up the tree to to rescue the the cat,38.46153846153847
and he goes up a ladder,50.0
and and while hes up there somehow or other the somehow or other the ladder fell off fell away from the tree,30.434782608695656
now hes now hes stuck,28.57142857142857
and the dog is barking,40.0
hes all excited,50.0
and a little girl I guess thats his daughter is trying to coax a cat to come down,36.84210526315789

and it was like a dream come true,50.0
but the fairy godmother said,20.0

so otherwise everything wont go back to normal,33.33333333333333

her her nice her beautiful dress turns back to a normal just apron dress,35.714285714285715
and the carriage turns back into a pumpkin,37.5
and so the next day the prince still with the the thoughts of Cinderella on his mind wants to find out who Cinderella was,45.83333333333333
and all he has left is a glass slipper,55.55555555555556

the animals were the people she got along with people she could talk to or the the creatures that she could talk to,65.21739130434783
and then one day the there was a prince in that country,41.66666666666667
and they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife,42.857142857142854
and as it was time for him to marry,55.55555555555556

her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish,27.27272727272727
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first,42.857142857142854
so by the time it came to go Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to make a dress or prepare herself to go,29.629629629629626
but unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters clothes and such that they had cast away because they didnt want it,52.63157894736842
so Cinderella was very happy that they had the dress for her,50.0
and while the the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go,34.375
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away,41.17647058823529
and they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters,59.09090909090909
and she went out to the yard and was crying,50.0
and then a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight,41.17647058823529
she made her very beautiful and all that,50.0
but she warned her,50.0
it would only last til midnight,33.33333333333333
and youknow she turned youknow a pumpkin into a carriage and youknow transformed all these elements to make her look very beautiful,31.818181818181817
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince,46.15384615384615
and I guess it was love at first sight,44.44444444444444
and they were dancing together,40.0
and youknow he he very much enjoyed his time with her,45.45454545454545
and they were dancing outside,60.0
and she saw the clock,40.0
and she knows its almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs leaving one of her glass slippers behind,45.0
and she went racing off in the carriage,50.0
and she actually didnt make it quite home in the when it struck midnight,46.666666666666664
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin,55.55555555555556
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin,42.857142857142854
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers,56.25
and so this prince after this happened he was very interested in finding her,50.0
youknow he was he wondered why she had ran away,60.0
and so he set out to search for her using the glass slipper,38.46153846153847

he sent out his I dont know it was the duke or something to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit,54.166666666666664
it was very small,50.0
and eventually that duke got to Cinderellas house,25.0
and Cinderella got excited,0.0
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella,52.17391304347826
I dont remember how,60.0
and locked Cinderella up there,0.0
and while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper,44.44444444444444
their feet were way too large,33.33333333333333
they went flying youknow every time,33.33333333333333
and the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind,50.0
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper,30.0
the stepmother was very angry at this,57.14285714285714

and theyd never find her,33.33333333333333
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity,31.25
and she ended up marrying the prince,42.857142857142854
and they lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
one day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat Patches was in the tree stuck and was crying,45.83333333333333
she ran home quickly to get her dad to help him to help the cat out,31.25
the dad brought a ladder just in case,37.5
and as they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree,52.17391304347826

once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella,40.0
and she had happy life with her mother and her father,36.36363636363637
and her mother died which was sad,42.857142857142854

father decided to get remarried,20.0
and he married a woman that had two other daughters aswell Cinderellas stepsisters,23.076923076923077
and he was a busy man so he was always off politicking leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters,38.095238095238095
and her stepmother wasnt very nice,28.57142857142857
and as she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her,35.714285714285715
and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them,42.10526315789473
it wasnt a happy life,50.0
one day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married,26.666666666666668
and so the king said,20.0
Prince were gonna have a ball sothat you can meet some ladies to be married,43.75
an invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball,46.15384615384615
and she was happy,50.0
and so she was went to get ready for the ball,36.36363636363637
and Cinderellas mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball aswell but that Cinderella couldnt go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done,42.857142857142854
which was kindof disheartening because she wouldnt have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear,40.0
so the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people,48.0
and she slaved away the day,33.33333333333333
and so eventually it was time to go to the ball,36.36363636363637
and Cinderella felt like she hadnt had time to get ready,25.0
and the stepsisters and the mother were happy,37.5
but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made,50.0
and she was excited because then she could go to the ball,58.333333333333336
so she ran down the stairs to leave,37.5
and the sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart,47.368421052631575
so she wasnt able to go in shambles,33.33333333333333
and while the stepmother stat,40.0
and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince,38.70967741935484
and as she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out,55.55555555555556
so they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress,40.0
and she was all ready to go to the ball,40.0
and so she headed off,40.0
and the prince danced with a few people but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really,29.629629629629626
he was very infatuated,50.0
the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal,47.05882352941176
and so Cinder Cinderella lost track of time,12.5
and it was about to strike midnight,28.57142857142857
she realized what would happen and so she ran,44.44444444444444
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers,54.54545454545454
and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was,57.14285714285714
she was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear,46.666666666666664
so she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper,45.45454545454545
so he was distraught,50.0
the king and he hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit,38.095238095238095
they worked long and hard the prince long and hard to find the person,21.428571428571427
and when they arrived at Cinderellas house the stepmother locked Cinderella in a room sothat she couldnt try on the slipper because she suspected that Cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen,58.97435897435898
and the stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper,30.0
and it wouldnt fit,40.0
and the mice snuck the key past Dragon the cat to open the door to let Cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say,37.03703703703704
but wait I can try it on,57.14285714285714
and luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on,47.61904761904761
but Cinderella produced the other slipper and said,12.5
well heres the matching pair,20.0
I was the girl and it does fit,62.5
so they were very happy,40.0
and Cinderella married the prince and they lived happily ever after,27.27272727272727

then you take the bread and close the sandwich and cut a slice down the middle,37.5
to make a peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter the jar of jelly a plate a knife bread,34.78260869565217
and so then you would take with your knife,44.44444444444444
I would put the peanut butter on the bread,55.55555555555556
and then I would take and the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter,38.88888888888889
to put the two slices of bread together,25.0
cut it in half on my plate,57.14285714285714

well Im very lucky because Im basically very healthy,27.27272727272727
I was ill as a young girl,57.14285714285714

they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did,60.0
so going along pretty healthy,20.0
youknow I had one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery,13.333333333333334
no drugs no anything,75.0

youknow and you kindof felt sick to your stomach but it was pains were terrible,46.666666666666664
so this happened a few times and youknow you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out whats wrong,34.78260869565217
so you tell them all of this and they think,60.0
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but theyre not telling you a thing,50.0
so they send me a for a sonogram,62.5
well Ive never had one of those,50.0
and so I told them at the place I said,50.0
if you find a baby in there and Im like sixty years old,28.57142857142857

scared my husband to death because he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane,60.86956521739131
so when we get back I go back to the doctor again,41.66666666666667
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder,38.46153846153847
and thats the way life goes,28.57142857142857

one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town,41.37931034482759
then we had a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was loud and Im gonna say verbally abusive eventhough I didnt realize that at that time,50.0
and so he would scream and yell and maybe not m always treat our mother like we thought,33.33333333333333
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and and the difference,50.0

and my classmates specialed,25.0
what do I remember about it,83.33333333333334
I remember being so ill before I had the surgery that I refused the baby because actually we thought I thought that I had the flu,53.84615384615385
and I was just feeling so badly,28.57142857142857
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didnt know really what was wrong,55.00000000000001

they just thought that I didnt wanna take care of my little girl,42.857142857142854
finally after three days I had that,42.857142857142854
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three am,50.0

and they really did not think that I would live,50.0
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they thats just the way they did things,61.904761904761905
and I actually chose you could choose if you wanted to have the baby to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby,46.15384615384615
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are healthy and not ill,50.0
and I chose the baby to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby,43.47826086956522
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kindof thought of her as their own,55.00000000000001
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses,57.89473684210527

it was the everyone had grown up and gotten older,60.0
and they received an invitation from the prince from the castle because the prince was old enough to get married now,47.61904761904761
and he was looking for a bride,57.14285714285714
so they were having a big party at the castle,50.0
so the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters,46.15384615384615
and Cinderella overheard it,25.0
so she ran to her room,50.0
opened up her trunk,50.0
and got out her special gown that shed been saving for a long time,42.857142857142854
she tried it on,75.0
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was,50.0
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart,36.36363636363637
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball,50.0
so the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball,40.0
and Cinderella was left home all by herself,50.0
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and especially the mice were felt very sorry for her and were very upset,36.0
and then allofasudden a Cinderellas fairy godmother appeared,12.5
and said,0.0
Cinderella we you are going to go to the ball,50.0
and so she fricked,25.0
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown,12.5
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach,37.5
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach,22.22222222222222
and I think the dog became the footman,37.5
and everybody went off to the ball,57.14285714285714

the fairy godmother had given her glass slippers,37.5
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything the coach would turn back into a pumpkin,52.17391304347826
and she would not have her dress anymore,37.5
so she had a wonderful time at the party and danced with the prince all night,43.75
and then allofasudden the clock started striking midnight,12.5
so she ran down the steps,50.0
and ran into the coach,40.0
and ran all the way home,33.33333333333333

and said,0.0
I will only marry the girl that fits into their shoe,54.54545454545454
so there was a proclamation sent around that the princes footman would be going around with the shoe,55.55555555555556
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe,45.45454545454545
so the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball,46.15384615384615
so she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket,50.0
and the mice connived and got the key outof the pocket,27.27272727272727
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe,44.44444444444444
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe,35.714285714285715
but they didnt make it as because their feet were much larger than Cinderellas,53.333333333333336
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave,38.46153846153847
and the mice had just gotten the door open to Cinderellas room,33.33333333333333
and she came running down the stairs,57.14285714285714
and said,0.0

and the footman said,25.0
yes ofcourse,0.0
and he went over to try the put the shoe on her,50.0
and the stepmother used her cane to trip him,33.33333333333333
so the shoe fell to the ground and broke,33.33333333333333
and so the stepmother said,20.0
well thats that,50.0
and Cinderella said,0.0
no,0.0
and she pulled the shoe outof her apron pocket,33.33333333333333
and said,0.0

put it on a plate,60.0
I open the peanut butter,40.0
and get a knife,25.0

and I have a peanut butter sandwich,28.57142857142857
okay the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago,30.76923076923077
I had vertigo,33.33333333333333
extreme vertigo,50.0
and I was working at the time,57.14285714285714
I couldnt walk without bumping into things,50.0
I was afraid to drive,40.0
and I went through all this testing,57.14285714285714
I was never hospitalized,50.0
but I hadta take six weeks off from work,22.22222222222222
I never miss work,25.0
and Ive never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me,43.75
I did cat,33.33333333333333
and they could never find any reason for it,55.55555555555556
all the blood work was fine,50.0
its very frustrating because they dont know how to treat it or what to do,43.75
you just hafta wait it out,50.0
so I stayed at home,40.0
went through all the testing,60.0
went to the doctors,50.0
finally decided to go to a chiropractor,28.57142857142857
and my doctor agreed that was fine,42.857142857142854
so I went for massage therapy and muscle and nerve stimulant,18.181818181818183
and that helped,33.33333333333333
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck,54.54545454545454
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium,50.0
now thats not proven,40.0
my regular doctor ofcourse doesnt go along with it laughs,36.36363636363637
my chiropractor thinks thats the answer laughs,37.5
but it was just a terrible ordeal,42.857142857142854
and Ive not had it return,42.857142857142854
just a little bit once in awhile,28.57142857142857
but I find that when my back is outof alignment and my discs are compressed that it kindof slows down your your functioning,52.17391304347826
so anyway that was the worse thing Ive probably experienced,45.45454545454545
somewhat yes,0.0

and you work back into it from there,50.0
he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment,57.14285714285714
but it his,66.66666666666666
and the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me,61.111111111111114
its just a matter of speaking distinctly,42.857142857142854
I hadta repeat my myself,60.0
I hadta make decisions for him,50.0
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it,50.0
so we did work through that,66.66666666666666
actually it went pretty well,20.0
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be,53.84615384615385
and,0.0
I do not wanna be a care giver laughs,44.44444444444444
but you work through it,60.0

oh yes,0.0

I had a gallbladder attack on my twentieth wedding anniversary,40.0
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs,27.27272727272727
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown gallbladder attack which is very very painful,45.0
and so I went to the hospital,42.857142857142854
I was beginning to turn green,33.33333333333333
and I had the surgery done,33.33333333333333
I was in the hospital about three days,50.0
thats before they did it with any kind of scopes,63.63636363636363
youknow they did a regular open laparotomy,28.57142857142857
so,0.0
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work,33.33333333333333
so I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure,50.0
and then once its over you feel alot better thats for sure,46.15384615384615
okay the problems are word finding and the ability to speak,27.27272727272727
my mothers disability is apraxia aphasia,33.33333333333333
and so she sometimes uses different words to try to get her point across,21.428571428571427
what I do is I offer her extra time,66.66666666666666
sometimes extra processing time helps,0.0
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the is it this and touch,61.53846153846154
if its an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever,60.0
sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is alittle better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it,42.30769230769231
and then because we live with each other and were together so much I can kindof read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs,50.0
ke today with I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring,45.83333333333333
and I figured that maybe they didnt take her credit card,41.66666666666667
so for the most part I can kindof guess so,50.0
a little bit like VannaWhite,40.0
is it this,100.0
is it that,100.0
does it begin with the letter,66.66666666666666
sometimes beginning letters help,0.0
so thats how we work it out,75.0
my husband and I were in WashingtonDC doing some sightseeing,50.0
and it turned when we came off a a boat trip it it got a little darker,52.94117647058824
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel,45.45454545454545
and so we were walking along,50.0
and it went was pretty isolated street,28.57142857142857
there wasnt alotof people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station,41.17647058823529
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us youknow maybe twenty yards back,42.10526315789473
and it was three young kids three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough,35.294117647058826

and as we turned the corner there was a bus station,45.45454545454545
and people were waiting there,20.0
so we were just so grateful to see other people,20.0
and they backed off,50.0
and they left us alone,40.0
so I think it was a couldve been a robbery youknow,66.66666666666666
and thats it,50.0
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldnt,61.111111111111114
and this lady was driving her suv thinking she could get through the wash,50.0
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along,40.0
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her,33.33333333333333
and so it appears as though the hes strapped hes got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot,51.724137931034484
hes holding onto a branch thats hanging into the rushing water,61.53846153846154
and he is attempting the rescue,50.0
no Im not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but Im assuming thats the belt for helping her,40.74074074074074
I dont know,50.0

and his mom said,25.0
youknow Joey I looked out the window,42.857142857142854
it looks like in the looks like it might rain today,63.63636363636363

that was a lesson learned,60.0

Cinderellas mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls her stepmother and her stepsisters,25.0
as time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls,44.44444444444444
and she is very cruel to Cinderella,42.857142857142854
she uses her as a servant,66.66666666666666
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning,44.44444444444444
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along,50.0
and the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals were not treated as well,38.88888888888889
but Cinderella loved them all,40.0
and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice,36.36363636363637
and and they all loved her,50.0
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle,48.275862068965516
in the castle there was a wonderful prince handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married,42.10526315789473
and the princes servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife,40.0
and so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball,60.86956521739131
and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery,46.666666666666664
and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time,50.0
well the stepmother got the invitation,33.33333333333333
she only considered her daughters and she didnt consider Cinderella at all,30.76923076923077
so she got the her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery,41.66666666666667
and they were ugly stepsisters,40.0
and Cinderella made her own dress,16.666666666666664
and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress,42.10526315789473
and when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball that they are gonna go to the ball but she is not,51.162790697674424
so she was put into locked into a room,55.55555555555556
and she was visited by the fairy godmother,50.0
and the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the the ball,53.333333333333336
so the fairy godmother with her magic bitty bippetyboppetyboo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown,33.33333333333333
and outof a pumpkin she made a carriage,37.5
and outof the mice she made horsemen horses to carry the carriage to the palace,33.33333333333333
and she was dressed in her the most beautiful woman in the in the land,60.0
but she did have a stipulation,50.0
she said that she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear,37.5
so she went to the ball,50.0
and she was the bell of the ball,62.5
and she caught the eye of the prince,50.0
and the prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters,47.05882352941176
so she danced the night away,33.33333333333333
and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes,50.0
and she knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the the night would disappear at that time,50.0
so she ran from the prince,50.0
and as she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps,46.666666666666664
and she ran and she ran,33.33333333333333
and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night,40.0
the pumpkin returned to its former self,42.857142857142854
and and the animals were no longer horses,25.0
and everything returned to theirselves to what they were,66.66666666666666
when she returned home the stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace,57.89473684210527
and they would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper,56.52173913043478
so the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it didnt work,23.52941176470588
and they a mouse brought her the key Cinderella the key,45.45454545454545
she got outof the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on,42.857142857142854
she tried it on,75.0
it was a fit,75.0
and the prince then designated her as his princess,44.44444444444444
and they got married and lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
we have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard,36.36363636363637
but we also have a kittycat who loves to go up the tree,38.46153846153847
and the kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and couldnt get down,37.5
so dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all,47.05882352941176
it appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree,57.89473684210527
he then took a ladder dad did,42.857142857142854
put it up against the tree to climb and get the cat,41.66666666666667
but the ladder fell down,40.0
so after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree,39.130434782608695
the fire department not police department,16.666666666666664
and theres also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree,40.0
thats it,66.66666666666666
one afternoon the little girls cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch,37.5
and she was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down,30.76923076923077
and her father being the silly man that he is decided to go up and take care of the cat,45.0
try to get the cat,20.0
so as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch,61.53846153846154
and the ladder falls off of the tree,50.0
at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and which scares the cat all the more,50.0
and the cat is not gonna come to the father,36.36363636363637
but the father cant get outof the tree anyway,30.0
so they hafta call the fire department,28.57142857142857
who comes and rescues the man outof the tree,33.33333333333333
and rescues the cat,25.0
the end,50.0

and I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before,55.55555555555556
but it kicked in really fast,33.33333333333333
ke they tell you to take three deep breaths,22.22222222222222
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out,33.33333333333333
and it was kindof like taking a long blink,44.44444444444444
and then I opened my eyes,33.33333333333333
and it was like three hours later,28.57142857142857
which was really strange because usually ke youknow when you sleep you can feel time passing,43.75
ke it didnt feel like any time had passed,50.0
so it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that youknow three hours had gone by,47.61904761904761
everything was all over with,60.0
and then I was on pain meds,42.857142857142854
I stayed overnight,33.33333333333333
and then I went home,20.0
I was on pain meds,60.0
but then I I was able to go off of those,54.54545454545454
Im not sure what else you wanna know about it,45.45454545454545
no not off hand,0.0
okay so I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator,43.75
she would hold things in,60.0
and youknow you could just feel the energy that she was upset,50.0
but she wouldnt talk about it,57.14285714285714
I asked her on numerous occasions to youknow if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her,60.0
she always said,33.33333333333333
no,0.0
and then she kindof passively aggressively started youknow not participating in things or youknow just kindof being rude I guess,25.0
so it finally youknow broke my last little straw,33.33333333333333
and I yelled at her one day,42.857142857142854
and kicked her outof the group,33.33333333333333
so thats what I did about it,75.0
okay well Im afraid of heights,28.57142857142857
even little heights,0.0
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder,40.0
so I decided one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving youknow thing youknow jump I guess thats what you call it a jump for his birthday,37.93103448275862
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too,57.14285714285714
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights,54.54545454545454
so we went sky diving,20.0
and it was terrifying,50.0
and when I when we jumped outof the plane youknow youre attached to someone else,62.5
so when we jumped outof the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute while we were free falling because I was just ke,46.666666666666664
and then the parachute opens,20.0
and then you start gliding which is kind of nice,30.0
that was that was better,80.0
it was a little bit more like being a bird youknow and flying,46.15384615384615
so that was nice for a little bit,50.0
and then we landed,25.0
and then that was that,60.0
and I said Im glad I did it,44.44444444444444
and Ill never do it again,16.666666666666664
and Im still afraid of heights,28.57142857142857
so the story starts with the flood,42.857142857142854
theres lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city,46.15384615384615
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat to save her cat from the flood and the rains,51.85185185185185
so she got caught in the flood,57.14285714285714
she got swept downstream,50.0
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out,46.15384615384615
and shes been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her,46.15384615384615
someone saw her,66.66666666666666
called the fire department,25.0
and now the the firemen are there,42.857142857142854
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on,58.82352941176471
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him I think thats what that looks like to get her outof the water,44.0
and thats the end,40.0
okay the boy is playing soccer outside,28.57142857142857
he kicks the ball really hard,33.33333333333333
it goes crashing into the window,66.66666666666666
it crashes through the window into the lamps m,55.55555555555556
he jumps up,66.66666666666666
he grabs the ball,50.0
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it,50.0
yep,0.0
the boy is leaving for school,50.0
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella,40.0
it might rain,66.66666666666666
and he says,33.33333333333333
Ill be fine,33.33333333333333
bye mom,0.0
so he leaves,33.33333333333333
he goes outside,33.33333333333333
and its sprinkling a little bit,33.33333333333333
and then its r,25.0
and theres puddles all over,16.666666666666664
and mom was right,25.0
so hes running back home in the rain,44.44444444444444
he comes home all sopping wet,33.33333333333333
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face,46.15384615384615
and he gets the umbrella,40.0
and leaves again for school with the umbrella,37.5
okay well the father his wife dies,28.57142857142857
and he is left in the care of his single daughter,54.54545454545454
and he remarries,33.33333333333333
and he remarries evil but she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella,33.33333333333333
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own,27.27272727272727
and they live together,25.0
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen,36.36363636363637
and the dad is kindof nowhere in this part of the story laughs,46.15384615384615
and then theres Cinderella lets see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them,30.434782608695656
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream,52.63157894736842
so then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married,52.38095238095239
and he must have a ball to find his wife,40.0
so they send out invitations to around the town,55.55555555555556
and the stepmother gets the invitation,33.33333333333333
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince,33.33333333333333
so they get ready,25.0
Cinderella has the the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress,35.714285714285715
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them,42.857142857142854
but her sisters say no she cant go,33.33333333333333
she hasta stay and clean,20.0
and they rip her dress,40.0
she goes back up to her room crying while her sisters and stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball,42.10526315789473
then the ir her fairy godmother appears,28.57142857142857
and says she will create the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball,44.44444444444444
but she has back by midnight or shell turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin,38.095238095238095
so and she gets glass slippers,16.666666666666664
so she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers,45.45454545454545
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her,46.666666666666664
and her stepmother and the sisters dont know who she is because she looks so different,47.05882352941176
and then it gets to be midnight,28.57142857142857
and she says,33.33333333333333
oh I needta go home,20.0
so she runs away from the prince,42.857142857142854
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs,42.857142857142854
and she runs home,25.0
and the her dress turns back to rags,37.5
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin,37.5
but she still has her glass slipper,28.57142857142857
then the next day the prince sends out someone to fit the glass slipper on all the womens feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was,50.0
so they show up with the slipper at her house,60.0
and the stepmother locks her in the room locks Cinderella in the room,46.15384615384615
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsisters feet which it doesnt fit because they have big feet,42.857142857142854
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room,50.0
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper,40.0
and loandbehold it fits,25.0
so they bring her back to the prince,50.0
and they get married,25.0
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
the little girls pet cat is stuck up in the tree,45.45454545454545

and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down,45.45454545454545
and the dog is barking at him,57.14285714285714

it was a work day,60.0
and we were at Mimis cafe,50.0
and my stomach started hurting,20.0
and I thought that it might just be stre,55.55555555555556
so I ignored it,50.0
but by seven oclock that night I was throwing up constantly,45.45454545454545
it never the pain never let up,42.857142857142854
and I was just throwing up throwing up throwing up,50.0
at five oclock in the morning I decided well I had decided before but at five oclock in the morning I felt comfortable calling my exhusbands father my ex father inlaw to come get the two older kids,34.21052631578947
who were ten and nine at the time,50.0
and I didnt have my third one,37.5
so my two kids,25.0
and take them to his wife,50.0
and drive me to the hospital,50.0
which he did,66.66666666666666
and I spent from,50.0
they did alotof tests on me,50.0
they found out that I have one kidney,50.0
I was thirty one years old,33.33333333333333
and I had no idea I only had one kidney,30.0
but they looked for kidney stones,33.33333333333333
and they only saw one kidney which was huge,33.33333333333333
and they thought,33.33333333333333
whats going on,75.0
they looked for the other one,50.0
they never found it because I dont have another one,54.54545454545454
so I found out I didnt have another kidney,50.0
and I also found out I didnt have kidney stones,36.36363636363637
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis,45.45454545454545
and it was about to kill me,42.857142857142854
so Doctor Geiger came,0.0
he was the anesthesiologist,75.0
he introduced himself,66.66666666666666
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists,58.333333333333336
I said,50.0
yes,0.0
I was in alotof pain,60.0
because the pain medication they had given me,62.5
I couldnt have any more,50.0
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons,25.0
so I was in alotof pain,50.0
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things,42.857142857142854
and so Doctor Geiger put me under,28.57142857142857
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly,44.44444444444444
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a,54.54545454545454
what are those things called,60.0
a ventilation tube down my throat,50.0
and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up,54.54545454545454
and they gave me some medication,50.0
and sent me home,25.0
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo,12.5
and now I have a third baby,28.57142857142857

oh was it SeaWorld,50.0
it was SeaWorld in SanDiego,60.0
with three children,33.33333333333333
one of which was in a stroller,71.42857142857143
and I was walking,50.0
and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said,53.333333333333336
look,0.0
so I was looking,50.0
and then there was a man off to the right of the of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily,65.38461538461539
and I looked up at him and there was he was indicating to me something,66.66666666666666
and I looked to my right,50.0
and theres a woman there with a stroller,44.44444444444444
and shes fuming at me,66.66666666666666
and shes telling her husband six feet away to tell me that Im in her way,44.44444444444444
and I look over at the woman,57.14285714285714
and she looks at me like she wants to hit me,54.54545454545454
and shes yelling at her husband to tell me,50.0
so I looked at her husband,50.0
and I looked at her,60.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
she can talk to me,80.0
and the words excuse me work very well,25.0
and so I looked at her,50.0
and she continued to fume at me,42.857142857142854
didnt say a single thing to me until after her husband had told me to move,52.94117647058824
then she cussed at me and called me a name,50.0
and so I basically let her live her miserable life,30.0
and thats all I really did about it,55.55555555555556
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred and six degree temperature,29.411764705882355
so I took her to the emergency room,50.0
and she wouldnt take anything orally,42.857142857142854
she jus,50.0
and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard eventhough her temperature was a hundred and six was a good sign,50.0
so they gave her,50.0
whats the nice way to say this,37.5
a rectal fever reducer,25.0
and she eventually got better,20.0
we got her on antibiotics,60.0
but I was extremely afraid because it was my first child,54.54545454545454
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred and six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature,52.0
so I took her to the hospital,57.14285714285714
and she eventually got better,20.0
okay once upon a ti,40.0
it was raining very hard,40.0
but she hadta get home,20.0
and so she crossed the bridge,33.33333333333333
but the bridge wasnt very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was decaying the under girders,50.0
made that up,66.66666666666666
and so the bridge gave way,16.666666666666664
and the girl fell off of the bridge,50.0
for she was really riding a bike,57.14285714285714
and it was a rumbly bridge,50.0
and she fell into the water,50.0
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help,36.36363636363637
eventually someone heard her cries for help,42.857142857142854
and put on all the rescue necessary rescue gear,33.33333333333333
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her,41.66666666666667
and she was very grateful,40.0
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him,64.28571428571429
and he said,33.33333333333333
dont ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain,46.15384615384615
and be safe,33.33333333333333
the end,50.0
one day a bo,25.0
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball,25.0
and he kicked it into the air,57.14285714285714
and it crashed through a neighbors window,42.857142857142854
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window,50.0
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window,45.45454545454545
but the boy ran away,20.0
and the man walked outside looking for the boy,33.33333333333333
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball,23.076923076923077
the man scolded him,50.0
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge,31.25
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even,41.17647058823529
the end,50.0
one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain,50.0
and told him to take an umbrella,28.57142857142857
the boy said,33.33333333333333
no Ill be fine mom,40.0
and the mother was hesitant,40.0
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella,45.83333333333333
then the boy was walking to school,42.857142857142854
and it started to rain,20.0
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didnt have control over everything like he thought he did,52.63157894736842
and so he,33.33333333333333
and wetly came in the door saying nothing,37.5
but showing his mother that she was indeed right,44.44444444444444
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being,43.47826086956522
so she gave it to him,66.66666666666666
and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mothers love,46.15384615384615
the end,50.0

I would guess,66.66666666666666
there was a little girl,40.0
and her father was widowed,40.0
and so he remarried,25.0
and the new stepmother had two daughters the girls age,20.0
and the stepmother was not very nice,28.57142857142857
and as the dad got outof the picture by an unfortunate series of events the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave,47.82608695652174
and turned her into basically a scullery maid,37.5
and made her clean out the fireplace,42.857142857142854
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I dont know what her name was before,61.111111111111114
and the one da,25.0
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife,50.0
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mothers old dress,29.411764705882355
and the,50.0
lets just call her the wicked stepmother,42.857142857142854
the wicked stepmother was not interested in letting Cinderella go,30.0
so when Cinderella came downstairs she,33.33333333333333
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress,36.36363636363637
actually not Cinderella,0.0
she didnt do that at all,42.857142857142854
and they had taken things from the sisters,50.0
so the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderellas dress,40.0
Cinderella was very sad,25.0
but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle,33.33333333333333
and a,50.0
her rather plump fairy godmother came,16.666666666666664
and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown,37.5
turned the mice into coachmen and horses,28.57142857142857
and turned a pumpkin into a coach,42.857142857142854
and Cinderella went to the castle,33.33333333333333
the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her,40.0
what are the chances,75.0
and as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight the magic would wear off,56.25
and so when the crock,40.0
leaving one of her beautiful glass slipper,28.57142857142857
however,0.0
so,0.0
eventhough the prince had spent couple hours with her,44.44444444444444
and went looking for her using the glass slipper,44.44444444444444
and when the people came to the door of Cinderellas abode,45.45454545454545
the stepmother locked her in had locked her in because they didnt want her to find she didnt want him to find she didnt want them to find her,53.125
and so they,33.33333333333333
she raced downstairs,33.33333333333333
the shoe fit perfectly,25.0
they found Cinderella,33.33333333333333
and Cinderella went to the palace,33.33333333333333
married the prince,33.33333333333333

but the ladder fell,25.0
the dog continued to bark,20.0
the dad was stuck,50.0

and saved them all,50.0
and sent the doggie home,20.0
and had a talk with the doggies owner about a leash law,41.66666666666667

well I guess I can back up and say that the girl rode her bike to the place where she played with her cat,54.166666666666664
but that was a long time ago,57.14285714285714
and there was a bird singing happily in all the cacophony,45.45454545454545

and so they went in,40.0
and what had happened I had ke peritonitis,37.5
and Id had diverticulitis,20.0
and one of them burst,40.0
and that would have been peritonitis with the infection bu,60.0
and they it had sealed it except for a,77.77777777777779
that,100.0
and so I was I guess what they call septic,50.0
and so they did the surgery,33.33333333333333
and it was a long long surgery,42.857142857142854
and I ended up with a lo colonoscopy no colostomy colostomy,45.45454545454545
it was the bag,75.0
and then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that,58.333333333333336
and then six months later I was able to go back in the hospital because they had removed a section of my colon,43.47826086956522
went back in the hospital,40.0
and they resectioned,33.33333333333333
and I was able to not have the bag anymore,30.0
so I can remember all of that,71.42857142857143
and and it was life threatening,33.33333333333333
but and I knew that,40.0
and and thats why Im not afraid to die now because it was very peaceful,35.294117647058826
it wasnt it wasnt like a scary thing so,54.54545454545454
yes,0.0
well its still on going,40.0
my mother as I said is eighty eight,50.0
she has a pretty profound hearing loss,28.57142857142857
and has for probably atleast ten years,14.285714285714285
but she refuses ta,25.0
so we have hadta deal with this,42.857142857142854
so when I take her,60.0
and Im the one thats responsible for taking her to all of her doctors appointments,52.94117647058824
and when shes in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth,31.25
and so I hafta yell at her all the time,50.0
and its so rude and awful to be yelling at her,36.36363636363637
and even when I explain to the doctors they still turn and talk ta,42.857142857142854
and thats frustrating for her,50.0
and once I leave Im feeling really tense and frustrated because Ive been yelling,43.75
and our bodies when,50.0
and my mother also is getting some dementia,37.5
and so the combination what Ive realized is more to just allow her to talk,37.5
and not really have a conversation with her anymore,33.33333333333333
and thats very sad,20.0
its I guess its not that unusual,42.857142857142854

they called it then angioneurotic edema but its since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called hereditary angioedema,27.77777777777778
the difference between,66.66666666666666
hereditary angioedema cannot,25.0
it hasta be the only thing that until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that during an episode was the epinephrine,60.0
during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up,53.84615384615385
just outof the clear blue,20.0
I went to urgent care,40.0
in urgent care they started an iv on me,55.55555555555556
and the doctor,33.33333333333333
I dont know if she was a doctor or a pa,58.333333333333336
anyway she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline,50.0
and anybody thats,50.0
it goes intermuscular,33.33333333333333
because it takes within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty beats a minute,34.375
in my case I think I went over two hundred,50.0
and I remember my it felt like,57.14285714285714
youknow at the base of my skull,57.14285714285714
just from so much pressure,20.0
and Id,33.33333333333333
Ive been knocked out once youknow playing football but I never passed out,42.857142857142854
and I knew I was gonna pass out,44.44444444444444
and I told the doctor that,50.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
okay lay back,0.0
so I I looked at her and said,50.0
I cant I cant,66.66666666666666
I dont dare,50.0
so she put her hands behind me,57.14285714285714
and at that point I dont know what was going on externally but internally I was fishing with my grandfather,52.38095238095239
and he was it was at a favorite fishing place that I that I had when I was growing up,70.0
and he was walking up the the stream bank wanting ta,54.54545454545454
and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him,54.54545454545454
and I said,33.33333333333333
I wanna go,33.33333333333333
I wanna go,33.33333333333333
no its not your time to go fishing with me,40.0
go home,0.0
so I woke up and later was told that,44.44444444444444
I I can recall actually I dont I dont know if this is something you want on tape or not but,52.17391304347826
I I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was ke looking at myself and looking at the doctor and youknow watching what they were doing,48.275862068965516
and it was like,75.0
jeez what are you doing to me,71.42857142857143
and then it hit me that,50.0
oh yeah theyre doing it to me,62.5
my wife hasta fill in the details youknow of other stuff that happened,38.46153846153847
but apparently they brought in the crash cart,37.5
and I guess youknow zapped me atleast once,25.0
I did come back,50.0
overall I was out for seven minutes,57.14285714285714
not breathing for seven minutes,20.0
and to this day have had little if any effects youknow aftereffects from that,50.0
youknow they they say seven minutes your brain is dead,40.0
well I have no idea why but it didnt affect me,50.0
not Im sure sometimes it effects me youknow in some of my memory but that could be aging too so,47.61904761904761
that is very vivid to me,66.66666666666666
the probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee who was actually hired for me,56.52173913043478
he came in as I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe and needed an assistant,50.0
the assistant was brought in,60.0
and when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kindof looked at each other and said,57.14285714285714
what did he just say,60.0
hes Filipino,33.33333333333333
hes he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog,52.63157894736842
I dont know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently,45.0
theres alotof people that wouldnt give him the chance,45.45454545454545
and youknow I actually was doing some interpreting for him ca youknow at one time or another because I understood what he was saying,54.166666666666664
and that was to me it was probably the most difficult one that I hadta deal with,58.82352941176471
not because I didnt understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him,42.10526315789473
but I also spent some time in Mexico,37.5
and theres people down there that speak no English,30.0
so Ive youknow hadta adapt,33.33333333333333
and Ive learned to speak a little bit of Spanish,36.36363636363637
enough to get by,25.0
things like,50.0
gustans,0.0
or,0.0
dondes,0.0
youknow the important stuff youknow,20.0
the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico,54.54545454545454
and we were at the time wed been discussing this,63.63636363636363
and we were just standing in line at the movie theater,45.45454545454545
and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico,52.63157894736842
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see,27.77777777777778
youknow to go to the the island of Cozumel and youknow travel around there a little bit,29.411764705882355
because theres some ruins there and its a really nice place,41.66666666666667
well the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there apparently was an ex marine or something,47.61904761904761
he was just perfectly built,40.0
and he had they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab theyd gotten near the port,45.45454545454545
I think they were doing one of the PrincessCruises or something,54.54545454545454
so theyd come into port and had been spent the day there,38.46153846153847
and then they hadta get back to the ship,33.33333333333333
so they hired a cab,40.0
well the cab starts going the other direction,25.0
and he kept telling him,40.0
no no no no youre going the wrong way,30.0
the ports over here,50.0
youknow,0.0
you needta go back this way,33.33333333333333
and he wouldnt stop,40.0
and he kept saying,25.0
not to worry,0.0
I know short cut,25.0
its okay,50.0
and he said he finally ended up convincing the guy that he better stop,42.857142857142854
and he and his wife just jumped outof the vehicle as it was moving,42.857142857142854
and people in the neighborhood that they were that they had jumped outof into started screaming about youknow at yelling for the federaless,56.52173913043478
so here we are,50.0
maybe a month away not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this,37.5
we get there to Cozumel,40.0
and soon as you get off the ferry theres all these cab drivers there,46.666666666666664
and wanting to youknow take you around the city or around the island,38.46153846153847
so this one n youknow kindof I dont know it was kindof like hey pick me,35.294117647058826
and and so we went over to him,50.0
and he says that oh yeah hed be glad to take us,38.46153846153847
and he says,33.33333333333333

and I cant even remember the amount,37.5
we get in the vehicle and,50.0
youknow we made the contract,40.0

and right off the bat he takes off into the middle of town,53.84615384615385
dont worry,33.33333333333333
its okay,50.0
I just hafta stop and let the owner of the cab know where were going,40.0
so here I am with my wife and my sister inlaw,45.45454545454545
the three of us,75.0
and were sitting there,25.0

well come to find out the guy was just going in to tell the cab the owner of the cab because apparently they owned it it was coownership,46.42857142857143
so he went in to tell the other guy that,40.0
hey dont worry about using the cab because Im using it for the day,56.25
and he was a very good tour guide,37.5
very good to us all day,50.0
but it was like I said it it was scary there for quite awhile,50.0
well it was the great flood of nineteen eighty,44.44444444444444
and people were doing such foolish things,14.285714285714285
but in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people,50.0
putting their lives on the line,50.0
we have a firefighter that jumped in the water to save a little girl who was about to drown,42.10526315789473
and he held onto her until other help could get there to help get her outofthe the water the swirling water,42.857142857142854
surely she would have died if he hadnt been there to help her out,60.0
well Danny was out playing soccer in the front yard,40.0
and hed been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well,30.76923076923077
so he gave it a boot one time,37.5
and he actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it,30.76923076923077
and it went over and hit the window of the the house nearby,46.15384615384615
and broke the window,25.0
and fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair,57.14285714285714
the father of the house,60.0
when they when he approached when it fell on his lap he was startled,71.42857142857143
and got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from,43.75
but ofcourse the little boy had run away,25.0
well it was a cloudy day,50.0
and mother had watched the or heard the news the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day,44.0
so when I was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella,46.666666666666664

this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain,54.54545454545454

and her all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball,57.89473684210527
because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her,38.095238095238095

but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight you will become the same Cinderella that you were before,60.0
no matter where you are you needta be you needta come home,50.0
so as this clock was striking d the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince,47.368421052631575
on her way out she lost her slipper one of her glass slippers,53.84615384615385
she got to her coach,60.0
and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin,37.5
and turned and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat,30.76923076923077
she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again,42.857142857142854
as it turned,66.66666666666666
the prince was so excited about this pretty young women that he wanted to meet her,43.75
he had kept the the glass slipper,57.14285714285714
and knew that he hadta see her again,37.5

and try on the slipper,40.0
and the prince announced that he this was the woman that he would marry,64.28571428571429

I have ALS here to here,33.33333333333333
and Im not able to hold anything in my arm like this,46.15384615384615
I have a very difficult time,33.33333333333333
so thats thats what happened,42.857142857142854
okay,0.0
tu what the situation was hadta do with my wife my second wife,53.84615384615385
shes lovely absolutely lovely woman,16.666666666666664
and we got we ended up getting a divorce,44.44444444444444
however after my divorce I went to a a thing at a seminar at a place called LandmarkEducation,55.55555555555556
and I learned about,50.0
it was a weekend seminar started on Friday Friday morning and went through Sunday night,33.33333333333333
there was about a hundred and twenty five of us there,36.36363636363637
there was about fifteen men and a hundred some odd women,27.27272727272727
mostly maybe not exactly that but it was that kind of proportion,41.66666666666667
and I was I was Id felt very very kindof down after my divorce,46.666666666666664
and I had prayed and this was kindof a the Lord leading me to this session,56.25
so I listened,33.33333333333333
and I listened alot,25.0
and the conversation dealt with abandonment,33.33333333333333
and it turns out that in summary I think most women I think its fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do,34.61538461538461
and and I learned very significant things about the abandonment and how people feel and learned that you hafta forgive an abandonment,31.818181818181817
but I also learned that what you,57.14285714285714
this was reinforced,66.66666666666666
Id been I was told by a priest back in the seventies that when your wife speaks to you just listen,59.09090909090909
and when you what you remember is one or two things is whats important,46.666666666666664
dont solve every problem,40.0
well this reinforced that,50.0
and its very p,25.0
women have a,33.33333333333333
thats why if you go back to that story I mightve said this,66.66666666666666
women have a a need more,33.33333333333333
men do too but they dont they dont verbalize it,41.66666666666667
but women verbalize it alot more an,28.57142857142857
when things build up after a day they have a needta come home and dump,40.0
they do,50.0
and they need somebody to listen,33.33333333333333
they dont need any of the dialogue on it or not but they need somebody to listen,50.0
so I learned to to just sit and listen,11.11111111111111
and what I remembered from it is to then afterwards after partners finished what you remember one or two things you you talk about that,48.0
and then your partner is is pleased because then you that shows that youve listened to them,61.111111111111114
and thats makes more effective communication,14.285714285714285
hope you listened,33.33333333333333
okay when I was I believe around seven years old maybe it was five or six I m this this,50.0

today is Timmys birthday,25.0
a very large party has been planned,42.857142857142854
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy,42.857142857142854
and good friends were invited over,33.33333333333333
well somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after of the cake after climbing up onto the table,48.0
mom sees this and is very very upset,25.0
very frustrated,0.0
and grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch,40.0
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy,57.89473684210527
to see this cake having much much less than its sposta have,33.33333333333333
first you,50.0
lightly toast them,33.33333333333333
bring the peanut butter and jelly to the table,33.33333333333333
apply jelly to one side,20.0
and peanut butter,0.0
and then bringing them together sothat the jelly and the peanut butter meet,30.76923076923077
put them together,33.33333333333333
and eat it,33.33333333333333
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the px,46.666666666666664
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck was kept up,50.0
and there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time,28.57142857142857
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible,33.33333333333333
but this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck,52.94117647058824
and as I left by kicking my left leg up and over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed of the truck,52.77777777777778
I was lightly tupped,50.0
because I had only been moved about a an inch and a half,61.53846153846154
if I had had this awareness it wouldve been much easier for me to push away from the truck and sustain less injury than I had,51.85185185185185
as that my left leg was kicked up and about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries Ive ever had,57.14285714285714
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest,54.54545454545454
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate,47.61904761904761
then falling down further the back of the bed,44.44444444444444
then the bumper,33.33333333333333
and in my attention anyhow almost eons later after I had thought that the last of the contusions were occurring the same spot on the under side of my left calf hit the the r the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle,46.51162790697674
the bed of the of the vehicle itself just,66.66666666666666
and coming down underneath,25.0
well this hit in the same spot one two three four,27.27272727272727
and I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries,44.44444444444444
at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle,43.75
and their discretion chose to take me to the hospital,40.0
and theyre my drill sergeants so I let them do that instead of saying its just a sprained ankle,40.0
and finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop,30.76923076923077
well I immediately went into shock,33.33333333333333
and being in basic training there is much suggestion to do as one is told,40.0
and a myriad manner of forms directly and indirectly,22.22222222222222
so my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and damage that I had just gone through,40.74074074074074
I actually hadta walk the next morning to the clinic on a very very swollen calf,37.5
so swollen infact that I was unable to take the bdus which are the battle dress uniform,41.17647058823529
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants from being able to be lifted up,50.0
my calf was so swollen,40.0
unfortunately that was the major holiday of that whole fort,50.0
combination of its anniversary and FourthofJuly,33.33333333333333
so the crew at the clinic on that Saturday,55.55555555555556
which then being a Saturday busses never ran so I hadta walk about two and a half miles on that condition,33.33333333333333
did a very cursory and less than effective look at my injury,33.33333333333333
and described me as rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches,23.52941176470588
the next and without and,40.0
the next day because it was a holiday and through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given kp duty,50.0
and the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing kp because everyone else had been working,54.83870967741935
and I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself,50.0
I was in shock continually this entire time,50.0
so I never volunteered for any of the kp duties,50.0
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and sprained almost knee,37.03703703703704
well regardless to say as I got back on Monday the staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physicians assistant,29.166666666666668
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms,33.33333333333333
and pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies,26.666666666666668
and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic,41.66666666666667
yes,0.0
actually I,50.0
for the last year Ive been a life coach for a developmentally disabled man where I live,55.55555555555556
and his developmental disablement has come about because of actual large set of circumstance,35.714285714285715
traumatic psychological and physiological experiences have pretty much left him with the mental state a mental emotional state of a very high strung five year old,26.923076923076923
and various communication miscues,0.0
and the lack of my focus to make sure,33.33333333333333
and to to better his activities has created a a very large,33.33333333333333
and at this moment I have hadta disconnect from being a life coach for this individual,50.0
in the past reiterations and nonreactive acceptance of whatever form of communication this individual has relayed,43.75
and then full discourse about the perspectives and the the missing pieces of the the sides of the total experiences happening,42.857142857142854
repeatedly and calmly delivered to this gentleman has helped,33.33333333333333
though current situations and my own revealing of larger circumstance has led me to necessitively,40.0
yes,0.0
the only only thing thats coming up to my mind right now was a trip to HooverDam when I was young,54.54545454545454
and I had at that time my st my youngest sister,45.45454545454545
she was about four and a half,42.857142857142854

and and saw all all the insides,42.857142857142854
well when we got back up as I as I looked out across the bridge and saw the very very deep hole,50.0
when the water gets too high,33.33333333333333
I got an immediate sensation of fear,42.857142857142854
prolly,0.0
and I immediately saw my sister,33.33333333333333
and I just felt horrible of about potential of her being drug down,46.15384615384615
and then spit out the side,33.33333333333333
because this thing this thing is about a a good hundred yards wide and very very very deep,38.88888888888889
and it just gave me this ominous sense of of lack and and grief,35.714285714285715
there was much much rain,20.0
so much more than ever before that a flood occurred,40.0
and began sweeping away houses and people,14.285714285714285

but then helped her to put the harness on,33.33333333333333
and be brought back away from the flood itself to safety,45.45454545454545
a young boy was outside practicing soccer,28.57142857142857
unfortunately he made a very large mistake and kicked the ball too hard,23.076923076923077
the ball flew into the neighbors yard,42.857142857142854
breaking the window,33.33333333333333
knocking over a lamp,50.0
and very very much scaring the man sitting inside watching the television,16.666666666666664

and looks out to see the little boy is gone,30.0

and his mother offers him an umbrella which he refuses,50.0

he realizes his mistake covers his head and runs back to the house,38.46153846153847
mother sees him and tells him,33.33333333333333
and gives him the umbrella,40.0
which then he uses to walk to school staying after he has been dried dry,46.666666666666664

and they open the door to see whats going on,45.45454545454545
and they come in living room,33.33333333333333
and they see an angry mom and little Jonathan crying and cake everywhere,15.384615384615385
and they wonder if theres still gonna be a party or not,42.857142857142854
youll probably laugh because this is kindof a unique story,54.54545454545454
I I once owned two blacktailed prairie dogs,25.0
and we some friends of ours liked our prairie dogs so much that two,35.714285714285715
so we had,33.33333333333333
and then one of them was going outof the country and needed us to watch their m their prairie dogs,35.0
and so we did,25.0
and one of them was a male,57.14285714285714
and he was alittle aggressive,40.0
and he didnt like me very much,37.5
and so I was trying to,33.33333333333333
and so I was trying to pet him,37.5
and I was rubbing his chin,50.0
and he was getting all,60.0
and I really didnt read the warning sign very much,27.27272727272727
and he bit me,50.0
and took out a good chunk of my,50.0
so so Im actually home alone,14.285714285714285
and I,50.0
and I can see,50.0
its pretty good bite,25.0
and I realize well,25.0
I should probably not I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it,52.17391304347826
and I I dont always do well with the sight of my own blood,46.666666666666664
ke I have no,50.0
but I got,33.33333333333333
and then like,0.0
ohboy what do I do,60.0
so ironically or,0.0
so I hadta wrap,25.0
and interrupt her class,25.0
and to get her,25.0
and so I was standing there when she,50.0
youknow Im standing there,40.0
Im like,66.66666666666666
the prairie dog bit me,40.0
can you drive me to the urgent care,62.5
and shes like,50.0
okay,0.0
so she hasta,33.33333333333333
and then I get to urgent care for stitches,33.33333333333333
and prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona,20.0
I had bought it in Texas,66.66666666666666
and you can also buy them in Washington state,44.44444444444444
but theyre theyre considered restricted wildlife here,33.33333333333333
and so I hadta completely lie about the entire,33.33333333333333
because they ask you how you got the bite and was it an animal and whatever,62.5
and I hadta,33.33333333333333
they probably would have come and taken the prairie dogs away,36.36363636363637
so allofasudden it became a like I think I said a a ferret,46.15384615384615
because youre allowed to have ferrets here,37.5
a ferret bite,33.33333333333333
anyway thats my experience,40.0
my grandmother whos almost eighty is in a nursing home,45.45454545454545
and shes slowly been losing her mental,50.0
and Im actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama,41.66666666666667
and so every time I visit her Im never quite sure what mental state shell be in whether she recognizes me,45.45454545454545
she she usually she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year,45.45454545454545
and those people that she doesnt,42.857142857142854
so usually sometimes Im me her grandson,37.5
but other times Im other grandsons who see her more often,25.0
and so so you just hafta sortof its easier to just sorta,16.666666666666664
and get her youknow sortof force her to realize who you really are,38.46153846153847
so youre so you just sortof play along,33.33333333333333
and you basically just ask her how shes doing,50.0
and she kindof makes stuff up or doesnt make alotof sense,25.0
although Imean you can under you can she,87.5
and you can understand what shes saying,62.5
its just that the its not coherent sometimes,50.0
and so you just kindof hafta take it as it goes and stay for about ten fifteen minutes,27.77777777777778
and then then you leave,20.0
and its kindof sad,25.0
but I think she atleast is somewhat happy to have a visitor,33.33333333333333
so theres some solace in that,57.14285714285714
this is when my parents were still married,62.5
and we were I was a little,71.42857142857143
I was probably like seven,40.0
and we were all camping at a lake in north of Dallas,58.333333333333336
and wed all gone to bed for the night,50.0
and were,50.0
and a really bad storm came,16.666666666666664
we were camping,66.66666666666666
ke in,0.0
and a really bad storm came that night,25.0
and the winds really picked up,33.33333333333333
and blew the tent started to blow the tent,22.22222222222222
off its,100.0
and actually started rolling all the way,28.57142857142857
so we were all in the tent,57.14285714285714
and it was ke rolling,40.0
and as it broke,50.0
and,0.0
and and my moms screaming,20.0
and my dads freaking out,40.0
and,0.0
I probably would have handled it different now as an adult,54.54545454545454
but as a kid its really traumatic when you dont know,50.0
and everythings,0.0
and and it stopped,25.0
it ke,50.0
and my dad was able,40.0
luckily we never got in the water,42.857142857142854
and he was able,50.0
but then but then everything,20.0
but we couldnt really leave that night,37.5
and there was some,50.0
so my dad sat up all night just to,33.33333333333333
and and it was just a really bad camping experience,30.0
and luckily I we kept going and I had better experiences so Im not afraid of camping anymore,31.57894736842105
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid,50.0
Im going to assume Ill Ill say this is this takes place in Arizona,40.0
and unfortunately Imean it was in monsoon season,37.5
and there was a huge storm,33.33333333333333
and caused what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent,40.0
and this poor woman decided that while she had gone that way home every day,46.666666666666664
and she really needed to get home to,12.5
and she was determined to get there across the wash that she crosses every day,46.666666666666664
but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash,50.0
and didnt make it but a few feet,33.33333333333333
and the water started surrounding her car and pushing it around and flooding her car,26.666666666666668
and she,50.0
she couldnt go reverse to get back,25.0
and started to tumble the car,16.666666666666664
and she managed to get her window down,25.0
and get on top of the car,42.857142857142854
and waved to some people that were on the bank to call nineoneone and,42.857142857142854
a rescue crew came out,40.0
and she was able to well she got right as they got there the water got higher,35.294117647058826
and she got swept off the top of her car,60.0
and it was floating downstream,40.0
and they were able to shimmy out on a a limb,54.54545454545454
and she was able to get close enough to him,40.0
and they were able to grab her and pull her to safety,41.66666666666667
and she was okay,50.0
Bobby is home from school,40.0
and he decides to go out and play with his soccer ball,33.33333333333333

in fourth grade I was outside during recess in NewYork,50.0
and as you may or may not know they have we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city,50.0

and that was my first time having a cast,44.44444444444444
and got back to school and all my friends signed it,36.36363636363637

and the part that I didnt like so much was when it itched inside,53.333333333333336
and so I remember one time my mom used ke one of the straws from the broom to try and itch,28.57142857142857
and it broke in there,20.0
so then that was even more annoying because I couldnt get to to it,46.666666666666664

we had the completely different view of California,37.5
California was like this fantasy land youknow awesome place to be you can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody,47.368421052631575
so when we moved here or when we moved to California from NewYork I would sometimes walk home from the babysitters or what have you,48.0
and one time this man stopped,16.666666666666664
and he was like,75.0

the dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing and the crumbs all through the house,44.44444444444444
so when they got home the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with a broom,36.84210526315789
youre not gonna believe me,42.857142857142854
but anyway two weeks ago I was Saturday night two weeks ago on a Saturday evening about six pm I started feeling a stomach ache I thought or like a side stitch,28.125

I could feel it moving,60.0
it wasnt a muscle I could,71.42857142857143
Im Im much a sportsman enough to know that it wasnt a muscle,43.75
it wasnt a bone,60.0
something was really weird and it was moving,50.0
they were kidney stones eventually I found out,50.0
but I remember thinking,25.0
I dont have yet insurance here,28.57142857142857
and Ive just moved back,33.33333333333333
and I havent been to a hospital here in twenty years,50.0
this is going to be really horrible,42.857142857142854
and and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where throat I had a fever of a hundred and one or something and just was doubled over and couldnt even and couldnt even really stand as this thing was making its way down,40.816326530612244
so we went to the hospital,50.0
and the first thing I walked in and I said,30.0
Im sorry bring you a bad news,37.5
and the woman said,25.0
why,100.0
did my husband die,50.0
thats the receptionist,50.0
I said,50.0
thats a good joke,40.0
but anyway I dont have insurance,28.57142857142857
and she said,33.33333333333333
thats no problem,50.0
thats youre gonna get a come on in,54.54545454545454
and I remember thinking,25.0

three hours later after some medicine and vomiting atleast forty times because of the intense pain the most intense pain Ive ever had in my life,37.03703703703704
just imagine ke stones going through that little opening,22.22222222222222
sorry,0.0
and whew,0.0
suddenly and I was having to use a little strainer thing and seeing them come out,31.25
and oh,0.0
and then for about a day the blood and everything else,36.36363636363637
but I was amazed the body and how,50.0
and once and once they told me what it was I read a little bit about and realized its not such a simple thing and how often we dont realize it,50.0
so water,0.0
people drink colas and,0.0
coffees colas bubble gas drinks are the worst,25.0
and then red meat is another bad one because they dont end up being digested,43.75
so I learned,33.33333333333333
and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasnt even vomit I thought,40.0
my my throats going to come out because of the convulsions were so strong,50.0
and I just remember thinking,20.0
my wife and son are coming next week,25.0
and ohmygod here I am in the hospital,50.0
so I was really I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it,41.17647058823529
except for the first time in my life ever,55.55555555555556
not death but enough to the point where something seriously wrong here,33.33333333333333
that that was the point of my story,75.0
I Ive never had that,66.66666666666666
at forty eight years old Im too young for this,36.36363636363637
in nineteen ninety six I was living in Japan,44.44444444444444
and I was contacted by a local city,50.0
a city named Uwajima which is very near where my wifes traditional home town is in the mountains of a small village area,43.47826086956522
their local high school fishing cooperative ship kindof like the sail USA or go around the world,29.411764705882355
up the submarine came up,60.0
this went on for months,60.0
and the Japanese government demanded an apology,28.57142857142857
the US government didnt wanna apologize nor the xxx of the US Navy,35.714285714285715
at the end of the day they didnt know what to do,53.84615384615385
at the local government some friends of a friend of a friend of a friend found me and said,52.63157894736842
we are not able to communicate with them,50.0
can you please explain to me what the difference is to an American of Im sorry,64.70588235294117
what does excuse me mean,60.0
I am talking about having a meeting with the secretary of the Japanese selfdefense,57.14285714285714
so kindof a secretary of defense who I would never normally meet,41.66666666666667
and the mayor two congress people or parliament members,11.11111111111111
sorry,0.0
and about forty very very very pissed off Japanese parents who had lost children wanting demanding to understand what the English concept or the western concept was Im sorry,26.666666666666668
I hadta prepare a presentation for this,57.14285714285714
and then I thought,25.0
how am I going to explain what is Im sorry,54.54545454545454
its like movies and songs we use this so often,30.0
yet it it has very very traditional deep meanings and depending on the level of the insult sh perceived or injury perceived or not there are different ways to apologize in Japanese and all cultures,25.71428571428571
as we we have levels of formality,57.14285714285714
anyway my next job was then I was to go to the US Navy representative through the US Embassy to ask could they apologize,41.66666666666667
Im not a diplomat and I dont pretend to be,41.66666666666667
but I was also in the US Navy,50.0
so one thing led to another and I met with the people,41.66666666666667
I was flown over to Hawaii with several of these Japanese to act as an intermediary watching these two groups try to communicate over a week period over something that was just the most absolutely dreadful topic for them,48.717948717948715
dead school children,0.0
clearly a mistake by one an accident,42.857142857142854
and how do you get beyond it,71.42857142857143
all they wouldve been happy with if that captain of the US Navy had l if the US Navy had allowed the captain to do what he wanted,55.172413793103445
he wanted to apologize but he was not allowed,33.33333333333333
he was prohibited,66.66666666666666
US government policy,0.0
thats fine,33.33333333333333
but because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing the communication never developed,43.47826086956522
two years after the man was fired,42.857142857142854
the captain,50.0
he came back to that area by himself his wife and his children and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the US government even more angry,44.827586206896555
so I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends the Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends but what was caught in the middle were some families and a truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble,34.0

when my wife was seven months pregnant we got news from her family that her mother inlaw was dying of intestinal cancer,45.45454545454545
we were living away from them at the time,66.66666666666666
we were living in Japan,60.0
excuse me,50.0
we were living in Germany but they were back home in Japan,50.0
the my wifes pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy,41.17647058823529
and it was her first child,50.0
so I hadta go back to represent her in the Japanese mind anyway for my wife and I to see the mother inlaw,34.78260869565217
in a period of three months I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about,40.909090909090914
the biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die,43.333333333333336
I talked to the doctor,60.0
but the father didnt know,33.33333333333333
they kept that information from the father,57.14285714285714
they didnt wanna tell him,50.0
Ive never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying,32.142857142857146
the mother didnt know she was dying,50.0
so I was afraid that my wife couldnt get home,45.45454545454545
the sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary,50.0
and I will never be able to answer that question of what if,53.84615384615385
so that to me is a scared situation that I clearly remember,66.66666666666666
okay,0.0

just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour,37.03703703703704
and the boy was running back home to get his umbrella,27.27272727272727
when he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him,52.94117647058824
I told you,66.66666666666666
and he then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school,38.46153846153847
nothing that any other boy probably hadnt done in their life,50.0
the young boys in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window,39.705882352941174
well in the tradition of good old story books once upon a time there was a huh what landowner well well endowed family who adopted a little girl,35.714285714285715
the little girl came into a family in which the mother and the two sisters the two daughters pardon me did not really appreciate having her around,40.74074074074074
and as she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse,29.03225806451613
but she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself,48.0
throat one day after,25.0
excuse me,50.0
the in the in the castle there was a prince and a king,61.53846153846154
and the king was adamant that his son get married and had been insisting and insisting,43.75
and in order to help the son decide who might be a f an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a dance,51.724137931034484
invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom,57.14285714285714
one day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that I mentioned,50.0
and the mother and the evil sisters were all happy to realize and think,21.428571428571427
heres our chance,33.33333333333333
one of us we can get married to this handsome prince,54.54545454545454
and so they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would go to the party,40.909090909090914
and meanwhile Cinderella had been listening and thinking,25.0
oh thats too bad,20.0
she was very sad about herself,66.66666666666666
but and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book,45.0
and throat one thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help Cinderella realize her dreams,29.166666666666668
she tried to create a dress and give hope to Cinderella that she too could have a better life,36.84210526315789
unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what Cinderella had been hoping,42.10526315789473
and they ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others,50.0
so Cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made Cinderella to be a very very attractive woman,30.952380952380953
on the eve of the on the night of the dance Cinderella attended the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person,56.52173913043478
noone could recognize that it was Cinderella because indeed she had changed so much,50.0
however the fairy godmother had reminded Cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because thats when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be revert to their original shape or character,45.45454545454545
so at the stroke of midnight Cillarella,42.857142857142854
he then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman mystery woman,38.095238095238095
he carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom,52.94117647058824
when he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where Cinderella lived he ofcourse wanted to have everyone try it on,48.0
and ofcourse the mother tried but it didnt fit,30.0
and the sisters tried and the shoe didnt fit,30.0
and Cinderella tried and it fit,16.666666666666664
and from then on love took over,42.857142857142854
and they lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
yesterday I was watching the news when I saw this crazy story,50.0

so he took the ladder out,50.0
and the daughter was very happy that they were gonna be able to save the cat,41.17647058823529
but once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down,46.15384615384615
and the girl started panicking,20.0
so she ran and called her mother,28.57142857142857
and the mother called the fire department,28.57142857142857
and the fire department came to help him down,33.33333333333333
well its birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old,33.33333333333333
and maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite outof cake which he obviously knew he wasnt sposta do because hes hiding under the couch,45.45454545454545
and the boys crying,25.0
and the mother is waving the broom threateningly,37.5
and the guests are looking alittle startled,28.57142857142857
and thats the end of that,57.14285714285714
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich,16.666666666666664
get hafta get two pieces of bread,14.285714285714285
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top,33.33333333333333
and put them together,25.0
well this is fairly minor but many years ago I was when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was cleaning a glass,46.42857142857143
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand,53.84615384615385
and it it started to bleed all over the place,40.0
but I was also pregnant at the time,50.0
and I dont know if that had something to do with it,53.84615384615385
but I had this weirdest feeling,33.33333333333333
and my husband came in and I just passed out,40.0
it was the first and last and only time Ive ever done that,42.857142857142854
I guess the most the time the most of the instances Ive had with people that have trouble communicating its usually more of a language barrier,48.148148148148145
I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man who had a stutter,47.05882352941176
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too,40.0
but youknow I found it so hard to to talk to him that I tended to avoid him in a way,42.857142857142854
so I cant say that I really otherthan saying hi Julio how are you I never really went much beyond that,45.45454545454545
and plus at the time I couldnt excuse me I couldnt hear well,46.666666666666664
so I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway,30.0
so,0.0
thats about it,75.0
one time I was just moseying down the street in a car and was preparing to turn left,38.88888888888889
and I thought I had my signal on,50.0
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough,58.82352941176471
but then somebody else who I dont even know where he came from I think he was walking outof the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done,54.054054054054056
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something,50.0
thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didnt youknow wasnt upset,43.75
he just said,33.33333333333333
oh I ran into you,60.0
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness,36.36363636363637
oh apparently this girl has fallen into some water thats maybe theres a flood or a storm,42.10526315789473
and a man is trying to rescue her,37.5
apparently shes been holding onto a tree branch,55.55555555555556
and hes trying to get a hold of her,50.0
but she wont let go of the tree branch probably,36.36363636363637
about all I can say,80.0
well hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window,42.10526315789473
its really improbable,33.33333333333333
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp,38.46153846153847
but obviously the boy has ran away because the man cant see him when he goes in at the window,52.38095238095239
this is kindof improbable too,40.0
the mother wants to give the the boy an an umbrella,45.45454545454545
he doesnt want it,60.0
so he goes off and gets wet,28.57142857142857
this is the improbable part,60.0
he doesnt like getting wet,33.33333333333333
he runs back to his mom whos mad,44.44444444444444
and hes wet so he takes the umbrella,33.33333333333333
now my son would love getting wet,28.57142857142857
looking at that I can hear the music from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old,50.0
Cinderella is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother,41.66666666666667
wicked and stepmother always go together,0.0
she has two ugly st two ugly stepsisters,12.5
I cant remember their names,50.0
one of them is Drizella or something equally ugly,44.44444444444444
anyway Cinderella is forced forced to work like a drudge for the the rest of the family who are cruel to her,54.54545454545454
but an edict comes from the,50.0
I think Im spinning tales here,42.857142857142854
an edict comes from the prince that theyre going to have a ball,50.0
and every maiden is eligible to go to the ball,40.0
but Cinderellas mother stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready,34.375
and at last the girls drive away in their carriage and Cinderellas left behind crying in the cinders,33.33333333333333
then the little mice come to her aid and start,30.0
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working,64.28571428571429
and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because yeah they didnt want her to go,42.10526315789473
so then the fairy godmother enters the picture,25.0
this is not in sequence at all,42.857142857142854
and ofcourse she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the the pumpkin carriage,30.0
oh yeah,0.0
and she goes off to the ball where ofcourse she is the bell of the ball meets the prince,57.89473684210527
the prince falls in love with her on sight,55.55555555555556
but at twelve oclock she hasta run off,37.5
she leaves her slipper,50.0
I guess that story goes all the way to the end,54.54545454545454
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper,47.82608695652174
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they dont fit,21.428571428571427
so he find m,25.0
heres one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree,50.0
and then this the the father has climbed up to rescue the cat,46.15384615384615
and now he needs to be rescued,28.57142857142857
for some reason the ladder is on the ground,66.66666666666666
and nobody has put it up there,42.857142857142854
so here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad,28.57142857142857
thats all,66.66666666666666
yeah well get your slice of bread whether wheat or white,27.27272727272727
what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first,36.36363636363637
get a knife,33.33333333333333
take it outof open up the jar,42.857142857142854
put the knife into the peanut butter,42.857142857142854
take out a take out a scoops,57.14285714285714
spread it over the bread,60.0
and then I open up a,50.0
and I usually use a spoon for that,50.0
put that on the other slice of bread,50.0
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter,40.0
spread it over the bread,60.0
and put the two slices together,16.666666666666664
a little girl was riding through the neighborhood on her bike,54.54545454545454
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree,54.54545454545454
her father came along,50.0
and said,0.0
what is it dear,75.0
she says,50.0
Dad my cats in the tree,50.0
well I can get the cat out,57.14285714285714
let me go get my ladder,33.33333333333333
father went and got the ladder,16.666666666666664
climbed up the tree,50.0
and then a neighborhood dog came by,28.57142857142857
and noticed a man up in a tree,50.0
and started barking at the man up the tree,44.44444444444444
and accidentally knocked down the ladder,33.33333333333333
so the man was stuck in the ladder along with the cat,58.333333333333336
and the fire department hadta be called to rescue them both,36.36363636363637
it was about I guess about seven years ago I really hurt my back,35.714285714285715
theres this family that I go and visit that has a little child,42.857142857142854
and from the time that child was born as a little boy I always picked him up and swung him around,47.61904761904761
but as this boy was getting older as I was getting older I I guess I cant do some of the things that that I normally do,57.14285714285714
this particular time I picked the boy up,37.5
and I was swinging him around,50.0
swinging picking him up by the arms,57.14285714285714
and I spread my legs wide open,28.57142857142857
and I was swinging him backwards and forwards,37.5
and I felt something snap in my back,50.0
I was in excruciating pain,60.0
I almost dropped the kid,40.0
I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids,63.1578947368421
but this was pain like I have never felt before,60.0
because even just to walk or or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms its all tied into the back,35.714285714285715
it would be like a knife was twisting so,66.66666666666666
thats thats the injury,50.0
and it put me outof commission for a couple of weeks,45.45454545454545
and the thing that comes to the to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating with someone else,58.333333333333336
its the family that I described earlier with a child,60.0
theyre Hispanic,33.33333333333333
and their English is not very good,28.57142857142857
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school,38.46153846153847
but whenever oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want,50.0
I help them with their homework,66.66666666666666
my wife she speaks Spanish,40.0
so its alright when she goes over there,37.5
but when it comes to me trying to convey my thoughts,45.45454545454545
and trying to convey my wants and desires,12.5
and also me trying to listen to theirs,37.5
I dont always understand what theyre talking about,60.0
or and then and they dont understand what Im talking about,46.15384615384615
yeah in high school a friend of mine myself and a friend of mine we ditched class sothat we could climb CamelbackMountain,45.45454545454545
neither one of us had ever climbed CamelbackMountain,37.5
so we didnt realize exactly youknow where to go or where to start,28.57142857142857
we just picked a spot on the northern side of the mountain,50.0
youknow walked in between some of those very expensive homes,50.0
and started climbing,0.0
little did we know we really had gotten ourselves in in alotof trouble doing that,53.333333333333336
there were times where we were actually hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs youknow just to just to get from one point to another,37.03703703703704
about halfway up were sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot,47.05882352941176
and I said to him I says,57.14285714285714
man theres no way we can go back the same way we came,42.857142857142854
and he says,33.33333333333333
I know,50.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
Im serious,33.33333333333333
he goes,50.0
so am I,66.66666666666666
and so we knew the only way the only thing we we figured what we hadta do is make it to the top,47.82608695652174
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side,50.0
but then we would still hafta hike all the way back around the mountain to get to our car,42.10526315789473
to make a long story short,16.666666666666664
youknow we were all scuffed scuffed up,42.857142857142854
we were tired scratched up lor clothes torn,37.5
but we could finally see we were kindof getting to the top,58.333333333333336
as we were approaching the top we saw more people up there,41.66666666666667
and older people younger people,0.0
we couldnt believe it that youknow these people all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time,60.0
so when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we we asked them,63.1578947368421
howd you get up here,50.0
they said,50.0
oh we took this trail youknow down here on the other side,33.33333333333333
and we couldnt believe that there was a trail,50.0
so after that experience youknow I thank God for helping us through it,53.84615384615385
because it it really it really made me understand why people hadta be rescued from CamelbackMountain,50.0
and I understand how people can get stuck,50.0
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges,36.36363636363637
but prior to that experience I I I couldnt understand how could people get to a certain place and not get back down the same way,44.44444444444444
a couple decided they would go white water rafting,33.33333333333333
and so they were white water rafting,28.57142857142857
the man told his girlfriend to put on her vest,40.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
I can swim,66.66666666666666
I dont needta put on a vest,50.0
and he goes,33.33333333333333
well Im gonna put mine on because I think thats just a safe thing to do,42.10526315789473
so as theyre white water rafting the further down they got the rougher the water became,35.294117647058826
and as as they continued to go down the water got so rough that her life vest her life vest fell outof the boat,37.5
and seconds later the boat tipped over,28.57142857142857
so both of them are are are are in the water with the rapids in the in the rapids hitting rocks with the heavy flow of the stream going going by them,65.625
fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to to stay afloat and last long enough to to float to the edge and grab a branch,32.142857142857146
his girlfriend was coming quickly behind him,57.14285714285714
and as hes hanging onto the branch hes reaching for her,69.23076923076923
early one morning its time for little Johnny to go to school,25.0
little Johnnys about to walk out the door,37.5
but mom stops him,25.0
and says,0.0
Johnny you better take this umbrella with you because I heard the forecast,53.84615384615385
and I think its gonna rain,28.57142857142857
Johnny says,0.0
oh Mom,0.0
I dont need an umbrella,50.0
umbrellas are for sissies,50.0
and besides a little bit of rain isnt going to hurt me,38.46153846153847
she says,50.0
I think you should take it,66.66666666666666
no I dont need it,50.0
Ill see you later Mom,20.0
so as Johnny is walking to school it starts to rain,36.36363636363637
at first a little bit and then harder and harder,20.0
and as Johnny is walking hes putting his hands over his head trying to stop all the wetness from falling on his face,50.0
and hes hating himself for not having to for not having to get that umbrella,37.5
so he races back home youknow he races back home,20.0
and when his mom opens the door hes soaking wet,45.45454545454545
and his mom looks at him disappointedly,42.857142857142854
and said,0.0
see youre all wet because you didnt take the umbrella,41.66666666666667
maybe next time youll listen to me,50.0
so Johnny took the umbrella,20.0
and went outside while it was still raining,37.5
and this time he used it,50.0
and he figured,33.33333333333333
hey I guess umbrellas arent for sissies after all,30.0
Bobby loves to play soccer,0.0
he loves playing soccer so much he can even play by himself,41.66666666666667
he was outside in his front yard one day just practicing kicking the ball,35.714285714285715
he kicked it so hard boomo,33.33333333333333
it went right through his neighbors window,42.857142857142854
and when it went through the window it went right into the neighbors living room,46.666666666666664
knocked over a lamp close to where a man was sitting,54.54545454545454
it startled the man,50.0
the man picked up the ball,50.0
and looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from,42.857142857142854
okay,0.0

and so everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball,50.0
and and so was Cinderella,20.0
she thought she would be going too,57.14285714285714
Cinderella went into a bed i while she was cleaning she went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress,50.0

but I dont have any shoes,42.857142857142854
she may waved her magic wand again and and there was some glass slippers for her,43.75

so now she was truly a beautiful a beautiful beautiful young lady,33.33333333333333
so they walked outside,25.0

theyre your friends,50.0
tell them to come over here,16.666666666666664

and the pumpkin turned into a carriage,42.857142857142854
and the mice turned into horses,33.33333333333333
and the dog turned into a chauffeur,42.857142857142854
so they all or so so Cinderella now was able to go to the ball,33.33333333333333
she got into the carriage,60.0
and off to the ball they went,57.14285714285714
when Cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty,55.55555555555556
they couldnt believe how incredible she looked,50.0
ah but she tried to remember as much fun as Cinderella was having she tried to remember one thing that her fairy godmother had told her,30.76923076923077
she says she needed to be back by midnight,44.44444444444444

and so they all moved in together,28.57142857142857
and then the father died,20.0

and since Cinderella was prettier than the other two stepsisters the mother didnt want her to go,38.88888888888889
because she wanted one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince,35.714285714285715

and they went to the ball,50.0

and then Cinderella was crying,20.0
and then she then the fairy godmother came,25.0

and turned a pumpkin into a coach,42.857142857142854
turned mice into white horses,20.0
and the dog into a coachman,50.0
and and so she was able to go to the ball,36.36363636363637

and she lost one of the glass slippers,37.5
clicks and she ran and ran and got back in the coach,25.0
and they started going down the road,42.857142857142854
and then every ding when the clock struck twelve turned back to the way it was,43.75
and she was very sad but she had a good time,36.36363636363637
and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers,41.66666666666667
and so clicks she went home,16.666666666666664
and then the next day,20.0
and the prince really liked her so,28.57142857142857
and he had this glass slipper so,28.57142857142857
so he sent out a decree to find this woman with the glass slipper,42.857142857142854
and so they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyones foot,41.17647058823529
and it wouldnt fit anybody,50.0
and he finally came to Cinderellas house,28.57142857142857
and they tried the slippers on the stepsisters and and it wouldnt fit,42.857142857142854
and then n they were gonna try it on Cinderella,36.36363636363637
and the stepmother tripped the the the little guy with the slipper,50.0
and and he tripped and fell and broke the slipper,20.0
and so the stepmother was like,50.0
oh well the slippers broken,20.0
and you cant try it on Cinderella,50.0
and then Cinderella said,0.0
but I have the other slipper,33.33333333333333

and they were happy and got married and lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
a little girl has taken her not neccesarily taken but a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree,48.275862068965516
and the apparently a man has brought has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder,41.17647058823529
and hes attempted to get the cat down,33.33333333333333
and he himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down,43.75
a dog may well have accompanied him,57.14285714285714
there was a dog there,40.0
and the fire department has also arrived with their ladder,40.0
and they are approaching the scene,50.0
and they are certainly going to get the cat down and well along with the man more than likely,36.84210526315789
and everything will be just fine,50.0
the first step is to assemble the items you need,40.0
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread,25.0
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread,41.17647058823529
and you would how I would go about doing it I was I would put spread jelly on on one slice of bread,60.86956521739131
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread,45.45454545454545
and I would put the two of them together,55.55555555555556
and then eat the sandwich,20.0
my recollection I havent ever been seriously injured but one of the the typical but more unusual things Ive encountered would be chicken pox,42.30769230769231
not that thats unusual but for me a seriousness,50.0
and I dont recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that,40.909090909090914
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience,50.0
not excruciating pain but but quite a bit of c discomforts,27.27272727272727
ERROR,0.0
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didnt obey mothers advice fully of not picking at the scabs,45.83333333333333
so thats my recollection of chicken pox,37.5
the person who Ive had the most difficulty communicating with was my father,57.14285714285714
and I in part due to he suffered from a some type of ataxia,64.28571428571429
and and he was well I was I was born when he was in his forties so Imean he was by the time I was he was quite elderly by the time not quite elderly but up there in years by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so,54.0
but he in part I he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of his failing his failing ability to walk adequately and,44.0
but he was very very little bit short tempered Id say,16.666666666666664
and just wanting he badly wanted to do things himself,20.0
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind of thing,36.36363636363637
but he couldnt do it,50.0
so hed ask for help,33.33333333333333
and then youd try to help,14.285714285714285
and he would put his hands in the in the project,63.63636363636363
and it was just more trouble,33.33333333333333
and when you tried to say youknow,28.57142857142857
I hafta do this myself,60.0
he would get frustrated,50.0
and it was just very difficult time trying to communicate that we both cant do this,41.17647058823529
so and just just an overall difficulty,14.285714285714285
occasionally it would brew into an argument,57.14285714285714
and there would be some walking away because its either you do this or I do this,58.82352941176471
and we both cant do this,57.14285714285714
and youknow I know youd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but,33.33333333333333
its you you just try to remain calm,37.5
and and just explain the situation as best you can,30.0
and and try to resolve it,16.666666666666664
and ofcourse there were good days and bad days,11.11111111111111
youknow days where hed be more tolerant of of that kind of thing,57.14285714285714
but but just it was more of a communication issue that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do,37.5
so eventhough he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied assistance because it was more,47.05882352941176
I wanna be able to do this,42.857142857142854
so,0.0

so you have it it splits into a wide fork,50.0
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel,40.0
well we didnt look at the map adequately,44.44444444444444
and we got in there,20.0

and happened to be turning around it in circles,44.44444444444444
and the flashlights were going dim,33.33333333333333
and by that time the other people who had visited had left,50.0
so we were in there alone,33.33333333333333
and at that point going in circles in the dark or the dim lights,42.857142857142854
youre kindof like youknow how do you get outof this place,50.0
and it became quite quite fearful,16.666666666666664
not I wouldnt say terror but the the belief that maybe well be spending the night in here,42.10526315789473
and obviously its youknow you dont think youre gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes,47.61904761904761
but its certainly you dont have food you dont have,41.66666666666667
so,0.0
I cannot be certain of what happened,62.5
this is a photograph,75.0
but clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water,41.66666666666667
it may be a creek a stream a river or just an extreme extreme area flood,43.75
but thats really irrelevant,20.0
she is in trouble,75.0
and someone has either noticed a passerby or has,33.33333333333333
or she alerted somebody that of her her situation,66.66666666666666
and the authorities were alerted because it appears that a a professional is attempting to rescue her,52.94117647058824
he has on rescue equipment,40.0
and I really cannot give an end to the story because I dont know what the outcome of the situation was,56.52173913043478
I assume she was saved,60.0
but theres no telling based on this photograph,44.44444444444444
there is a boy and a young boy,37.5
hes outside,33.33333333333333
and hes kicking about a soccer ball,50.0
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house,46.15384615384615
shatters a window,33.33333333333333
lands inside,50.0
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it,60.0
he is quite startled,50.0
we then see him with the ball in his hand,60.0
hes looking out the broken window,57.14285714285714
he I cant tell that hes glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption,66.66666666666666
and hes certainly not happy,16.666666666666664
Im not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother removed it from his hand,40.909090909090914
and he is still asking for it,57.14285714285714
and she is reluctant to give it to him,55.55555555555556
hes then outside with,40.0
well he has a backpack on so I assume hes headed off to school but not necessarily,44.44444444444444
and hes outside,25.0
and hes walking,50.0
and he sees raindrops falling,20.0
and the rain picks up,40.0
and he is getting soaked,60.0
and it appears hes turned around,57.14285714285714
and hes returned home,40.0
his mother is looking at his his drenched body,55.55555555555556
and then he was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain,48.275862068965516
okay the story of Cinderella,40.0
well Cinderella is shes one of three sisters,33.33333333333333
and two of them are rather in modern terms stuck up,36.36363636363637
and and well theyre high on themselves,37.5
and they their mother is somewhat the same way,44.44444444444444
and she as the story progresses there is a one of the wealthy gentleman,50.0
the uppity ups in in the area,57.14285714285714
he is trying to I believe marry off his son,50.0
and there is a ball being held,42.857142857142854
and Cinderella is not invited because she she has been rather outcast by the family as just the the servant girl,52.38095238095239
and and shes to wait on everybody else,33.33333333333333
so shes rather lower class in the family,33.33333333333333
and it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the the ability to go to the ball I suppose youd say,44.0
and she goes there in this fancy fancy vehicle,33.33333333333333
and shes shes wearing glass slippers,37.5
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the son of the the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son,50.0
so shes shes dancing with the son and it it turns out that the son is is rather enamored by her,60.86956521739131
so but the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by I believe it was midnight something,52.17391304347826
or else she turns into a pumpkin something like that,60.0
Im not exactly sure what the the gist of it was,58.333333333333336
but regardless she it gets close to midnight,37.5
she realizes this,66.66666666666666
and she darts off,50.0
and leaves the the prince or the son of the wealthy landowner whoever he was kindof depressed that she hadta leave early,45.45454545454545
and she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers,25.0
and these glass slippers are magical,33.33333333333333
and then she the prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her her foot,47.61904761904761
so and then hes again youknow theyre together again,18.181818181818183
and hes happy to have found her,37.5
and the the other sisters are who had planned on one of them getting the the guy theyre kindof left in the dark,58.333333333333336
and and everyone kindof gets their their comeuppance,37.5
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after,22.22222222222222
well you go to the cabinet,50.0
get the peanut butter and the jelly,28.57142857142857
the jellys usually in the refrigerator,50.0
and a slice of bread,40.0
and put the jelly and the peanut butter on the bread,36.36363636363637
and fold it over,50.0
and eat it,33.33333333333333
the cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog,61.53846153846154
and the dad said,25.0
well,0.0
to the little girl because she was crying her cat was out in the tree,66.66666666666666
I will get the cat down for you,75.0
so the dad got up on the ladder to get up get up the tree to get the cat,42.10526315789473
but the ladder fell down,40.0
and so here the dog the dog is barking at the tree to get the cat,37.5
the dad is caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down,56.25
so the police the firemen have been called,50.0
and theyre coming in to bring another ladder to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy,34.78260869565217
and there is a bird singing in the tree,44.44444444444444
so the bird is happy,40.0
so it all ends when the firemen get the dad and the cat down,42.857142857142854
okay I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had GuillainBarre syndrome,44.44444444444444
and thats a type of paralyzing,42.857142857142854
its kindof its I think it was called French polio because the men were from France,56.25
and I was on a vacation out over in SanDiego with friends,58.333333333333336
and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet,36.36363636363637
and I was stumbling,50.0
I was having a hard time walking,42.857142857142854
and I knew something was wrong,50.0
and I just I really kindof thought it was fate,50.0
I thought maybe Id a brain tumor or something really pretty serious,30.76923076923077
but my daughter was with me,66.66666666666666
and we had planned on going to UniversalStudios,50.0
and I wasnt in pain,50.0
so but I was just having a hard time walking,30.0
GuillainBarre starts at your fingers and toes,28.57142857142857
and then works works in,20.0
so I cant I can remember this going to UniversalStudios in a wheelchair,57.14285714285714
so by that evening by the time we all go back to our hotel I was really quite concerned,52.63157894736842
I did sleep,66.66666666666666
and the next morning they took me to ScrippsMedicalCenter in the SanDiego area,46.15384615384615
and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because GuillainBarre affects its its a autoimmune disease,40.0
and he asked me if I had had the flu recently,54.54545454545454
and I had,33.33333333333333
and so the the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system,38.46153846153847
and this was what was happening,66.66666666666666
so they told first they wanted to admit me to the hospital,41.66666666666667
and I said,33.33333333333333
no way,50.0
I I was going back ta,66.66666666666666
oh and they did r they asked me to ke shuffle a deck of cards,33.33333333333333
I couldnt do that,60.0
and snap,0.0
I couldnt do that,60.0
so got back in the car with my friends,44.44444444444444
and my daughter was with us,66.66666666666666
and he said,33.33333333333333
if you have trouble breathing,40.0
because it can go all the way in,75.0
its youknow affects your s affects your muscles,37.5
to find the nearest hospital,20.0
but I got back home,20.0
and it took me about oh six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery,47.368421052631575
for about six weeks I couldnt drive the car,40.0
I couldnt I could feed myself but I couldnt cut,58.333333333333336
I could shower but I couldnt,57.14285714285714
I had no strength in my hands or my feet,50.0
I couldnt stand on my toes,57.14285714285714
any of that kind of thing,66.66666666666666
so then I started it wherever it goes youknow,44.44444444444444
and then it stops and its just your body stops starts healing again,23.076923076923077
then it was a slow recovery,50.0
I would start walking just out around the block a little bit,41.66666666666667
but I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister,50.0
she was living with us at the time,75.0
and I just felt like an old lady,37.5
and this was over twenty years ago,28.57142857142857
so I was in my forties,66.66666666666666
and I was just holding,40.0
and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over,60.0
but it I recovered,50.0
I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands,40.0
I I can occasionally have a hand tremor,50.0
but I feel like Im ninety nine percent better,30.0
so that was it,75.0
yeah,0.0
oh yes,0.0
well okay,0.0
my mother who I lost about a year and a half ago had Alzheimers,35.714285714285715
so we went through this process,50.0
and she was oh about eighty when we first,44.44444444444444
and it was kindof interesting,40.0
my daughter,50.0
like I said my kids come just every other year for Christmas,33.33333333333333
and my daughter from California was home,42.857142857142854
and within two hours,25.0
they were all at my house,66.66666666666666
Susie came up to me and said,42.857142857142854
Mother something is wrong with Grandma,50.0
and we had noticed a little bit,42.857142857142854
but it it just got worse and worse,25.0
and then then my mom and dad were in assisted living out in FountainHills,35.714285714285715
then we lost dad,25.0
so we put mom into a a nursing home up in Flagstaff where my sister lives,43.75
and she was up there for four years,37.5
and at first she could talk,50.0
she went through all the different stations ay stations of youknow aggression and meanness,35.714285714285715
and she would call me or dad would actually because she couldnt really dial,46.666666666666664
but dad would call,25.0
and shed grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes,40.0
and she was much thinner than I was so,55.55555555555556
or taking money,0.0
dad would call and hiding in the garage and this mother whos k maybe a hundred and ten pounds at the most youknow,33.33333333333333
he was kindof frightened of her because she got really mean,63.63636363636363
but then she got back into a very calm state,30.0
and slowly began to really make no sense whatsoever,11.11111111111111
but Ive I learned,60.0
and and Dad and I went to a Alzheimers support group which really really helped us,31.25
especially dad,0.0
and because my mom had done everything,57.14285714285714
Imean she had been the one to do all the shopping send out the cards,53.333333333333336
and I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards,37.5
but finally there was a point where when dad died that she needed full care,40.0
so and the last six months she she couldnt talk or do anything,35.714285714285715
and she broke her hip had a fall,50.0
and the saddest thing was that up until the last year she was very physically very healthy,41.17647058823529
so she died at age eighty seven,28.57142857142857
ERROR,0.0

xxx,0.0

I was in an earthquake in California,71.42857142857143
and one of the major ones,33.33333333333333
this was in the fifties,80.0
and it was it it was we were visiting my dads aunt or my dads sister my aunt out in California,57.14285714285714
and it happened in the middle of the night,55.55555555555556

and there was an extra out that day on the earthquake,45.45454545454545
so it was it was alittle frightening at the time because you just dont know whats going on,60.0

okay this is the story of Cinderella,57.14285714285714
and Cinderella lost her mother,20.0
and her father married a new person a a woman,40.0
a and so Cinderella had a stepmother,14.285714285714285
but the stepmother also had two girls,14.285714285714285
so they came in and were living with Cinderella,44.44444444444444
the father didnt realize this but the stepmother was really treating Cinderella mean,35.714285714285715
and he she had her cleaning and washing while her daughters were being treated very very nicely,41.17647058823529
and Cinderella felt very sad,0.0

and Cinderella wanted to go,0.0
but the stepmother said,25.0
no way,50.0
you dont have the right kind of clothes,44.44444444444444
your hair isnt done right,33.33333333333333
none of that,66.66666666666666
so the the stepsisters were getting ready,42.857142857142854
and Cinderella was very very sad,16.666666666666664
and the book talks about her going up in the attic or down in the basement finding this chest with a book,50.0
this part I dont know but anyway,37.5
she calls on a fairy godmother to come and and help her,33.33333333333333

does up her hair,25.0
and she has a coach,40.0
and off she goes to the ball,42.857142857142854
but she is being told that everything is going to go back to the way it was at the stroke of midnight,59.09090909090909
so her coachmen are going to turn into mice,33.33333333333333
and her coach is going to turn into a pumpkin,40.0
but off she goes,25.0
and she dances with the prince,50.0
and she falls in love with him,57.14285714285714
but then she hears the clock stuhtriking,28.57142857142857
and she knows that this is all going to just collapse,45.45454545454545
so off she goes running down the stairs out to the coach,58.333333333333336
and about that time it ri the clock strikes midnight,40.0
and shes back to her ragged clothes,37.5
but she has lost one of her slippers on the stairway as she ran down from the castle,61.111111111111114

and he says whoever can fit into this slipper will be my new princess,57.14285714285714

but Cinderella tries on the shoe,33.33333333333333
and it fits perfect,25.0
so the prince knows that this is his princess,55.55555555555556
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
the end,50.0
pretty easy,0.0
well you get the ingredients out,50.0
you get the the bread that youd wanna use,40.0
I would first take a paper plate and put the two slices of bread on the plate,41.17647058823529
and then either before or after Id go get the jelly and the peanut butter,18.75
and if they were already open theyd probably be in the refrigerator,53.84615384615385
and then I would take two knives because I dont wanna adulterate one or the other,35.294117647058826
and I would I would probably put the butter on first,54.54545454545454
and I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly,35.294117647058826
and I would the put the butter on the one side,54.54545454545454
probably the right side just because its thats where its at in my mind,60.0
and I would put it on evenly,57.14285714285714
but I would put it on very over the whole area,54.54545454545454
not this area because I hate that,57.14285714285714
an,100.0
Id probably use alittle less jelly than the the peanut butter because Id rather have more peanut butter,30.0
and then I would put the two I would probably take the in the left hand take the one with the jelly and put it over the one with the peanut butter,50.0
so the two surfaces that have stuff on it face each other,41.66666666666667
and I would put them so the top of the loaf is where the youknow the top of the piece is where it has a symmetrical,65.38461538461539
and then I would cut it in half probably this way ri horizontally,46.15384615384615
and then I would know what Id eat it,50.0
I dont know if you wanna know that so,50.0
and at some point Id probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife wouldnt yell at me,58.333333333333336
looks like there is a kitty got up into the branch of a tree,57.14285714285714
and it looks like the father climbed up on the tree with a ladder,57.14285714285714
and somehow the ladder fell down,33.33333333333333
and the father is stuck in the tree,50.0
theres a girl up there reaching up for probably her cat,41.66666666666667
and theres a tricycle next to her,50.0
and theres a ladder there thats quite a ways from the tree,50.0
so I dont understand how it got that far away,45.45454545454545
but maybe it tipped over backwards,33.33333333333333
and then theres a dog probably their dog barking up the tree,38.46153846153847
and youknow why I have no idea what dogs do,40.0
and then theres a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree,47.05882352941176
and then smack evidently somebody called a fire department,22.22222222222222
and theres a firetruck,40.0
and theres a couple fireman carrying a ladder towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there,52.38095238095239
but maybe its not a good enough one,25.0
and thats pretty much it,33.33333333333333
so evidently the father climbed up the tree to get the cat out,38.46153846153847
and for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down,43.75
and somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the fire department,30.0
and theyre responding,50.0
an,100.0
looks like its low enough he can just jump down so,45.45454545454545
the thing was is that I never had a heart attack,54.54545454545454
and otherthan having a very little chest pain,12.5
it was kindof somewhat of a surprise so,62.5
I had went and had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician,41.66666666666667
and he said that was alright,50.0
which they dont show anything,66.66666666666666
so now he suggested a stress echo,28.57142857142857
so I I had a stress echo,42.857142857142854
and I went to it,60.0
and and I failed it,40.0
youknow I was kindof shocked,40.0
and I was gonna do things afterwards,25.0
and I just called my wife,33.33333333333333
and and talked to her,40.0
and then I went home,20.0
and smack and then they did a cardiac catharization,22.22222222222222
smack and between the first day and the second day they gave me nitroglycerine,35.714285714285715
and then I just didnt do anything because I didnt wanna have a heart attack,41.17647058823529
and I had a cardiac catharization,33.33333333333333
and I didnt know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was older and past his prime wouldnt have done anything if if if,60.71428571428571
and he wouldnt even put it in a stent,50.0
because which I wouldnt have used him if I would have known that,78.57142857142857
make a long story short I had three main,22.22222222222222
one was blocked a hundred percent,33.33333333333333
one was blocked ninety eight percent,16.666666666666664
and one was blocked eighty percent,16.666666666666664
so I was very fortunate that I didnt either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that,43.47826086956522
and I had surgery,25.0
and I had surgery by a a cardiac surgeon that was considered by the nurses and people in general one of the better ones,45.83333333333333
I went to ScottsdaleHealthcareOsborn,50.0
and before I went I called and asked them how many procedures they did the previous year,41.17647058823529
and based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance you had a better success,52.63157894736842
so they were even better than at Mayo,50.0
at the time Mayo was at Scottsdale Shea,50.0
and it was like oh three or four hours there,20.0
I to this day I dont know because what my wife told me and what she now says is different,57.14285714285714
so it doesnt matter,40.0
smack and when I got done,50.0
its its very intrusive,50.0
you dont know what the,66.66666666666666
and they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked really bad,47.368421052631575
but I was calm,50.0
and well my brother just had it a couple weeks ago,36.36363636363637
and his wife said he didnt look that bad,30.0
so I dont know what that means,50.0
well smack when I saw my mob,42.857142857142854
but she did r she recovered very rapidly,25.0
and shes still alive,20.0
and thats about fifteen years ago,14.285714285714285
smack and then I just remember that it it took a long time to recover,33.33333333333333
and then one day I went to the cardiologist and he said youknow,30.76923076923077
go back to work,25.0
which when I went back to work I had problems because it really was too soon,50.0
I should have said youknow,60.0
well Im not really ready,16.666666666666664
and my wife has always said that after that I acted like an old man,53.333333333333336
I was I was fifty five at the time,66.66666666666666
that must have been ten years ago,57.14285714285714
and the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems,42.857142857142854
and I would go from one room to the other to find out to get something,43.75
by the time I got there I forgot that,55.55555555555556
and they said that that was go away in six months,45.45454545454545
it never did,33.33333333333333
I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long,46.15384615384615
and at that time they didnt have a filter in there that filters out the little particles or whatever that causes your problem,45.83333333333333
and Ive never really been the same since then,50.0
and youknow thats the pretty much the end of the thing,41.66666666666667
the story,50.0
ERROR,0.0
and one day it it was a very very little right here,33.33333333333333

and we were moving from one location to another because my dads place of employment moved,50.0
and we were carrying some stuff on a a big long trailer that he was pulling with his nineteen fifty five Buick,50.0
and it was a rented Uhaul,50.0
and we were driving down the two lane highway and,40.0
probably going about forty forty five,0.0
ERROR,0.0
I didnt know what happened at the time,55.55555555555556
but subsequently I found out that one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch,52.94117647058824
because it was put in upside down,57.14285714285714
it came undone and it fell out,42.857142857142854
and because of that it the trailer caused the car to go like this,57.14285714285714
and the car was going like this,57.14285714285714
and I had a big round mirror that was above the dresser,50.0
and I had it in my in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side,61.111111111111114
because youknow so it didnt get broken,50.0
and the car whipped around,40.0
an,100.0
and to make a long story short,14.285714285714285
the trailer caused the car to spin all the way around,45.45454545454545
and the end of the trailer hit a big tree that was literally that big in diameter,41.17647058823529
and damaged the trailer,25.0
and the tree a little bit,33.33333333333333
and if he woulda,75.0
and and then I remember getting outof the car with my dad,33.33333333333333
and looking at the trailer and all that,50.0
and that was pretty,50.0
and then youknow it wasnt it didnt take a long time for all this to happen,44.44444444444444
but that kindof sticks in my memory,42.857142857142854
it youknow that youknow for the grace of God,55.55555555555556
or or my dads ability or something,28.57142857142857
otherthan having a damaged trailer,20.0
and I dont know cant remember if he hadta pay for it or it was covered under insurance or,47.61904761904761
but the mirror was not broken,33.33333333333333
and I dont think anything or much was damaged,40.0
and it was very but it was big long trailer,40.0
a double tandem youknow,25.0
tandem,0.0
two wheels,0.0
so that was that was I dont know if that was real scary but it it certainly left an impression on me so,58.333333333333336
well looks like theres a,50.0
oh,0.0
okay,0.0
I didnt get what this was to begin with,60.0
okay,0.0
looks like there was a young girl,42.857142857142854
or maybe a young woman,20.0
I dont know,50.0
probably in the teens or maybe oh I cant tell really tell the age,33.33333333333333
looks like that she was in a an area where there was rocky or stony or cliff type things,47.368421052631575
and she evidently fell in the into the xxx,55.55555555555556
it looks like xxx on the t,57.14285714285714
I cant really see that xxx,42.857142857142854
its not that good a picture,33.33333333333333
and she evidently got fell in,50.0
and she hanged onto a a dead trees branch outof the rocks,41.66666666666667
and looks like theres probably some man,37.5
by the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person,64.28571428571429
in a red lifejacket,50.0
and hes got a belt that I dont know if thats connected to a rope or not,55.00000000000001
I cant really see that,50.0
smack youknow looks like that the,50.0
oh I see what it is,66.66666666666666
hes got a belt hes gonna probably put around her,53.84615384615385
okay I didnt see that,50.0
similar to his,66.66666666666666
and it looks like hes just got to the point where hes up by next to her and hes gonna when he gets a chance put the belt around the girl and rescue her,57.89473684210527
probably paramedics or police,0.0
and looks like hes in well shape,37.5
hes got a a gigantic bicept,57.14285714285714
and the girl doesnt look really that she looks a little scared,38.46153846153847
Imean she looks alittle shocked out too or something,33.33333333333333
so I would assume it had a happy ending,44.44444444444444
so I I dont know about that,62.5
well theres well theres a boy playing with a I guess thats a soccer ball,44.44444444444444
when there little different sections,40.0
and hes in a probably a grassy area with some shrubs behind him,57.14285714285714
and hes got a baseball cap on,50.0
and he kicks it and it appears to go through a window,41.66666666666667
and it breaks the window,40.0
it lands inside a house,60.0
and it knocks a lamp off a a table,55.55555555555556
and theres a man that was evidently sitting in there,36.36363636363637
and I think it looks like it maybe startled him or something,50.0
and he picked up the ball,50.0
and hes looking out the window,57.14285714285714
and doesnt youknow cant see his expression on his face,41.66666666666667
but he probably in the either in the stages of finding out youknow who did it or whatever,55.55555555555556
and then hes probably gonna react to it one way or the other,33.33333333333333
well looks like theres a mother offering to a child,45.45454545454545
maybe a girl,33.33333333333333
I dont know,50.0
kindof hard to no,50.0
its probably a boy,50.0
unbrella,0.0
and he goes out,25.0
and walks with his backpack in the rain,50.0
and hes starting to get wet,28.57142857142857
and he,50.0
so he comes back,25.0
and hes all wet,20.0
and his mother seems to not that be happy about it either,41.66666666666667
and so then the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now,23.52941176470588
and hes youknow using it the proper way,44.44444444444444
that hes getting most of the rain not go on his upper upper body,46.666666666666664
and doesnt say if they he was dried out before that or not,57.14285714285714
but he doesnt seem to be wet from the picture,45.45454545454545
so I no,33.33333333333333
thats just speculation,25.0
well Id like to say that being a European I was not brought up to enjoy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches,31.818181818181817
but I have learned to make them for various visits that I have from my grandchildren,50.0
I would get two slices of wheat bread which I enjoy very much,38.46153846153847
I first I would get the peanut butter jar outof the cupboard,41.66666666666667
not the fridge because you dont needta put peanut butter in the fridge,42.857142857142854
and I would take a knife outof the drawer,44.44444444444444
I would put,66.66666666666666
put the jelly,33.33333333333333
clap it together,33.33333333333333

we were living in LA,60.0
and we lost our house in an earthquake,50.0
and in which time we decided to move to Arizona,40.0
shortly after we arrived in Arizona I was diagnosed with breast cancer,50.0
it was a very hard time for me because I knew noone here,53.84615384615385
I had no friends,50.0
luckily I had a wonderful doctor who performed an operation on me,50.0
and put me on a drug which I hadta take called Tamoxifen,50.0
I live in the LakesinTempe which is a very pleasant place to live,46.15384615384615
and over the years over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication I got to know very many friends who were extremely good very supportive to me,43.333333333333336
and I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time,52.94117647058824
and also grateful for the knowledge that its been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer,50.0
and up until now touch wood,16.666666666666664

when I left Australia to come back to Germany my my my German my gift to the German land which is not very large,45.83333333333333
and I already had one child who was born in Australia,36.36363636363637
and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home,41.66666666666667
and I hadta do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could which wasnt very easy because I had a sister inlaw who was not very kind at that time,48.57142857142857
and every time I made a mistake in Germany she useta she useta laugh and make fun of me,42.10526315789473
and I useta be very resentful about that,37.5
but because I was I guess so ambitious at that time and because I was good at dialects,55.55555555555556
and I I think this has something to do with musical ability because Im able to hear,38.88888888888889
I learned I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year I would say,47.05882352941176
and thats thats all I could say about language difficulties,50.0
very much so,0.0

if you read how to find your fairy godmother she might turn up and be able to help you,47.368421052631575
and she did that,50.0
and whan,0.0
and said,0.0
Cinderella you shall go to the ball,57.14285714285714
and she suddenly with with her magic was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made outof a pumpkin,42.10526315789473
and coachmen she changed the mice into coachmen,37.5
and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress,26.31578947368421
and she said,33.33333333333333
you go and you have a good time my child but remember one thing,28.57142857142857
when the clock strikes midnight you must already have returned from the ball,53.84615384615385
so Cinderella promised to do that,16.666666666666664
she went to the ball,60.0
the prince fell madly in love with her and she with him,58.333333333333336
and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to have left by the time that the clock r twelve,41.66666666666667
so she ran down the stairs as quickly as she could,54.54545454545454
and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step,41.66666666666667
that was the only thing that the prince hadta identify her with,58.333333333333336
shortly after that the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman,52.94117647058824
he who had no idea who she was,75.0
the only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper,46.15384615384615
so he sent a courtier around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper,59.09090909090909
and said,0.0
anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her,68.75
and ofcourse the courtier arrived at Cinderellas house,25.0
and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and ofcourse couldnt do that until Cinderella said,33.33333333333333
I would like to try,40.0
and she did,33.33333333333333
and ofcourse the slipper fit,20.0
and the prince was delighted to have found her again,40.0
and they married and lived happily ever after,25.0
apparently a birthday celebration is planned,33.33333333333333
and there is a cake with four candles on the table,45.45454545454545
we see on the right two women one already in in the room the other entering through the doorway,47.368421052631575
and each has a child,40.0
the women already inside has a little boy,25.0
and the women just entering is with a little girl,40.0
both of both children who are entering have wrapped presents presumably for the party,57.14285714285714
when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it a pretty good size portion of it,53.84615384615385
and there are pieces of cake on the table,44.44444444444444
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to what we percieve what we see as a dog sortof hiding underneath the sofa,47.82608695652174
and the hostess apparently the women whos giving the party is standing there facing the dog,41.17647058823529
she has a broom in her hand,57.14285714285714
she appears to be very angry,33.33333333333333
and the the birthday boy we cant tell what hes doing,53.84615384615385
he seems to be,50.0
I cant tell weather hes wiping his eyes,50.0
his u his mouth is wide open apparently to call or do something,30.76923076923077
and looks as though the woman the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom,47.61904761904761
oh my favorite food,25.0
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich,12.5
my way or the common way,33.33333333333333
well we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all,25.0
but use a good bread,20.0
sometimes its nice to toast it first,28.57142857142857
on the other hand its not necessary,42.857142857142854
its whatever you feel like at the time,75.0
well having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading,35.714285714285715
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first,33.33333333333333
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it,54.54545454545454
it works better,33.33333333333333
spread spread the,33.33333333333333
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread,53.333333333333336
well after that a little bit of butter,50.0
not too much but some,20.0
tends to help make the thing a little bit more moist than usual,23.076923076923077
and on top of that goes the jelly,50.0
now having done so what alotof people fail to have ever learned is youknow regardless of how much bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth,31.57894736842105
well theres an easy way around that,50.0
most people dont know my special secret,25.0
my special secret is lettuce,40.0
nice leaves of iceberg lettuce,20.0
just a couple is just right to do it,33.33333333333333
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had,21.428571428571427
I got alot of them but I can tell you Ill tell you this one,53.333333333333336
when the KoreanWar started I was twenty one and Onea,40.0
and in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself in a in in a stinky rice paddy shooting people I arranged or I I applied for the Airforces Aviation Cadet program,37.5
and I was I was appointed,66.66666666666666
I finally got an appointment to an air air cadet class,36.36363636363637
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia,50.0
and in those times,50.0
well I never did do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid,52.0
in the I was still in the in the within the very first I guess it was just the first phase of of training,66.66666666666666
I had already had some flying instruction,42.857142857142854
and I awoke one Saturday morning,16.666666666666664
no actually it was a Sunday morning,42.857142857142854
I awoke feeling hungover,25.0
I knew the hungover feeling,40.0
but I had not had I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then,36.84210526315789
I was only in my twenties,66.66666666666666
and I thought,33.33333333333333
boyohboy this is terrible,50.0
so I kindof stayed youknow just I hung back all day,36.36363636363637
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover,12.5
well I knew that I didnt feel well enough to fly,33.33333333333333
I was not safe,50.0
so I put myself into sick call,42.857142857142854
well this was this was a civilian contract flying school,50.0
and they had a infirmary but only a youknow it wasnt it wasnt a hospital,47.05882352941176
so I found myself in the infirmary,57.14285714285714
well I wasnt feeling too good but I wasnt feeling quite as bad as I had,33.33333333333333
youknow little by little it sortof left,28.57142857142857
and it got to the point where youknow the doctors would come in theyd looked at me and theyd say,50.0
well you dont have any jaundice but your liver and your spleen are enlarged,40.0
and we know there is something very very wrong going on internally,33.33333333333333
we dont know what it is,71.42857142857143
well story,0.0
we even I I I I felt good enough at or for after awhile that I you could even played a little bit of wheelchair football,53.84615384615385
but then one of the medics came in and he said,36.36363636363637
okay,0.0
he says,50.0
Isd,0.0
and I said,33.33333333333333
no youre not,25.0
he said,50.0
yes I am,66.66666666666666
he says,50.0
dont worry sir,25.0
he says,50.0
I givesd,50.0
and I thought,33.33333333333333
oh not another one,25.0
well he did,33.33333333333333
didnt seem to make very much difference,12.5
upshot of it all was that they gave up,77.77777777777779
they didnt they couldnt begin to imagine,44.44444444444444
they had never seen a situation like this with an with a an enlarged and palpable liver palpable spleen and no jaundice,50.0
it wasnt anything they had ever seen before,66.66666666666666
next thing you know I was sitting in the back of a of a staff car being driven from there down to the Tyndall Air Force Base in Tallahassee Florida,46.666666666666664
well they put me in there,33.33333333333333
they still didnt know,40.0
youknow lotsof poking around but finally they just said,11.11111111111111
okay you are you are confined to just bed rest,50.0
dont get outof bed,20.0
except to go to the bathroom,50.0
okay,0.0
well it got pretty boring,20.0
and I was feeling pretty good,33.33333333333333
so Id wander around at night,28.57142857142857
and youknow Id have the buddies over in the next ward or something like that,43.75
wed have visit,50.0
or Id get the nurses to give me icecream or something like that,35.714285714285715
well one morning the flight surgeon came around,25.0
didnt find me in my bed,57.14285714285714
he was very disappointed,50.0
and when I returned from wandering around visiting my buddies I was feeling pretty good,40.0
he said,50.0
if you get,66.66666666666666
he says,50.0
if ever I catch you outof bed again,37.5
he says,50.0
thats court marshal,25.0
thats the story,50.0
well it turned out that there was a new disease that they nobody knew anything about,62.5
the year would have been nineteen fifty one,50.0
and the disease is called infectious mononucleosis,28.57142857142857
you get it from kissing,60.0
that was that girlfriend I had back in town,55.55555555555556
back up there in Moltrey,20.0
thats what it was,80.0
okay that was the adventure,60.0
however end of the story,40.0
one year later a little over a year later I found myself in Korea,42.857142857142854
and I was I I I felt the needta go to the flight surgeon for another slight malady known as crabs,52.38095238095239
you get them from toilet seats over there,37.5
this is in Korea,75.0
loandbehold it was the same flight surgeon who I met the year before,53.84615384615385
and we had a good laugh,33.33333333333333
thats the story,50.0
yes,0.0
I think I already have,40.0
not at all,0.0
I have a hearing problem,40.0
and you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU gave a a workshop over time it was several weeks where we come over and wed learn all about hearing loss,39.39393939393939
well it ended up with me being a regular patient here,54.54545454545454
and what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss,57.14285714285714
well even now I find that many people particularly young women theyve been taught to talk through their nose real fast,31.818181818181817
and thats what they do,50.0
and I hafta say to them,50.0
excuseme I have a hearing problem,33.33333333333333
its not your problem its mine,50.0
and after several times of asking them to repeat what they said Ive had I I explain that,52.63157894736842
I have a hearing problem,40.0
I dont understand what you just said,50.0
now if you would be kind enough please to speak alittle more slowly and perhaps put some space between your words then Ill not hafta then Ill not hafta ask you continually to repeat yourself,25.71428571428571
okay,0.0
thats how I handle that,66.66666666666666
you bet I have,50.0
the beginning is this occured in this occurred in Louisiana,60.0
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana,36.36363636363637
and we were then flying,40.0
I was a fighter pilot,60.0
we were then flying the the swept wing version of the Fl eighty four known as the Fl eighty four Fl,38.095238095238095
and we were we had been out or on a youknow a series of missions,60.0
and we were just returning to the base,50.0
well actually I was by myself,66.66666666666666
I was flying solo not in formation with anybody,55.55555555555556
it was it was just a just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane,47.82608695652174
and also proficiency,0.0
just practice,0.0
practice this practice that,50.0
well in those times we we had a a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at three hundred and forty knots air speed,46.42857142857143
when directly over the air when we were directly over the end of the runway wed cut our power back,57.14285714285714
and that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees,38.46153846153847
after that the airplane is slow enough sothat we would we would have not have touched the throttle,66.66666666666666
in other words it cut power completely,28.57142857142857
and just bring it on around,50.0
well the the the legs of the of a of the pattern are called the approach,68.75
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind,16.666666666666664
ninety degrees from that is the base,57.14285714285714
and following that is the final,50.0
so its just el if,40.0
well here I am on the base leg with no power,54.54545454545454
all the garbage is out,60.0
we call it garbage,50.0
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear,33.33333333333333
and allofasudden Im about I dont know three four hundred feet off the ground,37.5
no more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet,18.181818181818183
something like that,100.0
Im not really sure,20.0
the airplane started to shutter,20.0
shuttering is the sign of a stall,57.14285714285714
that means the air when an when an airplane stalls it means its falling outof the sky,52.94117647058824
and I knew immediately people do not survive these a situation like this,46.15384615384615
and yet I automatically didnt even I I almost didnt have time to think,31.25
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway,62.96296296296296
I didnt want that to happen,42.857142857142854
well what did I do,60.0
I gave it full power which did not catch in time,45.45454545454545
I pulled in the the landing gear,57.14285714285714
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone,36.36363636363637
well with low rpm there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended,30.0
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down,60.0
I overshot the runway,50.0
but I wouldnt I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side,54.166666666666664
and the Fl eighty four Fl has a a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left,34.48275862068966
you cant predict it but it will do that,60.0
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe because its a jet,50.0
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward,45.45454545454545
well pretty soon there came the ground,28.57142857142857
in retrospect I can remember very well that the the horizon was jumping up and down,50.0
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction,28.57142857142857
it yawed,50.0
and as I say I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on,60.0
well eventually it did it did come to rest,44.44444444444444
it had the it had yawed to the right sothat at full power the engine was or the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in a which is always in place for the purpose of making sure people dont land wheels up,52.83018867924528
well they about panicked,50.0
well at which I followed the proper procedures,50.0
I cut all power turned everything off,57.14285714285714
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I I I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing,50.0
Im happy to report that the airplane flew again,30.0
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground,55.55555555555556
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels,50.0
and it it did fly again,50.0
so did I ofcourse,50.0
but in this this moment of panic was it it was only a a youknow only a quick flash,57.89473684210527
it was the the thought was,83.33333333333334
Ill do whats I know what I needta do but people dont dont walk away from these things,38.095238095238095
I walked away,33.33333333333333
it was later determined that while I was I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots,48.0
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone,54.54545454545454
and hes he was his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating,50.0
but he could tell that he was overtaking me,66.66666666666666
so obviously it was an air speed problem,37.5
from what I see I havent the foggiest idea of what it what is really going on,61.111111111111114
I see a man who appears to be lying possibly lying on his back,42.857142857142854
I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch,50.0
he is over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish,60.0
so possibly shes there to help him and doesnt know what to,28.57142857142857
youknow I dont know if she even knows what to do,41.66666666666667
I dont know any more than that,62.5
Imean I can tell you what I see which is some kind of a belt which he has around his left arm,63.63636363636363
he appears to be quite cu muscular,28.57142857142857
she appears to be very concerned,33.33333333333333
thats as much as I can tell you,55.55555555555556
a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks,44.44444444444444
it goes into the air,60.0
it encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it,53.333333333333336
a man sitting in a chair looks like an easy chair is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp,46.15384615384615
he then stands picks up the soccer ball looks out the window to see,35.714285714285715
lets see how did it get here,42.857142857142854
thats the story,50.0
a little boy is ready to go to school,33.33333333333333
apparently the weather is somewhat threatening,33.33333333333333
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella,50.0
well he refuses,33.33333333333333
he is going to be very brave,42.857142857142854
nothings gonna stop him,20.0
he doesnt need an umbrella,50.0
thats for sissies,50.0
out he goes into the weather,66.66666666666666
its raining,50.0
its raining hard,33.33333333333333
its raining so hard that hes stepping in puddles,50.0
hes getting soaked,75.0
his hair is dripping,50.0
he returns home much to the conversation,42.857142857142854
well apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella,42.30769230769231
well this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disneys thats for sure,38.46153846153847
Cinderella was a good girl,40.0
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters,18.181818181818183
and they were pampered spoiled and they were nasty,44.44444444444444
and Cinderella was called Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace,38.46153846153847
she hadta take out the take out the cinders and do things like that,50.0
so it was pretty dirty,40.0
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one,40.0
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother got an got invitations to go,26.666666666666668
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home,14.285714285714285
but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared outof nowhere and said to her,42.10526315789473
look you deserve to go,20.0
we could arrange this but there are conditions,50.0
first of all there will be a coach for you pulled by horses,69.23076923076923
and there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers,40.0
and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter whats occurring at at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be outof there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin,58.97435897435898
Cinderella went to the ball,40.0
the prince could not take his eyes of,50.0
and she had a wonderful time,33.33333333333333
but allofasudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve,33.33333333333333
she knew she hadta get the heck outof there really fast,27.27272727272727
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers,55.55555555555556
but it didnt make any difference,42.857142857142854
she got out she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home,36.84210526315789
well the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away,53.84615384615385
but that didnt matter because he wanted her,55.55555555555556
he was he was so struck by what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was,65.21739130434783
so he decreed that there would a search would occur over the over the kingdom until until the until Cinderella was until the woman was found,69.23076923076923
now why was this why was this such a thing,80.0
well Cinderella had tiny feet,0.0
and the glass slipper was so tiny that very few people very few grownups could fit into it,33.33333333333333
so he he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who who whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one,60.0
well loandbehold in his search his search was successful,44.44444444444444
they did find they did find Cinderella as the one who whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper,52.63157894736842
and they were married and lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
we see here a tree,40.0
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs holding on to it sortof so to speak and barking,45.0
in a branch in in the in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of rescuing a cat who is on one of the smaller branches,56.75675675675676
under directly underneath of which is a little girl who who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down,54.166666666666664
she has a tricycle in front of her,62.5
and we see near the little girl a ladder on the ground which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is,52.0
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains as I say remains on the ground,51.85185185185185
thats thats what we thats what we thats what we see to the left left side of the trunk of a tree,61.53846153846154
on the right side is another branch which had a few leaves on it,57.14285714285714
and one of on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing,50.0
at the same time we see in the in the distance directly to the right of the truck a firetruck and two what appear to be two firemen each each carrying an end of a ladder which presumably is going to be they will use to climb the tree rescue the man and probably the cat aswell,47.368421052631575
okay it looks like they have problems with their pets,50.0
and I have a cat,40.0
so I know that cats climb anywhere,28.57142857142857
and allofasudden its in a high tree,42.857142857142854
and it doesnt look like the cat is stressed,50.0
but the kids are or the little girl is stressed,40.0
so Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat,30.76923076923077
but I dont think hes able to,33.33333333333333
so he calls the firemen,40.0
and the firemen look like theyre going to get the cat down,38.46153846153847
and Im just gonna assume that they got the cat down,38.46153846153847
and the little kid is gonna be so excited,30.0
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down,33.33333333333333
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
okay you take the the loaf of bread,50.0
and you open the bag,40.0
and take two slices out,20.0
you get your peanut butter jar,33.33333333333333
you unscrew it,66.66666666666666
and you get your knife,40.0
and take out the peanut butter,33.33333333333333
and put peanut butter on both sides of the e I mean on one side,40.0
sothat both,100.0
and then you get your favorite jelly,28.57142857142857
and you do the same thing,33.33333333333333
and then you put them together,33.33333333333333
and serve it,33.33333333333333
and eat happily ever after,20.0
well I,50.0
and when I found out I had breast cancer,44.44444444444444
which runs very prominently in my family,42.857142857142854
my husband said,33.33333333333333
were gonna whip this thing,33.33333333333333
and so I had a mastectomy,33.33333333333333
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours,45.45454545454545
and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said,30.76923076923077
were going off to war again,50.0
and were gonna beat it,33.33333333333333
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing,42.857142857142854
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband,56.25
and my husband was trying to be strong for me,50.0
so we always had a positive attitude,28.57142857142857
and we we never thought negatively,33.33333333333333
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors,50.0
yes,0.0
okay well my mother was eighty nine when she had her breast cancer,38.46153846153847
and she came through that fine,50.0
but then after that a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes,46.666666666666664
and so she herself said,40.0
I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab,45.45454545454545
and she was living by herself at the time,66.66666666666666
and so she,33.33333333333333
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in near my sister in Dallas,47.05882352941176
and so then I went there once a month to visit her,25.0
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well,30.76923076923077
she she would start sentences,60.0
and never be able to finish them,28.57142857142857
and she would say,50.0
would you,100.0
and then she wouldnt be able to to finish the sentence,33.33333333333333
so it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted us to do,50.0
but we didnt really know what to do,33.33333333333333
so the only thing my sister and I did was we just smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf,36.36363636363637
so we talked slowly and loudly,16.666666666666664
and we always had a big smile on our faces,40.0
and we just showed her that we cared,50.0
and we would always read her mail to her,55.55555555555556
and we knew two favorite people of hers,25.0
so we would always read those more than once,44.44444444444444
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her,50.0
okay throat when I was working for this man he was the he was a member of YoungPresidentsOrganization,66.66666666666666
and it was made up of presidents from around the world,63.63636363636363
and they had a not a seminar but a they called it a university,50.0
and it was ke a week long,42.857142857142854
and it would always be one would be in the UnitedStates,63.63636363636363
and the second one of the year would be outside the UnitedStates,58.333333333333336
and this year it was going to be in SanFrancisco,50.0
and itll be twenty years ago next month,33.33333333333333
and my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening,53.84615384615385
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did alot of the background work,47.05882352941176
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working week,47.61904761904761
and so Don stayed here,0.0
and my sister from Dallas flew in,28.57142857142857
and that was the week that they had the SanFrancisco earthquake,54.54545454545454
and so we were at FishermansWharf because that was our one evening that we had free,56.25
and we were waiting to go on the trolley cart back to SaintFrancis the WestinSaintFrancis,40.0
and as were waiting in line the earthquake hit,44.44444444444444
and its really funny because weve never been in anything like that,69.23076923076923
and so my sister just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down,37.5
and she said,33.33333333333333
that was probably a two or three,42.857142857142854
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didnt know,65.21739130434783
but that was just her way of saying its a minor thing,50.0
well the electricity was off so nothing worked,37.5
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel,30.0
and in SanFrancisco youknow its pretty hilly,28.57142857142857
and so Imean it was it was quite a jog back there,50.0
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel,41.66666666666667
so we sat outside this big park area for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in,47.61904761904761
and the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was,38.46153846153847
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there,47.05882352941176
and we wanted to also call our two husbands,22.22222222222222
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news,36.84210526315789
she doesnt like to hear the bad news,33.33333333333333
and theres hardly any good news thats told,30.0
so we knew that she probably wouldnt be watching and know,41.66666666666667
but my sister said,25.0
mother what are you doing,60.0
and she said,33.33333333333333
well Im watching the news because soandso told me that there was a big earthquake in SanFrancisco,50.0
so this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco,42.857142857142854
so it was alotof fear at the beginning,50.0
we were on the nineteenth floor,66.66666666666666
so we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor,44.44444444444444
and then walk down with our luggage,28.57142857142857
so it was just the fear of the unknown,55.55555555555556
and not knowing if were gonna be able to fly out because maybe the the airline canceled the flight or whatever,36.36363636363637
but both of our flights were fine,57.14285714285714
and we made it home okay,33.33333333333333

well it looks like the little girls kitten got stuck up in a tree,50.0
and dad went up to help her out and get it down,41.66666666666667
and then he got stuck in the tree,37.5
so they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down outof the tree,28.57142857142857
okay Im going to tell you about the time that I had cancer and began my treatment,44.44444444444444
I was thirty seven years old,33.33333333333333
an,100.0
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my,28.57142857142857
I had a modified radical mastectomy,33.33333333333333
a,100.0
so within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo,53.84615384615385
smack they worry alot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects ofcourse,20.0
so I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two,36.36363636363637
I did not,33.33333333333333
and so after that first initial treatment,28.57142857142857
they told me not to eat lightly on the days of my treatment,46.15384615384615
throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat normally,50.0
and,0.0
so evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses,33.33333333333333
smack the person that I that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the conditions getting worse is my husbands mother,51.85185185185185
smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have,31.25
so it did affect her ability to communicate because she cant hear what youre saying to her most of the time,56.52173913043478
smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her,56.25
speak directly to her,50.0
I think shes become very adept at reading lips and figuring out what youre saying without hearing it,50.0
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation,60.0
so that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad,57.14285714285714
she now has the beginnings of basically Alzheimers of the dementia type,41.66666666666667
smack so,0.0
and you can see her now and see her again in thirty minutes and she wont remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually as a normal rule,40.0
she does recognize us youknow and is able to communicate,40.0
but basically,0.0
otherwise youre youre having to repeat everything so many times,41.66666666666667
you dont know if shes heard you or not,54.54545454545454
so thats about all you can do with that,70.0
is just make sure you have,33.33333333333333
well let me think,25.0
lots of them,66.66666666666666
but how frightened or how scared,33.33333333333333
thats the trick,50.0
okay I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young girl,50.0
and throat my parents had a v we lived on a farm,41.66666666666667
and my sister and I slept in the bedroom that was farthest,50.0
and between the main part of the house and our bedroom was a long,50.0
so at night when we would go to bed we had,54.54545454545454
and I would lay there and try to go to sleep,18.181818181818183
but then I would go to sleep,28.57142857142857
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the stairs,50.0
and since the,66.66666666666666
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was next to the main part of the house,47.368421052631575
and there was no way to get there except going by,36.36363636363637
smack so I I lived several years in fear,33.33333333333333
I,100.0
and eventually the we,50.0
and,0.0
and,0.0
so I hadta sleep next to the door,37.5
and I hadta protect my little sister,28.57142857142857
so that was probably the most frightened that I ever was that I can remember,60.0
okay,0.0
this girl has fallen into the river from somewhere,55.55555555555556
Im not sure if shes had a car accident and got outof the car or if she just fell into the river or the was walking swimming in the river and it swept her away,43.24324324324324
it looks like theres a rescue person,50.0
I dont know if its a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the limb to try to get her outof the water,50.0
at this point I think hes talking to her trying to get her outof the water,52.94117647058824
and she has her head outof the water,37.5
so Im assuming shes not in the process of being sucked down,50.0

she had CBGD I think it is,57.14285714285714
well it was progressive,50.0
she started out she said she noticed it when she was ke in her mid forties,62.5
she was ke an office manager secretary and,37.5
but youknow whatever,33.33333333333333
she just kindof got on with it,71.42857142857143
and over over time she just kindof talked a little bit slower,33.33333333333333
and would use youknow shorter sentences,16.666666666666664
and course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic,40.0
so,0.0
but eventually youknow it was,40.0
they didnt really diagnosis it for awhile,50.0
and then she went to UniversityofMichigan where they have this neurology or aphasia center,35.714285714285715
some type of where they do alotof research in it,70.0
thing is she didnt like the doctor,50.0
and she told him to fuck off,42.857142857142854
so didnt really get the whole research thing on it,36.36363636363637
but over time she youknow just got less and less communicative,27.27272727272727
they thought she was having mini strokes for awhile,44.44444444444444
a,100.0
it was actually the evening of her sisters funeral,55.55555555555556
they went out to dinner,60.0
and she passed out,50.0
and they rushed her to the hospital,57.14285714285714
and the doctor,33.33333333333333
well the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital,54.54545454545454
after she woke up that evening she was talking perfectly normal,54.54545454545454
Imean it it youknow had gone away,42.857142857142854
she could full sentences and as if if shed nothing happened,54.54545454545454
ke take,0.0
she went to bed that night,50.0
she woke up,66.66666666666666
and then she was back to where she was before it happened,66.66666666666666
so noone could figure that one out,42.857142857142854
but meanwhile the doctor pulled her drivers license because she passed out,41.66666666666667
and youknow considered a seizure or something,28.57142857142857
and that really pissed her off,50.0
then she took her my dad hadta take away the keys,36.36363636363637
she actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up,53.333333333333336
and we actually kept her car until she died,44.44444444444444
she we couldnt sell her car because youknow,55.55555555555556
when you get better Mom you can have your car back,45.45454545454545
but eventually she ended up losing muscle control,25.0
and youknow she was working with a walker,50.0
and then within a year after that she was in a wheelchair,66.66666666666666
she was in the nursing home for about the last year and a half,50.0
and when she went in the nursing home she could still speak three or four sentence or three or four word sentences,27.27272727272727
and towards the end she could get youknow one or two words out,38.46153846153847
but the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time,50.0
and then eventually she died,20.0
she just decided she was not gonna eat,33.33333333333333
and she didnt eat,40.0
and the last that was it,66.66666666666666
up no its its youknow kindof brought the whole family together,45.45454545454545
Imean theres funny stories about it,42.857142857142854
I knew she had decided not to eat,37.5

well I dont not sure Im not sure I know how to dance but Id love to try,23.809523809523807
but she doesnt really know that the stepmother the fairy godmother put a spell on the shoes,44.44444444444444
so anyone in the shoes can ke dance like magic,50.0
ke and on top of that the shoes will only fit Cinderella,41.66666666666667

except for the shoes for some reason but they never told her that,61.53846153846154

and the clock starts chiming so they go running away,20.0

its like,50.0
whoa this babe was for me,66.66666666666666
and allofasudden shes gone,40.0

meanwhile his fathers ke saying,40.0

because youknow shes got lots of money,50.0
and the prince says,25.0

and course her feet have got big corns so she cant try them on,46.666666666666664
then Cinderella shes ke hiding in the back,44.44444444444444
kindof quivering while the youknow this is all going on,60.0
and the prince sees her and says,28.57142857142857

and the stepmother says,25.0

and then when she turns the slipper on,50.0
this is me adlibbing,75.0
its not part of the story,50.0
but allofasudden the dress comes back on,28.57142857142857
the prince sees her,50.0

and they get married in the cathedral in the big city,54.54545454545454
and they live happily ever after,33.33333333333333
okay lets well lets see if we can throw some humor into this tragedy here,40.0
we had oh it looks like we had two people that were going for a drive,50.0
and they saw a wash,40.0
and they decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it,33.33333333333333
because theyre really cool,40.0
and they can do these things,50.0
and ofcourse the four wheel drive got run over,33.33333333333333
and they got washed off the truck and into the flood,54.54545454545454
and fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck,44.44444444444444
so they grab that on,60.0
and it ooks,33.33333333333333
and she is holding on to him,71.42857142857143
and hopefully the police are gonna come and rescue them,27.27272727272727
or it could be that this guys actually a fireman trying to rescue her,50.0
and she was the one that drove the truck into the wash,58.333333333333336
cant say for sure but,33.33333333333333
looks like theyre hanging on to the tree,66.66666666666666
and youknow maybe theyre going to make it maybe theyre not,30.76923076923077
but well lets assume that they do,28.57142857142857
they do make it,75.0
and they Sheriff Joe arrests them for five thousand dollar fine for doing the stupid driver law,29.411764705882355
driving through a middle of a wash,57.14285714285714
but after that they live happily ever after,50.0
okay it looks like,50.0
lets get a name for this stupid looking kid here,30.0
Reginald,0.0
Reginald decides hes gonna go out to play,30.0
so he goes out in the front garden,50.0
and hes playing with his football,57.14285714285714
soccers what they call it in America,57.14285714285714
and hes not very skilled because hes an American,36.36363636363637
and hes not ke British or German or anything,20.0
and he kicks it in the window of his neighbor,60.0
and kids actually pretty,0.0
well doesnt dont see the kid anywhere,33.33333333333333
looks like the kid ran away,33.33333333333333
so looks like the neighbors really pissed off because the window it not only came through his window,44.44444444444444
broke his lamp,33.33333333333333
and hes looking out the window to seeing if the kid is going to confess up to it or run away,50.0
and well we just dont know what happened,33.33333333333333
whether that happened,66.66666666666666
lets assume the worst,25.0
and lets say that the,40.0
and stecide,0.0
and calls the cop in,40.0
lets get Sheriff Joe in this again,28.57142857142857
and the kid come,25.0
Sheriff Doe,0.0
turns out the kids an illegal immigrant and gets deported,40.0
lifes hard but thats it is,42.857142857142854
well it looks like,50.0
oh lets get a kid for this name for this stupid looking little kid here,33.33333333333333
oh well name him after my nephew Eric,37.5
looks like Eric is gonna go to school,33.33333333333333
and his mom ofcourse is saying,33.33333333333333
you know what,66.66666666666666
I think its time that you take the umbrella,55.55555555555556
because Im guessing its gonna rain out,55.55555555555556
and he says,33.33333333333333
no Mom I dont want the umbrella,50.0
anyways somehow he gets outof the house,28.57142857142857
mom forces him to take the umbrella,28.57142857142857
but then he hides it underneath the the the car,60.0
and he goes off to school,50.0
and guess what,33.33333333333333
ofcourse mom is right,25.0
and it starts raining,25.0
and so he kindof ke gets halfway to school,22.22222222222222
and then he comes running home to mom crying because hes all wet,35.714285714285715
and mom kindof gives him a lecture,28.57142857142857
and doesnt let him have,33.33333333333333
youknow she actually reaches into his backpack and takes out the brownie shed given him take for dessert at lunch and says,36.36363636363637
no you cant have any brownies you naughty little kid,36.36363636363637
and gives him the umbrella,40.0
and makes him go back to school,28.57142857142857
and poor Eric then hasta go to school without any brownies because he didnt listen,43.75
h,0.0
and wouldnt come down,40.0
and so the man climbed up the tree to help,30.0
and I guess sothat then the man couldnt come down,45.45454545454545
so somebody call the fire department,33.33333333333333
fire departments gonna rescue everybody,16.666666666666664
okay I guess the reason the mans up in the tree is because the ladder fell down,58.82352941176471
take a slice of bread,40.0
an,100.0
and I put jelly on it,50.0
and enjoy all the grease and sugar you shouldnt have,36.36363636363637
Id had atrial fribulation,20.0
and during those times I got real dizzy and hadta get down in a hurry so I wouldnt fall down,47.61904761904761
and and a bright light appeared under my eyes,33.33333333333333
and I couldnt detect any pulse,42.857142857142854
so I knew my heart had stopped,42.857142857142854
so I performed a cardial,40.0
or defribrulated,0.0
I learned how in MensHealthMagazine,60.0
and I saved my life several times doing that,33.33333333333333
because this is a recurring problem with yi me,66.66666666666666
and the last time I had atrial fibrillation was Sunday morning,27.27272727272727
and it was so bad I couldnt,50.0
so I woke up my wife,50.0
shes a very sound sleeper,33.33333333333333
I woke her up and told her,57.14285714285714
and she come running around and pounced on it about a dozen times leal,42.857142857142854
and I knew to every time she come down I exhale,54.54545454545454
because it works better if my lungs are empty when she pumps my heart,57.14285714285714
and that brought me around real quick,42.857142857142854
so I dont think Ill ever let my wife travel without me from now on,37.5
shes the only shes the best defibrillator Ive got,50.0
,0.0
the scariest thing I had ever had is when I I couldnt get my heart restarted,52.94117647058824

twenty four for twelve ninety five,16.666666666666664
and a battery lasts about three or four days,11.11111111111111

single woman,0.0
that lived with her mother,60.0
and her single sisters that were not so pretty,33.33333333333333

but when she ran outof the palace she lost one of her slippers,46.15384615384615
and some time later a knock on the door came,40.0
and here was the prince come to try the slipper on her foot,38.46153846153847
and her foot was the only one that fit,44.44444444444444
it wouldnt fit her,60.0
so so he wanted her as a i bride,44.44444444444444
so she,50.0
and her and the prince lived happily ever after,33.33333333333333
smack well at our house we take the bread outof the freezer,41.66666666666667
and toast the bread,25.0
and then put about a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter,33.33333333333333
the chunky kind,33.33333333333333
on the peanut butter sandwich smack,33.33333333333333
on one side,33.33333333333333
then on the other side,40.0
and smooth it clear across,40.0
and then we smack,25.0
the two pieces of bread,40.0
cut it in half,50.0
and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts,53.84615384615385
but if were gonna eat it we eat it with the crust,53.84615384615385
thats about how to make a peanut butter sandwich,40.0
the dog and the cat were fighting,42.857142857142854
and the cat climbed up the tree,42.857142857142854
and the do,33.33333333333333
and the little girl happened upon the scene,37.5
and realized that the cat was in the tree and shes gonna need her dad,47.05882352941176
so she got her dad,40.0
and her dad got the ladder,33.33333333333333
and they were trying to get the cat outof the tree,36.36363636363637
but the ladder fell down,40.0
but just in the nick of time the firemen who were called by the neighbors came,50.0
and helped get the cat and the dad outof the tree,27.27272727272727
smack,0.0
well yes I remember being hospitalized,33.33333333333333
the most recent one was in NewYorkCity,42.857142857142854
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at RooseveltHospital,57.14285714285714
and my right lung had filled up with fluid,44.44444444444444
and so they kept me,40.0
I realized how important it is to have someone with you when youre in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked,59.09090909090909
the towels were like sandpaper,60.0
you were lucky to have a towel if you were to take a bath or a shower,47.05882352941176
they didnt come,50.0
so I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel,47.05882352941176
I have veins that are very difficult to get blood,30.0
so Id always say kiddingly to the people,33.33333333333333
are ya really good at this,66.66666666666666
and one man named JoeL told me,14.285714285714285
hed hed shay,20.0
Ive,50.0
after about twenty pokes in my hand I said,44.44444444444444
could you find someone else to draw blood because were not getting it done here,40.0
and smack it was really all I could do to get better so I could get outof the place,47.368421052631575
because its too bad that the staff is so overworked,50.0
and probably underpaid,0.0
and that facilities are having trouble today getting the help that they need,38.46153846153847
I could also tell you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night,62.5
ofcourse I wasnt breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things,42.857142857142854
and she couldnt find the bathroom,42.857142857142854
so she just used whatever facilities she could find,44.44444444444444
and when I said something to the nurses that Id like to be moved they just said,55.55555555555556
well youll probably hafta go on with a cancer patient thats dying,50.0
so I was so unaccustomed to hospitals,42.857142857142854
and Im probably unaccustomed to the treatment there because Im going back to Iowa thinking,41.17647058823529
and I was sortof on my own to try to figure out how to get help and how to get outof there,31.818181818181817
so that was my experience,60.0
thats probably the worst experience Ive ever had in a hospital,46.15384615384615
because everything else is always been won done very well,40.0
it was crazy,66.66666666666666
if you know Roosevelt Hospital,40.0
and it just felt I did I did learn though,40.0
when I was at RooseveltHospital I was watching Jeopardy on television,63.63636363636363
and they ask,33.33333333333333
who was the first SupremeCourt justice,50.0
and I looked out the window,50.0
and I saw the school at FordhamUniversity,42.857142857142854
and the first SupremeCourt justice was named for the one that is named in that school as the law school,50.0
smack,0.0
,0.0
smack Im not sure if I was frightened or scared in this situation,42.857142857142854
but I was frightened for my daughter,57.14285714285714
in September of net September two thousand six,25.0
on the nineteenth day,50.0
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom,54.54545454545454
that her husband had threatened to kill her,50.0
and within twenty hours I was in RomeItaly,50.0
and my husband and I decided that one of us should go to help her,46.666666666666664
and to help her with her husband,42.857142857142854
and I arrived hoping that I could do something to get them counseling whatever,50.0
within twenty four hours he had called the police of Rome,45.45454545454545
I was alone with him in the house,75.0
and I had no help,40.0
but I didnt know how to get ahold of my daughter,50.0
and the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail,47.05882352941176
and I immediately thought,25.0
smack wonder if I can take my pillow,50.0
or should I take my Sudoku game,42.857142857142854
because if I hafta sit in that police with the police in jail what am I going to do,57.89473684210527
so I sortof youknow,25.0
and then I started trying to call my daughters friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan,42.10526315789473
and I kept dialing,25.0
because I think when youre nervous you dial the wrong thing,50.0
I finally got ahold of my daughter,57.14285714285714
and she came,33.33333333333333
and we called the carabinieris,40.0
and the carabinieris,33.33333333333333
and Im not sure if I was afraid,44.44444444444444
I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail,53.333333333333336
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth to make it happen,46.666666666666664
and I since then we were trailed,57.14285714285714
our phone was tapped,50.0
the computer was oh the computer was compromised,50.0
we we wrote to each other sitting on the sofa,60.0
and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time,40.0
and Im not sure if I was really afraid,40.0
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening,66.66666666666666
but that was probably the most resourceful that I ever hadta be to protect my daughter and grandson,33.33333333333333
smack so Im not sure I share that with everyone,45.45454545454545
but if you wanna know when I was really drawn to action,50.0
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating,46.15384615384615
smack,0.0
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it,61.53846153846154
I think its not so much communicating it as it is understanding,50.0
because when I was in Italy trying to communicate with people I used my hands,53.333333333333336
I used any kind of framework I could think of,60.0
another language,50.0
smack to communicate with anybody,40.0
so I learned street Italian,20.0
smack I became pretty clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me,40.0
and I learned the words that I needed to use,40.0
but I think communication is so vital,28.57142857142857
and when you dont know the language of someone else its hard to communicate,46.666666666666664
do you want us to be creative with it,66.66666666666666
do whatever,50.0
well this could easily have happened in Iowa,50.0
the DesMoinesRiver was rising in nineteen ninety three,37.5
and also in two thousand eight,16.666666666666664
and people were warned not to be near the river,40.0
but people do that,25.0
and the water has an undertow,33.33333333333333
and it can catch,50.0
that could have happened in this picture,71.42857142857143
and police and fire and safety people go to great lengths to help those people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time,32.0
a,100.0
and maybe he was playing soccer with his friends,44.44444444444444
and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it,46.666666666666664
it went through the window,60.0
and the man was not so happy about it,44.44444444444444
because he was sitting there,60.0
and it knocked over his lamp,50.0
and then Im not sure what hes doing in the last picture,42.857142857142854
but hes looking at the window,57.14285714285714
the man is looking at the window,57.14285714285714
and it looks like hes holding something,62.5
but maybe hes making a telephone call,37.5
I dont know,50.0
well typically little boys and umbrellas dont really wanna,10.0
because the little boy would be much rather be much happier if he doesnt,46.666666666666664
but his mother says,25.0
you gotta take an umbrella,33.33333333333333
and at the last minute he said,42.857142857142854
and he runs outside,25.0
and hes in the rain,50.0
and hes not so happy,16.666666666666664
and he goes back home,20.0
and he says to mom,40.0
I guess,50.0
and then he takes the umbrella and leaves,25.0
once upon a time,50.0
there was a woman with two ugly girls,37.5
and a father with a beautiful daughter,42.857142857142854
and they got married the the man and the woman,50.0
so the families were united,40.0
and the wicked stepmother with her two daughters made the little girl,33.33333333333333

and by the way her name was Cinderella,50.0
smack and she worked and she scrubbed,28.57142857142857
and she had so many things to do all day long,18.181818181818183
while the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do,30.76923076923077
but one night there was a special party that the prince was giving,38.46153846153847
because you see these girls have grown up,62.5
and they were teenagers and they were older,50.0
and the prince was looking for a princess,50.0
smack well the two ugly stepsisters they were getting dresses,30.0
and they were gonna get to go to the party,36.36363636363637

smack and Cinderella they did their magic,28.57142857142857
and Cinderella got a beautiful dress,16.666666666666664
and she got a carriage,40.0
and she took off,50.0
and she danced with the prince all night long,44.44444444444444
but as the the mice had told her,62.5
at the stroke of midnight you hafta be home,55.55555555555556
so at the stroke of midnight she realized she hadta leave,45.45454545454545
so she ran,33.33333333333333
and she ran away,25.0
and she left her shoe,40.0
and the prince found her shoe,33.33333333333333
and then she got back home,16.666666666666664
and they went a and the wicked s stepsisters came back,27.27272727272727
smack then the prince was looking for the owner of the shoe,50.0
so he went out all across,33.33333333333333
and trying on the shoe,40.0
and they came to Cinderellas house,33.33333333333333
and at Cinderellas house the wicked stepsisters were,37.5
and they tried and tried to wear the shoe,22.22222222222222
but Cinderella wasnt given the chance until at the last they saw Cinderella,42.857142857142854
and the shoe fit perfectly,20.0
and Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after,22.22222222222222
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the first thing you hafta do is go to the freezer and get the bread outof the freezer,30.76923076923077
and you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesnt dry out,56.25
and if theres only two of you in the house you dont go through a loaf of bread a day so its important to keep it fresh,51.724137931034484
so you keep the bread in the freezer,50.0
so ya go to the freezer,50.0
grab the loaf of bread,40.0

you never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter because it just slides around and its really difficult to work with,39.130434782608695
so put the put the jelly on the other slice of bread,41.66666666666667
and youll find that because the bread is frozen its easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly,42.857142857142854
smack after youve spread the peanut butter and the jelly smack,41.66666666666667

because I was,100.0
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo,50.0
I I lost it because something in the chemotherapy gave me a very bad taste in my mouth,61.111111111111114
it tasted like I was chewing on pennies,62.5
you ever when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth and felt that taste,52.94117647058824

so I lost thirty pounds which was not a bad thing,36.36363636363637
I wish I coulda kept it off,57.14285714285714
unfortunately as I once we got the the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation,52.63157894736842

and the man had a little girl by his first marriage,36.36363636363637
and so they combined their families,33.33333333333333
and the two stepsisters I think were not very nice to the new stepsister,35.714285714285715
and they were alittle older,40.0
and they ordered her around,40.0
and and they were really really mean to her,44.44444444444444
so she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her new stepsisters or siblings,33.33333333333333
in the land that they lived there was a and they and the girls grew up and to become young ladies,42.857142857142854
and with Cinderella virtually becoming the the personal servant of her two stepsisters,38.46153846153847
in the land that they lived there was a a king,54.54545454545454
who who had a son,60.0
who would take his place,60.0
but the king was concerned that his son was unmarried,50.0
and they needed to socialize,20.0
and decided that they would have a ball,50.0
in which they would invite all the young eligible young ladies in the kingdom to come and to enjoy a a marvelous ball at the royal palace,44.44444444444444
and the invitation came in the mail,42.857142857142854
and the two ps stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to go to the ball and dance and maybe find the the young prince to be of interest,33.33333333333333
but they planned and schemed that Cinderella would not be allowed to attend and and was excluded,29.411764705882355
and when it came time to leave for the ball Cinderella was left behind,42.857142857142854
but was visited by a a a fairy prince,55.55555555555556
who knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella,42.857142857142854
said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella,38.46153846153847
and turned her into this beautiful young lady,37.5
and provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin,50.0
and told her that she wud,50.0
which she did but that she hadta leave,50.0
and be home by midnight,40.0
at which time she would be restored to her her normal self,66.66666666666666
so Cinderella went to the ball,33.33333333333333
and much to the chagrin of the stepsisters and the other young ladies in attendance,40.0
was immediately noticed by the prince,50.0
who was captivated by her,80.0
and the prince and Cinderella danced and danced,12.5
until almost the stroke of twelve when Cinderella remembered that she hadta back into her pumpkin coach,47.05882352941176
and ran outof the palace,20.0
and jumped into her pumpkin coach to return to her home,36.36363636363637
but in her haste one of her slippers that I think was made of glass or something would had fallen off,57.14285714285714
and she returned home,25.0
well the prince who was in hot pursuit,50.0
was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin,36.36363636363637
smack drawn by these horses,40.0
but did find the slipper,40.0
and commanded his his helpers to search throughout the realm for a young lady thats foot would fit in that slipper,45.45454545454545
and so the h,25.0
and eventually came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters,38.46153846153847
and try as they may the stepsisters could not put their large feet into the glass s,47.05882352941176
but the smack the attendant tried the glass slipper on Cinderella,36.36363636363637
and Cinderellas foot fit perfectly,0.0
and so the attendant knew that Cinderella was the the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball,47.368421052631575
and took her with him back to the back to the royal palace,53.84615384615385
where she and the prince were united,57.14285714285714
and became a couple,25.0
and were married,33.33333333333333
and lived happily ever after,20.0

the more I walked the more it hurt,50.0
but I really just kindof ignored it,42.857142857142854
I was more concerned about my right foot with the toe nail looking like it was lifting off the bed,55.00000000000001
and I didnt quite know what to do about this,45.45454545454545
so I made a appointment with the foot doctor,44.44444444444444

and then I casually mentioned that my left foot was hurting,36.36363636363637
an,100.0

and that led to xrays,40.0
which showed there was a small broken bone,37.5
which led to my having to wear a boot for a month,50.0
and then come back for more xrays,14.285714285714285
so,0.0
then I turned arou,25.0
more xrays,0.0

with its,100.0
looking out at us from the air vents I guess you call those that are in the foundation of the house,66.66666666666666
smack and that really scared me,33.33333333333333
I thought,50.0
if that thing gets in the house or gets out it could bite the kids,53.333333333333336
and it might be b rabid,66.66666666666666
so I called the animal shelter I think it was,50.0
smack and they told me that they everybody was on lunch,63.63636363636363
smack and so they wouldnt be there for an hour,45.45454545454545
which,100.0
because if someone gets bit I will sue the city,60.0
smack so,0.0
and the men were not happy to see this,33.33333333333333
because he really looked,50.0
and they took off the vent,50.0
and somehow they caught him,40.0
smack and then they discovered I believe this is they discovered a nest of baby opossums,43.75
which all looked very cute,40.0
when theyre babies theyre all kinds of babies look cute,41.66666666666667
so anyway they took the opossum and babies away,22.22222222222222

okay,0.0
well my mother had a stroke,33.33333333333333

one of her her glass slippers falls off,50.0
and she runs off into the night,57.14285714285714

and so the kingdom begins a search for the girl whose foot fits in the glass slipper,41.17647058823529

a,100.0
instead of them helping out,60.0
and the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen,52.94117647058824
so Cinderella because she works so hard has no friends,30.0
and except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house,53.333333333333336
and they befriend her,50.0
she sees the,66.66666666666666

throat meanwhile in that castle theres a prince,44.44444444444444

and does not want that competition for her daughters,44.44444444444444
smack so,0.0
and Cinderella goes through all her chores,42.857142857142854
but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also,35.714285714285715
so they help her with the chores,57.14285714285714
but then she realizes that she cannot,50.0
and so in,33.33333333333333
her,100.0

this was about two years ago,33.33333333333333
and I was having pain in my left hip,44.44444444444444
and Id had a car accident earlier that year,30.0
so I thought maybe it was related to that,55.55555555555556
but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an xray,44.44444444444444
and they found out that the bone the joint was actually dying because I had what was called avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didnt join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off,45.94594594594595
so,0.0
so we set up the appointment,50.0

and I went into the hospital,50.0
and,0.0
Ive never really been sick or anything in my life,54.54545454545454
so they put me under,60.0
and I actually kindof woke up before they were completely finished,45.45454545454545
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldnt feel anything from the waist down,55.55555555555556
but they were finishing up,60.0
and I was ke looking around,33.33333333333333
and the doctor was kinda surprised,33.33333333333333
he was like,100.0
oh just be calm,25.0
were almost done,33.33333333333333
and so then after that they wheeled me into the recovery room where youknow I kinda came more outof the anesthetic,42.857142857142854
and then I spent two days in the hospital before they were before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home,48.0
and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work,25.0
and then it was a year before they said I was completely healed,53.84615384615385
but yeah that was the the only time Ive ever really been in the hospital,56.25
no it was really kindof strange because I youknow I trusted the doctors,46.15384615384615
and I thought I would be afraid youknow especially when they were putting me under,60.0
but I really wasnt frightened or or scared,22.22222222222222
oh yeah definitely,0.0

alright this was gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager,60.0
and my family we lived in Anchorage and wed always every weekend we would go down to the KenaiPeninsula to either the KenaiRiver or the RussianRiver to go salmon fishing because the salmon would run,44.44444444444444
and so I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught,46.15384615384615
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite,45.45454545454545
and I was wearing,50.0
everybody wears waders,33.33333333333333
so anyway I was,50.0
and Im walking along,60.0
and I hear something,50.0
and I look over to my right,57.14285714285714
and I see a little baby moose,28.57142857142857
and Im like,50.0
oh how cute a baby moose,33.33333333333333
well I hear something,50.0
and I look over and its the mother moose,44.44444444444444
and it freaked me out,60.0
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby,44.11764705882353
and I had this huge thing of fish,37.5
and I was like I I didnt wanna drop the fish because I thought that would make noise,52.63157894736842
so I was trying to ke tiptoe as fast as I could through that area,46.666666666666664
and I was able to get past that,37.5
I dont know how I was able to get through there,50.0
I dont know how the the mother moose didnt hear me because they have good hearing,50.0
they dont see very well,33.33333333333333

theyre huge,33.33333333333333
and they look so goofy and,16.666666666666664
but they can be really dangerous,50.0
yeah actually my grandmother on my dads side youknow as she got older,38.46153846153847
shed had a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks in her life,40.0
but as she got older her memory started to go,30.0
and it was I think she,66.66666666666666
I dont know if it was Alzheimers that she had or dementia or what,53.333333333333336
but we would go to see her youknow from time to time,41.66666666666667
and youknow sometimes she would be really youknow with it,50.0
she could remember lots of things,50.0
and other times you would kindof hafta tell her who you who you were and talk really slowly,44.44444444444444
and youknow she would keep repeating,33.33333333333333
and shed be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother,50.0
and so,0.0
no,0.0
you hafta say,33.33333333333333
no Grandma its Rich,25.0
and shes,33.33333333333333
oh Richie,0.0
and so then youknow she would remember who I was for awhile,50.0
and then shed kinda fade out again,14.285714285714285
so it was difficult to communicate,33.33333333333333
it was kindof hard emotionally too youknow because I remember her from when she was younger,56.25
and she was ke my favorite grandmother,42.857142857142854
and she was really alotof fun,33.33333333333333
and then to see her in that situation where shes just kindof a shadow of her former self was was upsetting,50.0
so,0.0
well I would hold her hand youknow and just be youknow modulate my tone of voice,37.5
youknow just repeat it if if she couldnt understand,50.0
youknow just be there for her really,42.857142857142854
sometimes she couldnt understand,40.0
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didnt,53.84615384615385
youknow you would talk to her and she may not understand,54.54545454545454
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm,45.45454545454545
okay,0.0

once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella,36.36363636363637
and unfortunately her father passed away,33.33333333333333
and she was sent to live with her stepmother and stepsisters who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful,50.0
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun,52.94117647058824
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm,45.45454545454545
one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son,38.46153846153847
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that somebody was would be able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king,50.0
so couriers went across the land and delivered the message or delivered invitations to all the eligible bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom,37.5
and the the stepsisters were very excited,42.857142857142854
and Cinderella was excited too,20.0
but then they laughed at her saying,42.857142857142854
you cant go to the ball,57.14285714285714
you dont have a dress,50.0
youre just a scrub girl,33.33333333333333
and Cinderella was very sad about that,42.857142857142854
but her friends the animals made a dress for her so so she could go to the ball,50.0
unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her,50.0
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball,53.333333333333336
so they ripped the dress up,50.0
and Cinderella was sent down to the to the cellar,60.0
and she cried,33.33333333333333
and then allofasudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying,43.75
and she told her story to the fairy godmother,44.44444444444444
and the fairy godmother waved her wand,28.57142857142857
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with with glass slippers,30.0
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin,38.46153846153847
and it turned into a beautiful carriage,42.857142857142854
and she waved her wand over the mice,50.0
and the mice turned into horses,33.33333333333333
so Cinderella arrived at the at the royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress,40.909090909090914
she met the prince,50.0
and they danced the night away,33.33333333333333
but the Cin but the fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight,46.15384615384615
so Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away,30.76923076923077
and the prince tried to catch her because he was so enchanted with her,50.0
but he couldnt catch up with her,62.5
she Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden ip or one of her glass slippers on the stairs,48.275862068965516
she made it to the carriage and got home just in time,41.66666666666667
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin,37.5
and the mice turned or the horses turned back into mice,27.27272727272727
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because he was his heart belonged to her now,50.0
so he sent couriers across the land again with the the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper,42.857142857142854
and then he would know who who was the beautiful woman at the ball,57.14285714285714
so when the courier got to Cinderellas house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting to try the slippers on,36.84210526315789
but unfortunately they the slippers didnt fit either one of them,50.0
and Cinderella came outof the cellar and sat down,22.22222222222222
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle,48.484848484848484

and they noticed he was stuck in the tree,55.55555555555556

I actually got a dirty towel and ke,25.0
because you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes,55.55555555555556
and gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying,27.27272727272727
you needta get here now,20.0
we needta figure this out,60.0
whats going on,75.0
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole,61.53846153846154
they were looking for a new place to start a hive,45.45454545454545
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting,41.66666666666667
we hadta get someone,50.0
youknow were they going in everywhere,50.0
how were they getting in,80.0
they hadta call a bee expert,33.33333333333333
so then but yeah that was a freaky moment,33.33333333333333
and I was very creeped out,50.0
I remember going into my closet and ke,37.5
and Imean they were very focused on the windows,44.44444444444444
but it was alittle creepy to think that ke it might be,50.0
that was creepy for sure,60.0
youknow and the bathroom is the last place you need anything,45.45454545454545
yeah youre vulnerable enough,20.0
lets be honest,33.33333333333333
ke you just dont need anything coming at you with a stinger,53.84615384615385
so yes that was that was that was scary,66.66666666666666
certainly,0.0
Im trying to think of specific examples in the moment whispering,41.66666666666667
its interesting whispering,33.33333333333333
Im trying to think of,50.0
certainly while teaching sometimes having students particular students who really are struggling,25.0
and you feel like theres not clear communication,33.33333333333333
its not a coherent reason for why its not working and a resolution kind of thing,43.75
and youre struggling to understand,33.33333333333333
certainly sending emails to find out,16.666666666666664
taking a moment saying,25.0
I wanna talk with you,60.0
Im feeling youknow this this is this is these are my concerns,76.92307692307693
how can I better support you,66.66666666666666
is there anything going on that you wish to share with me,66.66666666666666
like those trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy and whatever theyd be interested in,52.63157894736842
asking them,50.0
youknow I think it really helps to just start with youknow,27.27272727272727
these are my concerns,75.0
ie missing work or behavior in class or something like that,36.36363636363637
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of where to go next with that,50.0
Im trying to think,40.0
Ive had Ive had some really difficult situations with students of youknow basically just really disagreeing over the the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences,45.16129032258064
and oh Im trying to think specifically,25.0
Imean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because then its not just you and the other person,26.31578947368421
is it just in this situation,66.66666666666666
or is it a broader picture problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers,45.45454545454545
and those are things I can think of,62.5

and this was something they were working on,75.0
his ability to listen to her and accept her direction,40.0
long term goal,0.0
and then he took the umbrella and started walking back to school,25.0
and it was okay because the umbrella kept him from getting rained on,61.53846153846154
the end,50.0
okay,0.0
so,0.0
and she loved her father very much,28.57142857142857
but her mother died,25.0
so her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl,35.294117647058826
her name was Cinderella,50.0
this woman came with two daughters,33.33333333333333
but they were unpleasant,50.0
and they were ugly,50.0
we hafta be honest,50.0
they were very ugly,50.0
so theres a great deal of stress after Cinderellas father,36.36363636363637
she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters,45.45454545454545
and they useta make her clean,33.33333333333333
and they useta make her cook,33.33333333333333
and they were very mean to her,57.14285714285714
and they made her live in the attic,50.0
and they made her wear old ugly clothes,25.0
but she was very very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative,14.285714285714285
and she befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds,50.0
and when she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of Fantasialand,43.333333333333336
and so she useta dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown,32.0
but she never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didnt have any nice clothes to wear,47.82608695652174
and they always said to her,50.0
youll never go to the ball,57.14285714285714
youll never go the palace,50.0
so one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big a very big dance because the king was,39.130434782608695
seriously,0.0
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men,46.15384615384615
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day hes going to be the king,50.0
and he needed to have children,16.666666666666664
and he needed to have a wife,28.57142857142857
so they were gonna have a big ball,33.33333333333333
so they were having a ball,50.0
and Cinderellas ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go,9.090909090909092
and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes,37.5
and Cinderella really really wanted to go,0.0
she was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go,56.25
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds,35.294117647058826
and they knew how to sew,33.33333333333333
and they knew how to accessorize,33.33333333333333
and they knew how to design dresses apparently,25.0
so they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella,30.0
and she was so surprised and so excited,25.0
I wonder what was next whispering,50.0
then she,50.0
and at the ball she met the prince,50.0
and it was just love at first sight,37.5
the way it should be,80.0
he loved her and she loved him,57.14285714285714
and they had a wonderful time dancing,28.57142857142857
and then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there,40.0
and they were pulling her dress,50.0
and they were tearing her scarves,50.0
and they chased her away and made her go home,30.0
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry,60.0
and so he sent out a message to,37.5
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry,57.692307692307686
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldnt let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper,43.75
so the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out,40.0
and then the prince did find her,42.857142857142854
and then they got married,20.0
and then the king was happy,33.33333333333333
and we dont really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters,38.46153846153847
the end,50.0

the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree,36.36363636363637

which most people thought really was weird because Im an adult,41.66666666666667
and I still had them at all,28.57142857142857

I think I went to ScottsdaleSamaritan to have it done,40.0
but it they did it ke on a day surgery,60.0

but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning,41.66666666666667
but I couldnt have anything to eat or drink after midnight,33.33333333333333
so by the time I got in there I was ke a little bit dehydrated,40.0
so they couldnt find a vein,42.857142857142854
and they hadta stick me ke six times inorderto,22.22222222222222

they they finally got it in,66.66666666666666
they had TheWall on for the music,57.14285714285714

and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery,46.15384615384615
it was painful,66.66666666666666
I felt I wanted to cry,33.33333333333333
infact I did cry just because it was so unpleasant,50.0
and it hurt so bad,20.0
they were trying to give me ke some water to help kindof,33.33333333333333

it was just it was a mess,71.42857142857143
it was horrible,66.66666666666666
but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out,26.31578947368421
but it was like,75.0
and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out,63.63636363636363

so that made it that much worse,28.57142857142857
I couldnt eat anything really hot because it was hurt it was burning my throat,56.25
and it was probably it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that,47.05882352941176

and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you,40.0
so its its collectively a scary situation all the time because youre in a country and kindof a situation where not everybody likes you,52.0
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just dont want you there,46.666666666666664
so when we would hafta go,66.66666666666666
any time youre on the road youre essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks,43.75
so youre constantly having to watch and look around,20.0
one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you dont stop on the road,55.00000000000001
you just you always keep going,33.33333333333333
you always keep going keep going keep going,12.5
and we were part of a convoy,57.14285714285714
it was like a,100.0
but I guess,33.33333333333333
or he didnt get the memo that you dont stop because it makes you a target,55.55555555555556
and he decided to stop for some cows,37.5
so he decided to stop,20.0
and we all lost our xxx,50.0
Imean we were like,75.0
what are you doing,75.0
but you dont wanna get out because that also makes you a target,50.0
so everybodys,0.0
get back in the vehicles,40.0
get back in the vehicles,40.0
and youre having to yell it,42.857142857142854
so it was a little bit of a of a crazy situation,58.333333333333336
the whole thing probably lasted maybe two minutes,12.5
maybe two minutes,0.0
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to to everything,46.42857142857143
so yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation,45.45454545454545
yes,0.0
this person they have dfklpu,40.0
Imean they have the ability to talk,28.57142857142857
they are dont have the skill base in talking with adults though,46.15384615384615
its a friend of mine who teaches at a,77.77777777777779
so she spends alotof time around,33.33333333333333
so when it comes time to,33.33333333333333
more its being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time,33.33333333333333
I think theres probably some selfesteem issues that go with that,50.0
so shes not out,20.0
shes not socializing,50.0
and then when she does go its like,62.5
its like,50.0
or if theres something thats bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like youknow,47.82608695652174
do you wanna talk,50.0
do you wanna talk,50.0
do you wanna talk,50.0
and you dont ever say anything,42.857142857142854
so eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as thats just part of that persons behavior,38.095238095238095
and thats how theyre theyre choosing not to communicate by,46.15384615384615
okay,0.0
so little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer,36.36363636363637
he had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him,60.0
but his dad said,25.0
no Im very busy,20.0
I hafta watch tv,25.0
so little Billy was kicking the ball around by himself,40.0
and then the ball went too far,14.285714285714285
and it went,33.33333333333333
and it smashed,33.33333333333333
little Billys dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said,25.0
guess I should have gone out there and played with him,45.45454545454545
and now I have dysfunctional family stories,14.285714285714285
so,0.0
okay,0.0
one morning little Billy was getting ready to go to school,18.181818181818183
his mom said,33.33333333333333
little Billy before you leave make sure you take an umbrella,36.36363636363637
and little Billy said,0.0
Mom I live in Arizona,40.0
it never rains here,25.0
I certainly wont need an umbrella,42.857142857142854
and mom said,0.0
okay suit yourself,33.33333333333333
so little Billy started walking to school,14.285714285714285
he got about halfway to school when it started to he started to feel raindrops on his head,44.44444444444444
and he said,33.33333333333333
but the longer it went on the harder it rained,50.0
so he ran all the way home,42.857142857142854
and he said,33.33333333333333
you know what Mom,50.0
you were right,66.66666666666666
I should have taken an umbrella,66.66666666666666
so she gave him the umbrella,50.0
and little Billy continued to walk in walk to school,20.0
and he thought to himself,60.0
boy Arizona weather changes from minute to minute kinda,11.11111111111111
so,0.0
okay,0.0
so Cinderella was living with her father,42.857142857142854
her mother had died a long time ago,50.0
and her father had decided,40.0
its time that you had a mother,57.14285714285714
and you need some brothers and sisters,28.57142857142857
so he went out,50.0
and he found a woman who he thought he could like,54.54545454545454
and he married her and brought her and her two daughters,36.36363636363637
here you go,33.33333333333333
heres your family,33.33333333333333
you now have a new mother,33.33333333333333
and you have new sisters to go along with it,40.0
well what the father didnt know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet,55.55555555555556
and they treated Cinderella horribly,20.0
they made her do all the cooking,57.14285714285714
they made her do all the cleaning while he was off,63.63636363636363
thats why he wasnt around,57.14285714285714
thats why he didnt know what was going on,63.63636363636363
so the,50.0
Cinderella is having to do all the housework,37.5
and shes taking care of everything,57.14285714285714
and the evil s stepsisters are just youknow bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do,33.33333333333333
so Cinderellas only friends were ke the animals that were there,45.45454545454545
and she would talk to them,66.66666666666666
and they would talk to her because they had that special communication,58.333333333333336
then one day from where Cinderella was at she when she would talking with the animals she could see ke,65.0
and off in the distance,40.0
and she always thought,25.0
wow it would be so neat if I could live in a castle,61.53846153846154
that would just be amazing,60.0
but Im Cinderella and that wont ever happen because I hafta make sure that I,41.17647058823529
meanwhile,0.0
and people in the town are,50.0
so hes a little bit worried about it,44.44444444444444
so he says,33.33333333333333
okay heres what well do,20.0
we will put this whole proclamation thing out,50.0
and we will get,50.0
and well let the prince pick one,14.285714285714285
youknow with all the women,60.0
so well bring them all here,33.33333333333333
so they send out a message to,42.857142857142854
they say,50.0
okay were having this big birthday party for the prince,40.0
bring your single daughters,25.0
and because he is going to be picking a wife,50.0
and the evil stepmother gets this message,28.57142857142857
and she says,33.33333333333333
well this is great,50.0
Im going to put my daughters because then we can get outof this hovel and move back in,42.10526315789473
and well be all rich and famous,14.285714285714285
and Cinderella thinks,0.0
wow that would be kinda cool,50.0
maybe I could get into this because Im pretty good at youknow sewing and everything,50.0
and Ive actually made a dress,42.857142857142854
so youknow I should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters,43.75
so she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room,50.0
and the,50.0
wow she looks alot better than we do,37.5
so we cant let that happen,42.857142857142854
so they rip up,50.0
and then they take her,40.0
and they ke,33.33333333333333
and then they take off,40.0
and Cinderella is really sad,20.0
and shes like,50.0
ohno this is really a bummer,50.0
and while shes upset she finds this book,44.44444444444444
and while flipping through the book she sees a reference to a fairy godmother,50.0
so she reads the reference and allofasudden poofo,25.0
and she says,33.33333333333333
well Cinderella Im here to help you out because youve been a very hard worker and you do good things,40.909090909090914

and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her,57.14285714285714
she turns the mice into coachmen,50.0
and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into a big carriage,44.44444444444444
so she does all of this,66.66666666666666
and then she says,25.0
bingo,0.0
the catch is is that you gotta be back by midnight,58.333333333333336
and Cinderella says,0.0
midnight thats cool,25.0
I can live with that,80.0
so she goes over to the coach,57.14285714285714
and they get in there and they take her up,40.0
and shes escorted into the big ball party,44.44444444444444
and everybody is looking going,40.0
wow whos that amazing looking girl over there,22.22222222222222
weve never seen her before,66.66666666666666
but she must be new,60.0
so she comes in,50.0
and the stepsisters see her,40.0
and theyre like,50.0
she looks familiar but we cant quite place her,40.0
but somethings just not right,0.0
so the prince sees her and says,28.57142857142857
wow youre a pretty good looking girl,25.0

lets talk,0.0
so theyre dancing,50.0
and theyre talking,50.0
theyre having a great time,50.0
and hes like,50.0
wow this is amazing,50.0
I think I found the woman of my dreams,55.55555555555556
when she happens to look at the clock and says,40.0
oh I got to go and,16.666666666666664
and while shes running off to get back into the coach she loses a shoe,50.0
so she drops,33.33333333333333
but she,50.0
and at midnight bingo,25.0
and everything goes back to normal,33.33333333333333
but she still has the other glass slipper,25.0
so she says,33.33333333333333
oh this is a nice souvenir,50.0
so she holds on to that,66.66666666666666
and then the next day the prince is like,44.44444444444444
well I gotta find this girl because this is the woman of my dreams,53.333333333333336
so I have this shoe,40.0
itll fit whoever was wearing it,71.42857142857143
so Ill just go around to all,28.57142857142857
and I will try and put this shoe on them,50.0
and whoever fits is gonna be is the one is the woman Im looking for,58.82352941176471
so he goes from house to house to house,44.44444444444444
and some peoples feet are too big,28.57142857142857
and some peoples feet are too small,28.57142857142857
and some people just they dont have feet at all so they dont even get to wear it,35.0
and he finally comes to the evil stepsisters and the stepmothers house,33.33333333333333
and hes trying to,40.0
and theyre like,50.0
so they just dont fit,33.33333333333333
in the meantime Cinderella has been trapped back,50.0
shes shes stuck in a room because the stepmother doesnt want her to be seen by the prince,52.38095238095239
not because she thinks its her or anything,62.5
so so the mice realize,20.0
hey we got to get Cinderella out because this is her really chance to to excel and shine,33.33333333333333
so they smuggle the key in,50.0
and she unlocks the door,40.0
and she comes out,50.0
and shes like,50.0
hey I think you found my shoe,42.857142857142854
