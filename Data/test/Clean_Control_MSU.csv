haven't had that many gram
but when I was I guess around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader
and I was in practice
and I was doing
which I can't believe I did
but headstands and head back flips
and doing a flip I fell
I tripped
and I came down
and I broke my arm
so I remember that instance
I remember it quite clearly being driven
it was a CYO thing
so I remember being driven in in the car by the priest and the my my other friends around me and going to the hospital and and having my arm taken care of and having surgery
so
I was in a cast
you hafta remember it was a long time ago
so I was in a cast
and I was in a cast for a long time
I do remember my father making me slings that were the holidays
so because it went through many holidays
and and then once it was you know once it
I went back to being a cheerleader again
it's a little misshapen
but it's fine
so I no longer do back flips to say the least
well my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight
well the problems were that he could not communicate
right after his stroke he really had no language at all
so the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and and has continued at this clinic
and this is almost four years later since his stroke
so I've seen the development of the speech patterns emerging
and what I have seen is him is him recapture language
I I think very similar to what I see in a child
so in moving in in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see
okay
well I guess the thing that always stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident
and and I remember asking the question
is he alive
and it was such a strange question
but I needed an answer to it
and they said on the other on the the other side of the phone they didn't know
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and and getting out there
and I remember hearing the sirens as I was as I was approaching
and when I got there you know he had already been in a he had already been out
he didn't know who I was
and he didn't know who anyone was
but luckily and but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him
so they knew that he wasn't drunk
they knew that he wasn't impaired in any other way
and he knew enough to know that he was he had a stroke
and I remember he was the one who said to me
get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to
and I remember this police officer
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him when Anthony was on the force
so he came in as a as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant
and so you know I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you know in that it was very much like a like a movie or you know
but and I remember getting down into the into the brain attack center
and everybody was doing what they needed to do
and it was all this kind of prescribed dance that went on
and you know getting him there and and getting him that shot and and that starting
and and you know and then from there it was just the recovery
it was the day in day out routine
but I do remember that
that stays with me
yeah it does absolutely
okay exc
well a boy is outside
and he's playing looks like soccer
so he's kicking the ball
and lo and behold it goes into the neighbor's or his own window and crashes through that window
and there's the the man who's sitting and either watching t v or talking or having a conversation
and the soccer ball comes through the window hits the lamp
and the gentleman inside is really quite surprised
he then has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man
and the mother is saying to him
take this umbrella because I think it's going to rain
and he's saying
no no no I don't need that umbrella
I'm leaving
so she's got the umbrella in hand
and he's out the door
and then lo and behold the rain starts
and he is caught in the rain
and he is really wet
and he makes his way home
and his mother is looking at him saying
I told you so
and let's get the umbrella
and then you can go back out
well it's a series of circumstances
and the little girl's cat is in the tree
she was looks like she was riding her bike
and she was she saw her cat up in the tree
she could have called her dad
and her dad said
okay I'm going to help you and go get the cat
and took the ladder
and it doesn't seem like the ladder is quite as as high as what he needed to
so anyway the
no I'm sorry exc
then it looks like he used the ladder
and the ladder has fallen
and he is stuck in the tree
and the dog is barking because they a re all up in the tree
and the firemen hafta come and rescue
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house
and there was a stepmother
and the stepmother had two daughters
the father dies
and the daughters the stepmother has a sense of favoritism towards her children her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they so to speak
so Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and and all of that
and then the the the stepsisters grow meaner and meaner as the time goes
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more jealous of Cinderella
and then comes the the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the for there to be a dance
and everybody is all is all you know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the the perfect outfit
and and Cinderella is not going to go to the ball
and she is at home
and and and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot
so they find I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the in a in a hope chest or I guess what I would call now a hope chest
and so that becomes
I don't wait a minute exc
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing
so the sisters go to the ball
and and poor Cinderella is home with her mice
and and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe
so the fairy godmother creates the the carriage to take her in
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect
and and her fairy godmothers then help her to go to the ball
so when when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there
and everyone is just
takes her breath away and she takes their breath away
and she meets the prince
and they dance
and they have a wonderful time
but what happens is the clock strikes twelve
and she needs to be home
and she is running out the door
and her slipper is her shoe is left behind
so she goes home
the sisters and whatnot they all go home
and and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper
and he combs through the village
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers
and it doesn't work
and then lo and behold he finds Cinderella
and the shoe fits
they get married
and they live happily ever after
the end the end exc
and way too many girls are looking for Prince charming exc
but that's a whole other issue yes exc
I would get the bread
first well I would get the bread out of the
for me I keep my bread in the freezer
so I would take it out of the freezer and let it defrost
my peanut butter stays in a cabinet
my jelly is in the refrigerator
so the bread comes out first
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out
once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter
put the other slice of bread on
and slice it in a triangle motion
there you go
www
I will tell you about a cheerleading accident
and I broke my arm
and I was in I believe it was sophomore it was my sophomore year in high school
and I was in the gymnasium
and we were practicing
and I did a back flip
and I came down on my arm
and I remember hearing it crack
it was CYO so it was it was not in a public school
and I remember the some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital
and I remember that I was in the hospital for almost a week
I'd never really been sick and have since really been sick gram
but so I I remember being in a cast for quite a long time
and and and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long
I had a Christmas sling and a and whatnot
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling
but I can now tell the weather
oh well I was I was fourteen years old
your body just gets better
I I there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that
it was going back I never went back to the squad
I tried to do twirling
and I just couldn't do the hand motions
and so I never went back to that
so
besides my husband
well after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him and realizing that he needed time for processing and and sort of understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them gram
so that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability gram
so he he was able to do that gram
so after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sort of a little bit of self teaching and and and giving him time to find his words and and thinking of the process as as as a child learns speech again gram
so I tried to educate myself on on how children learn language
and then from that he sort of followed that same process but only speeding it up
so he had the foundation there so
but mostly just giving him time gram
happy sad gram

in the summers we would go to the beach
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins
and we were always close
and we went to a place in Long Branch
and it was this sort of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families would would get into a room would get a room
and then you would get a parcel of a of a kitchen
and and you know when you think about it now gram
but and so we would go
and my folks never had much money
and and so they would sort of save up for this week
and and we would go to the and we we would all stay in this one room
and I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother
and and we would just we would go to the beach
and we would just have a great time
and I so I remember going to the pool
they would have salt water pool
I remember it being really cold
so you would jump in in the morning
and you know you would just spend your whole day there
and you would be spent by the end of the day
and and I still remember the smells and the sights of it so
you know and I remember the the routines
being Catholic on a on a Saturday gram
there was a place called Rutt's Hut which I think is still around
but it was this little over the boardwalk over the beach kind of place
and it was
and on Friday nights my my mother and my aunt and and they'd wake us all up to go to Rutt's Hup
and that would be our our treat
we were probably all in our pajamas
and and but we would all get out there
and and so it became a a sort of a ritual that we all did together
but I remember just playing on the beach and you know
so it was just a good time
yeah it was
it was a lot of fun
and with those cousins we're still close and still share a lot of things so
a boy is outside
and he's playing a game of soccer
so he's out for the afternoon and playing with
I don't see any friends so I think he's just playing sort of a kick the ball
and he's in his in his neighborhood
and lo and behold the ball finds its way into a window of a either his own family or or a neighbor next door
and there is a gentleman that's sitting maybe watching tv
I don't see a newspaper so he's watching some tv
and the window
he gets up to see who it is
and you kind of wonder did the boy run away or is the boy still there
I guess the mother heard the weather report be cause she had an umbrella in hand as the as the little boy is walking out the door
but he I guess took a look outside and said
no you know I don't see any I don't see any rain so I don't wanna take a an umbrella
so he says goodbye to his mom
and he's walking out the door
and then maybe he gets a couple steps
and here comes the rain
and he's like
uhoh I better get back home and see if I can get that umbrella
so he gets in the door
and his mother is looking at him and saying
I told you it was going to rain
so let me give you the umbrella
and then you can walk to school
and you'll be dry
a girl is riding her bike
so she's she's out on her bike
and she's going through the neighborhood and all of a sudden looks up and sees her cat in the tree
and calls to her dad and asks her dad to come on come over and help her get the cat
and the father brings over his ladder and puts it against the tree and starts to go for the cat and the ladder falls
and so now he's stuck in the tree
and the dog is barking trying to get everybody's attention I guess
or he's barking at the dog
or he's really barking at the cat probably
and the girl has the father takes out his cell phone
we'll put it in that situation now exc
calls the firemen
and he calls the fire the fire people from his town
and they come on over
and they will rescue the cat and the and the man
and the bird will still sing their
and the dog will stop barking
well the story opens with Cinderella's dad coming home with his new wife and their two children and and her two daughters
and what we find out later on is that the father has died
and this woman now becomes her stepmother
and as they grow then Cinderella becomes more of the servant to the to the stepmother and to the two girls
and a letter comes to them or an announcement comes to the family
and there is a there's going to be a ball
and the ball is going to be held at the castle
she wants to go makes a some sort of a dress
and then later on the stepmother and the the stepdaughters find out about it ridicule her kind of take the dress apart disassemble it
and she's left home doing scrubbing something scrubbing some scrubbing some pot or other
and she then will she's then left home
and all of a sudden lo and behold comes the fairy godmother
and and they whip her up a beautiful dress you know
well it's just a whole new thing of Chanel
and so they they whip her up this brand new dress
and she is then able to to go to the ball
and the ball is set for a reason
and the reason is is that the prince is to find a wife
and she's given instructions that she needs to be home by twelve midnight
and and the the fairy godmother provides her with this beautiful dress and these wonderful glass slippers and and a whole coach of of pumpkins that turn to to a coach and and with horsemen etcetera
and so she goes there
and she is the belle of the ball
and everyone is oohing and aahing because they don't know who she is
she then will go to the clock
well she's dancing and whatnot
and the clock s ks u
she hasta leave
and she's running away
and the prince is you know after her
and she loses a slipper so this is all that the prince hasta find this woman
so he combs the land and finally comes to the house of the of Cinderella with this wicked stepmother
and so they try on the the slipper
and it doesn't fit the mother the stepmother or the the the stepdaughters
and lo and behold they find Cinderella
and and the glass slipper fits
and to coin that phrase they live happily ever after
with two pieces of bread I would get a plate to put the bread on
get a knife to to spread the peanut butter
and get a spoon to get the
no I wouldn't get a spoon
I'd use the same knife
so I take the peanut butter out of I unscrew the top take the peanut butter with my knife and spread it on the bread
spread it on only the one side
get the jelly and put it on top of the peanut butter
and put the top put the other slice of bread on it probably press it down a little bit and then slice it
put the covers back on
just anything about it
well I I I'm a breast cancer survivor of five years
and I remember being operated on three times for lumpectomy
and the pain you know you remember that
and the the the just I guess the rehabilitation part of it gram
the the being tired all the time gram
and then finally gettin g better you know feeling more like a human being again gram
that's and then knock on wood you know I've been okay
I slept a lot
I still do
I I like to sleep
but I I worked
I whenever people would say
why you comin g you know why you goin g to work
why don't you just
I I found that to be more therapeutic than being home sleeping
you know I I slept at night
but I'd but I'd rather come to work and work
so soon as I had the radiation I came to work and worked a whole day and went home and collapsed and you know
but that to me was more therapeutic than anything just to keep going
do I have a difficult time
well I guess I I should say yeah
I guess through illness and my grandson is not he doesn't speak English yet
he's he's only one and a half years old
so you know like he doesn't he but we communicate in a different form
so I guess you you know you understand what they're trying to say eventually
you know they'll they'll make a point of telling you somehow
you know you figure it out
some form of sign language if anything gram
that you know
well we have our own little sign language right now
I don't know why but everytime he sees me he goes
ah
and that's that's the grandmother does this I guess you know
so he you know and
he and then right away it means getting a cookie out of the drawer
you know so he knows he understands I'm the one that gives him the cookies all the time
so you know but it's fun
and yeah I guess you know and in the you want you know when he wants his a sip of water
you know there's different just like with any child you know there's different ways that they they present themselves that they they let you know that they want their lunch
and they start laughing when you show them the right thing you know
it's it's it's a rewarding experience when you finally get it right you know
something important
I guess the most important thing I can remember is when my children were born
that was the most the best day of my life on both occasions like giving birth and and holding them in my arms and and what a miracle it was you know
that that was an amazing experience
I don't think there's anything that comes close to that out of everything I've ever done
but the I guess and the day I got married gram
that was you know different events I guess that were were important you know
but I guess the the most important ones were the day day the days I gave birth
those I had a son and a daughter first and then a son two years later
well the little boy's having fun kicking his soccer ball
and finally he's walkin g down the street
and he kicks it too hard
and it goes into the window
and the man is startled when the ball comes flying through
and eventually the male man's got the soccer ball lookin g for the the little boy that that broke the glass out the window gram
I don't know if he's a relative or he knows him even
but but exc
he's he's lookin g for him
he doesn't he doesn't look like he's anywhere around there
okay
looks like the the mom is trying to give the little boy an umbrella
but I think he decides he doesn't need it and goes outside
and it starts to rain
and he hasta he comes back soakin g wet
and his mom's like
I told you you needed the umbrella
and then he leaves with the umbrella
and he's all happy
and the he's he's he's walkin g in the puddles too
that's somethin g I would do exc
exc
looks like the little girl's cat got stuck up a tree
and a man went to help get the cat out of the tree
and a dog came chasin g after him and is barkin g at him
and finally the firetruck is coming
the firemen are comin g with the fire fire ladder to get the both of them out of the tree
and it looks like the bird's laughin g at both of them
but and the little girl's yellin g
jump
and it
but they both are scared
they don't wanna jump down
but thank God for the fire department
both of my son in laws are firemen exc
that's great exc
well Cinderella's father gets married to a woman who has two daughters
and and then her father dies
and the stepmother knowing her her her stepdaughter is so beautiful and everything makes her sleep in the
oh I don't remember where she slept actually exc
but makes her do all the housework and clean and act act like a servant maid in the house
and Cinderella befriends all the animals
and the birds love her
and the all the animals love Cinderella
and the king wants the son to get married and has a ball
and everyone is invited
all the young women in in in the in the country are invited to go
and the stepmother finds out that Cinderella was planning on going too
and they all destroy her dress

but her fairy godmother comes and makes her the most gorgeous gown and makes her look so beautiful and glass slippers
and she goes to the ball
and the prince falls in love with her
and but she hadta be back by the stroke of midnight

and she loses her slipper on the way
and the prince finds it and sends his his countrymen well his his servants out to find out where she is who who wear m
and they finally find Cinderella
and they live happily ever after
I would take actually I would take two slices of bread
and I would put peanut butter on smear peanut butter on the one slice and jelly on the other the other half
and then put them together
and cut it in half
and serve it
well the illness would have the big one I guess would have been breast cancer
and I had that in two thousand and five
I had an lumpectomy in October
and then they didn't get it all
and I hadta have another one in in December
and they didn't get it all
and it was my last chance in order to save my breast
I had I had one more in February of two thousand and six
and that one worked
that was that was good so
it I remember recuperating was a long process
I also had radiation
and it made me tired
but I worked I worked every day
I didn't miss any work
still came to work gram
it was therapeutic to come to work just to be cause if I was home I would go nuts thinkin g about stuff
so it was good to be busy and come to work
and I got through it
you know and and luckily all is well yet you know
so that's a
but it's it was a long haul at the time
sleep a lot gram
I slept a lot whenever I was tired and which would happen randomly
not at work gram
I didn't I didn't sleep at work though you know
but I felt like it I know
but I I'd I'd come home from work and just take a nap before I even had dinner with my husband
we'd we'd take a nap
and then and then got up and had dinner and took another nap and then went to bed gram
but I slept a lot
that's about all I remember as far as the
it I guess it was a way of dealing with it too
you know at the time I I was if I slept I didn't hafta think about things
so it was
but my husband was real great
he took good care of me
and my daughter gram
and and I don't know what I would have done without them
they were they were good
yeah have good support you have it makes you better real fast you know gram
well I have I have an eighteen month old grandson who's just learning how to speak
and but yet I understand what he wants you know by by you know the different sounds mean different things even though they're not English
you kinda know what he's talkin g about
and otherwise
well I do have a my my my my stepdaughter's in laws speak Spanish
and the the the her mother in law does speak a little English but not much at all
and the her father in law doesn't speak any English so
and I don't speak any Spanish so
but we do we do have a conversation
it's kind of funny
I don't know if we're talkin g about the same thing
but we you know we both seem to think we are
but and we he passes me the things when I need it at the table you know
if there's salt and pepper
so I we you know you do you find sign language
but you make your own sign language I guess if you you know if you don't know sign language
which but you you know you there's ways of indicating what you need or wants m
I guess they know
that but that's I guess that's the only I my mom had a stroke in two thousand and nine but didn't recover from it
she she she passed away from it
so that was you know so that was I only had three days of dealing with her her speaking
but and it was it was repetitive
she was stuttering speaking at that point
everything was
I I need need need need
you know it was that kind of talk
it was hard for her
but but then I really didn't I didn't have that long a long a time to really develop any kind of a language with her
about something that happened
well I remember when my kids were my my son and daughter were in middle school
and every President's Day week we useta take the auto train down to Florida for that week and meet my parents down in down by Disney World and go to Disney World
and the one time we got on the train my husband worked for the train
and there was a deadhead
deadhead means when they're towing the a part of a train back to where it needs to be
there was a deadhead deadheaded presidential car being towed back to
well actually I guess it's we we rode it the whole way
it was going down to Florida
because it it wasn't just to DC
well we picked it up in DC
so we went all the way to Florida in that one
so we ended up being able to use the presidential car
and we each on the train we each had our
my it was my son my daughter myself and my husband
and we each had our own bed our own bathroom
it was and it was just it was just amazing to go to travel like that
how I guess the the rich and famous travel like that
but it was I said to my kids
enjoy it now be cause we're never probably gonna ever do this again you know
it was it was amazing
but it and to lay in bed and watch as you're lookin g out the window at the scenery goin g by
it was just and we had two pillows each you know
it was it was just livin g it on the train
it was so nice
and and we went to Disney World too
that was fun too
but the train ride was an amazing trip
it was it was fun
and that was I guess one thing that I do remember
that was fun a really fun time that we had on the train
well there's this little boy who's outside with a soccer ball
and he's kickin g it around
and he's kickin g it around
and all of a sudden he kicks it a little too hard
and it goes into the window where it comes almost on the lap of the man sittin g in his chair
and it startles him gets him scared
and he gets up
and he's lookin g out the window for that little boy
I'm sure that little boy took off
you know but he he's lookin g out the window for him
well there's this little boy again and his mom
and he's off to go to school
and his mom says
you know it looks like it's gonna rain
you better take the umbrella
and he says
mom I don't need the umbrella
it's not gonna rain
I'm not gonna need it
and he leaves to go
and all of a sudden it starts raining
and it starts raining raining
he gets drenched
and he hasta turn around and go back and tell his mom
you were right
it's raining
and I need the umbrella
and he gets the umbrella and goes off to school
that's moms always know exc
well it looks like I think there was a cat that was being chased by a dog up the tree
and the little girl it was her cat gram
and she's she wants her cat to get down from the tree
and so I imagine it's her father that decides to climb up the tree
but he gets stuck up the tree
he can't get down
and finally somebody called the fire department to come rescue all of them
they the father and the cat were stuck up the tree
so they the fire department came through again
so it's a story about a daughter and her father
and her mother dies
and her father remarries
and the woman he marries has two daughters
who the the stepmother thinks her daughters are beautiful magnificent and doesn't want Cinderella to get any anything once the father passes away
makes Cinderella do all the work
and her she wants Cinderella to be her servant and and clean the house
and there's this handsome prince that lives in town
and the prince's father the king decides it's time for his daughter
and he sends a notice out to everyone in town all the women that are eligible to come and to a ball to dress up and come to this ball
and Cinderella wants to go
and the she gets her dress
I think it was her mother's dress if I remember correctly
and she's gonna wear that
and the sisters find her trying it on
and they they rip it on her and make a mess of the dress
and so she can't go to the ball in that dress
and off the the the stepsisters go to the ball
and the fairy godmother comes and helps Cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up
and she looked just gorgeous
and sends her off to the ball with a coach and a coachman gram
and goes to the ball with glass slippers gram
and dances with the prince gram
and the prince falls in love
and the only one thing was that she hadta be leave the ball by twelve o'clock on the strike of twelve
she hadta get out of there or she was gonna turn back into her rag clothes again
so she was havin g a wonderful time
and she hasta leave the ball when the when the clock starts striking twelve
and she loses one of her glass slippers
and the prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this glass slipper
and finally they they they weren't gonna try Cinderella be cause she they nobody thought she was at the ball
but they finally try her foot in the slipper
and it fits perfectly
and she turns back into this gorgeous gown and clothing again
and and the prince marries her
and they live happily ever after
okay
to make a sandwich if I'm gonna make a whole sandwich I would use two pieces of bread
and smear the peanut butter on one half and the jelly on the other half of bread
and then put them together
and cut it in half or fours whatever way you like it
and eat it
you mean in terms of how I felt or what happened
I was I was thrown off of a horse once which was was quite traumatic
and the horse reared up and seemingly simultaneously kicked back
and I was thrown in the air and tumbled pretty much head over heels in front of the horse
and I was out with a group of horses riding along a beach
and the the rest of them were behind me and just went galloping over me
and it it was that was really scary
I I love horses
I love all animals
but I never went horseback riding again
it was serious and I ended up with a serious back injury
it didn't manifest right away which I found out in my travels through the osteopathic world that they oftentimes don't
sometimes years can go by before you realize that there's been a disc injury or anything like that which is why most people don't connect it with an accident
sometimes you know great a great deal of time could go by years
and suddenly they aren't saying
oh I remember I fell off that horse five years ago
you know they're thinking what happened to me yesterday or last week so
but that was traumatic
noone trampled me but it it
yeah and the the terror of watching them you know running over me
it was pretty bad
yeah yeah no it was very scary
my back
oh yeah
when it first went out so to speak I ended up seeing an orthopedic surgeon
didn't want surgery gram
totally against it gram
was lucky enough to find an osteopath who
he's not a chiropractor but they do manipulations
and I've met people who have had surgery
and I'm doing way better than them
I've had a bout three rounds of physical therapy
and I also began doing weight work to strengthen my upper body
there was a time where I could you know be taking a gallon of milk or a half gallon of milk out of the dairy case
and it would go right to my fifth lumbar
so now my my biceps and shoulders have been strengthened with regular weight work
so there are things you can do you know
and I'm doing better than many people
the disc was cracked
so but surgery never seems to be a solution
no
no
I understand how to lift and bend
and I just strengthened myself
mhm
not really
I mean from time to time in our day to day you'll encounter people but never you know a for a sustained period of time or did I ever work with any person like that
oh yes
no it usually goes pretty well
a combination of demonstrating and signs you know showing them something and what little what few words I do know gram
well maybe more than a few words in some languages gram
and they tend to know a little bit of English
I remember I was I was in Frankfurt once by myself and I ended up going to a pub
I don't think they called them that in Germany
but anyway I had a wonderful time talking to people
I don't speak German
and a lot of Germans do have some you know language recognition in terms of English
but I tend to get along okay
there are way other ways than words to communicate
and it's fun
when my daughter was born
favorite day of my life well the worst and the best gram
I had I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell
and it was just it had no you know that old song what a difference a day makes
I mean from the pregnancy which was just wonderful gram
I ate everything I wanted
I felt terrific
I was working full time
my freezer looked like an Oreida convention
I could eat my you know my crinkle cuts my shoe strings with pasta
I could do anything
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say
my my my obstetrician you know during the the buildup to this would say you'll be sorry
and I said you know I cannot imagine regretting this
you know I'm eating I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the the the the
it's two pieces of pound cake you know with the Hagen Dazs in in the middle
so then I get to the hospital
and it was really nasty
it was really it was probably the worst experience I ever had
I was told that if I had automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward
that's what I was told
and I did it did spark revenge in me that I actually carried out
you know my my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook
he said
well we're just going to break your water
it'll move things along
I said
no
don't
step back
step back
just leave me alone
I can do this myself you know
and then he kept saying
relax
I don't understand while you're not relaxed
and this is psychological I'm sure
every time he said relax I became even more infuriated
you know this is the effect it had on me
and he wasn't listening when I said stop saying that
when you tell some one to stop doing X you expect them to stop doing that
so anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful
she was born smiling right away recognized my voice
it was just the the most special experience of my whole life
and so now I went for my first postpartum checkup
and I'm sitting on the table
and he you know does the finger pricks and to get some blood out
and he turns around
and he puts the little tube in the machine
and then he turns it on
and the machine is whirring
and I quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock
it happened really fast
and I threw him on to the table
and then I jumped on top of him put my knee in his groin
and I was
his glasses were askew
and he his tie was crooked
and I said
relax
relax
I don't understand why you're not relaxed
what's the matter you know
it was such a calamity
and although you know it was all in good fun because later on you know he
and his wife useta work in his office
and they had a nurse too
and they said
selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives
it's really selfish on I on our part
so that was it
that's it Keli
that was a big big experience you know Pee Wee's big adventure
well it seems there's a boy out playing
kicks the soccer ball gram
unfortunately it goes right into the window breaks it
I'm gonna guess that's his father sitting there
now he gets the ball
and he's looking at the surveying the damage and his son I guess
and it doesn't doesn't look like it's going to end too too well
might be a problem gram
okay well here's this little child I guess leaving for school
mother saying
take your umbrella
child says gram
no no I don't need an umbrella
very optimistic
I do the same thing exc
now it's raining
and now it's pouring
and then the child comes home you know obviously soaking wet
the mother is kind of in her I told you so q adj mode
and the little the little boy I guess it is he learned a lesson
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella
life is learning from one's mistakes exc
listen to your mother exc
well the cat's up in the tree
they get stuck in trees I guess
I've I've heard stories like that
I guess it's the the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like she's ready to catch the cat
the little dog of course wants the cat down for different reasons
and then the fire department shows up
which they're good like that
they got the ladder
and all is well
so Cinderella is sent to live with this with a family
and she is basically a a maid
and they there are the two the two
I think it's the wicked stepsisters if I recall
and they were they were rather homely
and Cinderella of course was very pretty
and she's very you know sweet and helpful
and these two are kind of spoiled and you know not very pleasant
and there's going to be a ball
and I I believe invitations go out
and the two sisters are going to they're going to go to the ball
and Cinderella is not invited
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in
and Cinderella ends up with
well it's all magical you know right
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach
and by dint of you know luck and good favor from the fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight
so she's dancing with the prince having a wonderful time
the other two sisters I I forgot where
they just kind of melted into the background
they weren't very popular
I could have told you that from the beginning you know exc
but anyhow Cinderella finds out what time it is
and she needs to leave you know to get into the the the carriage to go back before midnight
and she her slipper fill
and the prince finds it
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that you know he wants to find this this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper
I remember the details now from my own picture book exc
put it on
when when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet
and the slipper was even half not even half the size of her foot
so anyway they locked Cinderella up
I think nobody wanted them to find her
and the mice helped
they brought the key
and the mice she you know the animals loved her
they were her friends
and of course it all ends happily ever after
she does it does it is discovered that the slipper fits her
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince
just the way we all live gram exc
it's exactly what my experience has been exc
it's the same thing exc
it's like they it's like they met me exc
and they you know they they it was the you know really it was like they knew me exc
it's so uncanny exc
alright well first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture
now when I make a sandwich
and it's not just with peanut butter and jelly
I I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up you know
it's got to be just right
so anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter
again two slices of bread is nice but for this we'll put the peanut butter on first with a knife
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around
and it it just works better than with the knife
and that's it exc
you know in this case you could cut it in half fold it in half get another piece
you know if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle you know like that
and that's it exc
I like a good s m d u
oh gee
actually I fainted once
and that's a terrible feeling
and I guess you know I guess we could compare that to a a stroke in the sense that it's a sudden onset
and you do have a a short window if it's the same as a stroke
there in my case there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong
and you do have time to to be cognizant of being in big trouble
in fact I remember one time I I I fainted
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house
and that was I was really afraid of of the fact that I was in a hard tile room
and my daughter was downstairs
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight
and I just in a panic I said
Dolly call nine one one
so I knew I was in trouble
and I I then I I was able to just slowly go down myself
and then I went out of the picture
and the paramedics did take me to the hospital
and I had food poisoning
and when I got
now that was really frightening as you know they they're racing me through the the e r
they're asking me you know all sorts of information
and and the pocketbook disappears
and then you know testing and monitors and all that gram
and they said
you know your potassium level is in the basement
so it was really a
and you know you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either you know in the hospital or even dying
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to those sort of sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly
so it was truly an emergency situation
so and my daughter as young as she was you know I credit Natalie with you know the fact that it wasn't worse
that she she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed nine one one
yeah so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice I think
right
and that's probably as scary just like that
yeah yeah
I was in the hospital for the night
and they gave me a liquid potassium
and then in i vs gram
and then I left the hospital with
well before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions you know to to call
but it was liquid potassium and i vs for many hours
and they were monitoring me and you know taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that
so but you know I was out you know by the next morning
but still
I felt really weak and tired
I mean you needed to recover
the the the rest of that day was really kind of not on the map you know
but I mean I I just felt really really tired
and wiped out maybe is better
tired tired doesn't capture it
you know it was scary
you know when you see these stories right
you you hear them
somebody died
how do they die
right right
it can be serious
and I had been doing a good deed that day
I was at the Yogi Berra stadium
at the time and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation
and I was at the Yogi Berra stadium working an event
it was family day
and they had I had some chicken
and that's that's what did me in
trying to do a good thing right gram
they almost killed me
yes
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it
a very dear friend of mine was was had cancer and was dying
you know she was at that you know close point
and she I guess it was the liver starting to shut down
you know the again the organs the the kidney and liver especially the liver gram
and she was incoherent
and she was speaking to me
this was a very strange experience
she was speaking to me
but I couldn't understand a single word that she said
and it was just gibberish
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way
and she would it would be frustrating for her that I wasn't understanding what she said
and it sounded like words too
but it wasn't
and I spoke with the the nurse who was caring for her
she was at home
and I was told that when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of you know the medical sequence of events gram
but but that that's very frustrating to be
and I could see the frustration on her face
and then I feel badly
and I feel frustrated too because I I really wanna understand and and can't
well you could only have simple communications at that point sort of like point to things
and then I would I would I would tell her at different intervals
I cannot understand what you're saying
and she would feel even worse
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was saying words
I I realized that pretty pretty quickly
she she thought she was you know saying things
so I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or just pretend sometimes I even understood
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever gram
you know then she would it would be pretty clear I'm not coming with the water
but that that that's very frightening
and and it's frustrating for everyone
you're imprisoned in your own body in a way aren't you
yeah that hasta be a hell
""
something important
I guess a lot of important things sort of happened you know
be hard to
I think I think in a sense I made my own important things
for instance I grew up in a family
I was one of five children
and now I don't want this to sound you know politically incorrect but my father was Italian of Italian descent
and he had this mind set that girls just don't go to college
and unfortunately four of us were girls
so he didn't that wasn't a
he wasn't pleased with that either I don't think
and I was the third one
can you imagine
in a row gram
no boys yet gram
so anyhow it was made very clear that college was not on the map
and his his his idea was that
I've been supporting you all these years
and now you owe me
you know you hafta go to work and contribute to the household
so this was a built in thing
at the time I wasn't realizing how grave it was
in fact there was something that felt almost exciting about it
that I'll be going to work soon you know
and the good news was that I was also an honor student
and I got to high school at twelve
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete
and now I was going to work
so my guidance counselor at the school was she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student
she actually wanted to call him
and I was very calm about the whole thing
I said
there's really no point
you know it's you're not going to get anywhere
this is the state of things
it's the state of the art at the Lastname household
and that's that
so anyway she then decided to take me under her wing and knew someone down on Wall Street and who worked at a personnel department at what was then the Irving Trust Company which no longer exists
and they took great pride in that that company
they they were at one Wall Street
and they considered themselves at the top of Wall Street
and this was verbalized
so anyway she called her friend
and I'll never forget her
her name was Firstname Lastname who I went to see
so I I put a suit on went shopping and bought myself you know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview
and I think I was a shoo in because her friend the guidance counselor had called her
and so she hired me
and I ended up in a subbasement
not just a basement
it was a subbasement
I think I was lower than the vaults
in a secretarial pool where else gram
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool
I did
and good good on me gram
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to
even though I had an academic course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study
and I and I I took typing and stenography
I thought this might help me
and maybe my job won't be so random
I have at least a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up you know
so I end up in a secretarial pool
and they banks are notoriously very frugal
and back then the things were even worse
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization
and I I I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved
so if somebody you know in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches you know where I was
so I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in
it was sort of like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at being at any orphanage where a call comes in
and they pick you
so they a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust department on the twelfth floor
he was a a a senior vice president of the bank
his secretary was unexpectedly out
and they needed a fill in
so they selected me
and up I went
and I walked in
and you could hear a pin drop in this place
I could tell it was going to be
I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of you know lightheartedness
you you know it it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water
and you should genuflect you know before you to sit down at your desk
so there I am
and it turned out that his secretary
I'll fast forward a little
so here I was
you know my skills were good
I'm answering the phone
I'm taking shorthand letters
things are getting things are humming along
everything is great
and it turns out that she the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back
she was pregnant and was having some difficulties some complications so the the absence was going to be long term
and they hired me
so now and I had a raise right away
I thought this work life is a cinch
I'm here for a week and I got a raise
I got out of the subbasement you know
I'm in the light of day
things were you know things were moving along so quickly that I I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall Street you know
it was the trajectory I was on
so one day I was there I was there for about three months I guess
and I was out to lunch still trying to you know explore the area
it's a very exciting place you know
Wall Street
and I found the New York Stock Exchange
and I you know I was sort of like a pseudo tourist
so I was walking up Broadway one day
and I encounter the Marine Midland Bank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving
it just you know it was a great place light and airy modern
I went in
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was
so I was directed there
I sat down filled out an application
and I was drunk with power by then you know because I had gotten the raise
things were moving so quickly
so I filled out the application
the interview with the personnel manager went very well
she told me about three different types of positions I could have
and visited all three of them gram
and I could pick whichever one I wanted
so I picked the one in the international department
that sounded really interesting to me
and was working for an executive there gram
and it was just a wonderful environment
and I was in the Latin American division
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and Chile
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when there was the coup d'etat in Chile when Salvador Allende was
and we had lots of money
we we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin American area
so those were those were some pretty exciting times
and I then I was there for a few years
and my direct boss who was the he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor
so of course you know how romance always wins out
I had a boyfriend
I didn't wanna move to Paris
and many people probably would have said Paris you know
and it would have been
I look back
I probably made the wrong choice be cause the romance didn't work out either
but that's okay
so I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a little more fast moving and exciting
I I figured this is a good you know juncture to get out of banking
it seemed very staid no matter where you were
so I I I got a an agent
I had you know kind of felt my way around you know how things work down on the street by then
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms
so to fast forward
hope that wasn't too long a story gram
then I I I I had my daughter
I was a stay at home mom
and the college thing was always on my mind
so I applied to Montclair State
and and I was accepted
I came in at the time was a second career program gram
and the important thing was that I did it
I got my degree
and I graduated summa cum laude
and I had marvelous experiences
and plus I was a day student
and that was another thing for me
I realized that I could still kind of live the life I might have
when I mention a day student it's because I was a young always among young mainstream students
and I thought
gee maybe I'll be sort of ostracized from main society here
but I wasn't
and they liked me
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience
so I got the degree anyway
and here I am
yeah
you're welcome
yeah this is that same disaster that we had last week exc
disastro
the boy is outside having fun you know kicking around the soccer ball
and crash gram
it goes right through the window
looks like his father
knocks the lamp over too I see
the father was happen happened to be sitting in the chair
and he gets up
and he's got the ball in his hand
he looks out the window
and seems like the boy is going to have a bad evening
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that
funny he was just sitting there exc
you don't even see a newspaper or something you know exc
he was just sitting there waiting for disaster to strike
well we have what looks to be a mother and her child
it's funny
my first impression is a girl a little girl
but in other pictures I don't know
I think it's a little boy
maybe it's sposta be generic exc
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella
child says no gram
you know that that whole idea is rejected
mother offers the umbrella again
no bye
uhoh outside started to rain gram
now it's pouring
child comes in soaked gram
the mother is standing there with that you know I told you so q adj attitude and and kind of annoyed I guess
but that's what mothers do you know exc
you wanna protect your child exc
and the child they don't like the idea exc
they think you're mean and difficult exc
you just don't want your child to fall down and skin their knee exc
you don't want them to get wet exc
you don't want anything to happen to this child exc
I know that's how I was exc
and so now it's another rainy day
or later maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella
learned a lesson gram
listen to the mother
and you know so maybe a lesson learned for the future
that maybe mommy you know isn't that bad after all
trying to protect me gram
well we have a cat emergency here
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like
and I guess the father or maybe some well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder
got up in the tree gram
he's stuck up there too now
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to get the cat
and now I see the fire department is on the scene
and they're going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after
well for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a being a maid working for this family
and it was a mother and her two daughters
they were just very shrill and very unattractive young women
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and just just very nice
these two were were very spoiled and and didn't have any appreciation for anything
I mean Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard you know animals loved her
the horse the whoever was out there gram
mice even you know gram
she was a delight
anyway there's a a an an announcement comes to the unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their their their mcmansion I guess where they live gram
they weren't in a castle
they got an invitation to to a ball
the prince was going to give a ball
and Cinderella useta she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance
and so when news came of this ball she was also silently very excited about it
but the two girls you know of course they were going
they had an invitation
and somehow I forget some of the details in between exc
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up you know helping working some magic
and Cinderella does go to the ball
a pumpkin that that that what was that gets turned into a a a carriage and with horses gram
and she's got a beautiful gown on
and she just looks really just beautiful
and she the prince of course you know sees her right away
and you know one of those across the crowded room gram
and they danced all night
and it was very romantic
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the that or whoever or that they were
was that the stepsisters or was that another story exc
the wicked stepsisters I don't know exc
anyhow those horrible faces like gram
so anyway the the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight
and you see the the the clock is is striking twelve
and she's saying goodbye to the prince
and of course he doesn't wanna let her to leave
and she's late
she's running down this you know a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe
one of her glass slippers gram
and the butler or whoever majordomo from the the palace was sent around you know to the town to find who fits into the shoe
and Cinderella gets locked up
you know the mother the that horrible mother thought that you know they'd cram the shoe on one of her daughters' feet
and I remember their feet were ugly too
and the mice end up getting
oh she was locked in this room you know
they didn't want her on the scene
and the mice brought her the key
she got out and tried on the shoe
of course it fit perfectly
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after
one hopes
and I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at the wedding those those horrible people
okay exc
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here exc
otherwise it's an open face exc
they don't call it a sandwich right exc
so be nice exc
we'll we're pretend we have two pieces of bread gram
and I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly
and just gently spread that on
close it up maybe cut it in half
be cause I love s m d z u
but I don't like a bite of the crust first exc
on a peanut butter it's exc
so that's why I exc
yeah and I like to cut it on the diagonal exc
hasta be a particular way you know gram exc
yes I had in in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor
and he told me that if as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen
and two days later it ruptured
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm
and fortunately it was he needed do surgery
but after that I was fine
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain I've ever experienced
so that's the first thing that came to mind
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically
and it could not be
so it was full blown surgery
and I remember being I was obviously much younger
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience
and I hadta go very slowly
and I was out of work for a long time which is what I remember the most
and then little by little I just got my strength back until
I had the the privilege of working with a hippotherapy organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who worked with children with multiple sclerosis and and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would would elicit your sympathy
and you just sort of hadta tell them to you know to to buck up and do it
but it was very it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that
and now of course here I'm doing that in in in a much broader spectrum
there are several
let me think what would be a good story
well very recently two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country
and since we didn't have complete leisure time we divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every major league major league stadium in the country
and in two thousand twelve we completed that
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in in thirty cities
yeah and it was absolutely wonderful
and then of course they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami
so on Memorial day weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there
and in August we'll be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there
so when we hear if you build it they will come we think it's meant for us and that we're going to go see baseball games
and even though I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that we'd never seen or never would have seen
and it was just the the the best six years the best time I can I can recall
and we love to talk about it
yep
okay there's a young boy kicking a soccer ball
he doesn't know his own strength so he kicks it very far and very hard
and it breaks the window
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked
oh that's the ball
I'm sorry exc
he's holding the ball
and he's looking out the window to see who kicked the ball
okay a little boy is leaving for school
and his mother obviously thinks it's going to rain or knows it's going to rain offers him the umbrella
and he says
no mom I don't need it
see ya
I'm leaving without the umbrella
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder
and he gets really really wet
so he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry
and he's he's happier at the end
okay the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree
a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure
and now the man is stuck in the tree as well
and the the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat out of the tree
okay Cinderella is a story about a little girl who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled
and she is not treated as an equal
she is treated as a real stepchild
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders out of the fire
and she grows up in that role where her her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry
and the invitation comes
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball
and Cinderella thinks she won't go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball
noone knows who she is
and part of that is the glass slippers
she has her glass slippers
and she gets into the pumpkin that's turned into the carriage
she rides to the ball
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight
so she goes to the ball
and she has a wonderful time
and the clock strikes twelve
and she's running out of the ballroom
and she loses a glass slipper
and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry he's going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his his true love
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live
and the two two stepsisters try on the slipper
and of course it does not fit
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him
but the slipper does not break
she tries on the slipper
it fits
and they live happily ever after
and that's about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella exc
I would take a knife
I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first
and then I would spread the jelly
and then I would fold the bread in half
in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst
and my doctor had told me that I could just do normal activities and nothing would happen
and unfortunately it did rupture
and it burst
and it was February
and it was an ice storm
and it was the middle of the night
and it was very treacherous getting there
but I we did
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic operation
and they couldn't do it that way so it was a full on operation
and I remember it was I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time
and eventually I just got back to my own my old self
I don't remember too much about what I did to get better
I do remember though that I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown
and it required crossing a very busy street
and there was no traffic light
and I remember them being able to cross very easily
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in in either direction to inch my way through
but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to to move
and now I don't even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but
yes
okay thank you
yes my first experience was back in the late nineteen nineties
I worked with a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges
and the the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they had been
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse
so that was my first experience was was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually substituted for words that could that could not be understood
and and the the kids were great
and they were you know they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do they would just start to cry
and you'd hafta you'd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just I don't wanna do this
and now of course fast forward to here this has been an amazing experience working with both children and and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate
and what they're doing you know to to make themselves better
and I'm I've taken cues from the people with whom I'm working what not to do and and what to do
and and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps
so
yes I'd like it's something I love talking about
my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in in the south and then the midwest and
and even though we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something
and we were also very sad that it was finished
but every time they build a new ball park we'll be going
so and and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our Christmas cards our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with with the the trip itself
and the first one it said
from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home
which which was mine
but it was nice
and it in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen
we saw cities we never would have seen
and we interfaced with people that we never would have you know communicated with be cause they're very different when you leave the New York area
so
okay this story begins with a boy playing soccer
and he's kicking the ball in the air
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction
and the ball goes crashing through the window of a home
and there's a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window
and at the end he picks up the soccer ball and looks outside to see who kicked it from whence it came
okay
a little boy is leaving the house
he does not want the umbrella
he says bye mom and leaves without the umbrella
and as he starts walking it starts to rain
and then it starts to rain even harder
so he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet
and then he takes the umbrella and starts out again
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down
so her dad takes a ladder climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat
unfortunately the ladder falls
he can't get down
there's a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really can't get down
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree
Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters
and even though they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family
in fact her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders
and she is kept down at heel even though they are wealthy and snobby
and an invitation comes to a ball
and the the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going
but it's quite clear that she will not be going to the ball
the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife
and Cinderella's friends from the field make her a dress
and she's all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say
you're not going
and they destroy the dress
and she's devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress
she turns a pumpkin into a carriage
she turns four white mice into four horses
I could sing it but I won't exc
I really could exc
and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken
and everything will turn back to the way it is
she goes to the ball
she meets the prince
she dances with the prince
they're falling in love
and the clock strikes twelve
so she hurries out
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman he's fallen in love with
so they set out to try the the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in the town the village
and even though the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it they eventually find that it fits Cinderella
and they live happily every after
okay
I would take I would open both jars
I would find a knife
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread
and since there is only one piece of bread I would just I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich
okay I had fallen at one point
and I fractured my right wrist
and I remember that
well it was how many years ago
it was probably in nineteen ninety two or three
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream
and I was looking at the sign
and then I tripped and fell
and I was holding my keys in my right hand
and so I've but I got a little fracture
and I hadta go to the emergency room
well I was casted for quite a while
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge I think was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own recovery
but it wasn't really a bad thing all in all
I had the cast on for awhile
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist
yes I do
I have a very dear friend cousin who is has aphasia
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and she's now seventy one
and I visit her regularly
and we communicate in a very interesting way
well I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to
and I don't give her many choices
and we do a lot of hand motions
and she has a way of communicating
she's pretty amazing
she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats a lot
she she likes to say she wants to go home indicating her frustration with her situation
but I can see when I speak with her that she's very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts
she has the thoughts she if she could only put the words together
and it is very very frustrating for her
but I think that she's kind of come to terms with where she's at
it's hard
wow well the first thing that came into my mind because I'll I'll take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place
and the most so it's a trauma event where my grandfather passed away
and he was not sick
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was at work
so he went off on a normal day
and I remember playing you know with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital
and a friend of mine and I made put some cookies together and for when he was going to come home because we didn't entertain the thought of this person because it was my first experience with the death
so it's kind of a sad story
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life in the sense of the cycle of birth and death and whatnot
so it turned out he passed away that night
and I never did see him again
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship
and so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life
and then looking back on it as an adult now realizing that this man was really an angel of mine
I didn't realize it then but I came to believe
and I don't know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there
came to learn about that gram
and it just served as a a real learning in my life in many different ways
okay well this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went out of the way and broke the window
not his intention but it was an accident
and lo and behold his dad was sitting in the living room
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad
and the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didn't see the boy because the boy ran away in fear
this is the story about a a little boy who was on his way to school
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella
but he didn't wanna take the umbrella because he didn't wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain
so he went on his way
he got caught in the rain
it started to rain very hard
he got very wet
and he came home
and he got the umbrella
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom
that's right exc
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson exc
okay well little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park with her dad
and as they were going along they noticed that a cat was running along the field
and a dog was chasing it
and don't you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so
she encouraged her dad to get the ladder be cause they lived right across the street
and the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree
but then he got stuck in the tree
and looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down
so I'm sure someone had a cell phone in this picture even though it's not shown
so the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat
and they all lived happily ever after
okay once upon a time there was a young girl
and she hadta go live with her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldn't take care of her anymore
so he brought her to this house where these stepsisters and stepmother lived
and they took the the girl in
and turned out they really didn't treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted
and she was sort of like their maid
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent a lot of time among the cinders by the fireplace
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball
so when they got the announcement Cinderella knew about it
but of course the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball
so the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house
and then they saw how sad she was
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such
but Cinderella I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball
so as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go
and they had beautiful dresses
and she hadta help mend them
and let's see what happened
she I think she went out in the garden
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad
and she was crying
and she really wanted to go to the ball
and her fairy godmother had said you know
you may go to the ball just change
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress
and she said
fetch me a pumpkin
and then turned it in to a coach gram
and shen
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin
and so she was able to go off to this ball
and when she got there the ball was in full swing
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the the prince
and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious they really weren't gracious people
and one had a tic and a creaky knee
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just
things that they just didn't know how to interface with the king in a proper way or the prince in a proper way
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince
and there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love
and they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting
and suddenly the struck
and she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight
and with that she ran away
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind
she made her way home
she was a little sad because I guess she thought she'd never see this prince again
and then the prince found the slipper
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper
so he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on
and then they did come to the home of the where Cinderella lived
then they the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot
wasn't going to fit gram
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe
and it fits
and they get married and live happily ever after
that was not the best version of the story that I've ever heard exc
well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would open up the freezer and get some gluten free bread out of there
and I would put a paper towel on the counter
and I'd put the slices of bread on the paper towel
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly
put them on the counter
and I would retrieve from the drawer a implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly
and I would then open up the peanut butter
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread
and then I would close the jar
and then I would open the jelly jar
and I would take a nice heaping gram
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around
and then I would put the top on the bread
I'd close up the jelly and put the knife and the spoon in the sink
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate
and I probably wouldn't cut it
and I would go sit down
and I would enjoy a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich
oh that's right
I injury I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant
I was going to a store to get some an ice cream
I was really hungry
I had just worked really hard that morning
and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying
if they sell cheeseburgers I'm getting one
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist
and immediately a big ball popped out of my wrist
and I couldn't move my fingers
so I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast
and it was it was it was interesting mainly in my my in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything
but of course I couldn't work either
but it presented a challenge
I learned how to do things left handed
I hadta write left handed
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars
and that was in I think it was in May
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in Columbia Presbyterian with him with the cast on
we have these pictures
and I remember he had a little kind of like a scrape on the back of his head or just not not a a bloody thing but a a kind of like a worn out spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast
I don't actually remember doing physical therapy
once I had the cast off I think I was fine
and I regained all the strength in my wrist
I think six weeks
yes it was my dominant hand
yes I do
you know my cousin Ann she's seventy one now
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six
and so she's left handed
and so she lost the use of her right side
her hand is all mangled and her foot also
and her communication skills are very limited
she it's aphasia is what I think she has
and she's gotten progressively better over the years
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again
she useta always say
zoom zoom zoom zoom
and I always thought because she was in a car she was sitting in a her parked car when she had the stroke
and she doesn't say that anymore
but a lot of the people where she lives that's her nickname Zoom zoom because she useta say that a lot
but she's very challenging to communicate with
and I'll go see her and spend and hour or so
and we have lunch
and things and we try to communicate as well as best as we can with asking her simple questions
and she communicates in sort of a roundabout way
she has three children
and when she wants to talk about them she can't always get their names but she'll say one two or three
and that's how we know be cause sometimes she brings a lot of numbers in
so when she tries to tell you she's in pain she'll take her good hand
and she'll say
one two three four five pain
I don't know
I don't know
like that
she somehow it's amazing how she communicates
I give her a lot of credit
yeah
okay I would like to tell you the story about my grandfather
because he was the one of the most important people in my life when I was a child
and I was it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten
it was in July
and it was just a normal day
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street
and it was back in the day when there was a lot of freedom
you you went out the door and came in for lunch
and then you went out the door
and there really weren't very many parameters
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had
and came home to find out that he had had a
he they didn't use the word stroke but that's what he had
that he hadta go to the hospital from work
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies
and then the next morning I remember waking up
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like
I have that feeling of what it felt like to find out that you know he wasn't coming home and just as a child an innocent child kind of coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing
having that be my first experience with death
and you know I had my four sisters were there and my cousin who is in the nursing home
she was around because she she kind of lived with us for awhile
and it was just she actually I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard
everyone went to the all the adults went to the funeral at night
I just remembered that
and I was hysterical crying
I was so so sad
and she didn't know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me
and it worked
she wasn't being mean
but I was beyond being consoled at that point
and I I felt very alone in my grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather
but anyway that that that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future
and I remember a time when I was in sixth grade
and we were having a sleepover in my friend's back yard
happened to be with a a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to leukemia a the other girl who lost her grandmother gram
and I had lost my grandfather
and we it was like they they could make a movie about the bond
we were all in the tent
and and we were just talking
I can see us all sitting there
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life
and we put it out there
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go
and we all just just let it out
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this
and it's a good thing
so that's why I think this story is is so important to me was because it's something that affected my life you know as I grew up
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that I didn't know about angels then
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe
and he can sort of watch over me if you will
yeah one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball kicking the ball
and inadvertently it went through the window of his his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp
and he stood up and looked out the window
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window
he kind of shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing
and he was going to go speak to his son about that
okay well Johnny was on his way to school
and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said
Johnny take your umbrella
and he said
nope mom
I don't think it's going to rain today so I I don't wanna take it
so off he went without his umbrella
and sure enough it started to rain
and it it started to rain harder
and he got wet
so he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said
you were right mom
I needed my umbrella
then he took his umbrella and went off
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of taking her advice next time
it's always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though exc
okay Sally and her dad were walking around the park one day
Sally was riding her tricycle
and as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree
and her dad she urged her dad to help the cat
and so he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over
and some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the fire department
and sure enough the fire department came to help retrieve the dad from the tree and the cat
and at the end of the day every one was fine
once upon a time in a land far away there was a little girl named Cinderella
and she was brought to the home of a a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the the mom her stepmom
and they actually put her to work
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose
but Cinderella was happy nonetheless
and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends the mice and the birds and such
and she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella
and she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom
and in her heart she thought
oh I would just love to go to that ball
and she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of course she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella
and but the stepsisters were going to go
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball
and Cinderella was sad
she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said
we'll help you Cinderella
and they brought out some ribbon and some some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her
and she had the dress
but she had no way of getting to the ball
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared
and it was her fairy godmother
and her my
don't cry my child
I know you wanna go to the ball
and and I can help you
just fetch me a pumpkin
and I'll turn it into a coach
and your mice friends will be the coachmen
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the the coachmen
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world
and when she got there she approached the ball and looked down the stairs
and there everyone was dancing
and they saw her come in
they turned and looked at her
and the prince looked
and he thought she was the most amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen
he invited her to dance
and they just had a nice connection
and she engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing
and suddenly the time had gone by
and it was midnight
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight
so quick she ran from the castle
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper
and she found her way home
and
so he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to find them
and everyone tried on the slipper
and when he came to the house of the where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper
and it didn't quite work
but the Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs
and the mice gave her the key
and she got out
she came down
and she said she'd like to try on the slipper
and with that she tried on the slipper
and her fairy god
but as it was they she tried on the slipper
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted
and they got married
and they lived happily ever after
I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness
yes well if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of gluten free bread from the freezer
put them on a paper towel on the counter
I'd get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon
and I'd open up the peanut butter
and I'd scoop out some peanut butter spread it on the bread
close the jar
I'd use the spoon to get the jelly out of the jar
I'd put it on the other slice of bread
""
put the jar the lid back on the jar
I'd put the peanut butter and jelly back
I'd put the lid
and I probably would not cut it in half
and I would take it to a table
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich
I can remember when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing
I was swinging with a friend
and we were standing facing each other
and I hit my head
and I did have a concussion
and I remember feeling quite ill
and my mother was taking some nursing courses
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight
but I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache
and then I was fine
after a day or so
no I think just rest rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes
yes
all different people who've had
I think you know I've encountered people who stutter
and I will usually just try to let them finish
I'm pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them
and I've encountered people with aphasia
and I'll often do the same
unless they really look as though they're struggling
and then occasionally I'll try to give them a cue
yeah so I would say that's the most that I can think of
and children with speech and language difficulties gram
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words
mhm I can remember when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas
it was a couple weeks
she had been in the hospital
and she had not been ill
but she was diabetic
and you know periodically she would be in the hospital
and it was Christmas eve
and we got a call that she had passed away
and it was terrible
my dad was at work
and my mother hadta contact my dad
and it was a really very difficult time
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry
so it was really something that I think I really remember
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father
and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve
we put everything up then
and then we would get up
so my mother did have all of us do that
but I remember thinking how sad my mom was
and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers
and my dad didn't come home un til very late
and then he was there of course on Christmas morning when we got up
but it was a difficult Christmas
and I do remember that very vividly
yeah mhm
one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball
and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbor's window
his neighbor was sitting watching television
and the ball came through knocked over his lamp and caused quite a and caused quite a loud noise
his neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off
one cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school
he said
I will not need the umbrella
however when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard
it rained and rained
he hadta run through the puddles
and he got wet
he tried to cover his head with his hands
when he got home his mother said
look at you
you're soaking wet
and he thought about having an umbrella
and the next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson
one day a girl was riding her bicycle
and she saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard
she looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat
she went and got her dad who brought a ladder
he started to climb the tree
and the ladder fell
so now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree
someone called the fire department
and they were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad
Cinderella's mother passed away when she was a little girl
and her father was raising her
and he met a woman that he thought would be a good wife
and she had three daughters of her own
and they got married
and they lived together
but Cinderella was not treated fairly there
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores
and the stepsisters would say
Cinderella get my lunch
Cinderalla clean the laundry
Cinderella you know do everything
so and the stepmother was not kind to Cinderella
and one day an invitation came that all of the unmarried women in young girls in the village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince
they needed to find a suitable wife for the prince
so Cinderella heard about it
and she dreamt of going
and she was a friend to the animals
she was a kind girl
and the mice and the animals helped her
and they made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night
but when it was time to come they said that she could not go
and the wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly
they were very very mean to her
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go
and they locked her away
but the mice came and they helped her
they got the keys
and they opened the door
and all of a sudden the fairy godmother was there
and she helped Cinderella
and there was a beautiful dress for her
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight
so Cinderella went
and she danced
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her
but then the clock struck twelve
and out Cinderella ran out of the ball
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes
and then she turned she turned back into Cinderella
and she made it back to the to the the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters
and a few days later some of the prince's men came
and they had Cinderella's shoe
and they said we can try this on
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince
and all of the stepsisters tried it on
and Cinderella I I believe she was she was locked away then too because they had noticed they knew the stepmothers m
they realized
so I think they had locked her away at that point as well
and they helped her get out
and she tried on the shoe
and sure enough it fit
and she was able to see the prince
and they lived happily ever after
aw exc
you're welcome
well first you would get out your bread and you and a knife
and you would open your peanut butter and spread some peanut butter on the bread
and then you would get I would get a clean knife
I don't mix my peanut butter and jelly
and I would open the jelly and spread the jelly on top of that
put another piece of bread on top
cut it in half
my mother said if you cut it in half it's a little extra love in that sandwich
so we would always cut that in half as well
I remember
I was playing on the swings with a friend
and we were swinging
and I fell
and I did come down right on the back of my head
and I got a concussion
and my parents took me to the hospital
and they were very concerned
and I was very sick to my stomach
and they were going to keep me overnight at the hospital
but my mother hadta get home
she had three other children at home
my dad worked in the evenings then
and she had promised that she would wake me up every hour
so I do remember that
and the next day remember resting on the couch in our living room and getting all kinds of visitors gram
and yes the neighborhood children were all coming in
and yeah it was a day or two until I felt better
no
yeah I just remember my mother having to wake me up every hour or so even through the night and being extremely tired and wanting to sleep but her continuously waking me up
I'm sure she didn't yep
I have
some that I think of are talking with people who had difficulty with maybe disfluent speech
they were stutterers
and really trying hard not to finish their words for them or their statements gram
and also patients with aphasia gram
just really sitting and giving them additional response time gram
and also working with children with difficulty with language and with articulation gram
and mostly with them just modeling correct production for them gram
mhm
I guess that was an important day in my life
and I remember I was student teaching as a speech language pathologist
I was working hard
back then we didn't have Super Duper speech company so we hadta make everything
and I had contact paper that I was laminating pictures with
and my husband
now he's my husband but then he was my boyfriend
had called and said
oh let's go over to the park
let's do this
and he was acting kind of funny
and I thought
I don't really have time for this
and even when he came to the house he was acting kind of funny
and I said
oh you know I really wanted to finish what I was doing
so we went to Brookdale park which is where we live right now across the street from Brookdale park now gram
and that was the day that he asked me to get married to marry him
and then I was so shocked
and then I went home
and my my parents knew
so then they had invited my brothers over
and it was this whole small party
and I kept thinking
oh this is so wonderful
but I really hafta get back to what I'm doing
my husband was like
really
we're engaged
but I guess I was a conscientious student then too
I think so
so yeah and then it was nice
because the next day I went in to the you know to where I was doing my student teaching
and it was nice to tell my cooperating teacher
and all the children were very excited
it was nice
you're welcome
one day a boy was playing soccer
and he wasn't being very careful
and he went to kick the ball to his friend
but he kicked it through a window his neighbor's window
his neighbor had been sitting there watching television and was very alarmed and upset that the ball came through the window
when the neighbor looked to see who had kicked the ball the boy had run off
you're welcome exc
okay exc
one cloudy day a mom was encouraging her son to take his umbrella to school with him
she warned him a second time before he left
but he said
no I don't need it
I guess hoping that it wouldn't rain
but sure enough it did rain that day
it rained on the way to school and on the way home from school
when the boy got home he was soaking wet
and his mother looked at him and said
I had told you that you should bring your umbrella today
and then from then on he carried his umbrella and learned a lesson
okay one beautiful day a cat ran outside
and a dog chased it up the tree
a little girl was riding her tricycle and saw that it was her cat stuck on a branch in the tree
she ran and got her father who got a ladder and tried to help her retrieve the cat
but the ladder slipped off of the tree
now both the dad and the cat were stuck in the tree
the mom called the fire department
and they came
they were going to help both the dad and the cat get down from the tree
and everyone would be happy
sure exc
Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away
and her father married a wicked woman
she had two daughters of her own
and they maltreated Cinderella
she hadta clean the floor
she hadta bring them breakfast
she hadta make their dresses
and one day where they lived an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land
and all of the unmarried women in the in the area were invited to the ball
and the two stepsisters were going to go
and Cinderella helped them get ready
and she on her own made her own dress with the help actually with the help of the animals
she was very kind to animals
""
and then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her
and they were evil
and they ripped her dress and tore her dress
and they told her she couldn't go
and she cried and cried
and they left
and she cried
and then all of a sudden a fairy godmother appeared
and she told Cinderella
I can help you get to the ball
and she used her magic wand and made a beautiful dress
and she turned the pumpkins into a coach
and she had coachmen come
and Cinderella got to go to the ball
and sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did fall in love with her
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that Cinderella hadta be home at midnight
that if she was not home when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form gram
so Cinderella was at the ball having such a wonderful time
and it was getting closer and closer
and she didn't realize
and all of a sudden the clock struck
and she ran out of the ball
and as she ran down the steps she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers
and the prince found it
and that was all that was left of Cinderella
so the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him
and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella
so the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away
and they tried on the the glass slipper
but it didn't fit either of them
and the mice snuck the key under the door to Cinderella
and she was able to get out just in time so that she could try on the glass slipper
and sure enough it fit
and the prince's servants brought her back to the castle
and she and the prince lived happily ever after
you're welcome exc
okay so first I would have two slices of bread
and then I would have a knife
and I would spread the I would open the jar of peanut butter and get some peanut butter on my knife and spread it on the one slice of the bread
then I would use another knife
then I would
and then I would put the second slice of bread on top
and then I would cut the sandwich in two
okay
I remember hurting my back about five or six years ago
and I really didn't do anything to hurt my back
I just kind of moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back
and it was weeks of going to the doctor going finally just having physical therapy to to fix it
but it all worked out
yeah
it was a lot of exercises
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield
and they had me lift weights and do different exercises stretching mostly stretching my back
and they used some kind of electronic stimulation therapy
and that really helped
it was the big part
yeah
not really
I mean a little bit here and there
you know I've know people who have had strokes and
I think a lot of it was sort of just waiting them out
sometimes they just couldn't get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign sort of a sign language where they kind of point to what they're looking for or what they need
that was mostly
kinda what did it
I guess I'll tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace
it was a long haul
it was a lot you know a lot of discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it
and we probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents
and at one point I would be kind of more wanting to do it
and Eileen would be busy
her parents were ill
and we were trying to take care of them
and then it would swap
I was busy at work
and she was more interested in talking about it
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind of we were on the same page at the same time
and we made this decision to to that we should look possibly look at foster care
and we looked into it closely
and it just wasn't going to work right for us
and then we decided to to adopt
and we identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family
and we looked into all of her medical records and things
and then we traveled to China
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that
and then we then we went to China
and actually the adoption occurred there in China
and we have an older daughter who came with us also
so we're all part of all became one big family all at once
thanks
well there was a little boy who was playing practicing his soccer kicks
and looks like he kicked the ball a little too hard right through the living room window where his father was sitting there watching tv and keeping an eye on the baby
and his father hadta gather up the ball and look out the window at him and and say you know
what are you doing kicking the ball right near the window
okay exc
a little boy was on his way to school
he's getting ready to go to school
and his mother offered him the umbrella to take with him in case it rained on the way to school
and he said
no thank you I'm fine
and he walked out
and on his way to school it started raining really hard
and he hadta turn around and run home
and get you know when he got home his mother wasn't happy that he did not take the umbrella from the beginning
and he he took the umbrella
and off he went again to school
it looks like there a little girl's cat climbed up the tree
the girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard
and the cat ran up the tree
and she went in to get her father to help her
and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air
and the while once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too
so they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out of the tree
okay there was a little girl named Cinderella
and her mother died
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own
and the new mother the stepmother didn't really care for Cinderella that much
she was more concerned about her two daughters
and then as they grew up the the she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her
and one day there was a an invitation to a a big ball to meet the prince be cause the prince was looking for a wife
and his father was having a big party a big ball to so he could meet all the eligible women in the in the kingdom
so she wanted to go to the the ball
but she was too busy
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for everybody else because they all hadta have their clothes made cleaned and ready to go
so she in she started to get everybody's everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball
and in the meantime her friends the the the mice put sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball gram
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go
but the sisters found out
and they tore up her dress
and she was she thought she'd never get to the ball
and then she met her her fairy godmother
she went out in the yard and was crying
and the fairy godmother came
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the the mice into horseses
but told her that she needed to be home by leave by twelve o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point
so she went off to the ball
and she met the prince
and they fell in love
and all of a sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight
so she hadta run out
and she ran down the steps of the the castle
and left the prince
and she lost her shoe on the way
so the prince thought he would never see his this girl again
and so the next day the father and the and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on
and that was Cinderella
so then she married the prince and lived happily ever after
I would take the bread
and I would spread the peanut butter open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter
and then put another piece of bread on top of it
alright back when I was in high school I broke my collar bone in phys ical ed ucation class
I was a senior in high school
and I was playing third base in gym class
we we were playing softball
and I was playing third base
and it was a ground ball
I kind of moved over toward the short stop
and the short stop charged in to get it and ran into me and kind of hit my shoulder and snapped my collar bone
and it was in the springtime
so it was I you know they hadta I'd never broken a bone
they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me
and take then I we the field was about half a mile from the school
so I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm
and and they said my arm was broken
and they put this harness on me that kind of pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight
and so I got to wear that for my prom and for graduation
and there was a miserable injury
I'll say that
no really you just it's a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and you know meet up when while they heal
and otherwise it's just limited activity for awhile
right around the funnest time of the year
yeah it did
yeah I go I distribute communion in the nursing home once a month
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making a lot of sense and some are not so communicative
and you know you end up you know using my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to you know coax them into talking to you communicating with you
and you know you do a lot of different things make you know with trying to make facial expressions and trying to you know to just kind of jar them back to the present so they can determine whether they're even ready to take communion
but you know that's kind of it's a lot of it's a lot more a lot less verbal and a lot more you know trying to make a personal connection with them
when
I'll talk about my other daughter
when Erin was born and we it was a little postdated the energy s
and she was a little bit late so they decided she would they would induce her
and she we went to the hospital
it was all planned
it was only going to be a couple of hours
and it ended up being of course like thirteen hours
but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileen's parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby
and it was the first my parents' first grandchild so a really exciting time
and I have three brothers
so it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl gram
so you know it was the whole thing was just that being that we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done
and a little but it made it so exciting because we knew our that the grandparents could be there
and we could be you know it could be exciting for everybody
yes it was
so the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard
and it goes through the window of the house
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily
and I'm sure he's on the other end running from his father
the little boy is getting ready to go to school
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and because it's sposta rain
and he tells her he doesn't need it
and he walks out the door
and you know he just barely gets away from the house
and it starts really raining hard
so he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her
you know what you were right
I needed the umbrella after all
the little girl's cat climbed up the tree
it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog
and she so the cat got stuck in the tree
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell
so then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father and get the barking dog away from the tree
so once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone
and the father met a a woman and decided to get married
and this woman had two daughters
and the so the they became a family
and quickly the new mother who became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters
so she they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the stepmother and the two the stepmother's two daughters
and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody
and then one day there was going to be a ball
the king was going to have a a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party
and Cinderella wanted to go
but her her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody else's needs were taken care of first her the two sisters' dresses were ready and everything else
so Cinderella got it all ready
and in the meantime her the mice sewed a a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear
so after she got all of everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her
so she thought she wouldn't be able to go to the ball
and then she met her she ran out into the back garden of the castle
and she met her fairy godmother
and the fairy godmother told her that you're going to go to the ball
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown
and she put the she turned the mice into the horses
and she went off to the ball
and the but there was one stipulation is that she hadta be home she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was gram
so she went to the ball
and she met the prince
and they fell in love
and then the all of a sudden she heard the clock strike twelve
and she immediately tried ran out of the ball hadta get out of there before she turned back into Cinderella
and she lost her shoe on the step of the of the palace
but there was nothing she could do
she just kept running
and the next day the king's minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldn't fit into it
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after
I would put the bread down
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it
the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast my right breast
and our son Joseph had just been born a year ago a year before the the diagnosis or the concern anyway
and so I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him
but there was surgery required
and there was a waiting period
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on not on me so that I could get back to taking care of him
as it turned out everything was fine
the lump was removed
it was benign
and everything was alright
so but it was a scare for awhile
and important that I kept the priorities that I thought was were important
there was very little recovery
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasn't too sure whether they had removed the breast or not when I first woke up from the anesthesia
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright gram
and I was so busy
I don't recall anything special other than a dressing and keeping up with whatever med ication s whatever they told me to do
but I nothing was was bothering me after it was over
yeah
mhm
I useta teach English as a second language
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation exercises that we did
I always tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew
but yeah there's difficulty when someone is not fluent in in your language
sometimes with elderly gram
I took care of my mom and my dad as they were really in advanced years
nineties gram
and sometimes my father would go back to Italian
it was a place of comfort I think especially as he was maybe dying
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow
all I but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking
but it was memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another gram
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too gram
but I was very interested in where he was going with with the Italian at the end
with my mom she was more more grounded
sometime it was hearing it was her hearing problem
was a lot of shouting going on gram
so it's sometimes for me it's that
it's like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive
yeah
you're welcome
oh I've had so many happy things
oh what's happy
I'm sure the happiest day was the day Joseph was born
we were in East Orange General hospital
I had a wonderful doctor
my husband Joe who had a little too much background in language problems that can occur with babies and children made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food
whatever the heck his he worried about my doctor removed from the diet
so when it was time for Joseph to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes
so when the day come came I for Joseph's birth I was one lesson short of the full of the full course I guess of childbirth preparation
so I was going fine without any medication
it was just taking awhile
and then I said to them
this is all I know
I don't know any more
so they were laughing
and they said
we'll take over
and they just pushed my head from the pillow and said
let's line up the mirror correctly
everything was going fine
still no med ication s
everything was going fine
Doctor Sobol my doctor said
Firstname this is going on
I wanna get home for supper
I said
I'll get you home in time
so it was a little bit longer but at five twenty on December ninth ninety sixty nine Joseph was born
no med ication s
no nothin g
I was on a high
I can I've never been on such a high
but it was it was such a happy day
and everything was fine
it was the way Joe had hoped without any interference
he got a really nice Apgar score
yes he was a ten right off the bat
so I said
well did my job gram
now comes the scary part
raise the kid
so happiest day gram
for sure
mhm
once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball
and not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair
and shocked out of his ennui he looks out the window and with ball in hand has judged correctly that he's going to hafta go outside and speak to little Ned
well I think this is my daughter in law Tanya
and this is Nick
and Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him to school that day
and as he's waving goodbye he is reassuring my daughter in law that he surely doesn't need an umbrella independent little soul that he is
within the first block on the way to school he it begins to rain
as he's sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he understands what his mom was trying to say after all
a bit reluctantly he has returned home and just hasta stand there sopping wet while my daughter in law tries very hard not to say
I told you so
but he he happily accepts an umbrella and returns to school in the opposite direction it looks like
returns to school gram
umbrella gram
and dry gram
and happy gram
enough
well this is little Mary little Mary Boyle who has noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree
and and has called the only person she knows who can rescue Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household
and that is her dad
he has gone to help her climbs the tree
but the ladder has gotten away from him
is fallin g gram
as if things aren't noisy enough the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark
and so now the neighbors I guess have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue in this order dad Fluffernutter
and they're not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because he's the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with
there you go
you're welcome exc
there was a a widower with a daughter whose name was Cinderella who had remarried a a mean woman
he didn't know that at the time but that's what marriage reveals over time
she had two two daughters
and so his stepdaughters were part of the household that Cinderella and her father had enjoyed
but things changed once they all arrived together
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude
the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her in every way
she performed servile tasks
at one point an invitation comes to a ball
and they're considering happily going
Cinderella's face is lighting up
but she doesn't realize what's going on
the ball was held because the the King decided that his son it was time for the son to marry
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of the town
well Cinderella would love to go
and it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and the stepmother and the and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves
so they prepared had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy
but she was there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family
well there's a book in the picture and the picture book I don't remember at all exc
she discovers a book
I don't know if that's where she comes across an incantation
but a fairy godmother appears
and because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her
fairy godmother helps her
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too
and as as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball I'm going to just remember that she dances with the handsome prince
and at as she runs back tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair
I didn't see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though exc
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight gram
but she hadta get out of there by midnight
and she does
but then there's the there is the return of the slipper the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what he remembered about his beautiful date for the night gram
but as I said the book seems a little bit different exc
there's a key
and I guess when she lets everyone in finally
where is he exc
why is the key there exc
I don't remember that part exc
but as I just remember the story ends happily
that he does find her and the slipper
and they're reunited
and so happily ever after gram
uhhuh exc
well I would keep all my ingredients at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly
lay the bread down
get a nice butter knife
and I begin with spreading a a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the the well around all four sides so that when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesn't actually go over the side
it just stays within the the borders
I useta like mine folded over
I think I I like it just the one slice
so it just looks really kind of beautiful with a little wall a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle
okay exc
you're welcome exc
the the most the most memorable event was
it but I think I did tell you about it
the the yeah gram
it was about the the possible scare
it was just a lump in in my breast
and that I'm I'm pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of of our son to think about
and I didn't think because of my age or the the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything more than precaution to do the the procedure
but as close as I came was you know the the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and and caring
and I I felt supported the whole the whole time
just that I I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasn't sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so the dressings and bandage were so tight
but I just remember thinking the the they'll be I'll do whatever I hafta do on it
and whatever's next I'll find out about and take care of
so it's a moving progression
I don't usually write the end of a story if it's something like that
if you tell me I'll say
oh we'll go through it step by step
and we'll get there
it was like that
so I'm fortunate that it hasn't been anything worse than that
just I can only remember being busy because with with a toddler
he was a year old then
and and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another gram
it was nothing short of show up for a doctor's appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done
so I didn't think about
I knew I had it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright
so it wasn't much to do except you know just take care of of the healing part and cooperate
but I was sure everything was going to be alright
something important
well I think I think oddly enough of of meeting and and continuing a a life with Joe
it was I'm sure the most important thing that ever happened
the most memorable day was the day our son was born
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how how interesting that all was
we were students at Montclair State
and in those days freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus
we hadta sing the the alma mater
but the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at at Life Hall
and he noticed the sign and said something about
I think I had part of it was covered
and he said
are you a a speech major
I said
no English
and I I unveiled the the words English gram
but he was a senior
and I was a freshman
and so I got to meet one of the you know the upperclassmen got his signature
and then later we just had it was an easy conversation
we just we talked a little
he he continued when I whenever I saw him to say hi
and I people would tell me
he's a BMOC
you know he's a he was a a vice president of student government
and I said
oh my goodness
but the more we hadta talk about
I was a student leader in my high school
and I thought when he when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee
but it turned out that he we he was interested
so our first date I think was the
it was something like the Kingston Trio or something like that
some folk group gram
it was really nice
they were on campus
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come
that was one of his duties
but when I just think of how all that unfolded just
I knew I I was gonna finish school
and so we we paced ourselves I guess you know to to be logical about things
get to know each other no surprises along the way gram
because you have time with a person and you you see them in all the seasons and all
but I think when it finally came to to getting married I don't think there was a formal
we we people ask us but this was not even a formal proposal
I think everyone around us assumed we would marry
so we did
and so I I wasn't engaged
you know I we I was pinned
and someone said to me the next day
you know you're you're engaged to be engaged
I said
no I'm not
and they said
well that's what that means
and I said
oh I thought it meant sort of going steady college style
they said
no you're engaged to be engaged
I said
well we have some time to go before
I said
it means what it means to the individual couple too
so I tried to assert myself
but I guess they might have been right
but I don't I don't care
it didn't mean anything
but that it when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross I mean that's that's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married gram
and all that happened at once
it all converged
it's alright that we've done this before
okay same story exc
now was it little Ned
no this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself gram
and the trajectory is off
it goes right through a window
and we hear the crash
and the lamp has gone over
and and I'm assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody who's startled that this intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture gram
and he says
I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard
okay
it's still raining
okay in the first picture it's about to rain
mom is telling little sweetie
take your umbrella with you because I think it's going to rain today
and the little little Sammy this time says
no no no no no I don't need it I'm a big kid
and as he says goodbye his mom is just offering it one more time
he says
so long
see you later
but as he steps out the door wouldn't you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall
and as he's getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says
oh drat
and when he back gets back home and looks at mom I think she's restraining the
I told you
and he's looking a bit sheepish little Sammy
but he's out in in the last frame
but he's still going in the opposite direction here
okay
we're in a time warp you know exc
you guys have not moved forward from last last week exc
okay exc
groundhog day
no this is cat up in a tree day exc
oh my goodness my goodness exc
this is little sweet Sue
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb
the ladder that he must have taken to to get to to the cat has fallen
so he's stranded
and little Fido is barking and saying
what the heck are you doing up there
but thankfully the the firemen are on their way
kindly neighbors must have called and said
help help help
and so they're rushing along with the ladder
they will rescue him shortly
and I think they'll get dad down before they get the cat down
I think that's the priority
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world
it's all going to work out just fine
alright I think last time it was a combination as well exc
what once upon a time there was a a family where the there was a widow
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to a woman he had met
but the woman had two daughters of her own
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after the woman and her daughter the became the stepmother and the stepsisters and joined the the household of Cinderella and her dad
I'm assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again
and she must deal with the family her new family
and they're not very kind
there's they're mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of Cinderella at every option
and so she did the chores and she was treated badly
simultaneously there is another father and a and a and a offspring a prince this time
and the father is a king
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son
and I assume that it's time for him to be married
and so the prince a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful maidens who are available
an invitation goes out to Cinderella's stepmother to the household
and everyone is smiling
and Cinderella I guess assumes that she might be able to go
but this is not going to happen
this the the book
and I don't know what's going on with that little book yet
but she I maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house
the little animals or begin to help out
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready
and Cinderella now knows that with the help of her godmother she will get to go
there is a little admonition from after she's dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably
be sure you're home by midnight
and then it switches to the to the ball
and I and the prince sees and falls in love with at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty
when he could see all that gram
so they dance and dance
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase
I guess the the the right hand man the the first secretary first VP of the king is running after her to say
wait a second
wait a second
but she runs back to the to to home
and then comes the search for who matches the slipper
and it's he in your little booklet the first vice president then who comes to the door
and there's a funny little picture of somebody tripping and a cushion
but I don't remember any of that from my stories or my film memory exc
but apparently there the key there was a key there that still doesn't mean anything much to me
they must have let him in
the the match is made when she tries on the slipper
and so I I suppose the the fella
xxx we've got our girl
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot
and I don't know why I thought it was direct exc
but he could afford to hire help to do that so so the help took care of it
anyway it's a happy ending
they they get back together again
and I'm sure it's the prince and his sweet Cinderella and life is happy from then on happily ever after
oh my goodness exc
did you try it with the little wall exc
and did we say there's only one piece of bread and we want we think we want two exc
we can do it either way exc
we'll do a half one this time exc
we'll use the just the one piece of bread but we're going to make it the same way exc
we're gonna lay all the ingredients out first because I'm anal retentive
we get everything out
the knife butter knife gram
we open up the peanut butter first
and we spread a a thinnish layer in the middle because we're gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges
all four edges will have a slightly raised perimeter
we're going to put red raspberry jelly
open that cap up
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesn't cross over the walls so it doesn't hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your your hand as you're enjoying
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich
if you like you can fold it over which was the way a lot of people in my neighborhood did it
but I think that's it exc
that's how we'll do it exc
mhm
well I recently had Hodgkin's disease
was diagnosed I guess about three months after I retired gram
I spent several months in chemotherapy
but prior to that before the chemotherapy started I had an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks
that was was a Stevens Johnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no no burning to my skin
it was all a result of the allergic reaction
and that stopped the chemo
I had one round of chemo
and then the allergic reaction took place to the not the chemo medication but to a medication that's designed to protect kidney function
so I was in the hospital for three weeks
that resolved
I started chemo again
and I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since
so my hair came back
my weight came back
and I hafta watch it now because it's it's back more than it has been
but it was it's been quite a year and a half or so
well I had married my wife about forty eight years ago
and it was
sorry guys
pretty much her her doing plus my oncologist of course
so it was you know it I had chemo every two weeks
and the oncologist was just great
and and Firstname was quite a support
sorry
and I I didn't do much else because it was you know the chemo and and eating as best as I could and resting as as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasn't too hard
so that was it you know following doctor's orders as they say and my wife's orders
so
a story
well this being Saint Joseph's day in the Roman Catholic calendar and since my son's name is Joseph as well as my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday
that I do know the day of the week in December December ninth
and it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that that we found out that we were pregnant that my wife was pregnant
he's our only child
so his his the announcement of the fact that he was that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess are happy memories prompted by as I said today because of of the of Saint Joseph's day
about the about Saint Joseph's day
it's a it's a feast day in in the in the Roman Catholic calendar that comes just after Saint Patrick's day which I think overshadows overshadows it
and it's as the Irish celebrate Saint Patrick's I think Saint Joseph's day is mostly celebrated by the Italian Americans and by Italians
and there's a special pastry that is consumed
and it's called a Zeppole or the the donut of Saint Joseph
it's quite rich creamy fattening cholesterol laden but quite delicious
if you if you meant my son's birthdate we prepared for childbirth
I was to be a coach
it was very early in the time when the so called painless childbirth developed or Lamaze
but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didn't allow fathers in the waiting
so even though we prepared we prepared for the day of birth going to childbirth classes Lamaze classes
when it when
pun intended
when push came to shove I couldn't go into the waiting
so I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery
and and I we did use some of the coaching
so it and and she did employ some of the techniques that were taught to her
so yeah so that was that was the day of his birth
a boy is kicking a soccer ball which goes through a house window smashes the glass
and it's falling into the lap of a man who's sitting in a chair in the house
he picks up the ball looks out the window actually looks through the hole in the window gram
okay exc
the mother is handing an umbrella to her child because it's probably raining outside
he is saying
no I won't don't want the umbrella
he walks outside
it's raining
didn't listen to mom gram
he runs back with water now drenching him the rain drenching him
back in the house mother's not happy
she's frowning
the boy's frowning soaking wet
he leaves the house this time with the umbrella
well a cat is stuck up in the tree
and this child's father probably he he did climb the tree to try to get the cat
but he now himself is stuck up there
the dog is barking at him
and someone called the fire department
and two firemen are rushing over with a ladder
and they're gonna take him down as well as retrieve the cat
okay exc
Cinderella is a young girl who whose mother died
and she's brought by her father to live with I I think a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age
father meant well
but the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully
she became their maid essentially and hadta clean the house take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella do the cooking do the washing while they enjoyed life and did what they wanted to do to to please themselves
one day the prince
they they lived in a in a principality
the prince whose father wanted him to marry was asked to or was told that there would be a ball held at which many of the or all of the single women in the principality would would be invited
and the idea would be that he would the prince would eventually pick one of them to be his wife
the three Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball
the mother their mother's very excited
and of course Cinderella is excluded
she cannot go to the ball
and so she's left at home alone while the stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball
she's visited by her fairy godmother who grants her her wish of attending the ball
because Cinderella says
how am I gonna get there
what am I gonna wear
so the fairy godmother makes a very nice gown for her out of magic takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach
mice become the horses
I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too
I forget which animal becomes the coachman exc
they take her to the ball
she's not really recognized by her stepsisters and and the stepmother
but they the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight
otherwise or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera
so she promises to return at midnight
but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight
so she panics
rightly so
runs gets back in the coach and is taken home
but one of her slippers glass slippers that was part of what the fairy godmother made for her is left behind
and the prince at at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and wanted to to know who she was
because she was going to be the one
and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind
so he has all of the young ladies in the in the principality try the slipper on
it their it's brought to each of their houses
and the of course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one he was looking for the one who was at the ball
and sure enough it is Cinderella's foot that fits the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and but to her great delight
and the prince marries her
and they live happily ever after
well I would take two pieces of bread
on one o f them I would take a knife and spread the peanut butter
and on the other piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together
and I'd have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
yeah well the big one is my cancer Hodgkin's disease
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven gram
I had symptoms before then but didn't connect the dots
I had night sweats
I was tired and just didn't think much of it
but then I noticed that I was losing weight
and that's what caused me to seek a doctor
so I went to
I hadn't been to a doctor in years
so I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses
she's now both our physician for both of us gram
she did an office exam and was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something the lymph nodes turned out
so I went for a sonogram
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan
that led to the need for a biopsy
so at that by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong
the decision was gonna be is it
it it was lymphoma
but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non Hodgkin's lymphoma
so I went to Mountainside hospital in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasn't enough not enough tissue was obtained
so I hadta go into the city into New York to Sloan for a more complete biopsy
and that clinched it
it was Hodgkin's lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two
Hodgkins's is much more treatable at a higher success rate
so I started chemo
and after the first session I developed a rash
and we weren't quite sure what was going on
one of the nurses
the the oncologist wasn't sure
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment for the for the Hodgkin's
but one of his nurses said
this is an allergic reaction
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol
I think I mentioned this last time
which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney gram
it's actually a drug for gout
but it has a protective effect for kidney function
that landed me in the hospital with with what's called Stevens Johnson syndrome which is treated like a burn
it people with Stevens Johnson are often sent to burn units
my mouth was inflamed
I I it was just awful
I couldn't drink water
it it burned
that of course suspended chemo
I we worked through the Stevens Johnson
I was looking forward to chemo
it was it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation
so and I ended up having really a mild case from what I can gather
but still I I couldn't take solid food for for two weeks or so nor water
it was it was the only thing that really worked was was iced tea
so I got through the Stevens Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months
it ended last May
had my Pet scan at that time which was clear gram
oncologist waited another six months gram
had another Pet scan gram
that was clear
and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed
I don't know if you know about ports
so that sorta that sorta clinched the the idea that I'm you know home free
you know I hafta be monitored every six months
and chemo wasn't it wasn't all that bad
I mean Firstname got me through it if as I said last week
I broke down
she was just super in getting me through all of this
and the chemo wasn't bad
I I really wasn't nauseous
my appetite started to come back
in fact we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo
we'd send out for lunch
so the it was it was tired
I'd I would get tired
but I had chemo every two weeks
and my hair came back
and that's where I am now
not all that much
""
I'm a I'm a very bad eater when it comes to nutrition
fish
but it it it wasn't all that much to do
the the chemo was the the primary source of of treatment of course
the oncologist was very responsive
and he you know he he gave me anti nausea medication
but I didn't I took it once during the whole treatment time
and and even then it wasn't because I was starting to to vomit
I just felt a bit queasy
a lot of rest gram
I slept a lot and had tender loving care from Firstname
so it I didn't do a lot different you know
so I I really can't go beyond that
it was the chemotherapy and the rest
you know that was pretty much it
well I guess one of the most important things
I think I think last week I mentioned my son's birth so I I won't go through that again
another milestone was was getting a job at Montclair State
I I had I was a speech clinician doing work as a as a a speech language pathologist
but I missed interacting with students
I had and and and I I had some experience in doing that because I my undergraduate degree was in history
and I actually did student teach at a high school in history and had planned to do that
but then things things sort of changed obviously
but I I I missed that kind of interaction
I worked mostly with children when I was a speech clinician
and Firstname was teaching English at the high school level
and she would come back home with stories about you know working with students and discussions they had in class
and I was sorta jealous of that
and so when I was invited to to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance
that that changed everything
and I was warned that from from friends colleagues that I was taking a big risk in in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure
that they were I was gonna be taken advantage of
I don't know where they got the idea
but that I would you know I I would work for x l number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldn't get tenure
but I wanted to be in the classroom so much
and it was more that than doing research actually
it was actually teaching that drew me to it
that I said
the heck with it
you know I'm gonna do it
and so I I did
and it it changed everything
and that was a very very positive event you know
and I spent forty five years after that being here
yeah
so yeah
yeah
well no lucky for you
okay a young boy is kicking a soccer ball
he's out I guess in the backyard
but as he's when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbor's house or maybe his own house and lands on the lap of a of a man sitting in a chair who then gets up holds the ball in his hand and looks out the the hole in the window
and that's where it ends
so we don't know if he's gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what
but he's just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened
this is a story about not listening to your mom especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella
mother is suggesting that he he do that
that he's there's it's going to rain
and he's he's rejecting the whole thing
says goodbye gram
and mother's a bit dismayed because he's not taking the umbrella
and sure enough once he's outside it starts to rain hard enough that he hasta run back to the house
he's not very happy
he's soaking wet
mother is looking at him almost saying
see I told you show
and next we see he's out back in the rain but with the umbrella
well it seems as though this young girl's father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat who's up on a limb
he himself though ends up being stuck
his facial expression indicates that he he's having difficulty moving one way or the other
and being of no help the dog is barking making a racket
and someone evidently called the fire department
and there are two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder
and they're going to try to get him down
his ladder father's ladder is on the ground I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him
so the fire fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope
story of a young girl whose
I guess she's a teenager
whose mother dies and father remarries
and she's introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters
and they immediately take advantage of Cinderella
she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and hasta attend to their needs and the needs of the household
and evidently father was of no help in mediating any of this
so the girl ends up being in a household but but being rather a member of the household being a a servant as I said
one day a ball is announced
she she lives in I guess a principality headed by you know royalty
and one day a ball is announced
if I recall correctly it's because the prince is in need of finding a wife
his father tells him that it's time for him to marry
so a ball is organized
and all of the eligible young ladies in the principality are invited to attend
and the three stepsisters and and their their mother go plan to go
and they get their gowns ready
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too
but it turns out that she's not gonna be allowed to go
she of course is very sad about that
enter her fairy godmother
they they go off to the ball the the the the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella gram
you're gonna go too
and we're gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen
and I guess the mice too become horses
I'm not sure which animals become the horses maybe the mice
she's outfitted Cinderella's outfitted with a gown an d a pair of glass slippers
why glass exc
I don't know exc
but she's told she hasta get home by by midnight
because at the stroke of twelve everything's gonna turn back to what it was
the coach will become the pumpkin
the coachmen will become the mice
she'll lose her beautiful clothing
so she goes to the ball promises to to leave by twelve
but she's having a great time
and the prince is very much drawn to her
and she's still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time and gets gets back home in time
but as she's running out one of her slipper slippers comes off
and the prince picks it up
and it turns out that she's the one that he wants
and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady into the into the glass slipper
so a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper
and the the the stepsisters of course try
and they don't fit
and they try to push their feet into that slipper
and it doesn't work
and they're very upset
an d lo an d behold Cinderella's foot fits perfectly
it was her slipper
and they're very very surprised shocked and upset
but she's the one
the prince is delighted
and they end up being married and live happily ever after
well as I said before I'm not very good at nutrition exc
so I would not use what looks like whole wheat bread
I would use American white bread two slices
on one slice I would spread the peanut butter
and the other slice I would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich gram
