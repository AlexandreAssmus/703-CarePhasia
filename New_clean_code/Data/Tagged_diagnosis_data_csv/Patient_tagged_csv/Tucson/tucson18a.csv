text,diagnosis
it depends on what I'm talking about ,patient
um if it's pretty typical ges,patient
telling a story ,patient
I'll put it that way ,patient
if I told you something about what happened ges it becomes   I  I  ges,patient
and um people will say ,patient
like even my mom will be like ,patient
 I don't know what you're saying ,patient
so  you know what I mean ,patient
my words ges,patient
yes  yes head,patient
mm mhm ,patient
and it  a a_lot_of times ges I can't come up with the words either ,patient
but what I've learned quickly to do is how to define ges  what the word is which then becomes ges part of telling a story ges in order to laughs point out what the word is ,patient
um you mean like once I'd been in the hospital ,patient
I  c I can ,patient
well  yeah  ges I  I can ges before they took me ,patient
okay ,patient
basically what happened like two or three months in advance ges I couldn't  um I couldn't organize ,patient
I was running uh a business at a church bookstore ges ,patient
and um ges it was close to Christmas so there's more stuff ges,patient
and trying to figure out even how to ges,patient
and at one point when I realized points,patient
and um ges I couldn't figure out how to do it ,patient
i and things looked a different size ges,patient
so  I couldn't tell what fit ges,patient
um and it turns out I also ges ,patient
I remember specifically too ,patient
ges I'd ordered fifteen hundred dollars worth of books ,patient
Christmas time ,patient
and then  so  I've got the receipt ges,patient
and I couldn't get anything put together ges ,patient
like I didn't know where to ges,patient
I'm pretty focused ges,patient
couldn't figure that out ,patient
and then I saw another receipt ges because I got  ordered like ges seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books ,patient
and I remember looking at it going ,patient
 I don't  ges what does this mean ,patient
and then I just was like ,patient
 never_mind I can't think about it right now ges,patient
and ges in addition to that I was going to school ,patient
so  you_know all together ges,patient
well  at school I was  I'd been in digital arts classes ,patient
so  I was in a Flash class where  making movement ges,patient
and um it was the same kind of thing ges where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things ,patient
but our final project head,patient
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing ges that we'd done right before that it took  I put it in ges like seven or eight different programs ,patient
so  now I look back ges,patient
 oh  I wasn't stupid points,patient
 it was this thing points,patient
so  to s ,patient
mhm ,patient
and then the day that I went into the hospital um it was the first ges part of January ,patient
and ges I was at work ,patient
and  um and things had been ges being weird ,patient
and a girl was there ges ,patient
and  it's like I was  like I was ges,patient
I'm like ,patient
 woah  ges this is a weird feeling ,patient
my mom picks me up points,patient
well  actually drive points,patient
and I took a rest during that time ,patient
ges but I found out later that I wasn't even speaking well ,patient
that  then ges I go to the emergency room ,patient
it took them eight or nine hours to see me ,patient
yeah ,patient
and ges I didn't know that until later that points,patient
they were just like ,patient
 oh  head,patient
because they were nice ,patient
I remember points that part ,patient
and then I did get ges unconscious ,patient
um my mom tells me that they put me ges,patient
and uh  so I  I still don't have  I don't even go like ,patient
 oh ,patient
nothing like that ,patient
and  the way they discovered I had encephalitis  and this unusual one herpes encephalitis ,patient
the neurologist was saying ,patient
 no  it can't be ,patient
and ges,patient
 yeah  I think it is ,patient
so  they gave me the medicine right away instead ges of waiting for the test results three or four days later ,patient
and that's when I see it's kind_of ges,patient
that's what even the neurologist has said ,patient
so  that's my story ,patient
so they say ,patient
mhm ,patient
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year ,patient
um and um you_know it was tough to figure out how to walk ges,patient
it's not that it was um ges  where I couldn't walk ,patient
it's that I couldn't ges,patient
um I couldn't both  like if there was points a radio or a tv on I couldn't pay attention to what you points,patient
I couldn't figure out how to cook ,patient
you_know things like that are still complicate ,patient
no  they're complex but they're not as complicated ,patient
I've just learned how to ges,patient
 and ,patient
y you mean like  um like learning words again ,patient
well  I definitely head,patient
I wrote ges a_lot ,patient
I_mean  I wrote pages and pages and pages ,patient
um just in general  I wrote a letter to  Pima_College um because of something ges that had happened the semester before ,patient
and I took three or four months to write it ,patient
I didn't want anyone to help me ,patient
so  and that was cool that I'm  I'm ,patient
you_know  I look back I'm like really glad I was the person that I was to not give up ,patient
um and so I also went to exercise ,patient
mom took me to her exercise class ,patient
and they knew my mom well so I didn't feel ges uncomfortable  not being able to do much ,patient
um little things like that ,patient
I did lots of little things ,patient
okay  now like what ,patient
oh  okay laughs ,patient
I'm like ,patient
 ges what things ,patient
yeah  I'll tell you a recent one because that might be a_little more difficult ,patient
I can tell you the past because I've told a_lot_of stories from the past ,patient
so  um so  I'm doing it deliberately for  the current ges,patient
and it's sad ,patient
um my grandson just passed away a week ago ,patient
he's twenty ,patient
and he passed away from cancer ,patient
and he was sick for a year and a half ,patient
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer ,patient
so he was sick before ges,patient
um now  let's see how I can ,patient
I shouldn't try to think ges,patient
okay ,patient
um so   what happened is when he graduated from high_school he lived outside ges of Tucson close to Phoenix ,patient
and  a and um  so he was going to join the Marines ges,patient
but I said ,patient
 don't join the Marines until you  find out ges what you wanna do really ,patient
because it had been tough ges in his family life ,patient
um so  I found uh a way to get ges him to move in with me ,patient
we didn't have a_lot_of money to make it happen ,patient
so  I found a way ges to get him here ,patient
and after he'd been here a few months ges kept saying ,patient
 I'm sick ,patient
 I'm sick ,patient
they finally found out what it was ,patient
so  ges it was just a tough approach ,patient
and um  exhales so they  f his parents finally moved him ges back in ,patient
and it's just been a tough path ges,patient
um I've learned how not to talk much ,patient
so  ges I haven't been able to participate in us  ges in language at all just in ges touchyfeely stuff ,patient
but um I've stayed up there um when he was in the hospital ,patient
well  a week before he passed away ges my man and I went up there for uh a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool ,patient
we got to spend time there ,patient
and then the following ges,patient
ges and we went up there  for a day ,patient
we were right there when he passed along with other people ges and stuff ,patient
so  it was  uh it was very sad ,patient
and it was a good process too in the final moments ,patient
that's my story ,patient
oh  yeah head,patient
 okay ,patient
okay  these things are pretty easy for me ,patient
so  th they're  ki uh  points,patient
this guy here points,patient
points,patient
  points,patient
 points,patient
 points,patient
 points,patient
 points,patient
 uh points,patient
 points,patient
is that okay to say it that way ,patient
okay ,patient
okay ,patient
 the um fire department guys are showing up to  help someone points,patient
 I don't  I don't know ,patient
because um ,patient
okay ges ,patient
points,patient
points,patient
points,patient
and then points,patient
that's what I got ,patient
mhm ,patient
 oh_boy ,patient
okay ,patient
 oh_boy ,patient
 there was  there was a girl  who had a family ,patient
but two of the girls weren't her real sisters because her dad ges had married a woman with these two girls ,patient
and they were pretty rotten ,patient
and um  I can see some pictures with some animals ,patient
and I don't know what that meant ,patient
and ,patient
okay just a minute  whispers finger,patient
oh  and I think they wanted to go to a  like a party ,patient
and the girls wanted to go ,patient
oh  ges it had something to do with the prince  meeting the prince ,patient
the girls wanted to go ,patient
s for some reason Cinderella also wanted to go ,patient
and sh she was able to because a fairy came along and helped her get dressed and get there ,patient
so  then she  gets there  whispers ,patient
and then something happens at midnight ,patient
so  she can't get home because what she rode in ges becomes a pumpkin again ,patient
and  um  and she loses a shoe ,patient
and then once she's home like the next day the  the prince comes with the shoe ges,patient
he's looking for the person it fits ,patient
and it's not her stepsisters  or her fake sisters whatever they're called ,patient
but her  f her foot fits in it ges because her foot's little and so is the shoe ,patient
and so they  officially fall in love and get ready to get married ,patient
head,patient
I know these days points how to say it ,patient
okay ,patient
um first of all finger,patient
gotta find where it is ,patient
then  ges look for the peanut butter ,patient
so  is it in this cupboard ges,patient
then get them both out ges,patient
ges then get a knife a,patient

and then it's done ges ,patient
