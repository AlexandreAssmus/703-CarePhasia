i i if  if  uh if the goal  uh like in a range of one to ten with ten being you_know prior to my stroke it probably ranges from like a  a three or four to a seven ,patient
and um uh depending on you_know how much sleep I had and you_know what I did the day before and you_know how I feel and you_know it can  i i it can  it can vary like I say you_know on the high side like  of like a seven or uh you_know down as low as a three or four ,patient
oh yeah ,patient
uh uh s my stroke occurred on a Sunday April third  I think it was ,patient
a a a April third or April fourth um in the afternoon ,patient
I was uh taking my son uh FirstnameK for a ride in the truck ,patient
and sometime during the ride f a about you_know an hour ride uh I didn't  I just didn't feel very good ,patient
and uh uh f when I say I  d I didn't feel good I didn't  f I didn't feel up to snuff ,patient
and uh I  n I knew something was wrong but I was hoping it was just temporary ,patient
so  not to alarm my wife I didn't say anything laughs to my wife uh the rest of Sunday ,patient
and uh you_know that night I went to bed early ,patient
and  next morning's Monday ,patient
I went to work laughs you_know like normal ,patient
and uh driving to work because my right side was affected ,patient
I had a left side stroke so my right side was affected ,patient
I kept drifting off the side of the road ,patient
um I got on the Mass_Pike from Springfield to uh New_York state ,patient
and I kept going over the rumble strip ,patient
and then I g didn't  I  I knew I couldn't talk to anybody because they  it  like I  I  I knew it but just had something wrong with my speech and you_know my verbal thing ,patient
so  I  uh I picked up some corn seed that I sold these two farmers ,patient
and uh I got the corn seed on my truck ,patient

and uh the phone rang ,patient
and I  I was si sitting like here hand,patient

but it was you_know over three hours so  the cat was already out of the bag ,patient
