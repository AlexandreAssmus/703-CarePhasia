and you_know I  I couldn't  I couldn't uh think straight ,patient
and I  I'll never forget ,patient
I  um um I was weakened on my right side my  my right hand shows,patient
and uh a as it turned out my speech was about  uh about  about two on a scale of one to ten maybe even a  even a one ,patient
and then I was  I came home ,patient
and I  w I went in the house ,patient
and uh I sat down ,patient
it was about three o'clock three thirty ,patient
and um on my left I have a chair  taps,patient
and  and on the left I kept my phone taps,patient
and it was  my wife was sitting points,patient
and the phone rang ,patient
and I knew uh I had something wrong ,patient
so  I  I grabbed the phone ges,patient
I  I couldn't even get you_know anything more than h you_know hello out ,patient
and the person on the phone I  I  I t to this day I  I  I don't know who it was but she said ,patient
 Firstname  are you alright ,patient
and I said ,patient
 no  I  something  something's wrong ,patient
and she said ,patient
 I think you had a stroke ,patient
and  but sh she was  you_know she put me over to  so she asked f for  for my wife ,patient
I  I hadn't talked to laughs my wife you_know because I didn't want her to know f that I was s s you_know not feeling right ,patient
so  I thought it would go away to you_know ka continue to go to work and everything like that ,patient
but  so  we went to uh the hospital um xxx ,patient
uh  we went to the hospital uh Monday ,patient
I tried going to work on  on Monday ,patient
 I  I don't know why but I ,patient
and I  I drove my truck from ha Hadley Mass ,patient
laughs it's about eighty miles away ,patient
and on the  on the way out it uh kept drifting to the right ges,patient
you_know  f th the rubber strips you_know on the interstate ,patient
and they  I went off the road down in sɪzbɛriu ,patient
and at that point there I decided I  f I got something wrong with me you_know s more than s s you_know a good night's sleep is gonna you_know kɜu ,patient
so  I  uh I went home and that's  that's points,patient
s s s Sunday I didn't say anything hand,patient
on Monday I told my wife laughs ,patient
you_know  and I went to the hospital ,patient
and you_know since it was already you_know a whole day you_know I found out that if you go to  th th to the doctor's within three hours of you_know your stroke they have a chance to change the course or you_know reverse it whatever ,patient
anyways  the horses are out_of  out_of the barn by the time I said anything ,patient
and uh I took the m_r_is ,patient
and you_know I went s s through speech therapy and you_know uh ,patient
there's two other types of ,patient
I'm trying to think ,patient
but those lasted a very short time ,patient
but s s speech therapy you_know lasted like three or four months ,patient
and finally uh my uh therapist said you_know ,patient
 I think you've reached the  your plateau ges,patient
and  uh and uh you_know I was re released ,patient
and  um  and pretty much you_know she was right ,patient
it  I  I plateaued you_know after six months ,patient
and now it's six and a half years later and I'm still ges,patient
 well  um one thing that's uh was f k quite clear I was very tired ,patient
so  I z useta get like six hours sleep at night you_know when I was working ,patient
I probably went to uh nine hours you_know and  with a  a nap in the afternoon for like a half an hour ,patient
uh I  uh  in my therapy you_know I  sh sh I told ges,patient
and she uh tried to help me with  with that ,patient
and the only way I could  uh I could really function I could  I could  I could y y y y use the cue cards hand,patient
or I could uh have written on paper you_know like  uh like uh canned speech ,patient
but I  I  I was not able to uh really talk you_know like one on one like you're  you and I are doing right now ,patient
you_know ,patient
uh just  uh uh  the best way I can describe things um if  if I was a thirty five uh r_p_m record you_know I was trying to talk to a seventy eight r_p_m record you_know ,patient
I just couldn't get on the save ,patient
and uh it  it's not quite so bad you_know individually but when I talk to a  b a bunch of people in a  n a noisy room and just you_know ges noise from all directions uh I just wanna be out_of the  uh out_of the scene ,patient
uh very much like downstairs points,patient
it's getting bigger laughs ,patient
well  I have had many things happen but uh uh I'll tell you one th that  that involves my stroke xxx ,patient
clears,patient
and uh my fiscal year ended uh October first you_know f f f for my s selling and stuff ,patient
and anyways I said ,patient
well  May June July fingers,patient
I had like five months to go ,patient
and I was  uh I was  uh I  I had done all of my categories ,patient
so  I  I  I won a trip to uh Caro_Springs ,patient
and uh and I had a stroke ,patient
and anyways my  uh my wife hand,patient
but uh I took my oldest son ,patient
 and  clears,patient
um clears,patient
and that's another thing uh ,patient
I never useta cry ,patient
but uh you_know it's just something that they say that  that added benefit or a loss whatever that came along with the stroke ,patient
 and uh that's  you_know as you can see it's uh k k continued to stay with me ,patient
yeah  it's crazy  yeah ,patient
I can hear uh Amazing_Grace at a funeral and hands,patient
don't ask me why ,patient
 yeah  v it's very weird laughs ,patient
because you_know I'd be able to be cracking a joke for me or something during you_know  you_know the playing of Amazing_Grace ,patient
but you_know it  j you_know it's just very  uh very awkward ,patient
well  laughs it  it happens too  too often ,patient
and uh you_know watching a tv show you_know ,patient
it might be something stupid like the Bachelorette hand,patient
laughs if I come in and my wife's watching a show and uh you_know if they have a little sin sɛnɪməlu ,patient
and I don't like the show anyways laughs but I just  you_know I can't get over it you_know ,patient
it's  it's  it's really  s it's very dumb ,patient
well  a  a bunch of my female friends said ,patient
 well  it makes you um a cuter guy ,patient
whatever laughs hand,patient
 no ,patient
yup ,patient
so  n now you know laughs ,patient
alright ,patient
alright ,patient
well  this comes uh r right home to roost because I played soccer for  for Umass ,patient
and uh the first picture shows a  a young guy playing soccer ,patient
he kicks the ball ,patient
and uh he must be f too close to the house because uh he put the ball right through the window laughs ,patient
and uh as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed ,patient
and he knocked the window ,patient
so  he did ks considerable damage  I guess ,patient
and uh the last p uh picture shows the homeowner you_know holding the soccer ball and looking out the  at the guy ,patient
so  I can only imagine what happened on the fi fi f if the  fifth f picture if there was one ,patient
 well  I guess it shows a woman and uh probably her son ,patient
and he wants to go outside  I guess ,patient
and she says ,patient
 take your br umbrella you_know before you go ,patient
and he's  he didn't wanna take it ,patient
and she offered it to him twice  I guess ,patient
and uh he still didn't take it ,patient
he goes outside ,patient
and the third picture shows him getting drenched ,patient
and the  the fourth picture shows him getting drenched even worse you_know ,patient
so  he comes back inside soaking wet ,patient
and the mother says ,patient
 I probably told you so ,patient
and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he shoulda had in the first place ,patient
alright ,patient
well  evidently the cat climbed the tree ,patient
and as cats are prone to do it couldn't get down from the tree ,patient
and uh a homeowner or somebody you_know uh a male tried to get up the tree and he couldn't get s the cat down either ,patient
the girl's crying for her cat ,patient
uh oh  the reason the guy can't g get down is because his ladder fell down laughs ,patient
so  he's stuck in the tree ,patient
and the dog uh you_know bark ,patient
so  I guess we know why the cat is up in the tree ,patient
and anyways uh way to the right it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy ,patient
this  this is this wanted ,patient
yeah head,patient
well  my son laughs watched Cinderella quite often ,patient
he  he watches ,patient
 he  he watches all  all the Disney movies you_know over and over again ,patient
and I  I mean over and over again no not once or twice I mean ,patient
forty fifty times yeah ,patient
laughs I know most of them yeah ,patient
well  I  I watched s so many movies with him uh Cinderella might  uh might involve uh some other s story too but ,patient
 yeah ,patient
 okay ,patient
it won't take long ,patient
oh yeah laughs ,patient
I'm gonna give you m my version and it's gonna be laughs very short ,patient
 but uh it starts off with a young girl ,patient
I think she has two sisters maybe ,patient
and she's the least favorite of  of  of  of the  the three even_though she's the  you_know the knockout of the three laughs ,patient
laughs her mother's uh even worse ,patient
sh sh sh you_know I  I k s compare her with the evil g godmother ,patient
anyways uh don't laugh laughs ,patient
anyways she wanted to go to the ball ,patient
and she couldn't go to the ball ,patient
but sh s somehow f sh she got t it  to go to s the ball ,patient
and anyways at  at the ball there was a prince there ,patient
and uh I think he had uh a slipper ,patient
and he tried the slipper on the  every  every girl there ,patient
and uh as luck would have it Cinderella you_know fit into s the shoe ,patient
and anyways uh I hope I'm telling it right laughs ,patient
so  I think uh you_know they're happy ever after ,patient
the end laughs ,patient
that's pretty easy ,patient
I would take uh the bread out_of the icebox ,patient
and I use only Arnold's uh whole grain breads because that's healthier for my son ,patient
I can  I can tell you this because I've b b b been making b uh lunches for like six months now ,patient
and every Tuesday he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
but anyways uh uh I get him a whole piece of  two pieces of whole grain bread ,patient
lay them on the  the ges,patient
and on one I put the grape jelly head,patient
he loves grape ,patient
and then I put uh Skippy smooth spread uh on the other side ,patient
and I ges,patient
and I cut him four pieces ges,patient
and then I uh have uh little bags that I you_know put it in ,patient
and then I  I close the  the sandwich in the bag ,patient
and  I'm ready to go ,patient
