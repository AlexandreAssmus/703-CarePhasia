yep ,patient
mhm ,patient
 it  it  uh it's a good way ,patient
um I think it could've been extended with the expansion of the words more than just twenty on the object and twenty uh subject it's  uh subject ,patient
um after awhile that gets a lil ,patient
yeah  at_least to me it did ,patient
to others ges probably not ,patient
uh knowing the depth of the group that you have ,patient
uh but to me it got really  rep after awhile I got tireding ,patient
uh uh bɑltʃɪŋu ,patient
so  uh I like a small expansion with  with uh xxx words would've been nice ,patient
um I don't know if you could do that uh with the group or with the coming group ges ,patient
it  would it be əpɪkəbəlu ,patient
well  it depends on probably where the person is ,patient
where the  where the person sits in that  that group ,patient
uh if they  if they reach a certain mark then uh I'd  I'd  then I said  say ,patient
 okay expand that person ,patient
uh if they don't they stay on the same words ,patient
and they keep going through it you_know ,patient
 I don't know ,patient
 yeah you expanded mine ,patient
and I doubt that  that some of the people would  would uh be able to take that kind of expansion ,patient
it would've been putting an awful lot of pressure on them ,patient
um so  that was good ,patient
uh but it got a little boring towards the end ,patient
 well the word retrieval was severe at the beginning ,patient
uh uh I think it more severe at the beginning than it is now ,patient
uh but yeah when you say ,patient
 well   I  I wouldn't quite meet that retrieval  wouldn't be at that retrieval level that the rest of the group is at ,patient
it was true ,patient
I would agree that  that um I don't fit into uh that group along that  that ges line ,patient
so ,patient
oh yeah it definitely helped me ,patient
uh I can speak now a_lot more fluent than I could at the beginning ,patient
mhm ,patient
beginning middle and the end oh_boy ,patient
well  here was little Johnny is off kicking the ball ,patient
and he likes to kick the ball ,patient
his father is a soccer player and so he gets a kick out_of it ,patient

he runs up and he whacks the ball points,patient
he whacked it good too points,patient
but unfortunately there's a window points,patient

and he ,patient
it was very  very nice but no she couldn't wear that ,patient
she's too little ,patient
and she's too small to wear that ,patient
and so she just went ,patient

and she jumped in this carriage ,patient
and she rode along ,patient
and she got to the ball ,patient
and there the princess ,patient

and he looked at it ,patient
and the shoe was on ,patient
and because it was on he ,patient
and they went off and they got married ,patient
and they lived happy kɛvɚu ,patient
mhm ,patient
tell me how ,patient
well  I haven't done that lately ,patient
but it is uh really the best thing going ,patient
the what you do is you get the peanut butter and  and  and  and jelly all together ges ,patient
and you hafta kind_of look at it and say ,patient
hm okay I've got myself a loaf of bread ,patient
and I've got a  a firm and a  and a  a lighter loaf ,patient
and I'll choose the firm though because the peanut butter is gonna be sticky and when you spread it ,patient
especially with one hand  left hand ,patient
that's gonna tear the bread ,patient
and so the lighter loaf can't do or you'll end up with  with your bread all ripped up ,patient
so  you take the thicker loaf and slice it down ges,patient
and slice it into two slices each about inch ges,patient
and uh took those ges and lay them down ,patient
and take the peanut butter first points,patient
and bread ,patient
and the bread won't tear ,patient
that bread stays the same ,patient
then you take the  the  the tʃɛlɪu ,patient
oh i it's good tasting jelly ,patient
so  you dip ges,patient
and you spread ges,patient
and it is on top of the peanut butter because I guess  because if you put that on first the jelly and then the peanut butter it would splatter all over ,patient
so  you spread the peanut butter ges,patient
so  you got a loaf  s,patient
and you take your bare piece of bread that's  that's  that's  that's  that's not used ,patient
and you pick it up and put that on top of the whole thing ges,patient
and it'll  press it down just enough that it'll start the jelly falling of the edges ges ,patient
and then you pick it up ges,patient
and you chomp it down ,patient
