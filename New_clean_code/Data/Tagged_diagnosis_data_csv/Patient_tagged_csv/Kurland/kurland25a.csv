well  I'm  I'm supposing that my speech is getting a_little better uh as  uh as time has gone by ,patient
I think that um I can  especially when I'm at the beginning of the day I think I can speak fairly well at certain times ,patient
I've been able in  uh in  in certain cases to uh discuss whole  um whole elaborate stories with  with other people ,patient
uh and  s and sometimes they don't work quite as_well ,patient
uh sometimes uh I can  I can get lost it's  talking to my brother or somebody like that and  uh and just hafta give up and  and  and stop ,patient
at other times I can just yack away with my  my  uh my uh natural uh bullship ,patient
so  sometimes I really feel like I can still talk myself perfectly well ,patient
uh but then s things foul  foul  get fouled and fouled up uh or they just uh start to getting snafuednv from time to time ,patient
but periodically I can surprise people by sounding pretty normal shrugs ,patient
uh it was actually very  very charming ,patient
um I  I was  I was uh just sitting around in my  in my house ,patient
not  I wasn't feeling very well because I'd been about  had about ten  ten  ten days of not feeling particularly great ,patient
and all_of_a_sudden every  something seemed to be terribly wrong ,patient
I said ,patient
 hm I  d I really don't know what that is ,patient
but first I  I called the  uh the ambulance immediately ,patient
then I went and got myself a little valise ges and gathered all my things together ,patient
and uh then I  I  uh I put a couple of things in my  in my  uh uh in my dresser like for example my uh wedding ring and stuff like that just to get  to get them out_of the  out_of the way ,patient
uh and then I  ch I  I  took  uh uh b I  I had uh uh an email I was  I worked on ,patient
I got  ov I got about four people little  just little uh emails saying ,patient
 I'm going to hafta go to the hospital ,patient
and then uh I went o out f of that and  and stood outside waiting for the uh hospital ,patient
and the  uh the  uh the  uh the  the uh uh e_m_t looked at it ,patient
 okay who's  who's  who's here with the  uh who's here with the hospital for the  the ambulance here ,patient
and I said ,patient

and uh so  and then I helped myself out to the uh place ,patient
and that was the last thing I saw ,patient

I can't remember the name of that  that stupid place ,patient
I  it was uh ,patient

but then I can't remember anything about Cooley_Dick at all head,patient
I t have no idea ,patient

I have no idea of  of anything of  of Cooley_Dick at all uh except for my last  uh my last uh uh um trip to  to Cooley_Dick ,patient
before that I  I have no idea ,patient
so  uh my friends once in awhile they'll tell me all these ridiculous things that I did and  and silly  silly things that I was trying to say and failing to say ,patient
but uh I had nothing ,patient
