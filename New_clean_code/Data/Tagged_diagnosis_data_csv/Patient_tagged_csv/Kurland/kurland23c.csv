oh I  I definitely think uh because uh when I first met you at uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house you were doing the same kind of testing ,patient
and I think most of them I couldn't  I couldn't say anything ,patient
um I_mean  I'd  l I'd see the pictures ,patient
and I  I couldn't say an action thing like somebody's like um bending or something like that ,patient
I_mean  I'd just look at the pictures ,patient
and uh and I'd see pictures of things ,patient
uh if I saw a peacock or an artichoke or something like that you_know it was  I probably  there was probably most things ,patient
maybe my  I could say my glasses maybe or banana ,patient
I don't know if I said that at the time but ,patient
 I could say something like that ,patient
but most everything else I'd just  you_know I'd just look at the  I would just look at the pictures you_know ,patient
and I'd  I would be trying to say something but you_know I couldn't do it ,patient
so  I think I'm a_lot better now ,patient
and  um and I think I  I did better in uh well ,patient
I haven't seen uh Martha and Jacquie and  and  and you and myself were doing that for like a couple of weeks ,patient
and I think that I'm better now than I was then ,patient
yeah ,patient
that's  that's what I'm saying ,patient
that's  that's one of the uh ,patient
and then of_course that  you_know when you're not doing it for like ,patient
it's been  it's been uh awhile ,patient
um I hadn't been thinking about for  uh g up until recently a couple of uh days ago ,patient
and I started thinking about everything else together ,patient
now you_know the saying stuff again ,patient
and uh a_lot_of it was coming back perfectly fine ,patient
and then some of the  some of them uh I've added ,patient
I've added that I really couldn't  uh I wouldn't be able to do correctly ,patient
but I think I've done a little bit better ,patient
uh like something's planting you_know ,patient
it has uh planting uh in the ground or something like that ,patient
yeah ,patient
I don't know if there's anything else you'd like me to say ,patient
yeah ,patient
yes ,patient
okay ,patient
yeah ,patient
a young man is um kicking a ball ,patient
and he's really not looking where he's going to do it ,patient
and it comes over to a neighbor's window ,patient
and the  uh and the ball goes right through the window ,patient
and the  uh it's hard to tell whether that's  it's an old  it's an older  p it's a ,patient
it could be a elder  uh a young  a old  an older man not an older man  uh that's sitting in the sofa ,patient
and the  uh the ball just knocked over the uh lamp ,patient
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp ,patient
and  uh and probably  probably could hit the  uh the third  this third person here ,patient
they're sitting here ,patient
so  the  uh the man uh stands up ,patient
and he's picking up the ball ,patient
and he's looking out the window to see who  who probably threw it ,patient
yeah ,patient
well  this is an umbrella ,patient
remember I couldn't even say umbrella ,patient
 before again I could say umbrella ,patient
so  uh the mother  mother is holding the uh umbrella ,patient
and the little boy is  uh is looking ,patient
and she probably saying  g um saying goodbye ,patient
and uh she thinks ,patient
 well  sure don't you think  you should take the umbrella with you ,patient
he said ,patient
 nah I'm ɡʌsu ,patient
but then he's out ,patient
uh and he's ,patient
 oh  look at this ,patient
 it's raining ,patient
 I should've like um taken that umbrella ,patient
you can see it's even  it's even getting worse over here ,patient
and he  uh he's back ,patient
comes  so  he runs back to his house ,patient
and the mother's there ,patient
and she's saying ,patient
they're both looking ,patient
he's soaking wet ,patient
and the mother's looking at him ,patient
and she's gonna probably give him the umbrella ,patient
um and he's going back ,patient
I don't know where he's going ,patient
he's probably going to school ,patient
and he has an umbrella ,patient
and now he's going back to school ,patient
yup ,patient
and uh ,patient
yup ,patient
well  the little girl's looking at the  at the t ,patient
there's a tree here ,patient
and um now this thing probably was start  I think this was started that the dog was running after a cow ,patient
and the cat ran up the tree into a  li a  le a la ,patient
how do I say this ges ,patient
oh a breach ,patient
I'm doing two with and I'm not saying it right ,patient
anyway it's the  um it's part of the  it's part of the tree ,patient
so  this is where the cat eventually got up  was up here ,patient
so  the little girl could've been  could've been actually seeing the  uh the dog uh cha chasing the cat ,patient
and uh but anyway she  she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down ,patient
she was probably riding a tric tricycle ,patient
um so  the  probably her father put the ladder up on the limb  limb  the limb and uh went up there ,patient
and the  l and the ladder fell ,patient
uh so  the  it's pretty high up ,patient
and the cat's up there ,patient
and the  uh the man is way up high ,patient
and he doesn't have a ladder ,patient
and his  uh and by the looks of it his  actually his daughter's more interested in the cat than  than her father ,patient
or that's  or it's a man perhaps ,patient
and uh there's a bird on the  tr in the tree also but I don't think they're involved in uh ,patient
yeah  and I don't think they're afraid the cat or anything like that ,patient
uh so  the uh firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going uh to first take the  the father down ,patient
and uh then they're gonna get the cat ,patient
and uh the little girl will be happy ,patient
and the  uh the dog ,patient
who knows what's gonna happen to the dog ,patient
it's gonna probably chase after her  the cat again and find another tree ,patient
I don't know laughs ,patient
Cinderella ,patient
oh yes ,patient
yup ,patient
okay ,patient
um on ,patient
and they're not very attractive ,patient
and there's a  there's another girl who's a blonde and quite attractive ,patient
uh s same age ,patient
uh but she hasta do things to like do all the work ,patient
and the  um I think that the  uh the mother ,patient
and I'm not sure whether that  the mother  the uh attractive uh one is part  is  she's  uh uh she's part of the family or one of uh a younger  a younger woman ,patient
well  with  with the  with this mother ,patient
I'm not sure how that works out ,patient
there's a handsome man too ,patient
I'm not sure that that's her husband ,patient
and  you_know and maybe you_know that's the reason why he has those two  uh the two  the other two woman that aren't very attractive ,patient
uh so  uh he's  the  uh the young  the young lady um is looking  um looking over the  over the window out into the city and sees the  the uh cass castle which I'm sure that  who  um who's probably the king uh of the  uh of that area uh lives at the regular city ,patient
and the  the  uh the people live in a regular  in the the house  regular house uh with the mother and the  and the other  the other uh three uh young women ,patient
and two of them ,patient
I don't even remember if  if they're twins ,patient
I'm not sure the  the  uh they have like dark  dark hair and stuff like that ,patient
so  she's  um the  uh the king wants to have a party uh for his  his young  s his young son ,patient
and it'd be nice if uh he might  if everybody in the city that are  uh they get a letter ,patient
I'm not sure everybody's gonna get one but they're gonna have this dance ,patient
and um they'll  they could actually meet the  uh this young man uh coming up ,patient
so  the  uh the young  the young girl  the blonde lady is like down in the  has her own room ,patient
or maybe it could be uh in the ba basement or something ,patient
and she's looking at  uh at a  at the different  uh glah the uh ,patient
what do you call that ,patient
the dress  the dress is not  apparently it's not perfectly uh beautiful uh in the uh ,patient
and the other  uh the other uh ,patient
so  they're going  when they're going to the party ,patient
and uh actually three of the  three of the girls  the two twins um ,patient
and she's  she's going ,patient
and um they're not ,patient
I think part of that I'm missing what's happened ,patient
well  anyway what  what happens is that the  uh the  uh the young  the young girl um talks to the uh magical grand  grandmother ,patient
I know I'm not using it correctly head,patient
uh and she  uh she has a magical f uh ,patient
I can't think what did I call it ,patient
anyway it turns her into a beautiful white uh dress ,patient
and she also has uh the  her shoes are made out_of glass ,patient
and she's dancing with a young  with a h handsome man ,patient
and they seem like they're getting along ,patient
and uh of_course the  the women  the other  the other children uh they're probably adults now aren't really that happy about the fact that uh she has a beautiful gown and  and she's dancing and obviously the uh young gentleman prefers her ,patient
and uh they also know that  uh that  that all of that  the beautiful dress and everything like that that was given by the  uh this magical grandmother ,patient
I know I'm not using this right head,patient
uh knows that at twelve o'clock everything will  will change ,patient
and she'll hafta like  uh she's gonna hafta run away ,patient
so  right  she realizes that it's almost twelve uh that  eve that evening ,patient
and she's running away down the stairs ,patient
and she lost w the glass um shoe ,patient
and  uh and all of the  she had uh uh uh a castle ,patient
not a castle ,patient
well  she uh ,patient
I'm having a difficult saying how this  this young woman was uh ri riding ,patient
but anyway at  at  noo at uh twelve o'clock everything goes back to its original  uh what it was ,patient
and uh so she's gone ,patient
she's back at the house ,patient
and uh the king found this beautiful glass shoe ,patient
and he wants to go all the way around  around the city and try to find this  y this woman ,patient
and they  uh they came to that particular house ,patient
and they found  uh they had the  gra the uh grass ,patient
and the young woman  the uh blonde lady uh she actually  she's the only one that will  that can actually fit that glass uh shoe ,patient
and the  uh everybody's really pleased about it ,patient
and they realized that the  the king ,patient
I guess he's a prince ,patient
the prince and uh this young woman are gonna get married ,patient
and that's how it ends ,patient
 no yeah ,patient
I forgot the part ,patient
you_know  how they  how she got to the uh party ,patient
was uh I think they have like  uh uh everything  everything is made out_of like uh ,patient
like the horses are really mice and stuff like that ,patient
I don't know if it doesn't say that in there but ,patient
what ,patient
a peanut butter and jelly ,patient
um how would I  how would  how I would make it ,patient
and I  I would use my  uh my knife ,patient
um laughs well  if I was gonna make uh a sandwich with  uh out_of uh peanuts and uh some kind of futu ,patient
and I would buy it ,patient
and it's really fresh ,patient
and I would  uh and I'd use the knife ,patient
and I would  uh it's  it  I hafta like uh ,patient
uh I'm trying to think of what the right term ,patient
slice  slice ,patient
I'm gonna slice the bread and make two pieces but whatever size I want it to be ,patient
and  uh and then I would open up the peanut  peanut butter ,patient
and I would use the knife ,patient
and I could put as much peanut butter I would want ,patient
and I would open up the  uh the fruit  uh jelly  the jelly ,patient
and I could put as much on that as I want ,patient
and I would cut it in half or even four pieces ,patient
and  um and I could eat it ,patient
and it would be delicious ,patient
at_least that's what I'm gonna say shrugs ,patient
