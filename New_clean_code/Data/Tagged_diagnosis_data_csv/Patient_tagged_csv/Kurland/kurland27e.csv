mhm ,patient
I remember going into the  hos being admitted to the hospital ,patient
I felt wide awake ,patient
I was talking to the um guys in the ambulance ,patient
um then my sister met me ,patient
and after that I me remember very little ,patient
um I do reme remember but I think it's because they told me that um they instead of  they admitted me but did not do anything at all to um work on my leg which is what they should've done immediately ,patient
um they told  they told me or  they told my sister that um they were gonna let me you_know rest for twenty  f you_know for twenty four hours and evaluate it which was laughs the most asinine decision they ever made because by waiting um and I don't know remember the medical terms but basically I was out ,patient
um and um my  sis they had sent my sister home ,patient
and she came back up the hospital the next morning ,patient
and um she had a fit because she knew there was something wrong ,patient
um and I guess that by then I didn't know but she had  she called the doctors and had had a f s f screaming fit ,patient
and they ended me in to do  to operate on me which was like twenty hours late ,patient
and by that time I'd lost all use of my right leg ,patient
um and I remember  I sort_of remember going in and out ,patient
um I kept thinking ,patient
 I hafta get up ,patient
 I hafta do something ,patient
um and like s uh to me in my head I was yelling at the nurse saying ,patient
 you_know  why are you doing this to me ,patient
um I didn't come out of it ,patient
you'd hafta ask my sister but at_least three or four days ,patient
um and I gather from my  my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious ,patient
um and I woke up and was in a blitz uh blank out ges ,patient
um I came out_of the hospital like after six days I think  seven days ,patient
and they immediately put in  put me in ,patient
um and it took me another ten  twelve days ,patient
no  thirty ,patient
t it took me thirty  forty  forty two days between each  ho between the two hospitals ,patient
and at the end of the two  forty do ,patient
no ,patient
I wanna say Mount  s oh Saint  Mount_St_Vincent ,patient
and um they kept me there for let's see  four five six weeks ,patient
and then they left me in there another twelve  twelve and a half months ,patient
so  I spent um thirteen fourteen weeks in there I_mean  fourteen months in there ,patient
um and then they let me out ,patient
and um the time in the hospital I ,patient
and I hope  I'm hoping  may I'm changing my mind now ,patient
but um for the month  for the twelve  six months that I spent there I've had a_lot_of doubt as to whether I should have left it or not ,patient
because there I can go ,patient
I could si study ,patient
I could take the van wherever I needed to go ,patient
when I wanted to study I studied ,patient
when I didn't wanna study I didn't ,patient
um the last six months or so have just been massive disasters of being  people who you don't wanna be around you around you um if you wanna do things ,patient
and that  that ups upsets me as much as knowing that for the first three four  mo fi four  four to five months I have no recognition of what happened ,patient
but now I'm going through a period of anger ,patient
um it just sighs ,patient
that's quite a story  Firstname ,patient
oh  it gets  it gets better laughs ,patient

um and I smiled sweetly and listened to all this ,patient
and I have no idea what's going on yet ,patient
