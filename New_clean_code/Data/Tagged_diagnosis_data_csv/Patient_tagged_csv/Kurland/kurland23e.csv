uh sure ,patient
I think it's  um it's August ,patient
and um it was a Friday ,patient
it was about uh eight fifty eight eight fifty nine ,patient
it was almost nine o'clock ,patient
I was driving on the Boston_Road ,patient
I was driving uh a nineteen ninety three Ford van ,patient
we had just gone to a Home_Depot ,patient
and  and uh she brought ,patient
a bathroom  s,patient
a bathroom  s,patient
it was made out_of fiberglass ,patient
and then I showed her a thirty foot long uh ladder uh that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less ,patient
and uh then I started driving ,patient
like I said on Boston_Road ,patient
and I was going to um Yuno ,patient
and um FirstnameG looked at me and she said ,patient
 um turned right ,patient
 and then try to put on your brakes ,patient
and I wasn't going very fast anyway ,patient
so  I managed to like not hit anything ,patient
and I managed to turn right ,patient
and uh I pulled off of the side of the road ,patient
and uh I put on the brakes ,patient
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that ges,patient
I was holding on to the wheel ,patient
and then  uh and that was  that was ,patient
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor ,patient
and they all could see something was happening ,patient
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground ,patient
and uh um then somebody  somebody uh with a smartphone called up uh an ambulance ,patient
and uh they said ,patient
 you're going to the hospital ,patient
and uh after that I  d it took me a long time before I could say um Bay  uh Bay_State  or something like that ,patient
and um you_know I was saying to myself um I said ,patient
 obviously I feel pretty good ,patient
 and they're taking me to  uh they're using an ambulance ,patient
 and they're taking me to the hospital at Bay_State ,patient
 and uh obviously there must be something wrong with me or else I wouldn't be going to uh a hospital in an ambulance ,patient
and uh then I tried to say something to FirstnameG ,patient
and then I couldn't say anything ,patient
and then I couldn't say the right words ,patient
I_mean  I knew what I could say but I couldn't say it ,patient
and that's when I realized that  uh that I probably had a stroke ,patient
I think that's ges ,patient
have I said  said that before ,patient
oh  okay head,patient
 sure  okay ,patient
uhhuh ,patient
uhhuh ,patient
um well  in the beginning there's uh a little girl ,patient
and there's a cat ,patient
and um I think that the little girl loves the cat ,patient
it's a good friend ,patient
I don't know if it's male or female ,patient
and she'd like  she wanted to get  have the  uh the cat off of a tree ,patient
it's up on the  on the uh tr træntʃu ,patient
I can't say ,patient
bræntsu ,patient
bræntsɪzu ,patient
bræntsu ,patient
okay  uh so  she asked her father if he could use a ladder and to go up to the tree and get the cat ,patient
and then a ladder fell down ,patient
maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get away to this  far away as possible ,patient
um either that or um the  the dog wished the father hadn't fallen down the ladder laughs ,patient
so  then there's a bird ,patient
um I don't know how  what the  the  the bird is involved ,patient
it's s s gonna  s it's  s it's making a song perhaps ,patient
and uh there's uh another uh ladder that's involved with the firemen ,patient
and they're trying to lift up the  uh they're gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his ,patient
uh if the  if the cat was more important of_course the  the uh firemen would get the cat first and then the dir the  uh and then  then  uh then get the  uh the father down ,patient
uh is there anything else ,patient
yup ,patient
yeah  you_know I  I uh ,patient
that thing about the grand  that  about the  uh the grandmother ,patient
I've forgotten what I should call  the right term to call the grandmother ,patient
yeah  yeah ,patient
oh  I can't look at it ,patient
okay ,patient
okay  the version ,patient
okay ,patient
um in the very beginning there's um a mother ,patient
there are two  two daughters ,patient
and uh I'm not sure ,patient
there's another woman  young girl ,patient
and she's a blonde ,patient
and she has blue hi eyes ,patient
and uh the  uh the two  the two daughters have dark hair ,patient
and they're uh young then ,patient
and then  uh then this continues in the future ,patient
time is going on ,patient
and the  uh the girls are much older ,patient
and the two  uh two daughters are uh not very attractive ,patient
and the blonde lady has  her hair's now kind_of light brown but her  you can still see her blue eyes ,patient
and uh she's uh ,patient
in the beginning I have no idea why that young  the blonde girl is there ,patient
whether uh she's an  or she's like uh ,patient
something happened to their family and they're just taking you  they're gonna uh live ,patient
so  anyway I'm not sure about that ,patient
so  um so  anyway she's like  um her friends are all other mice ,patient
and uh the cat seems kind_of evil to me ,patient
the cat's a_little evil ,patient
there's a horse  there's a horse there ,patient
there all these little  mi there are three or four mice ,patient
and uh the  um they realize that uh there's  that they're going to  um there's a  k there's a king ,patient
and he has a son ,patient
and um they  they  wan they'd like to have a dance uh because they would like to marry the  uh the son who's probably a prince ,patient
and uh so they invite everybody in the town ,patient
I think ,patient
or just people that have a_lot_of money and you_know the uh ,patient
so  uh there's a litter ,patient
and uh they could  they could go to uh a prawn ,patient
not a prawn ,patient
I'm not using the right xxx ,patient
a dance ges ,patient
it's gonna be a dance or something like that ,patient
and uh the  uh the  bron the brown haired  the light brown haired blonde woman is like  she's very excited too ,patient
she could probably go herself ,patient
and she had uh her  br her  um she has a gown ,patient
uh it's okay ,patient
um and they're going to the dance that evening ,patient
so  uh  that's gonna happen  I think ,patient
so  then there's this  um there's this grandau grand  uh grand ,patient
not a grand lady ,patient
see the last time I said it I knew what her name was ,patient
it's kind_of like um ,patient
and the first time I said it was a magical grandmother ,patient
but it isn't magical ,patient
it's something else ,patient
 but I've  I've forgotten what it was ,patient
and  uh so  anyway  they said that uh with magic I could turn the  uh the horse and the pumpkin ,patient
I don't know ,patient
they didn't say anything about the pumpkin but I think I saw the movie a long time ago ,patient
a pumpkin became a um ,patient
ges I don't know what they call that ,patient
it's not a truck ,patient
anyway  the  uh the  uh the mice are gonna be part of the  uh on  this group of people that are going to the dance ,patient
and the horse is beautiful ,patient
and the  uh the thing she's gonna carry and  is v very interesting ,patient
and then they  uh they go to the  d they go to the dance ,patient
it's in the  f it's in  it's  it's getting  it's very  it's in the uh nine ten o'clock at night ,patient
she's go  she's  uh she's dancing with the uh prince ,patient
and she has  uh um her shoes are glass shoes ,patient
and they're very small ,patient
and um she realizes that uh at  n at twelve o'clock that uh all of the magical stuff is gonna be gone ,patient
and uh she's gonna  so she  so um she um realizes that it's almost twelve o'clock ,patient
and she  she get  she  t she uh runs away from the uh dance or whatever it is ,patient
and uh she lost one of them one of the  uh the glasses  shoes ,patient
and um so she's back at her  hou she's back at the house ,patient
and where she's like us ,patient
she just helps out ,patient
and uh the um part of the um ,patient
the king found the uh grass ,patient
and uh they  everybody tries to put their feet in it ,patient
and of_course the  uh the two daughters ,patient
of_course it doesn't  it doesn't say that but I'm sure that's what happens ,patient
everybody in the town they can't  they're too  they have  they're the  the  uh the glass shoe is  is all too  their  you_know their feet are too big ,patient
and then the  uh the young useta be a blonde bl blue hair ,patient
and they realized that she's really gonna be a princess ,patient
and  uh and then ,patient
and the other thing is  is that I'm confused about when she goes to the uh dance she has a kind_of uh a white pink dress ,patient
but then she's at the  uh the dance and she's got a much nicer  it's a gown perhaps ,patient
it's a really  it's white very beautiful ,patient
and she's got the uh grass ,patient
and  um and she runs away ,patient
uh I don't know what happened to the  to that white gown ,patient
she's got the uh pink and white one ,patient
and she's back in her bathroom ,patient
and then  you_know then she can fit the  uh the grass ,patient
she  uh she's gonna be the one that  that uh the prince and the uh princess are gonna be married ,patient
ges that's kind_of ,patient
 you always say that ,patient
oh  yeah head,patient
oh  is that good ,patient
 that's good ,patient
good to do that ,patient
