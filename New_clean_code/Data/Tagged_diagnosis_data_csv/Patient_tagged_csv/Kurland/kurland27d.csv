but they  the more I did it the more the words came ges ,patient
um I was thinking about th going over the words in my head ,patient
and I found that I still retained a almost seven  eighty percent of what I had learned ,patient
I hadta keep going back ,patient

but  um did I feel it was helpful shrugs ,patient
yes  because I didn't realize how much I had learned I_mean  I d or  lost ,patient

ges and add ten more words ,patient
because I felt the repetition ges of two sets of words ,patient
I don't know why but points,patient
