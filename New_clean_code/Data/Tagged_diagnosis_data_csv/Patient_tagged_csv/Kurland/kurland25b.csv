certainly ,patient
yes  I think I was sposta  I think I  h uh I had dropped my um ,patient
no  that's a good question ,patient
I think I dropped my daughter ,patient
and I  I went home to uh South_Deerfield ,patient
and FirstnameP was there ,patient
and uh I  I  we had things we were gonna do later in the day ,patient
but all_of_a_sudden as I was driving I heard uh some chaos and commotion going off in the  by the radio ,patient
and I went down and  uh and sat there and said ,patient
 what's going on here ,patient
and  and then I went up to  uh to uh FirstnameP who was getting dressed ,patient
I said ,patient
 uh FirstnameP  I think some kind of disaster has fall  befallen the world ,patient
 and uh you should come down and look at it ,patient
so  I went out and we had a  to the tv and  and started looking at it ,patient
once it  once it started it was like you just hadta stop and look at it ,patient
there was nʌsɪŋu ,patient
and uh my uh uh managing editor at the Review uh who at that  at that time was  was uh uh living nearby came over too ,patient
so  the three of us just sat around and  and watched ,patient
but I think a nothing else happened that day ,patient
I think we just shut it all down and  and just s sat there and began to try to deal with it a little bit ,patient
but it was an extraordinary day because that was when the  uh the two towers uh fell down one after another ,patient
and it was  it was amazing to just sit there ,patient
then one of them the  the smoke would go over it and imit,patient
 I  I just couldn't believe my eyes actually just you_know because uh you_know I'm  f I'm from New_York ,patient
and I've  I've spent  I know what all that stuff is like and uh shrugs ,patient
head,patient
that was pretty much it ,patient
I think we just sat there and  and  the three of us ,patient
 then I got my  then I got my daughter ,patient
and we hadta just  we had  I hadta explain to her what  how  what happened ,patient
that was tough ,patient
mhm ,patient
okay ,patient
uh Otto was playing soccer and kicked the ball much harder than he expected ,patient
the  uh the ball uh broke the  the  the glass of uh Mister_McGregor's house and kicked his  and bumped his own  his uh ball  s,patient
at this point Mister_McGregor came out uh very angry and upset by the destruction of his property ,patient
okay ,patient
 Patricia told her daughter to ,patient
uh her  her son ,patient
I guess it's a son ,patient
Patricia told her son to uh make sure to get uh an umbrella today because it might very well rain ,patient
however  young Ants said ,patient
 no I really don't wanna have an umbrella with me today ,patient
 and I don't think it's going to be particularly rainy ,patient
so  Ants was on his way to school when eventually he began seeing the uh dribble drops of the  uh of the  uh the rain as it proceeded ,patient
in_fact  the rain got very heavy ,patient
and  uh and uh he hadta return to his house where his  uh his  uh uh uh his ,patient
who's she  she ,patient
his  uh uh when his  uh dai when his daughter ,patient
 I told you before Ants ,patient
 you're sposta take care of your  your clothes and get  uh and be careful of the rain before the rain comes out ,patient
then young Ants carried  uh carried his  carried himself uh with a nice umbrella to  uh to get to school in the morning ,patient
you're right ,patient
yeah  yeah  that's it ,patient
it's true ,patient
oh yeah this ,patient
it was a terribly busy day here in  uh in Woodbrook ,patient
uh the cat was  uh had  had treedv itself in today  in the  uh in  in the early afternoon ,patient
and young uh Polly was uh trying very hard to  uh to  to get the cat uh treedv before uh it  it tried to get even farther into the  uh into the tree itself ,patient
uh dad uh uh attempted to get the tree ,patient
and he couldn't get out  get the  the  uh he couldn't get the  uh the  the  the tree ,patient
he couldn't get the tree together for himself ,patient
uh so  here  uh the  there  there was no point by  of trying to get the ladder because uh dad just couldn't get it up ,patient
and there it was ,patient
the dog was of_course as dogs always do began to  uh to bark and bark furiously which of_course made the cat even more perturbed ,patient
uh by this time they hadta actually call a fireman uh to get the cat back ,patient
and uh the  the  the thing had a  a happy ending with a twittering bird ,patient
oh yeah ,patient
hm,patient
laughs okay ,patient
once upon a time uh the children were astounded to see that there was a new child uh magically appearing from somewhere ,patient
uh though where she was  she  she came from noone seemed to know ,patient
uh mother was very  mom  her  her mother was very angry with that idea and thought well I suppose uh that Cinderella can simply be a servant uh this  for her  for herself and for her own two daughters ,patient
uh and sure enough that's what Cinderella mostly did ,patient
she  mos she mostly worked terribly ,patient
and uh as she was  and  and uh the  uh the other three daughters were of_course uh hideous and  uh and  and vicious ,patient
and they  uh they were of  they were  uh they  they  uh they  they  they really  they didn't stay  in the  in the  uh in  they didn't sit  stay in the  in the uh uh ,patient
it's not the apartment ,patient
anyway they  they  they had uh a quiet  they had another spot a sort_of servant's quarters uh that they hadta  hadta keep ,patient
um it was a  it was a beautiful uh day ,patient
there was a  there was a  you could see the  uh the  uh the king's castle look  uh looking  uh uh kind_of twinkling in  in everybody's eyes as  uh as they looked besides ,patient
but luckily there was something that  that  uh that helped Cinderella during this time ,patient
mostly uh some rodents that  uh that appeared uh con constantly in  in  in  in what would've been I guess a very needed  would've needed  a  uh um a uh laughs uh ,patient
oops can't do it never mind ,patient
let's forget that part ,patient
uh and also there was a horse lying around and I think  maybe a dog as_well ,patient
at that point um the two uh other daughters of  s of  uh of their mother uh heard that there was going to be uh a special ball today uh presumably for the prince's uh birthday or something like that ,patient
and there um Cinderella thought ,patient
 oh  this is going to be fun ,patient
and she got  she got the  a little  uh a little dress herself ,patient
and yet the two nasty daughters said ,patient
 no  she's not going to come ,patient
 she can't stay ,patient
she's a servant you_know ,patient
and they are  they were the hautesadj old bourgeoisiesn of the place ,patient
so  they said ,patient
 fine ,patient
and there was just no  no  uh no point in  in her being here ,patient
fortunately for Cinderella who would've been no doubt weeping uh in  for  uh for the  the misery of not being at the  uh at the castle uh uh s sin Cinderella had a fairy godmothmother ,patient
and uh she said ,patient
 wow fine ,patient
 I have a  uh I have uh a special uh place that you can do ,patient
y I will get your  uh I will get you a beautiful uh uh dress ,patient
 so  you can  you can  uh uh come  you can  f you can uh join with  with it  with me ,patient
 and uh then uh I have also uh c uh a uh magic uh uh ,patient
here comes trouble ,patient
um  coach ,patient
uh a magic coach that  uh that  that you can ride ,patient
and sure enough there were also two beautiful horses that were not like the mangy old horses that Cinderella knew ,patient
uh they move then to the  uh the  the beginning of the  of the  uh of the ball ,patient
and uh all_of_a_sudden uh the  uh the prince's ,patient
and she danced with him ,patient
and they danced the  the ball together uh happily for uh many time  many hours ,patient
however  Cinderella also hadta uh stop because uh the  uh i in the  in the  at the  cr at the  at the croak ,patient
laughs no xxx ,patient
at the  at the croak ,patient
and  uh and so she hadta walk back from  from the  uh the  the  uh the  the  the  she  she had t to walk  uh she hadta drive back ,patient
but all_of_a_sudden  uh but at that point she also no longer had her beautiful uh gown ,patient
at this point the  uh uh the king ,patient
 who is this beautiful ,patient
uh this  the  the  this  the prince said to the king ,patient
 who is this beautiful woman ,patient
 I must find her ,patient
and they looked all around uh to try to  to discover her but uh she  th they  they couldn't or not readily ,patient
eventually they came up to the  to the  uh the place where uh Cinderella uh ,patient
no  no  sorry ,patient
where the  the two nasty creatures that normally habat inhabited the place uh would  uh would have their  uh would have their  their missing uh slipper ,patient
uh and uh they tried each one ,patient
and the  these  n these nasty creatures were unable to  uh to  uh to  to  s to fit with the  uh laughs were unable to  to  to  to fit the slipper ,patient
uh however Cinderella was ,patient
and uh they were uh delighted to be able to discover her ,patient
and they brought her back to the castle where she  uh she uh uh eventually uh  lived there and  uh and married with the king ,patient
that was sloppy work ,patient
I should've done better with that really ,patient
yes ,patient
first I would  I would get some bread ,patient
um and then I would probably um get some butter and slop the bread out ,patient
and then I would  I would get some uh I would say uh uh probably jelly ,patient
I'd slop the  the jelly in ,patient
I'd  I'd bring it all back hands,patient
then I will  c would cut the other uh portions of it ,patient
then I'd eat it up ,patient
