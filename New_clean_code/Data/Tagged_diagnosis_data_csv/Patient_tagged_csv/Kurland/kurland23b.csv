I was at work ,patient
I was at work ,patient
and um people came down ,patient
one of the women came down ,patient
and she said she was talking  d that her husband called the telephone  called him ,patient
 you should see what's happened ,patient
and one of the planes too ,patient
one plane hit ,patient
it was probably ,patient
what was it ,patient
uh it was eight fifty nine in the morning  I think ,patient
and at first they thought it was like uh a small um airplane ,patient
and it hit the  um it  it hit the uh Twin_towers ,patient
uh but then they realized it was really  uh it was north and s ,patient
I think it was north and south ,patient
is that the different towers ,patient
and um they thought that it really was a much bigger airplane ,patient
and um anyway her husband said that he had heard that maybe they're ,patient
this is later on that there was  they were like ,patient
all around the country the other um buildings were gonna get hit ,patient
and  um but basically we saw that there was really  uh the  um the pɪnətɡɑnu ,patient
and um the other plane ,patient
and then this is  this was a number of  uh I think there were four  four planes ,patient
um the other one um people that were  were riding got up and tried to like um talk  they got it to hit the ground ,patient
and um lemme think what else happened ,patient
I think there was four planes ,patient
and um okay yeah ,patient
so there were two  there were  there were  there were  there were two of the Twin_towers ,patient
two  kah two different planes hit that ,patient
and  um and then the Pentagon hit ,patient
and then the other plane they actually got it down ,patient
and  and uh the plane never hit anything ,patient
it  it hit the ground ,patient
okay head,patient
yeah ,patient
yeah ,patient
but it was funny because they thought that it was gonna  that it was gonna ,patient
the  her husband thought that it was gonna happen to a_lot more than that ,patient
uh where they  where they got their information ,patient
they  they  they claimed that they could hear ,patient
I don't know what they did ges but they claimed that it might go everywhere around the country ,patient
but nothing yet  we never  of_course we realized that never happened ,patient
yeah okay ,patient
sure ,patient
no  this is a story ,patient
like me to tell a story ,patient
okay  the boy hit uh a ball ,patient
and he hit the  um the window ,patient
and uh in the back  actually it was his  it was his house ,patient
and inside the house it could've been an  ol an older man uh got hit by the ball ,patient
it hit the  uh the window on the outside ,patient
and on the inside it went through the window ,patient
and it hit the uh person that was sitting ,patient
and  uh and look like the person got up ,patient
and he hel hold the  held the  uh the ball ,patient
and he was out looking at a big hole in the  in the window ,patient
and he was trying to see who actually hit him ,patient
I don't know that's ,patient
this is funny ,patient
I'm gonna call this a heavy carousel ,patient
because uh if I took a little  I'll  if I  if I spend more time I'll say what it is ,patient
anyway it'll come up to me ,patient
I know what it is ,patient
I've been practicing ,patient
where you were doing on the ,patient
I was  I was ,patient
umbrella ,patient
okay  umbrella ,patient
that's why I called it a heavy carousel ,patient
I thought that was kind_of funny ,patient
I meant that  I meant that to be funny head,patient
okay  um so  anyway  I've been talking about this and I haven't really been looking at this ,patient
sorry ,patient
I don't know what this means ,patient
is it  um it's either the little boy was going to  going to use that ,patient
or either that or his um ,patient
I guess ,patient
is he heading  uh is he  is he  in the beginning of it is the little boy talking to his mother that he wanted to  to use this ,patient
or he either that  ges either that or he wanted it ,patient
and she said ,patient
 well  maybe you shouldn't take it ,patient
I'm  I'm not sure exactly how this is ,patient
uh so  the little  the little boy is still looking uh at his mother ,patient
and she's holding the  uh the heavy parasol ,patient
and um anyway he's out the house ,patient
and it's raining already ,patient
and now it's really heavy rain ,patient
and uh so he came back ,patient
he's back to his house ,patient
and he's covered with water ,patient
and the rain was heavy ,patient
and his mother didn't look like she's very happy ,patient
and uh it doesn't say exactly what happened to the uh jusɛləu ,patient
but he has it now ,patient
and he's back  he's outside again ,patient
and he's not get his  he's not uh get  he's not get his  um he's not  he's not gonna  on his head he's not gonna get hit by it ,patient
and uh he  so he'll be drier ,patient
I wasn't sure how  how that worked with the mother whether she really wanted him to use it or she wanted to keep it ,patient
I'm not sure ,patient
okay ,patient
okay ,patient
oh okay ,patient
okay  this is kind_of a fun story ,patient
this is like the  um so  like there's a  there's like a little girl ,patient
and she liked  liked the  the cat ,patient
there's also a dog ,patient
now the dog could belong  belong to  uh to the  f the  f their family perhaps ,patient
or it could be uh somebody else's um neighbor ,patient
and they had a dog ,patient
and the dog actually skeɪdu ,patient
and the dog ,patient
and it was um on the  up there pretty high ,patient
so  his ,patient
 oh  I'll get the cat ,patient
 and I'll get a ladder ,patient
 and I'll put the ladder up here ,patient
 and I'll try to get the cat ,patient
 so  I got up there ,patient
 and what happened though ,patient
 the ladder fell down ,patient
and the little girl probably was driving ,patient
I don't know what you call that it starts with a kl ,patient
it's like a ,patient
anyways she  she still  she really liked the cat ,patient
so  somebody ,patient
it was either um ,patient
there's also a  there's also uh a bird up here ,patient
but I don't think that  that  that has anything involved with the cat ,patient
I don't think the cat is afraid of the  of the  of the  the  uh the bird ,patient
so  um you would think that the little girl if she was strong  if she was older she could help uh lift up the ladder and put the father back on ,patient
but uh she can't ,patient
and uh I don't know ,patient
she doesn't look like she's involved that  that she has a small  a telephone ,patient
and she could call up um nineoneone or something so_that the fire people could come and put the ladder up and get his ,patient
and then  and uh she also  she's not gonna  they like daw uh birds so they'll  they'll  they won't try to hurt the  the bird either ,patient
and they probably will get the uh ,patient
of_course the thing that would be kind_of fun ,patient
if they were more interested in getting the cat they'd leave the father up there ,patient
I don't know shrugs ,patient
that's my little story ,patient
oh yeah I knew that was ,patient
I  I saw ,patient
I saw it points ,patient
I saw it ,patient
sure ,patient
okay ,patient
my version ,patient
um well  the first page um these  there are little girls ,patient
and there's a  muh there's a mother ,patient
and they had like a little  c a cat ,patient
and the cat uh ,patient
so those  so and then on the second page I don't know if it's her husband ,patient
uh and there's like  um and there's another girl ,patient
it's possible that they  that the mother had  had three girls ,patient
and um the two of them were kind_of her pals ,patient
and maybe they were twins ,patient
I'm not sure ,patient
but they weren't very attractive ,patient
uh and the  uh and the cat looked like it was a_lot_of trouble too ,patient
it had a kind_of  um um it was almost like um their mother ,patient
their mother didn't look like she was a_lot_of fun either ,patient
and maybe  perhaps it was her husband ,patient
and they had like a dog ,patient
and the dog looked like a nice dog ,patient
and little blonde girl was  she was  she was nice too ,patient
and the husband  perhaps it was the husband ,patient
he seems like a nice person also ,patient
and the mother and her two little twin girls and that little  and the cat are just trouble ,patient
so  um so  what's happening ,patient
they're  um we can see that this happened in a much later period of time ,patient
and the  um the  l the  the three little girls got older ,patient
and two of them weren't very attractive ,patient
and the mother um was um perhaps it's her mother uh she much preferred the  the two  um the two twin sisters that weren't very attractive ,patient
and um so they  actually if I remember correctly the  they useta let  the little  the little  the pretty little girl hadta do crappy work ,patient
and she wasn't treated  she much preferred the  uh the twins if they were twins ,patient
so  um and I think the mother  the young  the young girl uh the  at one time she was a blonde ,patient
I think her hair is ɡɑɾɪŋu ,patient
she um was looking at a beautiful um dress ,patient
and um she also looked out the window ,patient
and she saw this beautiful um place where the um ,patient
I hafta say how you call that right ,patient
it starts with a cl sighs ,patient
it's probably the head of the uh ,patient
if if there was like  there was a town ,patient
um he is either something like the  may the mayor or he was a im important um person ,patient
he had like a young  he had this  this young man that perhaps was gonna be the king or something ,patient
I'm not sure exactly how you say it ,patient
and it's like ,patient
I'm having a really hard time calling what the name of that place was ,patient
starts with a cl ,patient
um castle ,patient
the castle ,patient
they saw the castle ,patient
okay ,patient
so  so  we're  we're setting up here ,patient
we see the  uh the young  the  the attractive young girl ,patient
she's our nice  she had you_know she had  um she's older ,patient
she saw priz this very attractive uh dress ,patient
and uh she looked out the window ,patient
and she saw the castle ,patient
and uh this would be a nice ,patient
that's the area ,patient
so  then the mother got uh a letter claiming that there was gonna be a  um a big dance or a big area where people ,patient
I don't think he's the king or whatever he is were all gonna take a look at this ,patient
it's gonna be around um ,patient
it must be  uh it's a important area because people were going to  they're gonna dance with this young man ,patient
um they're gonna have music ,patient
they're gonna have food perhaps ,patient
it seems like a great time ,patient
but the main reason was  is that all those  all those young girls all around the country uh they would decide which one uh the  uh the king's young son was gonna marry ,patient
he's gonna marry one of those women ,patient
and uh so um I also  I  if I remember correctly the  uh the  uh their  the pretty girl couldn't really go to  um couldn't go to this  this  this  this interesting plɛriəu ,patient
lemme see what you call it right sighs ,patient
so  there's a merr uh magic grandmother ,patient
and she decides that  um that the little  um that the young woman  this young woman could  could wear nice clothes ,patient
she could wear nice clothes too ,patient
you_know  there's a beautiful white gown ,patient
and she would go ,patient
and she danced with the  uh she danced with the um young man who was gonna be the king in the future ,patient
and uh they seem like  this is the one ,patient
and she had this  um um  there was a g glassed ,patient
and a_lot_of different people tried to put that on ,patient
and only one had the right  uh the right feet that  that would be able to wear the uh glass shoes ,patient
and um so the  so they  um the young man was of_course quite happy ,patient
and  but the problem was  is that things are gonna change at  at twelve ,patient
there's a midnight time ,patient
and uh I think all of that um ,patient
I don't know if this story says it corr was  correctly that  that um they were all in this beautiful place ,patient
this  um this not a wagon ,patient
I'm not saying the right term of what this thing is ,patient
but at twelve this thing that everybody's riding on turns into  um ,patient
you can't ride in it nicely ,patient
it's uh ,patient
I'm having a ha hard time when I was doing this ,patient
I  it starts with a uh ,patient
that orange thing ,patient
it starts with a pl ,patient
and we were doing this when we were together ,patient
I couldn't say it right ,patient
and it starts with a ,patient
anyway that's  it turns  it's got wheels and all of this ,patient
and  and at the  when it turns twelve the whole thing's gonna like turn into something else ,patient
and everybody's gone ,patient
and there  uh the girl  the girl was xxx the  the  the  actually the attractive young woman she's running away because it's gonna turn twelve ,patient
and she still has one of the glass  um one of the um glass um shoe ,patient
so they're looking  the  uh the king is wondering what happened to the other glass shoe ,patient
and people are going around to all of the different places ,patient
and um went over to the  the one house that the  uh that the  uh the mother had the two twins that they never really liked very much ,patient
of_course she couldn't fit  she didn't have one like that ,patient
so  then the little blonde girl  the little blonde uh woman had the other um ,patient
oh I know what they did ,patient
they found one ,patient
they found one that uh ,patient
and they had like  uh their ,patient
and the only one that could do it was the one that was like doing all  she was a worker ,patient
and she wasn't treated as nice as the mother and they  uh the twin sisters ,patient
and she wound up she could fit that ,patient
and they decided this is the one ,patient
and the thing ends um that uh they're gonna get married ,patient
I'm sorry head,patient
 on and on and on ,patient
peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
how would I do it ,patient
um I guess I would like  I'd prefer um the type of bread ,patient
a_lot_of people like white bread ,patient
and they also preferred small  smooth  smooth uh peanuts ,patient
and if they had a choice of the  um j the um ,patient
it's peanut and jelly ,patient
the jelly ,patient
uh what it  what could be made out_of ,patient
it could be  um  could it be made out_of apple ,patient
it could be uh grace ,patient
g I_mean  um gr purple ,patient
what do you call purple ,patient
purple grease ,patient
um anyway all these different types of um ,patient
they could ha be made out_of like um oranges ,patient
mɑrbəliu ,patient
and what was your question ,patient
how  how I would prefer to have it ,patient
oh  well  I'd have two  two  um two pieces of bread ,patient
and I would put  on one side I'd put a uh ,patient
and I prefer  if I was gonna be preferred I'd have uh peanut  peanuts  peanuts ,patient
I'd have like chunks in it ,patient
and I would  I use apple  uh apple uh jel dʒʌvəlu ,patient
I can't say it right ,patient
and one would be on one side and one on the another ,patient
I put it together ,patient
I take uh uh a knife ,patient
and I would cut it in half ,patient
and I would have that on a plate ,patient
