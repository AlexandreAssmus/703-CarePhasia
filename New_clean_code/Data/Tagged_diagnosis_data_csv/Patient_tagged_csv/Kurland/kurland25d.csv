mhm ,patient
that's an interesting question  isn't it ,patient
well um it seemed  it  it probably  presumably you could actually do this on  on a  on a uh uh less high tech ,patient
but it is nice to have ,patient
and uh it  it  it has several different functions ,patient
one is the uh um ,patient
what do you call that thing ,patient
um know yourself ,patient
uh that  the  uh the thing we always talk to together ,patient
um the ,patient
 go to meeting  yeah ,patient
that's one  one thing ,patient
then there's uh t s the stɑprɑwɑtʃu ,patient
and there's the  uh the  uh the  the  the  the basic media of the  of the thing ,patient
so  it has a_lot_of different uh uses I think ,patient
so  it  I guess it's  it's probably exactly what you need for your ,patient
well  I_mean  sure ,patient
because you_know something got  bet got better here through the  through the whole operation uh  I think ,patient
you_know  it certainly seems that's  that seems to be the case because I was really flailing there at the beginning ,patient
and  um and then I flailed again when  when I was trying not to look at the  at the uh uh letters ,patient
you_know  just  I would  I would just push it ges,patient
so  uh that  and that seems to have been the second way to help  help myself here ,patient
is  uh because then I  I could get to the point where I could sort_of write these things a little bit ,patient
um and  and actually everyday this is getting a little better now ,patient
I'm still using the  uh u using the  uh the whatchamacallit ,patient
the  the uh ,patient
y yes ,patient
uh yeah  the  wi the Ipad's great actually ,patient
it works perfectly well ,patient
and I do really like ipa Ipads as a  as a genre ,patient
god_damn  this is like literature or something ,patient
ready ,patient
alright ,patient
girl has lost her kitten which is now  uh now um going to the  uh is now sitting in the  the tree ,patient
uh dad would like to get the kitty back but can't get it  get it ,patient
um and apparently also the ladder was no use uh in the  in dad trying to get these things from the  uh the child ,patient
uh as if to make matters worth ,patient
uh a bird's twittering ,patient
before things really got out_of hand the fireman came and got the and  were about to get  uh get  uh get  get the  uh get the uh kitty back from the  the fire persons ,patient
not great but ,patient
it's not Goethe  you_know ,patient
oh  that again ,patient
probably ,patient
mhm ,patient
okay ,patient
oh  really ,patient
mhm ,patient
hm,patient
let's try to see ,patient
a young orphan was uh brought to uh the house to live with two  uh there  where  where two uh odious women were  laughs where two odious women were uh holding forth ,patient
when they began  uh at  at the very beginning the  uh uh Cinderella as uh her  her name would  s would be known later uh was now just a  uh a kind of a servant waiting  waiting on these two women and their foul mother ,patient
Cinderella noticed the  the beautiful  uh the beautiful uh ,patient
try again ,patient
Cinderella saw that the prince's uh castle gleaming in the distance ,patient
at last uh a party was  was  uh at last the party was uh ,patient
the king had asked uh p a p party to be uh uh ,patient
no  I can't  can't do this laughs ,patient
the king  set a party ,patient
it sent ,patient
I'll try this again ,patient
the king had  had  a  s had a party uh where the  uh all of the  the uh uh beautiful women could be  could be uh known to the  uh to the prince who would be  who  who would uh find himself uh uh a  uh um a  uh find himself a uh per person laughs ,patient
um  where the  the young prince could meet all of the other women that were around in the valley ,patient
Cinderella would gladly have taken  had  had uh gone to that party except she was not allowed ,patient
the two uh uh hideous women were all deck  decked up looking their very best ,patient
uh but Cinderella was not allowed to go ,patient
at that point a fairy godmomother ,patient
here uh the  uh the two uh women who lived in in  the house were  were not very attractive ,patient
uh and the prince was not much interested in them ,patient
but in turn  in time he discovered that Cinderella was uh really quite charming and delightful ,patient
and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit  a bit longer ,patient
but uh then came uh the stroke of midnight ,patient
and she  uh she got back her  her  her  uh she got back to her  uh her  um to her  to her room and had a wonderful time ,patient
the prince there would  would s still had not found the  uh the  the  the  uh the perfect woman that he adored ,patient
so  uh several people started looking around to see them uh and to decide which one was really  Cinder was like  cin which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted ,patient
one after another several of these terrible creatures uh proved that she could not  f she could not f uh fill  fit the  the  uh the  uh she couldn't fit the  uh the portions  the  the  uh could not fit the um ,patient
lemme try it  try it again ,patient
all of the  the other women in the castle were not  uh were  were too uh big and could not be  uh could not be  could not  c could not get the  the  uh the  the  the size of the  uh of the  of the shoe that they were trying to find ,patient
but the shoe uh fit Cinderella perfectly ,patient
at that point the  uh the prince then was brought to the castle ,patient
and they were married immediately and uh lived happily ever after ,patient
why is that so hard ,patient
sort_of ,patient
