um well  clears,patient
um I stopped at this  um in Petersan ,patient
and they were having  um they were having artwork there you_know ,patient
and uh I talked  and when I went in  t when I went in there a_lot of the  pee one of the women I actually knew her ,patient
and act she  she actually ran for a representative ,patient
xxx  she lost last year ,patient
and she also writes uh books ,patient
and uh I've seen her talking about this ,patient
she wrote a book about this  uh this man that was in World_war_two ,patient
and he  he was caught in the baton  s,patient
when somebody  when they die ,patient
um ut a march ,patient
did I  can I say that right ,patient
 you understood me right head,patient
and that man when I was young when I was eighteen he  he would  uh he  he  he  k he talked to me ,patient
and he said uh who he  who his name was and everything like that ,patient
and he told me that he was always in love with my art ,patient
in World_war  this is in World_war_two ,patient
and uh but  and he was  he was  his name was FirstnameP ,patient
and he wasn't  he was about as tall as I was ,patient
and my aunt s ,patient
and he asked her to marry him ,patient
and she said that no she wouldn't do it because she liked taller men ,patient
laughs but he would tell me about this ,patient
but this woman that I was talking Sunday that she tried to be a  she tried to  to run for as uh a representative ,patient
and she  um and she lost ,patient
she useta  she useta be a writer for uh um a representative in  um in Massachusetts ,patient
when she was young she useta did ,patient
this and anyway head,patient
so  I know  I knew her ,patient
so  I talk to a_lot of these people ,patient
and uh I was doing very well except I got to a word ,patient
and I told them ,patient
 you_know I have a  s I have  I have the  I had a speech ,patient
 and it's difficult for me to talk ,patient
and she said nobody had any idea there was wrong with me talking until that  until that time ,patient
and uh so they were getting  re you_know it was  it was uh eight  it was six o'clock ,patient
they were all ready to  uh everybody was all  all done ,patient
and I bought  I bought the book ,patient
and I was outside talking to this other man ,patient
and he was probably uh our age ,patient
I was  I_mean  I was his age head,patient
and he was  he was  muh he was slender ,patient
and he said that he had migraine headaches every two or three days ,patient
 and  uh and he had  uh he was worried that he'd have a stroke himself ,patient
and he said that uh he had extremely bad um maɪgrɛnu ,patient
and he  you_know and but he said ,patient
 uh you_know we don't know how you_know ,patient
I_mean  we shook hands and everything ,patient
and he talked quite about what his problems that he has ,patient
 because I talked about the stroke that I had ,patient
and he told me how he has  he  sus he suffered from that ,patient
and uh I had read recently that there were some new uh drugs that might help out people that have that ,patient
and he said that uh he  he saw a doctor ,patient
and the doctor told him that  uh it  they gave him some of his drugs ,patient
and it didn't do him any good what's  what  not xxx head,patient
so that was  so  that was that ,patient
uh so I  so  I guess my little bit of story is  is I said this quite a bit before anybody knew there was anything wrong with me you_know ,patient
I guess the  and I  my feeling is  is that I don't think I'm doing much better ,patient
um people will say boy Firstname sounds  he's a_lot better ,patient
and uh but uh I'm afraid that I'm not getting much better head,patient
that's  that's one of my  head,patient
I think I'm probably a little bit better than I was ,patient
um but I still don't think I'm really  really well ,patient
you_know  and I'm always surprised when people tell me ,patient
 gee we had no idea there was anything wrong with you talking ,patient
you_know  because to me it sounds horrible to me ,patient
this is how I feel about it ges head,patient
is that  uh uh because I  I think that I was very good at  at speaking ,patient
uh and I knew  I knew so many different things ,patient
and I was witty and things like that ,patient
and uh so I'm not  duh I'm not depressed or anything like that ,patient
and I'm hoping I'm going to do better ,patient
it's just that I don't think I'm doing that head,patient
you_know  okay  head,patient
um actually I don't think I've had any problems ,patient
uh I think that I remember everything wonderfully ,patient
and as a matter of fact I wanted to tell you about  uh about ,patient
I was with FirstnameG ,patient
and I was driving ,patient
I was driving a van ,patient
and we were going at uh the Home_Depot ,patient
you_know  and for year  for a long time I could not say Home_Depot ,patient
so  I  I admit that I'm  a_lot of the words I'm doing a_lot better than I  than I was head,patient
like it took me m maybe a month before I could say uh Baldwin_Hill_Road which is where I  you_know where I live head,patient
and I  actually I was probably  uh since I was like one year old I lived in the same  in the same house ,patient
so  I actually knew  uh knew how to say it ,patient
so  uh when I was with  uh it was like uh our  it was our  it was uh eight sixteen two thousand thirteen August ,patient
and I was driving ,patient
it was about nine o'clock at night ,patient
and we had just left Home_Depot to buy ges uh ,patient
I was actually  she had an apartment in her  in her um ,patient
the  this lady who had lived there for twenty four years had died recently ,patient
and we were fixing up her apartment ,patient
and one of the things was that her  um the  the bath uh had an old steel tub ,patient
and we just bought a ,patient
and I'm good at finding deals ,patient
and I found a nice  uh a nice new tug ,patient
and uh we were just bought it in my van ,patient
a and  and so then we were gonna have a supper  we were gonna go suppering now ,patient
so  I was on route  te r uh I was on uh Boston_Road ,patient
and uh I was driving ,patient
and uh this is about nine o'clock at night ,patient
and she said ,patient
 you sh should turn  you should turn right ,patient
she said ,patient
 turn right ,patient
and apparently what happened is that I had paralyzed ges,patient
I was  dri head,patient
and uh on the  she said that one of my eyes  you_know I  my  ee I couldn't see on this side ges,patient
it's like this whole whole side ges,patient
and uh I was driving ,patient
I managed to get the van on the side of the road ,patient
and it was right where we were going to uh the restaurant ,patient
and  uh and then I would just hold onto the steel ,patient
and  uh and I was so  I was really lucky uh that FirstnameG was with me you_know ,patient
 and actually I've  I've always felt that FirstnameG saved my  saved my life basically ,patient
um and  and the other thing that was  that worked out well is that there were  there were  there were doctors ,patient
and uh uh there were  there was two nurses and a doctor that just happened to be driving their cars ,patient
and they saw it  what happened ,patient
and everybody got out ,patient
and they all got me  op we opened up the door ,patient
and they got me down on the ground ,patient
and  um and they called up  ges,patient
what do you got that say it right ,patient
it starts with uh the truck ,patient
it's  it's  um it's not the right term for  for the truck but they took her to  um and they took it to Baystate ,patient
and while it  when I was there ,patient
and during this time I started losing the color ,patient
I could  s I could still see my vision but it was like black and white ,patient
 that you_know the  c the  the color head,patient
we got to  we got to Baystate and their emergency ,patient
is it emergency ,patient
well  anyway um e kay it  it all came back to me ,patient
the color all came back ,patient
I_mean  I was on a ɡɝdiu ,patient
what do you call it ,patient
they carry people ,patient
ɡɝdizu ,patient
ɡɝdizu ,patient
I was on that head,patient
and uh they were taking me in on  uh upstairs ,patient
uh I think I probably took  uh s I don't know if I xrays or something like that ,patient
or maybe it was like  uh could've been an m_r_i or something perhaps ,patient
and then  uh then I finally made  head,patient
it was almost like one o'clock in the morning ges ,patient
I was in  uh you_know there was like uh a nurse  a young nurse ,patient
and FirstnameG was here ,patient
and uh I wanted to  I knew everything was happening ges ,patient
you_know  I was saying to myself ,patient
 boy something's really happening me that's really not doing well you_know ,patient
I said ,patient
 uh you_know they're sending me to a hospital so obviously something's wrong with me ,patient
and uh so I wanted to  s so then I wanted to  I kept on trying to talk to FirstnameG about what was happening ,patient
and I couldn't say anything ,patient
and I said ,patient
 if I can't say anything to FirstnameG then she's gonna think I can't tell her what's wrong with me ,patient
so  they think that there's probably something a_lot worse than me ,patient
because I think I understood everything that was happening during  during this whole thing ges that was happening ,patient
and uh so that's  that's pretty good head,patient
okay  well  I was  I was at  um I was at um Baystate ,patient
and I was there for like um I think it was  eight days ,patient
and then it was very  not very far away ,patient
we went to Mercy ,patient
and I was there for ten days ,patient
um and then I  I was talking  I was there  um they tried to seem ,patient
they  I said to her head,patient
 some uh physical therapy work ,patient
and I could do everything ,patient
I had no trouble ,patient
you_know  they  they started off you_know trying to move my  you_know  you_know uh how I can move and stuff like that ,patient
and  and they  actually after like two days they said ,patient
 he doesn't need any physical problems ,patient
so  I was actually talking  I talked to this  this  this woman that was uh the speech therapist ,patient
and um I talked with her for  mo for like nine  nine days I think ,patient
and then the last day  last day I was there  uh I think the ninth day I think I  they  they had this group of people ,patient
they had  s they had uh ,patient
that you would  you would  this one  this one woman had  uh I think you probably  you probably knew her uh because she was from Umass ,patient
and she was going at that time ,patient
she's still going at_least m almost a year ,patient
she was going to uh be th you_know helping uh at Umass ,patient
uh so  we had this group of people that suffered from  from  uh from speaking well ,patient
and I listened to  you_know I listened to what she was saying ,patient
uh z actually the whole group uh of  pee of people ,patient
and apparently they do that every ,patient
I don't know if they come every month or something ,patient
and they  they talk to people about that ,patient
so  uh and then  and then after ten days I was there ,patient
we dec uh decided that we went to  uh in Amherst ,patient
and it was like um um rust ,patient
and you_know what happened is that the speech therapist would come ,patient
and she was there for like fifteen minutes ,patient
and she'd do the same kind of testing that you've been doing ,patient
and uh is  is like the same thing head,patient
and you_know it was like I had seen it ,patient
and  and uh the next day another speech therapist ,patient
I think there was only a couple  t a couple of people ,patient
and she started the whole thing all over again ,patient
right ,patient
and she wasn't here that long ,patient
and then uh the next day this other person came again ,patient
and uh we were doing the same thing ,patient
but none of them ,patient
it was only very short period of time you_know maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving ,patient
and uh so I think uh FirstnameG and I we actually  we actually points went for a walk you_know because where she was isn't really that far away ,patient
so  in the center of town points we went to uh dinner ,patient
and uh we were talking ,patient
and she was saying ,patient
oh the other thing is the speech therapist had been there for like thirteen years in the same place ,patient
and she was  qu and she was  she's getting a new job ,patient
she was gonna lo lose  she was gonna leave ,patient
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks ,patient
and um now it's getting  uh you_know it's the middle  it's the beginning ,patient
so  I when would  it was  I just had  I had a birthday there that week head,patient
and um we were thinking that maybe we would stay ,patient
and I was gonna stay with uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house ,patient
I was gonna stay there ,patient
uh because I think what happened is that uh we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse ,patient
the nurse ,patient
and the thing is that  that uh this ,patient
and this is what um ,patient
they wanted to  ha to you_know if I wanted to go to the  um to have my  uh my bath and stuff like that ,patient
they wanted to take me ,patient
all of the people that worked there ,patient
they  you_know and when I was in  in  I was in um Mercy all of the  they let me do it all by myself ,patient
and some of the nurses would let me do it at four o'clock in the morning ,patient
I could  I could go all by myself ,patient
I could  ov I could  wa they had like a room ges ,patient
I could  I could take all my clothes off ,patient
I would  I'd take a nice bath ,patient
I'd put everything back ,patient
and then I would even  I  I would like  uh with my razor I would  I would  um you_know I would  I would touches,patient
what would you call that ,patient
not my beard but I would cut my beard and things like that head,patient
and I didn't have any problems um when I was at Mercy ,patient
no problems whatsoever head,patient
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the New_York_Times ,patient
that's basically the only thing I hadta try to read ,patient
and I would say if I read something like um um one section of the New_York_Times it would probably take me  um maybe it would take me an hour just to read one  one ,patient
and then I'd only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read you_know ,patient
of_course if it was  maybe if it was an uh newspaper that was easier to read I might do better ,patient
but uh it was still the New_York_Times and uh the edi editorials and things like that ,patient
I was having a hard time understanding it ,patient
but I had an ideara ,patient
so  um so  a so  FirstnameG and I were going  we were  s we were at  we were having supper ges ,patient
and she  s and  and she said ,patient
 well  what do you think ,patient
what she should do ,patient
I said ,patient
 I'd just as soon go home head,patient
 I should go home ,patient
so  then she tried to find people um in  uh in that area that would  they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist ,patient
and um this one woman came ,patient
and uh I really  I really  I thought she was quite good head,patient
but you_know what happened ,patient
I think they found one in Athol ,patient
and then I started to drive too ,patient
and if I could drive then you see you  c you couldn't have a person that would come to my house ,patient
right ,patient
so  um so  what happened ,patient
I really liked this woman the speech therapist head,patient
but I hadta give her ,patient
and she had all of the  um she had all of this  she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could  uh I could probably learn with this ,patient
how do you say the right term ,patient
um we  um I started doing that ,patient
you_know  she would do things like writing a picture ,patient
there'd be pictures or something like that ,patient
and we'd be like ,patient
 uh the  uh  the clock ,patient
you_know  and the clock would be  um we'd be on like a twelve ,patient
and it'd be on six ,patient
and it'd be on three ,patient
it would be on  uh um you_know it would be on uh eight or something ,patient
and I would hafta write  write it down which one it was head,patient
so  um that was how I started doing with the  th with the speech therapist head,patient
but then I couldn't  you_know I  I couldn't drive ,patient
you_know  I'd  we  we can't let her keep on coming ,patient
and  and she knew I could drive ,patient
 so  um so  then I  I  we found that we could go to  um to Athol ,patient
and it's  and I'm gonna still  I'm gonna go  I'm going three times a week to see FirstnameE ,patient
and um ,patient
yeah  okay  so  that's basically it ,patient
okay ,patient
oh ,patient
 oh I think  well  actually meeting you at  uh at  s at uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's ,patient
and you  remember you started  you  you_know you were starting to do some of the work with me ,patient
and you had like pictures ,patient
and I hadta like uh try to say what the words were and stuff like that ,patient
yeah  I remember that ,patient
I was remembering that ,patient
and I was  and I remembered that I was having a hard time to say what the words were ,patient
and uh you_know and you  in the beginning it was pretty easy ,patient
and then of_course the words got more difficult ,patient
and uh so  I_mean  that was a_lot of the work that you did ,patient
and I think the reason why uh y you were involved  that you were involved with that is that uh we were worried that we couldn't even find a speech therapist ,patient
and I think that's how FirstnameY found you you_know ,patient
and then we finally  then we  then we did find someone to go down to Athol ,patient
so  and then you were also telling  telling me that uh because I had recently had that problem uh having uh trouble with  with the  uh what had happened in that part  that my  b then I needed  uh I needed everybody to  like uh to become ges ,patient
what do you  c um what did I hafta say what it ,patient
my  my brain was  was  still um um needed to be  uh get better ,patient
I hadta get better before I could  I could come over here to have  to have you help ,patient
so  we waited ,patient
we hadta wait ,patient
so  do I wanna tell ,patient
you said you wanted uh another story ,patient
this is just uh a story about how I met you ,patient
how I met you ,patient
I thought that was pretty  I thought that was pretty  I thought that was very important that this was gonna help me ,patient
 you_know yeah  yeah ,patient
okay ,patient
yup ,patient
um well  this is a  this is a boy ,patient
and he's  um he's kicking a s um ,patient
and I know what kind of like uh ,patient
it's uh a ball ,patient
it's a sɑkəlu ,patient
and she ,patient
and of_course what happened here is he  he  uh he kicked the  uh the ball ,patient
and he hit the  uh uh um a window ,patient
maybe it's his neighbor ,patient
and  um or maybe it was his father ,patient
I can call it his father ,patient
his father is uh in the living room ,patient
and he's sitting there ,patient
and he actually kicked the ball ,patient
and it went  uh it went uh on the other side ,patient
and it fruu ,patient
and it actually hit  um I guess it hit the lamp  the lamp too next to his  uh perhaps to his father  or a  ner a neighbor ,patient
or maybe it was like um uh a young man ,patient
I don't know who it is that's here ,patient
and you_know the problem over here is  is that um he  he looks like he's standing up ,patient
and this  la this fourth one is hard to tell exactly what this is ,patient
whether uh ,patient
this looks like this could be  uh this could be um ,patient
whether this is like a  um a ball or whether this is his brain that got knocked out_of it ,patient
I don't know ,patient
this looks like it's opened here ,patient
I don't know what this is ,patient
this doesn't  this isn't very uh ,patient
it's hard to tell very much of this other_than there's somebody standing up ,patient
I don't know what s that person is holding  is holding onto ,patient
if it's sposta be um that it could be this ,patient
I don't know what it is ,patient
okay ,patient
that's all I can say ,patient
mhm ,patient
okay ,patient
I guess he wanted the uh ,patient
this that's what the ,patient
you_know  I  I n ,patient
the umbrella ,patient
okay  the umbrella head,patient
finally I got to say umbrella ,patient
the little boy wanted the umbrella ,patient
and his mother had it ,patient
the mother doesn't look very happy ,patient
she doesn't  actually it's hard to tell anything about how she looks ges,patient
she changes over here ,patient
uh so or he  either that or he tried to grab it from her ,patient
I'm not sure ,patient
because it looked like something happened ges ,patient
um the second uh he looks like well  he's going to leave ,patient
and uh she's gonna  she still has the umbrella ,patient
so  here's the  s the little boy ,patient
he's actually getting wet ,patient
he's walking ,patient
and um he's getting wet ,patient
and now he's really getting wet because it's probably really coming out a_lot ,patient
you can see right here ,patient
it's like  um this in pʌltu ,patient
head,patient
well  he's a pool  s,patient
pool  s,patient
he's on  this  this pools on his um shoes and stuff like that ,patient
so  he's back in his house ,patient
and he's all covered with water ,patient
and his mother she doesn't look like sh this was a great decision on her part ,patient
she doesn't look happy ,patient
it's hard to tell really but it's kind_of like uh the cartoon is ,patient
it's hard to tell what she really looks ,patient
uh so  I guess that she decided she'll let him use the umbrella ,patient
and it's still really raining ,patient
but he  at_least he's dry with the umbrella ,patient
yeah ,patient
laughs well this is pretty funny ,patient
well  this is a little girl who has a cat ,patient
and the cat is up the tree ,patient
and um I don't know if she was driving ,patient
she had her  bici she was on a tricycle ,patient
so  and here's a little  the dog is up to  is at the tree too ,patient
and he's barking ,patient
maybe that's what caused  the  uh the cat was afraid or something and went up there ,patient
either that or they're afraid of the sun ,patient
I've always said that as a joke ,patient
so  so  here's the ladder ,patient
now what it looks like the  the um maybe the ladder was up there ,patient
and it fell over ,patient
and so now the  uh this is funny because now the  this man maybe it's  maybe it's her  um her father ,patient
because he's  he's up there too ,patient
he's  he's lost ,patient
he can't get down ,patient
and uh so what happened over here ,patient
uh a fireman's over here ,patient
and he's gonna  perhaps he's gonna save both the  um his ,patient
and then there's a  uh a bird up here uh who probably enjoys this whole thing ,patient
it's not gonna run ,patient
now I'm xxx ,patient
 I was gonna say this looks like  uh this  the  uh this is almost like a  g looks like a dog one ,patient
looks like it's some  looks like somebody draw a picture of a dog on here ,patient
k yeah not years and years ago ,patient
nah I don't remember it ,patient
sure ,patient
well  the first page is  it's on the lefthand side ,patient
it looks like um maybe it's uh could be  it could be their mother and uh their two daughters ,patient
and they had like a little  they had a little cat ,patient
and the little cat ,patient
they all look kind_of like nervous ges to me ,patient
they  they didn't look like they were  the little girl was  the two little girls they look like they were dangerous people ,patient
and the cat looked like it was somebody that ,patient
the  the cat was like a funny looking cat too ,patient
and on this side there was a like  a little girl ,patient
and uh she was very nice looking ,patient
and uh I'm not sure who this guy's sposta be ,patient
he's  he's uh a man ges ,patient
and he's got like um a beard ,patient
not a beard but what would you call that ,patient
mustache touches,patient
and he seems like a nice person ,patient
and he was inviting them to come into their house ,patient
um I don't know exactly what I could say about this whole thing ,patient
if I was a little girl I bet you I could remember all the details on this a_lot better than I could right laughs ,patient
so  um so  then I think what you  you get to see this  um this castle ges from the distance ,patient
and I think there's this young  young woman ,patient
and she looks like she works there ,patient
she probably works at the  at the  somebody's house ,patient
and she probably hadta like  uh her job was to like um clean ,patient
and she was  she was trying to help out ,patient
she probably wasn't rich ,patient
um but I think they were looking um ,patient
the  ma the major part of the story I think I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna continue with this  is that um they were looking for a  um for a young  for a young  a young man h handsome man who was gonna get married ,patient
uh and they were  and he was  he was probably in the  in the uh ,patient
what do you call that place again ,patient
I said it right but now I've forgotten what to call it ,patient
uh the castle ,patient
uh they were gonna have uh like a dance there with music ,patient
and  uh and they had this um glass um shoe that they found the right one that would fit ,patient
that would be his  that would be his  uh his wife ,patient
uh so  a_lot_of people came to the  to the uh castle ,patient
and they had the  da they were dancing ,patient
and  um and I think this  this young woman who was very good looking she was like  um she hadta work there ,patient
uh maybe it was her  maybe it was um the mother or something ges ,patient
but she had  her two daughters  older daughters weren't very attractive head,patient
um and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would  uh somebody  this handsome man was gonna marry her ,patient
so  um so she was  so  mainly I think they went ,patient
head,patient
I'm not calling it a dance ,patient
I know  I'm sorry head,patient
and I'm trying to think who the  uh who the  who this  this  gram this sweet lady who's like ,patient
she's a magical person ges,patient
and she's gonna like uh ,patient
so  this  this poor  g g this pyu poor girl she needed uh to have a beautiful dress ,patient
but um I don't think she had anything ,patient
but this um ,patient
what did they call it ,patient
this  this  that woman that could make things happen ,patient
I don't know what you call her ,patient
but um she wound up going to the  um going to the dance in this beautiful uh dress ,patient
and  um and what had happened is that she was gonna  at  at the head of  of twelve she hadta run back home again because she would  all of that  that magical uh dress and everything was gonna be  uh was all gonna be gone ,patient
and she's gonna have her  her uh clothes that she just worked down in the  uh in the cellar or in the floor or wherever she worked ,patient
to go back to work ,patient
so  she was trying to run away from uh this beautiful man ges that wanted to marry her ,patient
and uh she lost this  the glass  the glass um ch shoe ,patient
so  she managed to make it ,patient
you_know  she ran away ,patient
she lost  she lost that  that  that  um the magical shoe that she was wearing ,patient
and uh so they  what they did is they  they hadta find all the  points all the different women that perhaps um would wanna marry him ,patient
if they had  they hadta fit the uh right glass shoe ,patient
and um I think they kind_of  they had it  uh they had that  they had the  um that  they had the shoe ,patient
and ev they hadta decide ,patient
everyone was gonna come and try to put it on ,patient
and the only one that could put it on was the young woman that didn't have any money  was poor ,patient
and she put it on ,patient
and then they decided that she was the one that was gonna  that he's gonna  gonna marry her ,patient
I don't know ,patient
that's kind_of like ,patient
um how would I would do it ,patient
uh well  the first thing I would have is uh a knife ,patient
and I would have a  pla um a plate ,patient
and I would have some bread ,patient
and uh depends on what it is ,patient
if  uh if the bread was never  fluh if it was  uh it was whole you'd hafta take a knife ,patient
and you'd hafta make um two sights ,patient
I don't know what you'd call it ,patient
when you  when you have bread and you cut it into two pieces what do you call that ,patient
