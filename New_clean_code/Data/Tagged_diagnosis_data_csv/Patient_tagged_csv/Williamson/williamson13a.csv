okay ,patient
 well  my wife says sometimes when I get a_little upset I talk too loud ,patient
but uh ,patient
 then she says rest the time I mumble ,patient
so  you_know uh laughs ,patient
 yes  it was in uh  March of uh  two thousand and  seven I guess  three years ago ,patient
 or eight I ,patient
head,patient
uh  I was uh at the breakfast table ,patient
 and uh ges,patient
and I said ,patient
 ges,patient
 and I called my wife ,patient
and she said ,patient
 yeah I'm gonna call nineoneone ,patient
so  they immediately took me to the Restin_General Hospital enrolled me and  and ,patient
head,patient
ges,patient
I'm thinking about the uh  uh t_i_a ,patient
 I went in to have hip joint replacement surgery ,patient
 and I was a healthy ,patient
I just had points,patient
so  I went to have that replaced ,patient
and uh the following  the surgery went fine ,patient
following morning they got me up for the first time to  to walk ,patient
and when I got up I collapsed ges  suddenly ,patient
 and they did the usual m_r_is and the cat ,patient
and uh  they would ask me the battery of questions ,patient
and I had difficulties knowing when I was born what year I was born uh  etcetera ,patient
uh,patient
I had head,patient
 never did ,patient
uh lips_smack by the time I,patient
 I could listen to the news  and understand what I was hearing ,patient
ges but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do  head,patient
so  I tried to cope with it  by asking my wife grabs,patient
and I started trying to work one line at a time in  in one ges column ,patient
 that was difficult ,patient
but when I f felt I ges could repeat that and say it then I would try to get  head,patient
 maybe one  sent  one sentence ,patient
and it was difficult ,patient
but  ges,patient
and after several days I got to where I could maybe  read and comprehend a short paragraph ,patient
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down  mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was ,patient
and I said ,patient
 oh  good ,patient
 I can get to my computer now ,patient
 so  I got downstairs sat down at my computer  and sighs  I hadta call my wife ,patient
 how do I turn it on ,patient
she showed me ,patient
and it came up ,patient
and I said ,patient
 now what do I do ,patient
 and I said ,patient
 oh  sighs ,patient
 and I got something in front of me ,patient
I said ,patient
 I wanna send an email to my  some of my friends ,patient
head,patient
and said ,patient
 ges,patient
but it took me awhile to get that ,patient
and I had ges jumbled head,patient
and I even saved it  because it ges was very jumbled ,patient
ges,patient
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after ges it was very jumbled ,patient
head,patient
and uh so that's when I heard about the Stroke_Comeback_Center from uh the traveling nurse that came by to attend me ,patient
head,patient
and she said ,patient
 you'd be a very good candidate for your  our class ,patient
and I said ,patient
 ges well sign me up ,patient
and so uh uh I  I came here and was uh starting on a once a week schedule ,patient
 and I felt  it was a very good experience because I started making  progress ,patient
and what I  fel I've always said about with FirstnameM and p the center as a general is they seem to have a very good k way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge  but not over  not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it ,patient
so  if it was points,patient
head,patient
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and ges,patient
ges and this sorta ,patient
so  it was a ges,patient
and then she  s  she said  um FirstnameM said ,patient
 you might be a very candidate to enroll in our  one of our online penpal classes that we have with aphasia students  points at Oklahoma_City_University or  one of the Oklahoma universities  ,patient
so  I  b I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students ,patient
and after ges,patient
I decided I would start to write a   maybe a little journal  of my experiences from the day  as I recalled it from the day  I had my first uh stroke and  and ges to the recovery period ,patient
and I ended up sighs doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester ,patient
and I ended up labelling it as Firstname's aphasia journal ,patient
and uh I would s ges write a   a little section each week ,patient
ges and then she would kind_of react  respond back to me ,patient
but I would  I would ges build on it and finally ended that up ,patient
and she turned it in as her   as her theme  p her project for the   for the  seme for the semester ,patient
and hadta give a presentation on   on this interaction ,patient
so  ges all that  all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this ,patient
head,patient
but a I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again ,patient
and that's when xxx sent me in and dɑɪəgmostu ,patient
but they went ahead and sent me to John_Hopkins points uh Stroke_Rehabilitation_Center ,patient
and I became a patient there subject and uh worked with them ,patient
and uh  they diagnosed that I had had ges a previously undisclosed  uh ges flap on my heart ,patient
 that uh  is congenital ,patient
but that is ges probably why I caught the clot ,patient
and xxx ,patient
head,patient
but that's  uh  uh yeah I participated in that ,patient
and uh sighs  part of my therapy building along was  after going through wr writing my  ges weekly Firstname's journal I met with a couple of retired army officers who contacted me that said they were  the y US Department_of_Agriculture was wanting to write a  uh  a history of nutrition research that had been performed by the military after the  Department_of_Agriculture became involved ,patient
and they said ,patient
 Firstname I understand you understand what happened ,patient
I said ,patient
 oh  yeah ,patient
 I was  involved in that when they closed the program down and had it rebuilt ,patient
 and I  have kept all of the old files ,patient
 and he said ,patient
 well  you oughta write that up ,patient
 and so I started another project to  uh uh still working on it writing a history of nutrition research performed by the military from the seventeen thirties to the present day ,patient
you_know and I  I  I  and I'm  s  you_know I'm still working at that ,patient
and uh  I continue to uh come here to  the Center once or twice a  a week and  uh because I have a buddy ,patient
name is FirstnameK ,patient
and uh she was  uh p ges had had a stroke not too long before I did ,patient
and we were here in the first class together ,patient
and she's   she's about forty  I think ,patient
but we kind_of  we're buddies ,patient
 and uh I feel like  maybe I can contribute to her recovery ,patient
 at the same time ges interacting and working with other folks ,patient
so  it uh ,patient
 yes  yep head,patient
I would think it's ,patient
okay ,patient
head,patient
surely ,patient
I will use one that I actually used in my uh  penpal stories ,patient
one of the things that came was I   I was a farm boy growing up in Missouri ,patient
and uh  I had a grandmother which I thought very much of ,patient
and uh she had  was a single lady by this time ,patient
her f husband had passed away ,patient
my grandfather passed away ,patient
but I was out uh getting starting in college or no  head,patient
and dad uh  decided that I should uh  maybe buy a or  I'd decided I wanted to buy a   a uh p Hereford heifer to start a  b a,patient
I had my Four_h  uh FFA activities ,patient
I told my grandma about it ,patient
and she said ,patient
 well  I'd like to  I need one ,patient
 I'd like to have a heifer too to come on our little pasture ,patient
to keep the weeds down out on her place ,patient
so  I went together and dad and I ,patient
and we purchased  two heifers  Susie and Stella ,patient
well  I took  Susie ,patient
and we stayed on  at my dad's place ,patient
and Stella was at my  gr my  gr my grandma's place ,patient
the  uh  uh  but on one occasion   we brought them back home in the winter time ,patient
we bring them all back to the  points to the  to the barn to where the  you_know to get them off the pastures were already gone up and to uh give them hay ,patient
inhales well sighs  I was going out one day down to bring  try to get the cattle to come up including Susie and Stella to get them up to the barn ,patient
and they were running around head,patient
and I got aggravated xxx I decided I'd throw a rock at one of them to get them to go back ,patient
well  I ended up ges,patient
and I picked up this ges boulder and gave it a heave ges,patient
unfortunately it ran headlong points,patient
knocked the thing flat on its ges,patient
so  I was scared as the dickens ,patient
I ran up to dad ,patient
 help me come ,patient
dad came down the barn immediately and got his old dull pocket knife out ges,patient
thought maybe he'd be able to  uh figured it was probably dying but at_least wanted to preserve the meat to let it bleed it out ,patient
well  the ges,patient
 imit,patient
laughs Stella b blared laughs and belted ,patient
and so it wasn't dead it was just knocked out ,patient
so  uh that taught me a lesson not to be throwing rocks and st ,patient
Stella became fine xxx head,patient
head,patient
 laughs ,patient
but that   I used that as part of a short story about a little uh  writing cla ,patient
 head,patient
well  this young boy is playing soccer ,patient
and he's just kicked the ball up in the air and uhoh ,patient
it just hit the window in the house and I guess  broke in the window ,patient
it not only went th,patient
and then dad is  uh picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window and figured out  trying to find out where did that come from ,patient
sure ,patient
 well  the  sighs ,patient
let's see ,patient
the young boy is uh with a mother ,patient
mother's got an umbrella ,patient
he's  seemingly reaching for the umbrella ,patient
the next panel  looks like uh mother's trying to encourage the boy to take the umbrella and go outside ,patient
but the boy apparently decided to go outside without the umbrella ,patient
and now it's raining ,patient
and now it's starting to pour down rain ,patient
and he's running back to the house ,patient
and now his   his head's all wet ,patient
and his mother looks sort_of upset ,patient
and  he goes back outside but now he's using the  he's wearing the umbrella ,patient
 well  I think we had a problem where  oc  occurred where a cat decided to crawl up into the tree and go out on f small limb on the outside ,patient
it looks like the uh yeah   young girl got upset and had called  her dad probably to  maybe try to get the cat down ,patient
 uh she'd been points,patient
dad had apparently gotten a ladder and had uh started up the tree and got up there but  for some reason it looks like the ladder has fallen down ,patient
the dog is now upset and barking ,patient
dad's stuck in the tree ,patient
and the cat's still there ,patient
well  there seems to be a bird chirping for one unknown reason but enough that somebody decided to call the fire department ,patient
and the fire department with two men are carrying a ladder apparently there to try to rescue to get the ma man down and possibly get the cat out_of the tree ,patient
think that found all of the  characters that were in the ,patient
 scene ,patient
 head,patient
 Walt_Disney's movie ,patient
okay ,patient
look through it ,patient
okay ,patient
 s story is about Cinderella who was a younger sister of  with two older sisters I believe ,patient
and she seemed to be the prettier of the three ,patient
and her mother was um a little bit of a domineering lady ,patient
uh,patient
 and they were all excited becau,patient
well  the  li the older sisters were getting themselves well dressed and ,patient
well  at first it was sure whether younger sister Cinderella was gonna get to go to her nɑɾəu ,patient
but there were some animals around ,patient
and head,patient
but anyhow  they all finally got dressed mother and the three daughters ,patient
and they went to,patient
and sighs there was a handsome prince probably with the  t the son of the  shrugs whoever was a main character th or the head,patient
and there was a number,patient
and apparently Cinderella may have got to dance with  one of the young men ,patient
but somewhere in the process she lost a slipper ,patient
after the ball when they'd all gotten home  I think she must have noticed that she was missing her slipper ,patient
and much to her surprise Prince_Charming came riding up to the house in his carriage and was looking for who  does the slipper  belong to which one of the ladies ,patient
and probably they must have tried it on ,patient
and the two older sisters their   slipper was too small to fit on the feet  of them ,patient
so  he  then Prince_Charming tried it on Cinderella ,patient
and it  slips the uh  s shoe fit perfectly on the slipper  s,patient
and so Cinderella then got to go back with Prince_Charming and go t back to shrugs another ball or something ,patient
that seems to be what ,patient
there's animals ges in this  watching the process but I don't know how they were  s exactly were involved in the story ,patient
but that's what I remember I think  of that story ,patient
okay ,patient
 well  sighs if we were s making  thinking of the process of the last class I had with points FirstnameM in which we were trying to hafta ges work out steps to do things you needta stop and think about it ,patient
well  the first thing you hafta go ,patient
 and if we were having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would hafta go in the  into the uh refrigerator and pull out the peanut  butter and the bar ,patient
uh I would get out a plate ,patient
put my bread on the plate ,patient
and I would go to the  uh  uh get a knife out_of the uh drawer ,patient
and I would use a knife to spread first the peanut butter on one side of the bread ,patient
then I would uh  use the knife uh to uh spread the jelly on the bread ,patient
and I would close  uh  put the other t piece of bread on the  uh  join it with the others ,patient
now I've got myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
and I can take it to the table and eat it ,patient
