my speech is alright ,patient
it's just that I have trouble getting some of the words out ,patient
I know what I wanna say ,patient
I know everything about it ,patient
but um like right now I'm talking clearly ,patient
and that I always did ,patient
even the doctors always said ,patient
 you  you speak so clear ,patient
you_know  they know every word that I'm saying ,patient
but um the words ges,patient
now try  work  work  I hafta work for it ,patient
um what I was doing that day ,patient
before ,patient
I was outside working in the garden ,patient
and it was hot ,patient
it was in the beginning of June ,patient
and it was three years ago when it was in the nineties ,patient
but I love to work in the garden ,patient
and I was working in the garden ,patient
and all_of_a_sudden it was getting  you_know I was getting a little not dizzy but I just wasn't feeling right ,patient
and I thought ,patient
 I think I better stop because it's getting too hot ,patient
so  I cleaned up ,patient
I had a shower ,patient
and um I went shopping ,patient
I was looking for curtains ,patient
and uh it was getting later because I always like to get home by three o'clock to watch my program laughs ,patient
so  uh on my way home I was passing another store whi which had curtains ,patient
so  I thought ,patient
 well  let me check it out in there ,patient
so  I went in there ,patient
and as I'm walking around all of sudden I'm like  um the ges,patient
nothing hurt ,patient
nothing hurt ,patient
but it was just getting weird ,patient
and I thought ,patient
 what is happening ,patient
so  I thought ,patient
 must be from the heat ,patient
so  uh I thought I better go home ,patient
I'm driving and I'm by myself ,patient
so  I went home got clea uh cooled down and I had a uh something to n eat ,patient
and then I sat and my story came on ,patient
and uh I don't remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything ,patient
but all_of_a_sudden my son who lives with me he's calling me ,patient
and he comes home about five o'clock ,patient
and uh clears,patient
and he says ,patient
 what are you doing ,patient
he says ,patient
 you should be cooking ,patient
he says it's ,patient
I says ,patient
 oh  you're home early ,patient
and he says ,patient
 no ,patient
he says ,patient
 it's five o'clock ,patient
so  between that time when the story was about to start and five o'clock I was out ,patient
but I could talk ,patient
I could walk ,patient
I could  nothing  nothing bothered me ,patient
but I got in the kitchen and I stood there ,patient
and I said to him ,patient
 whadya ,patient
 what am I cooking ,patient
 supper ,patient
 okay ,patient
so  I took a  mo a few more steps and I says ,patient
 what do I have for supper ,patient
 what am I making for supper ,patient
he says ,patient
 what you were ,patient
we were making lambchops on the grill ,patient
and I had them marinated ,patient
and uh I says ,patient
 well  what was I making ,patient
so  he  he told me ,patient
and I says ,patient
 where are ,patient
I didn't even know where they were ,patient
he says ,patient
 in the refrigerator ,patient
and I didn't even know what a refrigerator was ,patient
and then I started to get not scared but I thought ,patient
 something's wrong with me ,patient
 because I'm talking ,patient
 I'm talking very clear and everything ,patient
but I didn't know anything that was going on ,patient
uh in my mind I did but I couldn't get them out ,patient
so  um he looked at me and uh he says ,patient
 what's wrong with you ,patient
I says ,patient
 I don't know ,patient
 something's wrong with me ,patient
so  I have a daughter who lives in uh Vernon ,patient
and uh I said to him I says ,patient
 call ,patient
and he looked ,patient
I said ,patient
 call s you know you know who ,patient
so  uh I couldn't get her name out ,patient
so  he called her ,patient
he realized what I was trying to get ,patient
so  I got her on ,patient
and I told her ,patient
I says ,patient
 there is something wrong with me ,patient
 whadya ,patient
 he's  I don't know ,patient
 I know who you are but I don't  I can't get your name out ,patient
so  she says ,patient
 there's nothing wrong with you  mom ,patient
 it's hot and we told you ,patient
 don't work in the garden ,patient
I says ,patient
 there is something else wrong with me ,patient
so  then all_of_a_sudden her name came ,patient
because it's going through my mind ,patient
and I says ,patient
 Donna there is something wrong ,patient
and I started to cry ,patient
so  she says ,patient
 mom stay on the phone ,patient
then she got her other phone and she called the doctor ,patient
and the doctor said ,patient
 get her up to the hospital ,patient
so  they took me up to the hospital ,patient
she called her husband who worked down this end ,patient
and um he came and my son took me to the emergency room ,patient
and I was there for oh I guess  about oh twelve hours thirteen hours ,patient
and they didn't know what was wrong with me ,patient
because every question they asked me I said right off correct ,patient
um everything ,patient
and uh count backwards imit,patient
went right back ,patient
and uh we were you_know talking and I was walking around ,patient
and I hadta go to the bathroom ,patient
and I knew where the bathroom was  laughs in the hospital ,patient
and I went there ,patient
and uh we came out and we were talking and talking ,patient
and um the one doctor said ,patient
 we're not sure what is wrong with you ,patient
 everything seems to be fine ,patient
 everything is connecting with you ,patient
so  uh meantime I didn't realize that I didn't know the names of my  ho all my other family ,patient
so  they  um they just kept me there ,patient
and all_of_a_sudden one doctor says ,patient
 well  you've got a choice ,patient
 you can either ,patient
it was on a weekend which is a bad time ,patient
Februa  uh Fridays ,patient
and sh he says um ,patient
 you have a choice ,patient
 you can either can go home for the weekend and come back Monday ,patient
 or you can stay over the weekend ,patient
now when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything they're not gonna say ,patient
 oh  I'll stay at the hospital  laughs ,patient
especially on a weekend  laughs ,patient
so  we went home ,patient
so  my  my son inlaw took me home to her ,patient
and I was there for the weekend ,patient
and um they had gone away for uh the weekend ,patient
not the  the whole weekend just over  overnight that one night ,patient
because originally I was sposta babysit for them anyway ,patient
so  uh just by luck my daughter said to her husband ,patient
 bring your father up too ,patient
 I don't think mom should be by herself ,patient
so  because I had ges,patient
so  um the father came up ,patient
and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart ,patient
I cried snaps,patient
and I just wouldn't stop crying ,patient
and then all_of_a_sudden I'd sleep ,patient
I'd sleep for hours ,patient
and I didn't realize it ,patient
and then uh we went the weekend we went to the doctors and uh ,patient
 well  she seems to be fine ,patient
 she's talking she's doing this and she's doing that ,patient
and I said ,patient
 but there is something going on with my head ,patient
I says ,patient
 something's wrong there ,patient
so  I  arra I went home ,patient
I was head,patient
and about a week later uh they  s my doctors uh sent a neurologist to me ,patient
and when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me he says ,patient
 you had a stroke ,patient
he says ,patient
 it wasn't a big one but he says ,patient
 you had a stroke ,patient
so  that's how I knew I had a stroke laughs ,patient
it was really really weird ,patient
but uh I  I forgot so many things ,patient
like in the morning every morning after I got my breakfast ready I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper ,patient
and head,patient
I looked at it and I couldn't get the words ,patient
I  cou I knew what they were but I could not say any of those words ,patient
and I  t what I did get to read I didn't understand ,patient
so  I tried for a couple of days and like ,patient
 the  the heck with this ,patient
 I just won't read anymore ,patient
after a couple more days I'm sitting there and I thought ,patient
 you are gonna learn to read that paper ,patient
I started reading it ,patient
now I read a paper ,patient
and it didn't take me long but I worked hard at it ,patient
and every morning when I got up after I you_know into the bathroom and everything I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there ,patient
and I'd think of my daughter's family ,patient
there's four people in the family ,patient
there's two boys her husband and herself ,patient
I knew her name but I couldn't get his name out and the two boys ,patient
and I would just close my eyes and visualize it ,patient
and gradually all_of_a_sudden I'd see their names ,patient
and gradually it would come ,patient
then I went with my oldest son with his family ,patient
it was tiring ,patient
and I did that at night too when I went to bed before I went to sleep ,patient
I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother were in all that ,patient
and it was a long time but it  it worked ,patient
it really really worked ,patient
and I said to my daughter one day I says ,patient
 you_know  I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me ,patient
I says ,patient
 I am so tired ,patient
and I says ,patient
 I don't do anything ,patient
she says ,patient
 Mom  you are doing a whole lot ,patient
I says ,patient
 such as what ,patient
I says ,patient
 all I'm do ,patient
 well  that's it ,patient
she says ,patient
 you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it ,patient
but um it all came ,patient
it's just now I  I have trouble every once in awhile to get my words out ,patient
and that and when I write ,patient
it's getting better ,patient
sometimes when I write ges,patient
and all_of_a_sudden I look at it and I thought ,patient
 no  that's not that word  laughs ,patient
and the first time I saw that was when I made my first  uh when I was going to the store ,patient
my little shopping thing ,patient
I needed uh mayonnaise ,patient
laughs so  laughs  I'm writing and writing ,patient
I get to the store and I came to that word ,patient
I couldn't figure out what it was ,patient
the  head,patient
and I couldn't remember what it was ,patient
and by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back ,patient
 now I hafta think ,patient
 what was I gonna do with this ,patient
then I knew what it was ,patient
it would come ,patient
I'd forget it again but then in it  but that's the way it goes ,patient
I know everything but um I still hafta  I forget a_lot_of things ,patient
but everybody says ,patient
 oh  I forget too ,patient
 I'm always forgetting ,patient
you_know  and it's fine because I  I laugh about it ,patient
because when I'm with my friends and out I see people having trouble ,patient
they can't remember ,patient
 I know what I wanna say but I can't say it ,patient
and there's nothing wrong with them ,patient
so  I think ,patient
 well  maybe you're not that bad laughs ,patient
but um I have had so much pleasure here and learning ,patient
and um so many people ,patient
 I don't know what you still go to there ,patient
I says ,patient
 I'll go there until I'm finished ,patient
and I says ,patient
 points,patient
I said ,patient
 when I'm finished ,patient
and I said ,patient
 I know I'm not going to be a hundred percent ,patient
but I says ,patient
 I am still learning ,patient
and I says ,patient
 I  watch everybody here ,patient
and I says ,patient
 I have seen so many improvements ,patient
and I says ,patient
 it's wonderful ,patient
and I says ,patient
 I'm just so fortunate that I'm not had the problem that most of them here have ,patient
nods yes  it has really helped ,patient
still helps laughs  yeah ,patient
it is ,patient
for each one ,patient
alright  the story is about a boy um playing soccer ,patient
and he breaks a window  in a house ,patient
and then points,patient
and the soccer ball coming through the window to hit him ,patient
and then he gets up and um he's looking out the window holding the soccer ball ,patient
and uh  that's about what he has for the whole story ,patient
but um  it more or less is a lesson for him that you don't do that kind of ball playing so close to buildings to houses ,patient
and um ,patient
well  there's one thing that I have been always happy about what happened to me ,patient
like um the fortunate stroke that I had that wasn't too bad was  um it was in nineteen seventy five  I had cancer ,patient
and I had uh a mas um okay masectomy ,patient
and um I came through it very well ,patient
and there was a_lot that was in there ,patient
but um I got it through finally ,patient
so  that's what about thirty some odd years already ,patient
and uh I'm very proud of that ,patient
and I was the first one in the family to have cancer ,patient
and then all_of_a_sudden other members of my family ,patient
immediate you_know my living home family ,patient
um they have come down with it ,patient
and they're gone ,patient
and uh I have always been very thankful that I came through the way I did ,patient
and the doctors were amazed because it was so fast that I  I healed and everything ,patient
I didn't go home the way a_lot_of people who have masectomies ,patient
and at that time it was about five years later when they started to come out with the um ,patient
how do you call it ,patient
um they made um ,patient
the word is right there I can even see it ,patient
um where they just do a sighs ,patient
laughs ,patient
come_on brain move ,patient
um  oh   I am really stuck ,patient
and my happy happy things were my children when they were born ,patient
and um I had two boys and a girl ,patient
and um they're great kids ,patient
and I have finally got two great grandchildren this year ,patient
 two at one time ,patient
I didn't think I was ever gonna have another one  have one laughs but I got two at  two great grandchildren ,patient
 boys ,patient
this is a story about um ,patient
the weather apparently is gonna be rain ,patient
and points,patient

and he's covered up ,patient
well   this is a picture of a cat that went up in to a tree and apparently ,patient
well  cats usually jump down ,patient
but it's up there and it wouldn't get down ,patient
and points,patient
points,patient
and then all_of_a_sudden decided he was gonna up the tree to find  to get the cat down ,patient
in the meantime the dog is barking up the tree ,patient
and points,patient
so  what they did they went and called points,patient
and points,patient
and they um points,patient
and points,patient
okay ,patient
 well   this apparently is during a flood ,patient
and during that flood points,patient
and it was very very uh strong ,patient
the current was very very strong ,patient
and she apparently couldn't get  her out  herself out ,patient
and somebody must have seen her or knew that she was having a problem ,patient
and they called the ai uh emergency group ,patient
and points,patient
and he's hanging on for dear life ,patient
and wants to help her ,patient
and it doesn't show that he did successfully but apparently I think  he did ,patient
mhm ,patient
if I can remember all of it laughs ,patient
 I said if I can remember all of it ,patient
I_mean  this  I don't know what this is all about ,patient
it  apparently this girl's father remarried ,patient
this is how I'm reading it ,patient
and um his new wife had two girls ,patient
and um so it made three girls in the family now ,patient
um they weren't very nice ,patient
they didn't like Cinderella ,patient
and um they always made her do uh a_lot_of work around the house cleaning up and doing stuff like that ,patient
and um the other two they would go to parties and  and uh be with friends and everything ,patient
and then uh all_of_a_sudden one day the mother got a letter and  uh from the  um  the prince's sh  it's not a house   the uh  palace ,patient
and they were invited to go to the ball that he was having ,patient
and uh they told her that she couldn't go to that ball ,patient
so  they were getting all dressed up and everything ,patient
and um first she thought she was gonna go ,patient
and then they said no that the  sh she couldn't go ,patient
so  um they got all dressed and uh ready to go ,patient
and then clears,patient
and these little mice were friends of hers ,patient
I think they were mice laughs ,patient
and um so she took the dress and she decided that she was gonna go to the ball ,patient
and she got all dressed up and everything ,patient
and um there was uh uh the fairy godmother ,patient
that's the one who said about the uh dress ,patient
and uh clears,patient
and the horses will be the mice  I think it was ,patient
so  um she did that ,patient
she got all dressed ,patient
she went to the ball ,patient
and the prince saw her and liked her very much ,patient
she was  she looked beautiful and everything ,patient
and um the  she knows  she knew that if she didn't get back by noon  uh twelve o'clock um everyth ges,patient
so  all_of_a_sudden the uh clock rang for uh twelve ,patient
and she realized she's gotta run ,patient
and as she was running down the steps she lost her one shoe ,patient
and it was the good  the pretty shoe that she had on ,patient
and um she got home ,patient
and then all_of_a_sudden uh the prince was trying to find somebody who fits that shoe ,patient
and um they came to her house ,patient
and uh the two stepsisters they thought ,patient
 well  there's no sense in her looking at  uh trying because it's not her ,patient
so  they tried and they tried so hard to squeeze their feet into this little shoe ,patient
and it didn't work ,patient
and it turned out that uh Cinderella was the last one left to try it ,patient
and um they teased her and everything you know that it's no use of doing it ,patient
but she did and it fit perfect ,patient
and um it end up that they fell in love ,patient
and um they got married and lived happily ever after laughs ,patient
