um I can be confused a couple of times ,patient
uh sometimes I get the wrong words ,patient
um it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say ,patient
uh su sometimes it's like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that I'm trying to say ,patient
um I do have problems on  sometimes on the relationship between words ,patient
like I know that I'm wanna talk about a female relative ,patient
and I might say the wrong one ,patient
like I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother ,patient
stuff like that ,patient
um but um I do have problems with um numbers too ,patient
um I know if I'm talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number uh even how many times she hasta uh repell ,patient
so  and just like that I  I said repealq instead_of repeatq ,patient
that  that's some of the things that I have problems with ,patient
but other_than that I_mean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow  slowly I usually can get through it ,patient
uh I don't know about it actually ,patient
um laughs I was sposta be having um a physical uh s therapy at home ,patient
um and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kind_of crazy she said ,patient
um I wasn't making sense ,patient
and later that morning the physical therapist came ,patient
and he had all  all the  um uh he had all the equipment ,patient
and he took my  um he took my uh vitals ,patient
and he said that I should go to the emergency room ,patient
and that's  that's  th that I remember ,patient
I didn't remember ,patient
so  my uh brother and my wife took me to the emergency room ,patient
and luckily at the hospital that um I went to has a good uh stroke um thing ,patient
so  they took me right in there ,patient
they took a  even in the emergency room they had uh a c_k ,patient
so  so  that's about what I remember ,patient
well  when I  when they took me back to the um uh hospital room there um I saw like five different doctors ,patient
and they all did the same type of stuff ,patient
so  I could probably you_know do the  the what a doctor would see to check about a  about a stroke ,patient
but I remember um I had um some memory loss ,patient
like uh by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit ,patient
and although I've know my brother's wife for you_know thirty five forty years I could not remember her name ,patient
like one  I said ,patient
 who is that ,patient
you_know stuff like that ,patient
but it  by the time I was um discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the  knowing that I did have some um apha ,patient
I didn't know at the time that it was aphasia ,patient
but I  I knew the symptoms that I uh pro pro pro protest ,patient
but that  that's all I remember ,patient
uh w well with the  I didn't have any physical problems with the streak ,patient
uh so when I did get  uh well  at the hospital they brought a speech therapist ,patient
uh they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital ,patient
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged ,patient
so  uh I had hoped  I  I knew I had problem speeching  p,patient
so  I had asked if I could um forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well ,patient
I  I was walking and all that ,patient
but they said that ,patient
 no you have to finish your physical uh therapy before you can start the speech uh therapy ,patient
so  I  I had uh home speech therapy ,patient
um it was very good ,patient
I  I  the  the therapist was very good ,patient
and she was actually the one that ,patient
uh after they let me have I think it's a Medicare type thing that you can use uh ten sessions ,patient
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the uh speech clinic at Buffalo State in uh New York ,patient
and uh a_lot_of that was uh to get my memory back ,patient
uh a_lot_of the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories ,patient
uh uh i it's hard to explain how it took ,patient
uh I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist ,patient
and after a couple of um sessions with the neurologist he said you_know there's pretty much nothing else that he can do about it ,patient
but if I had any other problems um um you_know they could call me ,patient
um one of the things they did  uh they did probably one of those uh cognitive uh test ,patient
I  I did them ,patient
and I did okay I guess ,patient
uh probably sound uh like the stuff that they  they said that uh President Trump uh aced you_know ,patient
I had some problems with it ,patient
but uh laughs I had brain damage ,patient
so  I guess I had uh a reason ,patient
but uh that's about it ,patient
um well  uh probably one of the  the  the nicest things that I have recently was uh my daughter uh on this  uh this Mother's Day she stopped over with the card for my wife ,patient
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant ,patient
so  on father ,patient
and then on Father's Day we went over to her house with uh my oh son inlaw's parents ,patient
and they did a uh review ,patient
so  they had a uh car ,patient
and we saw that we're going to have a grandson ,patient
so that  that is probably one of the um um  you_know that period between there has been exciting for us ,patient
okay ,patient
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the uh clears_throat window ,patient
the ball breaks the window and startles the uh man who grabs the  uh grabs the ball and looks out the window to see what's going on ,patient
okay ,patient
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school ,patient
and he wanted to take or  uh she wanted him to take an umbrella ,patient
but he did not do that ,patient
he started to walk back to school ,patient
and the rain started to come ,patient
so  he ran back ,patient
and the mother was a_little angry because he had not pulled it or  he had not put the uh umbrella with him ,patient
so  he went back  put the umbrella on and walked back to school ,patient
okay ,patient
well  it looks like the cat was stuck in the uh tree ,patient
and the man had tried to get to ,patient
but he was not able to do that ,patient
so  the firemen came to  um to help him ,patient
I don't know if they're there to get the cat or the  fa or get the man ,patient
and the cat ,patient
okay uh the story starts when uh a woman ,patient
so  cirren Cinderella goes to the  step the man or  the bad stepmother ,patient
and the two children the  the  the stepmother's daughters were bad ,patient
well  they aren't bad ,patient
but they make Cinderella do all of the uh work around the house ,patient
uh and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her ,patient
and apparently they can talk with her ,patient
uh and then at after awhile  after several years it looks like after the  Cinderella got uh a_little older there was a  um a invitation to go to the um ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for uh Cinderella ,patient
but then uh Cinderella's uh godfather ,patient
and a  she turns the animals into uh people that work for the uh stage not the stage  the coach ,patient
um so  they go to the uh ball where Cinderella meets the prince ,patient
but because_of the  um the godmother only could do the spell until midnight um everything turned back to normal where uh her gown was gone ,patient
and the coach were  m,patient
and the animals were back ,patient
but then there was a man that worked for the princess ,patient
um at the end uh they  they put the glass slip slipper on Cinderitta ,patient
and um it fit per perfectly ,patient
and they found that that was the uh woman that the prince was looking for ,patient
and they went happy  they went happy to the  to the end ,patient
and that's about it ,patient
oh okay ,patient
uh I would open up the bag of the bread ,patient
uh put a piece of  of  slice of bread ,patient
I would push ,patient
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around ,patient
and then put the second uh top of the slice of bread ,patient
and I guess that's it ,patient
