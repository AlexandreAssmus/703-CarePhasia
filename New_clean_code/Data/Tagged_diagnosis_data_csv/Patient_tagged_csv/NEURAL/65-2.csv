speech is adequate ,patient
much improved ,patient
the  uh the halting of  w halting of  of speech ,patient
um the  what  what happens is that the  uh um if I,patient
 well  I  sho I shoulda said this ,patient
 I coulda said that ,patient
 why  why didn't I say that ,patient
uh for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics uh,patient
uh it helps immensely if I think about it for about a  about,patient
unle unless I've seen it before uh the  uh the  the ,patient
and uh it  it is  uh uh uh well  I'll ,patient
 wh why didn't  why didn't I think of that before ,patient
I  I  I  be before  before my eighty four accident I,patient
but uh it's much more difficult and  and uh takes longer,patient
and that's  it's like I say ,patient
been that way for thirty six years ,patient
um the first one was a  where I was tl boned at an,patient
uh and uh ended up being a ,patient
I  I caught the  uh the uh old International Harvester,patient
and uh had a shattered pelvis  broken hip  five broken ribs ,patient
did I  did I say punctured lung ,patient
uh seventeen units of blood ,patient
uh three and a half weeks in a coma ,patient
and  uh and uh I  uh in a coma for three and a half,patient
um hospital probably  probably about two and a half months ,patient
and our third child was born uh three days after I was uh moved,patient
and the second one uh was uh February of nineteen ninety where,patient
there was a shared ,patient
uh and  uh and what  uh I believe that I was,patient
well  I  I guess I don't know how long ,patient
but uh uh I recall walking across the street starting across,patient
and then I had the  sen the sensation being spun around ,patient
and then  and then uh uh later like I say I  I  d,patient
I don't know ,patient
twenty minutes later ,patient
and  and I  I was  I was in a great mood ,patient
I was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last,patient
and  uh uh and this one is fe ma uh February nineteen,patient
and I was  I was  I was  I was in a really great,patient
and then I say a  b a brain injury because uh uh um I,patient
uh and uh I had  that was  that was  that,patient
um it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down ,patient
finally went away ,patient
but I don't  I recall maybe three  four  five days,patient
something  something like that ,patient
but it lasted a significant amount of time ,patient
uh and  and the  the doctors could not tell me whether the,patient
it was extraordinary painful ,patient
and  and uh um I recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a,patient
uh oh uh after  after three or four months when  when,patient
 oh uh you_know that's probably the most painful injury known,patient
oh okay ,patient
yeah wasn't just me being a big baby then  right ,patient
and uh he  he  he chuckled ,patient
that  that's kind_of uh it  it ,patient
th those are the two accidents in  in a  in a  at,patient
uh West Tenth going into  West  uh Tenth and ,patient
okay ,patient
um the  uh um after the first the eighty four incident,patient
uh wh what had happened was that the eighty four uh laptops,patient
and  uh um and uh uh uh my  my boss at that time,patient
I'll call it uh ,patient
I won't say leisure work play with ,patient
but  but uh learn how to use there  there at home ,patient
and of_course this is before the  this is before the web,patient
but uh I had been doing a  a Nastran which is Nasa structural,patient
and  uh but that was all that  was all on uh IBM uh,patient
um and  uh uh and so here is just a  a simple little,patient
oughta be able to know how to use that ,patient
and  and so they brought this  uh uh my boss brought,patient
and  and in those years there was a  a user manual that came,patient
uh and so tried to use a  c a computer  an  op a,patient
uh if you've ever read  uh if you've ever read a Microsoft,patient
and uh one of  one of the  one  th one thing in,patient
selectq ,patient
well  had we never had any training in  in a  uh in uh,patient
and  and after several days of trying to figure out what,patient
th there's one æfeɪʒəu ,patient
select meat ,patient
an aphasia ,patient
uh selectq meant  uh what  what they meant by,patient
I just could not ,patient
there was no way ,patient
I'm extraordinary troubled really troubled by that ,patient
and so  so finally I called a coworker and uh uh said ,patient
 what  what  what did the  what does this mean to me,patient
and it described the uh uh tapping the cursor and moving the,patient
that's what they meant by selectq ,patient
well  hell  that was never described in the manual at all ,patient
and that  that  that really  that threw me for a loop,patient
and so uh I became  became uh very questioning as to whether,patient
uh and  and so  so finally the  the  like I say the,patient
 oh okay ,patient
the most  most s basic of terms which the  the uh um,patient
or my  uh no  no  this is DOS not Microsoft ,patient
this is before Microsoft existed ,patient
this DOS manual it did not  did not uh uh uh comprehend,patient
but they did not ,patient
DOS manual did not describe that anywhere ,patient
and so  so the  and uh so I went back to work and uh,patient
and  and finally uh my  my  after a couple years uh,patient
 you might  might have it  you take those  take,patient
and so wow that was  that was a godsend ,patient
I_mean just being able to  to write  write things down ,patient
so  I  I carry a small ,patient
don't have with me right now ,patient
but I still  I carry a small  like a small notecard,patient
because that  that was  that was  writing  when,patient
holy_mackerel that was  uh that  that was uh um a,patient
um tha that  that in particular ,patient
and  and also I ended up uh uh as a later  as a um,patient
uh I developed uh uh tricks where I when I meet somebody new,patient
use their name in any kind_of verbal  verbal conversation with,patient
use name  e use their name every time first or last name or,patient
and  and then uh after the  after the  after the,patient
uh and  and  and that  that has been a  uh,patient
for example I met a  uh in our neighborhood met a ,patient
I'm at  I'm at  I'm at home now ,patient
not down the farm ,patient
but uh met a fellow in  in the  in the uh neighborhood,patient
and I got his name ,patient
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told,patient
and uh this morning I was  I saw him out for a walk and ,patient
and then fine finally the name came to xxx ,patient
so  but  but the  the discipline on  on um recalling,patient
yes  yes ,patient
the  uh um I think I mentioned to you last week ,patient
may may uh possibly I didn't ,patient
but the time  I'd spent some time as a  at the rehab,patient
uh and  uh uh because I  I started oh ,patient
and it became rather troubling to me because having  they just,patient
so  there was no therapy ,patient
you just  you're able to survive ,patient
just a  the thing you're able to just  could just check,patient
uh and uh um because they just did not do therapy in those,patient
and  and over the course the next twenty years uh wife and I,patient
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five,patient
that's what they're telling people even uh fifteen years ago ,patient
uh and so I wanted to  to  wanted to share that with ,patient
but it is  takes a long time ,patient
and in oh ,patient
 yup  a year to year and a half recovery ,patient
 year to year and a half recovery ,patient
 year to year and a half recovery ,patient
hey  you don't stop recovering ,patient
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly,patient
but you never never stop recovering ,patient
uh I had a  in the eight  the eighty  eighty four,patient
and it was just something that I accepted ,patient
and it was  I could function without it ,patient
no  no big deal ,patient
but uh to stick a pin there and I don't  wouldn't ,patient
uh no  no big deal ,patient
and then it was probably five years ago or ma twenty  twenty,patient
I think it was  yeah ,patient
I think it was oh ,patient
twenty five years after the eighty four incident I was in the ,patient
and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five,patient
so  what I'm  what I'm telling you actually is that the,patient
but  s but still you never stop recovering ,patient
you just don't stop recovering ,patient
you don't ,patient
yes  it's uh not  not rocket science ,patient
it  it ti ti time  time is  time is the best ,patient
because you  you  the feeling that  the feeling that,patient
and  and you'll notice one day it'll  it'll ,patient
 oh  oh crap I  I  I have feeling there that I didn't,patient
it  actually it will happen ,patient
you will experience it ,patient
um uh actually  actually n no ,patient
it was  it was  uh it just  I_mean I was used to,patient
but  uh but I  I don't  I don't know if I got used to,patient
but  but uh like I say twenty five years later I just put on,patient
 hey wait a minute ,patient
 I've got feeling there ,patient
and had  had  had none before ,patient
I  I don't know when it happened ,patient
have  have no idea ,patient
they will  it will  they will ,patient
the nerves will work again ,patient
they  they will actually ,patient
they will ,patient
uh when  when I  when I  when I  I  first,patient
when  when she and  when I  she and I first met uh,patient
uh we went to  we went to different high_schools together ,patient
uh her from uh in near Washington Indiana  in Washington,patient
and myself from uh Plainfield ,patient
uh and it was before classes started at Purdue ,patient
August of nineteen seventy two ,patient
uh it was uh uh her first day on campus ,patient
my first day on campus ,patient
um there was to be a  a dance at uh  the  the dorm I,patient
again  again each is our first  first day on campus ,patient
and  uh uh and  uh and  and so I was a little bit,patient
which I  I will arrive but place a little bit early given ,patient
and uh uh so I ended up being just a little bit early for the,patient
and  uh and uh my wife and  uh and her  her  her,patient
guy  girl  girls  girls go with  with body guards ,patient
I get that ,patient
I think it's a ,patient
her and her  her and her wife and uh uh her and uh,patient
and  uh uh and uh FirstnameS's wife has never met a,patient
the  she's the  a  a true extrovert ,patient
matter of fact if you look up in Webster extrovert and it said ,patient
uh but anyway  so  so  uh she and a girlfriend that,patient
 oh hey is the  uh is the  the dance here ,patient
and  and wellco I answered ,patient
 well  it's supposta be ,patient
 uh that's why I'm here ,patient
and  and uh then we  I just  uh I hung around ,patient
I  I  I hu hung around her that  that  that  that,patient
and uh that's where we started dating ,patient
and  and uh oh it's  we  we dated probably three,patient
dated around about three years or so ,patient
and after about uh four years I figured out that wellco maybe,patient
and I oughta get more serious about this ,patient
so  it was just like I  k I accused her of  of uh,patient
that's w where  where we first met is she picked me up at a,patient
a young  a young boy it's look like a  s a um grade,patient
is kicking it ,patient
and he  k he  it ends up going through a house window ,patient
uh a gentleman on a couch uh there in the window uh sitting,patient
and then he  he  he gets the ball  s stands by the broken,patient
in the beginning this  this mother it appears uh is  had,patient
uh and uh he  he says ,patient
 ah ,patient
he says no and says ,patient
 no  no  mom  I don't need that ,patient
and then  then leaves ,patient
and then in the middle it starts raining on him ,patient
and then rains heavier on him ,patient
and then  and then uh uh he goes back home just uh,patient
and then the last  the end of the story was he learned his,patient
the way this started was that the  it looks like uh that,patient
that the dog is barking at  a dog is barking at this guy ,patient
and uh on the  on the  on a tree limb there's a cat,patient
and it would appear that uh uh a cat climbed up the tree ,patient
the  uh a little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck,patient
they  they  they  uh a male  a man uh uh uh,patient
there's also a  a firetruck and a fire engine ,patient
but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder ,patient
and it looks like the  lad the  the ladder is being used by,patient
uh and  uh and the  and a songbird is over on a  a,patient
okay done ,patient
Cinderella was a  a daughter of a  uh uh a subject of,patient
she  her mother had passed  uh her mother passed away ,patient
and her father remarried ,patient
and the stepmother had uh uh two  two daughters uh who,patient
uh and as they  after they were married uh the uh uh,patient
and uh so  so s Cinderella spent her time working cleaning,patient
and  and uh uh in that  in the kingdom there was uh,patient
um an advisor to the king suggested a  a  a ball be held,patient
uh so  the word was put out about the ball coming up ,patient
uh Cinderella was real happy about the  ba about the ball,patient
uh and so the  the  the  f um the farm animals,patient
and  uh uh and then at the last minute uh the stepmother,patient
and  and the  uh and then also the  the  the,patient
uh and so  so the stepdaughters went to the ball ,patient
and  but in the meantime while  b before  uh before,patient
and so it  it um made for her a  just a  a lovely gown,patient
and they  then turned a  a pumpkin into a coach uh pulled,patient

uh and uh um the prince uh was acquainted with the ,patient
ended up spending the night dancing with uh Cinderella ,patient
