uh it's pretty good ,patient
um I have problems sometimes especially with uh numbers still uh ,patient
and sometimes I don't know if it's because I don't hear the  the  the  what I'm uh saying correctly ,patient
it's something like if I was to say ,patient
 uh I had to take care of my uh income tax ,patient
uh I might say uh my incomeq taxedq or uh my incomeq texa or  Texas ,patient
you_know s stuff like that where I  I kinda think twice of what the  uh the real or  the  um the word that I was trying to say ,patient
uh something like that ,patient
but other than that I'm thinking I can talk pretty good as long as uh uh people give me time and slow down uh you_know because normally people speak faster than I can ,patient
so  uh usually if I'm in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I  I have some kind of problem speaking ,patient
so  they understand ,patient
so  it  it  it's pretty good ,patient
I_mean like I  I've gone uh to a bunch of doctors ,patient
and you_know they might repeat something for me or you_know uh ask what I had really said stuff like that you_know if I uh say it wrong ,patient
but other_than that I'm feeling okay speaking ,patient
oh I  I  I don't really too much about it ,patient
uh I knew that uh I had been having uh physical therapy because I'd had had a hip replacement  the other hip replacement ,patient
uh so  uh that morning my wife unders or she said that she understood or  she knew that I was having some kind of uh problems speaking ,patient
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that ,patient
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular uh session ,patient
and he also noticed that I uh was speaking differently ,patient
and uh he took my vitals and stuff like that ,patient
and he said that I should go to the emergency room ,patient
and after that uh we're only ah maybe three miles from the hospital ,patient
so  my brother came over and took uh my wife and uh him over there ,patient
and they sat there while I went through the uh emergency room and stuff like that ,patient
so  it  it took about uh uh maybe three or four hours to have  you_know go through ,patient
uh they did some task ,patient
and I think they have a good uh stroke uh thing ,patient
so  they  actually in the uh emergency room they had a c_t scan uh were I could do ,patient
and then they  they found where I had uh a room ,patient
you_know and they  they had found that I had had the stroke through the c_t  c_t scan ,patient
and then by the time I  I went up to the room probably three or four other uh doctors came from you_know the  the hospital doctor uh uh neurologist ,patient
uh they actually had uh a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to uh stop the blood or anything ,patient
but it looks like after it  it  the clot burst I was okay ,patient
and there was no xxx uh more um bleeding ,patient
so  that  that's about what I remember ,patient
and I  I know um when I saw the doctors at the uh uh room they all had the  they have the same type of test that they do to see if it was really uh a stroke and what kind of damage it might've been ,patient
and I knew that I um had some memory loss ,patient
uh I recognized my uh brother and my uh wife ,patient
but my uh brother's wife came later because sh she was a nurse ,patient
and even_though I know her for thirty five forty years I couldn't remember her name ,patient
so  I  I did have some uh small  or what do you call it  short memory uh loss ,patient
but that  that's about it ,patient
well  at the hospital I  I stayed there for three days ,patient
and they did a_lot tests ,patient
uh they did uh m_r_is uh uh echocardiograms uh to make sure you_know I didn't have it ,patient
they did uh things uh measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything ,patient
uh they did  like the last day that I was there they brought a uh speech therapist there because they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital ,patient
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my  my speech xxx a affected ,patient
and it turned out that you_know the next day they uh dis distarged ,patient
and I never saw her again ,patient
and uh because_of my  uh my medical insurance uh when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before uh they could start my speech therapy ,patient
so  I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house ,patient
and that  that was about it ,patient
um I'm trying to think ,patient
I  I know last session I think I talked about uh my daughter being uh pregnant nowadays ,patient
but if I was to think younger uh maybe a good time a thing that I liked uh was in my  when I was twenty uh I was in the airforce ,patient
and I was stationed in Italy uh in the Alps ,patient
it was a radio station on top of a  uh a mountain actually ,patient
so  uh having never uh learned how to play or  how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn how to play or  how to uh ski uh because our  uh our sight was on the top of the mountain ,patient
and they had a uh uh ski slopes there ,patient
so  I had a good time uh in Germany ,patient
and the guy was a very old uh German guy that gave uh several of us uh skiing lesson ,patient
and uh after that uh because our  uh our location uh wa where I would uh work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didn't xxx ,patient
so  I got to be pretty good at uh ski  playing ski ,patient
er I keep on saying playq playingq skiq ,patient
uh skiing is skiing ,patient
it's not playing ski ,patient
and that  that was a good time ,patient
yeah ,patient
yeah I_mean it  it  it was a very small village where we lived when we were at  when we were off the sight ,patient
so  there was a_lot_of places to ski ,patient
and it was only like uh forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg ,patient
so  we  we'd ski in a_lot a places around the Alps ,patient
okay ,patient
um there's a boy in the yard playing with the sco er uh soccer ball ,patient
uh he kicks the ball ,patient
and it hits the window and breaks the window ,patient
uh the window gets broken and comes through into the house and knocks the  uh the lamb ,patient
and then the man goes over to the window to see who had uh broke the window ,patient
okay ,patient
uh the story starts with the mother telling the young boy that he should take a umbrella ,patient
but the uh child kinda waved it off saying that I don't need the uh umbrella ,patient
and he starts walking to school ,patient
and the uh rain starts to fall ,patient
it starts getting a_lot heavier ,patient
so  he runs back to his  off or not his office  to his house ,patient
and uh he gets all wet ,patient
and his mother is a_little mad at him because he didn't bring the uh umbrella like he told him ,patient
so  and then he went got the umbrella and started to walk back to school ,patient
okay ,patient
um I think I'm pretty good ,patient
uh you want me to tell you what I okay ,patient
what I'm seeing at  is uh a cat that is uh on top or  on top of the tree ,patient
and the young girl wants to bring him down ,patient
and her father uh tried to go up the tree to uh get the cat out ,patient
and the dog is barking at the man ,patient
and apparently the father got stuck in the tree himself with ,patient
and after that uh two firemen came to bring him a  lat a ladder to probably take both the father and the cat out_of the tree ,patient
no  I  I think I  I have them as as good as I'll be able to remember ,patient
okay ,patient
okay uh the story starts when a man brings uh his  maybe his youngest  her ,patient
uh they start when they were earlier ,patient
but uh after several years it turns out that uh uh Cinderella has  has made  hasta do all of the work to uh take care of the  the  the family there ,patient
uh after awhile uh Cinderella starts to be friends with little critters ,patient
uh uh after awhile there comes an announcement that there's gonna be a ball at the prince's  uh prince's uh castle ,patient
uh all the women the stepmother and the stepsisters were all uh dressed up for the ball ,patient
but uh uh Cinderella was not invited ,patient
so  she started to look around or she was reading something ,patient
and she saw a uh godfather ,patient
uh and she had  she made up a beautiful gown for Cinderella ,patient
and she turned the animals into a couch ,patient
so  uh Cinderella and the prince had a beautiful time and were dancing ,patient
and then at the um strike ,patient
and the uh coach turned in back into uh a pumpkin ,patient
so  when she was leaving from uh the ball she left  lost her uh glass slipper ,patient
uh after they found the glass  uh glass slipper uh a man who worked for the king and the prince went around to try and to see if they could find who uh dropped the glass slipper ,patient
so  they look ,patient
and none of the other woman at the house would fit with the  the uh slipper until uh they found Cindereed ,patient
so  uh they went to the castle ,patient
and the prince and Cinder Cinderella uh got married and live happily É›vu ,patient
okay ,patient
uh I would get a couple slices of bread ,patient
uh the way I would usually do it would be spread the peanut butter on one slice ,patient
uh put a little bit of uh jam around it ,patient
and then put the top uh slice ,patient
and then usually cut it in half ,patient
