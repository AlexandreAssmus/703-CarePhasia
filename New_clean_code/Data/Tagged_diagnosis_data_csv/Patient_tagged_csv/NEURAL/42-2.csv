how it was ,patient
um mostly when I started ,patient
I had a month I don't even remember anything about it ,patient
but um it was like ten days ,patient
they finally got me in there to  um I finally started  I_mean I could actually talk or anything like that ,patient
um but I had to remember how to remember everything ,patient
and we're  everything is gone back ,patient
I mean everything about um abck all that kind of stuff like that ,patient
everybody's name ,patient
everybody  the computer on there ,patient
the  the Coke sitting there ,patient
everything ,patient
the wrong about it ,patient
you have nothing about it ,patient
you hadta remember everything about it ,patient
so  um we um went to ,patient
I had like thirty  thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first ,patient
um and then um we went to ,patient
um after that that's when we started to talk and to um get in the sort of thing ,patient
make sure I'm forget something ,patient
it's ten years before ,patient
um laughs but we did start like um abck one two three or something like that with my mom ,patient
started to  um it's in um um books ,patient
I went there ,patient
there is someone  we got a talk over there ,patient
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abck one two three and stuff like that ,patient
um and it took a long time ,patient
it was about a year the start over that ,patient
and I've gone down ,patient
it was Monday to Friday ,patient
now it's down Monday Wednesday Friday ,patient
then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks ,patient
just try to talk a_little better and that ,patient
because I_mean at this time I could talk a_little better ,patient
but it just hard to get back everything out_of there ,patient
so  that helped different things about it for those six weeks ,patient
and you're trying with computer ,patient
or trying to  try to write on there ,patient
trying to do something about it get a_little better there ,patient
and that's how they tried to ,patient
after that they started IU ,patient
and that's when they um started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that ,patient
um there's so much you couldn't remember anything about it ,patient
um but it's  you just take your time trying to ,patient
me  m me and my mom  my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that ,patient
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things ,patient
so  it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time ,patient
so  you just gotta keep everything  keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk ,patient
mostly taking my time ,patient
so  if I talk too much people have no idea what I'm doing ,patient
and they talk to me real quick ,patient
this is kind_of weird because if one person talk ,patient
if there's three people I can understand other people ,patient
I can understand more of this ,patient
but  so  it takes time um getting around everything ,patient
so  um so  it's just  it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting a_little better ,patient
um I don't know how long I can go ,patient
but it's just  it seems like I'm still doing something with it ,patient
so  um and it keeps going over time ,patient
so  so  I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that ,patient
and the  um and it's  my mom's very helping ,patient
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too ,patient
they need to do something like that ,patient
but um I have my brothers too ,patient
one of them  I_mean one I don't see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other ,patient
so  it just  it's not it  as it used to be ,patient
I knew a_lot_of people and all that kind ,patient
now I'm kind_of move down like a_couple people I knew and just take my time ,patient
so  it's a_lot easy as how it was ,patient
um I dunno ,patient
is that come around or ,patient
xxx about it was um like I said I had to re remember everything ,patient
I_mean I wasn't really  didn't get me out that bad because I said ,patient
 what was I gonna do ,patient
so  you hadta restart everything to get back on there ,patient
so  you took your time and tried to get through it ,patient
and I_mean if you're going to yell at it it's not gonna do anything for it ,patient
so  you're  the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that ,patient
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that ,patient
I'd be outside and doing stuff like that or you_know ,patient
but it really doesn't bother me that much ,patient
I_mean I just take my time during the day ,patient
like I'm  I'm gonna dry  s,patient
and I might go outside and working on the  a branch or something like that ,patient
just keep going back and forth ,patient
um like I'd  I'd go get my aunt ,patient
she's ninety seven ,patient
I get her on almost every times for a week ,patient
and maybe like one day of the week and we'll see her ,patient
but I get her on the phone every day ,patient
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving ,patient
and  and it's another way to get through to me and everybody else ,patient
I_mean a_lot_of them can't understand what I'm doing ,patient
but a_lot I know they know everything about it ,patient
so  it's easy about it  so ,patient
just anything you're telling me or ,patient
um I thought it was kind_of totally different when I  I  re I restarted here ,patient
um I hadta remember how to do everything ,patient
which was  it was kind_of  it's a_little weird for every  everybody too ,patient
because I_mean I knew right away my mom could ask me you_know what this was in the kitchen or something like that ,patient
yeah I knew how to make it ,patient
I can make my breakfast and all that stuff ,patient
she goes ,patient
 know what that is ,patient
no  can't remember ,patient
like that ,patient
I knew everything ,patient
it's all on my head like that ,patient
I_mean made my breakfast and you_know like the um eggs bacon um microwave and the whatever like things like that ,patient
and always be there in the morning ,patient
always my breakfast first ,patient
people think I'm weird ,patient
but  but  um but it's just something that um ,patient
it is another way I tried to keep doing what I'm doing ,patient
but it also is doing whatever I need to do ,patient
I_mean I hadta do everything like that anyway ,patient
so  it took some time on that ,patient
and um it's  it was a long time to do ,patient
but you had  just took your time and do whatever you're doing  I think ,patient
it's  um I don't know how to ,patient
you're not gonna too quick ,patient
and you hafta do sometimes ,patient
so  you just kinda do whatever you're doing but then a little bit farther ,patient
number one the  the boy was sitting outside with a um soccer ball ,patient
and he kicked a good one there ,patient
but it went over by um the house over there went into the umbrella um not the umbrella how_about  the window ,patient
went into the  through inside there it look ,patient
there's a guy sitting in number third ,patient
the soccer ball came in ,patient
knocked out the lamp ,patient
knocked him out too ,patient
he was probably sleeping I think and scared him out pretty bad ,patient
and then um number four I gotta see what I can move around here ,patient
uh he's over looking through the window to see who it was ,patient
their probably  probably ran away ,patient
but um he's not very happy somebody threw the soccer ball into the window there ,patient
about it ,patient
um mom told the boy that she ,patient
and she ,patient
 oh  no  I don't need to take that ,patient
on number two ,patient
number three he went out there and it rained ,patient
so  he's walking ,patient
and it's raining more ,patient
and he's getting his feet in there ,patient
but he got all the way back ,patient
and she's not very happy with him ,patient
mom's very happy with him ,patient
and he knows ,patient
he had water all over the place ,patient
but next time he changed and took the umbrella with him ,patient
enough ,patient
okay ,patient
um looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree ,patient
which they could do anytime  I think ,patient
um well  I don't know ,patient
they can't get everything but they're  they do to know  to enough ,patient
um but the  the girl she'd like to get her cat back ,patient
but  um so  she's waiting there ,patient
and her  her dad decided he could go up there to help with that ,patient
when he took the um ,patient
I know what it is ,patient
lak  lædɪdu ,patient
something close like that ,patient
but he took it up the top ,patient
and  um and it fell down ,patient
so  he's gonna have trouble anyway ,patient
the cat's too far away ,patient
but he's stuck ,patient
he can't get down ,patient
the dog's kinda barking at him for no reason driving him nuts ,patient
but  um but the um firemen came in here ,patient
they're gonna help for him ,patient
so  they're walking over this way ,patient
um so  they're walking ,patient
and they'll get up here in a little bit ,patient
they'll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him ,patient
but um the  the bird's happy ,patient
they're on the other place over there away from everyone else ,patient
so  they're singing something like that ,patient
but um it's pretty much about what it is unless they're waiting on he gets down and the cat doesn't wanna come down ,patient
um did I get enough ,patient
okay ,patient
looks like  um for some reason they gave it seems like another cousin with them ,patient
they gave her with her aunt ,patient
so  um I'm not sure why he's  they send that way ,patient
but anyway um whoever gave it said that'd be nice ,patient
we'll give it to you and stuff like that ,patient
and they'll keep and  st and they'll make it good for you too ,patient
but then the aunt ,patient
she made her pretty bad ,patient
she had to go work outside and  and everything else ,patient
and again she's certain  s,patient
but her cousins ,patient
they got to do whatever they wanted ,patient
and they're kind_of a pain in the butt ,patient
um but  um so  that's how it was for all the time ,patient
she tried to be nice ,patient
but they were still not very nice ,patient
but um the one time they were gonna have they were t ,patient
I guess they do for the sometime the year they get to see everybody ,patient
so  they went to um see if this would be  see ,patient
their  their aunt ,patient
um so  they're gonna go there to play or  play or sing that night and stuff like that ,patient
but their cousin ,patient
but a  um uh what would you say it'd be ,patient
um s not a ghost or some I don't know what ,patient
they had one they would bring on the way ,patient
that's not normal how the um people and stuff like that ,patient
this was totally different ,patient
how they ,patient
but they ,patient
so  she could go on that way ,patient
um so  she got to go in that place ,patient
then um went to see there to that night ,patient
got up ,patient
she could go um sing and play or was out there ,patient
got some people ,patient
and that's where they saw the big um ,patient
it's one of the ,patient
I think he's um ,patient
I don't know if he is the king ,patient
or he might be just the new king coming there ,patient
he was out there ,patient
he was with her for a while ,patient
but then she hadta leave ,patient
and he is worried what happened her ,patient
but um she left ,patient
and he was worried about that ,patient
but she did drop one of her um shoes ,patient
so  he had that ,patient
so  they went back ,patient
she was going back her place where she was just gon not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff ,patient
but um her cousins ,patient
and they put them on there ,patient
and her feet are huge ,patient
so  it wasn't gonna work on that ,patient
but then um while they're there they did  he did bring them over to her ,patient
and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes ,patient
so  he knew what it was ,patient
so  he took her back ,patient
and that's one of the great or  the best thing you could ever do ,patient
she went back ,patient
she's  she's like a queen now ,patient
so  best thing that came on that way ,patient
so  enough ,patient
okay ,patient
you  um I would take two the bread ,patient
um put it on  on top of plate ,patient
um I got some butter ,patient
and I really can't say what it was laughs ,patient
um it's in the ,patient
well  I took one of those out ,patient
so  you take the knife and  and just lot  s,patient
um so  you could flip both sides so c comes in  in the middle there ,patient
I'll take the knife and go wipe it off  put it in the dishes something like that ,patient
um usually get something to drink ,patient
Coke mostly ,patient
but go sit down on ,patient
um and just in  in your hands ,patient
and you got your  got the sandwich ,patient
and should be pretty good ,patient
