my speech ,patient
I think it's a_lot better than what it  what it was ,patient
and I'm hoping that it gets better ,patient
actually I'm hoping that it  that it gets back to where it was ,patient
yes um but to be honest with you I  if  if  if what you're asking is I think that I didn't exactly understand what had all happened you_know ,patient
um and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and a_lot of it ,patient
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were  were  were kind_of funny or weren't making sense ,patient
so  I  I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand ,patient
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would r remember everything ,patient
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought ,patient
there  I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset  not upset  sad  sad ,patient
and then  but then ,patient
anyway sorry ,patient
well  most of the time I've been pretty happy sorry  because um I'm very fortunate that I'm still here and have a s second time to be alive and be with people that I  I care about ,patient
but it's just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything ,patient
I was  I was home when it happened ,patient
and um I  it just really hurt ,patient
for me it was on my left side ,patient
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down ,patient
but right away I could tell something wasn't right ,patient
and um then I  my wife realized more stuff that was going on ,patient
and she was able to ask me ques quite a few questions ,patient
and after a few questions she could realize I wasn't making sense ,patient
so  I guess that's the answer ,patient
um sure um a_lot ,patient
um um I'm trying to think where to start ,patient
from the time that I was at the um ,patient
I can't even think what it's called ,patient
where was I at ,patient
after the stroke happened at first CAR,patient
yeah i_c_u and then the ,patient
did it ,patient
where I was for awhile ,patient
um yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me CAR,patient
yeah rehab that's the one ,patient
it's hard for me to answer when I can't think how to say it ,patient
rehab ,patient
and they were helping me ,patient
and they  they were very kind ,patient
and my wife was wonderful ,patient
and they were just telling me things that gave  g i i me  it gave me a_lot_of hope that they realized I was pretty much  I was a_little weak ,patient
but I was physically able to walk around and do a_lot ,patient
and that  remember I told yesterday I could remember a_lot_of like well  uh um how to play a guitar and um kind_of singing ,patient
although I guess you would know how this stuff means ,patient
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was ,patient
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something ,patient
but that gave me a_lot_of hope ,patient
and then um I got back home ,patient
and I've worked with a whole lot of things ,patient
I'll show you one of them ,patient
xxx ,patient
here it is ,patient
one of these things ges,patient
so  not every day but for a_lot_of days I just go back ,patient
and I look at this ,patient
and I started going backwards i just uh to try to read it ,patient
you_know dog and cat ,patient
so  th there's a whole bunch of these things that they had ,patient
and then uh some of those in the other room that I can't always get a hold of but I  I managed to get a hold of these ,patient
I usually  I can usually get them ,patient
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something ,patient
and when I started playing ,patient
is it okay i if I keep blabbing for a minute ,patient
this is actually  I guess my wife can tell me I  I kinda blab ,patient
so  uh I don't mean to be that way ,patient
but um um you_know sh I guess she realized soon ,patient
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing ,patient
and um after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with um older people ,patient
and then it made me think more about that after so something I was going through ,patient
and uh I really wanted to  to just sing ,patient
I  I  I realized that I missed that ,patient
so  we were talking about me doing that ,patient
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened ,patient
um somehow one of them got  got missed ,patient
and so it was about a month I guess  later ,patient
um yeah  yeah July ,patient
one  uh well  I'm forgot to say it ,patient
uh w bottom line is one of them called not long before ,patient
oh_my_gosh you_know w we didn't tell him   s,patient
and so I still said ,patient
 yeah I want to try it ,patient
so  I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs ,patient
and I  I did it ,patient
and I was nervous ,patient
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to  to start doing it again ,patient
and I did a whole lot of shows again ,patient
and I think that really helped me because it  it started r remembering and a_lot_of that ,patient
so  I guess that's the answer to a_lot_of it ,patient
yeah and I was feeling so good ,patient
I  m I musta done a hundred shows at least ,patient
she could tell you ,patient
there was a ton of them I did ,patient
and uh pretty much not having any problems ,patient
um but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing ,patient
and I was singing all not making sense ,patient
and that just destroyed me ,patient
I_mean I just  that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I  I was back ,patient
and then that happened and the next thing I knew we're going to the hospital ,patient
and I just couldn't believe it ,patient
I just  I just said ,patient
 oh_my_god no ,patient
and that was  that was probably the worst ,patient
um but then came back around again ,patient
so  I was doing better again ,patient
and then all_of_a_sudden Covid came in ,patient
so  since it's been so many weird things in my life because_of just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything ,patient
and then that's come along ,patient
and it's just every  we're all going through that ,patient
kind_of figure out what's  h what's all gonna happen ,patient
and how are people and etcetera and ,patient
so  yeah it's been really really crazy ,patient
oh_my_gosh so many ,patient
I don't know where to start with that ,patient
I  I can only tell just  just the one  huh ,patient
well  I would talk about my wife and I getting  getting  getting married ,patient
um I guess that's pretty obvious that I would say that ,patient
um gosh I_mean I'm trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more ,patient
um I got  I forgot a little what you asked me ,patient
but this might be part of it too ,patient
um we got to go to where we useta go every year ,patient
up  to up north from us which is up b by Wisconsin ,patient
um FirstnameT my wife ,patient
you_know I wasn't able to actually  I used to always be the one that kind_of was the like main like uh driver ,patient
and so of_course she  you_know I knew that I couldn't  we weren't going to do that especially with our kids with me driving ,patient
so  she  she did ,patient
but going there again was a really wonderful time ,patient
it really uh reminded me of a_lot of places ,patient
because we  we usually would go in the same places ,patient
and uh so that sort_of is a long thinking about ,patient
I just felt kind_of ,patient
we  we married there ,patient
so  I guess I don't know ,patient
I don't think I'm really answering what you asked me ,patient
just like happy times of just one happy time ,patient
yes I would  uh I would uh love to ,patient
um well  first of all we're just friends ,patient
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church ,patient
and I was really interested in her ,patient
but I took a long time ,patient
um and finally I mentioned about if we could g go out ,patient
and she said yes which is wonderful ,patient
we went out ,patient
one of the happiest ,patient
the  that first date was just amazing ,patient
I felt like I was this younger g person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of ,patient
and we just went out to see a movie ,patient
and then we just talked for a long time ,patient
and I told her good night and drove home ,patient
and that was incredible ,patient
and so we started going out ,patient
and when we got married it was such a happy time ,patient
um I remember I went  t t t it didn't right away go ,patient
be before we got married that last night for ,patient
but I did ,patient
and I woke up ,patient
and I was really happy ,patient
and uh I uh was looking fairly forward to it ,patient
felt a_lot_of peace ,patient
and so um we had a pretty special wedding that we had done ,patient
and um the way we did it was that you_know I didn't get to see her how she was looking when h she walked out ,patient
and I was standing way back ,patient
and I saw her coming ,patient
sorry ,patient
it's no nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda ,patient
but I cried because she was coming w w w wsorry  with her dad ,patient
and uh that was amazing ,patient
and uh we had uh uh a fantastic uh w wedding there ,patient
and uh anyway the whole time it was happy ,patient
I don't know why I cried  sorry ,patient
I think I might have thought of c because_of FirstnameT's  FirstnameT's like  FirstnameT's like uh mom who  who had passed away a year and a half ago ,patient
so  I think that kinda got me ,patient
but everything else w was  was really happy ,patient
oh_boy ,patient
well  in this case it's a  it's a  it's a guy a young bo boy ,patient
and he's got a uh ,patient
oh what do you call those things ,patient
things that you ,patient
see now I get stuck on ,patient
I  I  n I owe ,patient
totally I can't think what that's called ,patient
uh bouncing go ,patient
oh_no ,patient
uh uh I  I'll get that ,patient
do I have much time because  because I can think of that ,patient
is there a timing on it ,patient
okay  I hope that's okay and that's doesn't drive you crazy ,patient
you're like ,patient
 okay come_on  FirstnameJ ,patient
uh I've got this ,patient
it's  um oh what do you call that ,patient
mom  the moms go with ,patient
oh  I'm stuck on something really obvious ,patient
but anyway he's gonna  he's taking it and um using his foot ,patient
and as he does hits it a_little too hard into the r I guess  the right ,patient
and it's going right toward a person's house ,patient
and oops looks like in number three you can see that it  it actually broke there ,patient
and there's this person's probably somebody's dad just sitting there ,patient
it looks like he mighta been reading or something ,patient
I'm  I'm not sure about that ,patient
like oh_my_gosh got a_little startled ,patient
now he's looking down at the fourth one ,patient
and he can look back there and see what happened ,patient
and then probably can see behind wh who that probably was I would assume back there ,patient
so  that's my answer to that question ,patient
okay ,patient
on the first one xxx  on the first one uh there is uh a person ,patient
this is a xxx  I guess ,patient
and uh yes which is like  um sorry  which is like um um mother ,patient
and it looks like to me like she is telling him that he should take a um ,patient
uh it's going to be the hard when we hadta think what that's called ,patient
uh to k not get wet ,patient
um like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain ,patient
stuck on what that's called ,patient
but I know what it is ,patient
um and so she  it looks like he's going like ,patient
 no ,patient
and the  though the  the second one it looks like he's  oh like she's ,patient
oh I see what happened ,patient
she's looking a little bit upset like ,patient
 what ,patient
 you're not gonna leave ,patient
and then the third one he's now outside ,patient
and boyco guess what happened ,patient
now it's  it's  he's getting soaked ,patient
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house ,patient
yes and she does look a little bit upset ,patient
and he's looking kind_of like ,patient
 yeah  mom  y y you were right ,patient
and he's soaked ,patient
and now she has the other thing I can't think of what it's called  around him to keep not getting wet ,patient
that's pretty much what I have ,patient
okay  so  first  first I'm going to look at what I see ,patient
um and then there's a_lot going on there in there ,patient
okay ,patient
there is a um ,patient
okay ,patient
ks I see it's a tree ,patient
there is a man uh standing outside or  up high with the tree ,patient
there's a dog ,patient
can't help it ,patient
I always notice like dogs and cats ,patient
there's a dog at the bottom u u under there looking up ,patient
kind_of looks like it's barking ,patient
probably saying something like ,patient
 what are you doing up there ,patient
and there's a cat just sort_of hanging out ,patient
oh I see ,patient
and then are both under the cator   at the bottom of the cat or whatever uh uh is a young girl who's probably trying to help with  th with the  with the cat ,patient
um interesting enough there  there is a uh ,patient
uh what is that called ,patient
oh_no ,patient
I can point to it ,patient
but I can't say it ,patient
um there is a thing that  which the young girl could take with the  with the man ,patient
and he could  uh he could walk down there ,patient
can't think of what it's called ,patient
um okay ,patient
on the right uh uh uh see is a  uh is a um ,patient
crud  I forgot what that's called ,patient
I'll skip that one ,patient
at the bottom there we do see there is a  uh a_couple guys  a person  people who are um gonna probably help him ,patient
um uh the  which forgot what that's called too ,patient
uh uh f like a  f like a f ,patient
I can't say it ,patient
with a f ,patient
I  I got it ,patient
with a fire person who's gonna come and probably help him up there ,patient
that's what I've got ,patient
okay ,patient
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella ,patient
but um Cinderella starts with uh she was  had a wonderful mom a and also dad  father and mother ,patient
and they were loving and  and kind ,patient
and she was too ,patient
and um something happened which a_lot  lot of ,patient
and that was her  um her  sorry  her like mother ,patient
so  h her dad  her father um met this other woman and decided to  uh he'd like to m m have h him and her get married ,patient
and uh as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go ,patient
 oh_no don't be marrying this particular person ,patient
but he did ,patient
and that person had a couple  uh a couple like  sorry  a_couple like daughters that she owned ,patient
and it's showing that they're all very very mean not only to  to Cinderella but even to themself ,patient
they just  they're just very  all they think about is uh themself ,patient
and the  m the mother is just interested in trying to make a_lot_of money when she gets married ,patient
so  they realize that Cinderella is just  is a very beautiful person ,patient
I_mean she's  she's very  she's very pretty and beautiful ,patient
but she's  inside she's just a really sweet person who  who cares about people ,patient
so the  uh s oh  I think it's called stepmother ,patient
I think that's what it's called ,patient
um realizes they need to  she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters ,patient
and so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that she's  m,patient
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy um at least for the most part and just doing a_lot_of lovely things in taking care of them ,patient
and so around that time the  uh p the prince ,patient
uh let me see ,patient
his dad ,patient
I can't think of what that's called ,patient
um wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all ,patient
who would be uh just a lovely like a girl ,patient
and so they have  have this like  this like ball ,patient
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that um Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that you_know ,patient
but they showed that the other two stepmothers ,patient
and that their mom ,patient
and they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen ,patient
woo this is hard ,patient
but the um mom realizes ,patient
 uhoh better not have with Cinderella because it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen ,patient
so  Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready ,patient
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little uh animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful ,patient
so  they made is  made her beautiful thing ,patient
but then the stepmother got where she  she  she couldn't go ,patient
and so then Cinderella was really crying ,patient
as I remember that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken ,patient
and you_know how could they not even let me do anything ,patient
and then there's s fairy godmother person pops out_of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be uh driven ,patient
she gets there ,patient
and she can dance ,patient
and he sees her and wants to dance with her ,patient
and uh he's captivated by her ,patient
and um all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes oh_no it's by this  i midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back ,patient
so  Cinderella gets home ,patient
and she's still kinda happy ,patient
um which is  I thought that was always amazing ,patient
she was still  she just happy a and so honest about ,patient
 wow I got to actually do something like that ,patient
and she thinks that's the end that would ever be ,patient
but she was still happy ,patient
and so then with the prince he is like ,patient
 I hafta find out who  who  who that  who that was ,patient
which I  I wouldn't really blame him ,patient
of_course he's gonna wanna meet her ,patient
and goes he wants to  he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her ,patient
so  um he hasta go  has a decree I guess that popped in  decree to every single unmarried person ,patient
hasta be  uh figure out who that was because ,patient
oh  yeah  I forgot when  when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things ,patient
I can't think what it's called ,patient
behind your foot thing ,patient
uh so  they know that if they can go to each person they'll find out who that was  h who that fits ,patient
so  th they go ,patient
and at the end Cinderella  it's obvious that she's the  the correct one ,patient
so  they get married ,patient
and then she's happily ever after ,patient
that's it ,patient
my  my brain is like ,patient
 whew that's a_lot_of thought ,patient
okay ,patient
um take  take my peanut butter ,patient
hafta open it ,patient
take it out ,patient
probably get  wanna get like not just like one but get  uh get two ,patient
lay them down ,patient
grab uh something to go under thing uh ,patient
I can't think how to call it ,patient
under the jelly ,patient
and go in there ,patient
and take one and put it around the peanut butter ,patient
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three three or four ,patient
and that's how I would say ,patient
I don't know what to call that  sorry ,patient
