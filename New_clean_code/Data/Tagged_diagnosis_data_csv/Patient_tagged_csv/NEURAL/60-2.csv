pretty good ,patient
yes ,patient
no ,patient
um I went to bed on a Monday night ,patient
uh I worked all day ,patient
and I went to sleep ,patient
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back,patient
about uh one o'clock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to,patient
and uh that's typical for me ,patient
and uh I had trouble getting the covers off ,patient
uh I was laying on my left side ,patient
uh I remember that because uh I had right side weakness ,patient
and the blankets just felt really heavy ,patient
and uh so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket ,patient
as  uh it was like they were full of bricks or something ,patient
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it ,patient
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the,patient
I was exhausted ,patient
and uh so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed ,patient
and uh I laid there for about a half an hour ,patient
and um I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down,patient
and then I got up and uh thought ,patient
 I'll try again ,patient
but as soon as I stood up I realized ,patient
 no I'm still just too tired ,patient
so  I crawled back in bed ,patient
and uh about uh seven thirty or eight o'clock I'd decided to,patient
I  my boss was a creep ,patient
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible ,patient
and so  but this guy was uh kind_of uh the boss's pet ,patient
and uh so I thought ,patient
 I'd  I'll just call him ,patient
and uh when I used my cellphone ,patient
I had that guy's cellphone number and desk number ,patient
but I thought sure I selected the desk number because I was,patient
but I thought ,patient
 I'll just leave him a message ,patient
well  he answered the phone ,patient
and  uh so it hadta be before eight o'clock because I was,patient
and I said to him ,patient
 FirstnameB  uh you're at work already ,patient
and he said ,patient
 no you called me on my cellphone ,patient
 well  what's up ,patient
and I said ,patient
 well  um my  my brain's not working right today ,patient
 so  I'm not gonna come in ,patient
and uh I chose those words carefully ,patient
I didn't want them to know there was a health issue ,patient
um but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not,patient
and I certainly needed to make that call ,patient
and uh so uh he took it as uh humorous ,patient
and I was fine with that ,patient
that was kind_of why I said it the way I did ,patient
um and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that,patient
he said ,patient
 I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me ,patient
and I said ,patient
 no  FirstnameB ,patient
 I wasn't trying to tell you anything ,patient
 I was  I was not  this was not a call for help ,patient
 uh I already had in my mind what I was gonna do ,patient
 but I just needed to let you guys I  know I wasn't gonna be,patient
and uh so he was real relieved to hear that ,patient
and uh so I felt bad when he said that ,patient
I was like ,patient
 oh_gosh the guilt this guy's carrying around for nothing,patient
and uh anyway  so  um I called either before him or,patient
and uh I never call him ,patient
we've been going together for about six years ,patient
and I  for me to call him is  that's a big deal because,patient
and  uh but I called him that morning ,patient
and he picked up ,patient
and um I told him  I said ,patient
 something's wrong ,patient
 um my brain's not operating right ,patient
 I'm not sure what's wrong ,patient
 but something's wrong ,patient
and uh he  I think he suggested I go to the hospital or see a,patient
or uh he might even try to help work it through and try to figure,patient
um finally I said ,patient
 tell you what ,patient
 um let's just see how I'm doing ,patient
 I'll call you back in a half an hour ,patient
and if I don't then uh I think I said ,patient
 call for an ambulance or help ,patient
I don't remember what I did ,patient
but there was some kind of a plan if I didn't  he didn't hear,patient
and uh so um I think before I called him back I decided ,patient
 let me call my nextdoor neighbor and ask her to take me ,patient
and I didn't want to freak her out ,patient
so  I didn't wanna say hospital or emergency ,patient
so  I just said ,patient
 uh something's not right with me ,patient
 and so I need to see a doctor ,patient
 and I should probably see somebody pretty soon ,patient
and uh so she said ,patient
 okay I'll be over in about ten minutes ,patient
and I said ,patient
 that's fine ,patient
and so I called him and told him you_know I was gonna go uh to,patient
so  um later he told me that he almost uh called an ambulance,patient
but he  he's the kind of person he's afraid to make a mistake ,patient
I'm sure there's some  some psychology there to  to delve in,patient
but  uh but uh I told him  I said ,patient
 if you make a mistake because you love me and you're trying to,patient
uh maybe initially I might be not happy with you for making that,patient
but later I would understand that you did it out_of love ,patient
so  it's okay ,patient
so um anyway  so then uh my neighbor came over ,patient
and I wasn't dressed yet ,patient
and uh so I was in my bedroom getting dressed ,patient
and um I don't remember taking a long time to get dressed or,patient
I wasn't experiencing the exhaustion anymore ,patient
and  um but I noticed at one point she came around the corner,patient
and  uh so then  but I finished getting dressed ,patient
and just  uh I kind_of planned out some things to do to,patient
if I made sure I'd let the dog out and let her back in ,patient
and uh I grabbed my purse and my phone ,patient
and uh kinda made a mental note ,patient
yes  I've got my health insurance card ,patient
I've got money ,patient
uh got my driver's license ,patient
I'm good to go ,patient
and then we went out the door and um or  I went out the,patient
she said ,patient
 I'll tell you what ,patient
 I'll go get my car and bring it to you ,patient
because she's just next door ,patient
but I think she afraid for me to walk ,patient
so  she was in my driveway ,patient
and I'm coming out the door ,patient
and I've got a deadbolt and a knob lock ,patient
and I  n uh the dog is in ,patient
and I'm trying to lock the door and xxx the knob ,patient
I could feel it ,patient
and it's right ,patient
but I'm sitting here looking with my keys ,patient
and they weren't fitting ,patient
so  I was having trouble ,patient
I don't carry a_lot_of keys on my ring ,patient
but I couldn't figure out which key went into the lock ,patient
uh so  finally I thought ,patient
 well  I got the  the knob locked ,patient
 it's good enough ,patient
and we  when we went down the road I don't remember who or,patient
but I think I went to the best possible one ,patient
um and when we got there  um it was like uh four of,patient
we call this hospital row ,patient
so  um my street is always the first in the city to get paved ,patient
well  maybe the governor's and then mine ,patient
so  um then she didn't understand where to go exactly ,patient
she  I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didn't,patient
and I saw the red lettering ,patient
and I couldn't read it ,patient
uh that was so significant to me because I remember I could not,patient
I knew what the word was ,patient
but I couldn't s say it to  to save my life ,patient
um but  well  I could say it ,patient
I just couldn't read it ,patient
and uh so I pointed ,patient
and I said ,patient
 emergency ,patient
and so I wasn't reading it you_know ,patient
it was like ,patient
 it's red ,patient
 and I just know what that word was because it's red ,patient
and uh so we got to the entrance ,patient
and there was like uh I wanna say  a canopy but not,patient
um and I caught the eye of a policeman that was uh sitting or,patient
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the,patient
and uh I waved at him and motioned for him to come ,patient
and he did ,patient
and I told him ,patient
 uh I think I've had a stroke ,patient
and I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility ,patient
don't even remember ,patient
but  but  uh and I said ,patient
 but I'm afraid to walk ,patient
and I was walking fine ,patient
but I just never had a stroke before ,patient
so  I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now ,patient
and all_of_a_sudden I can't you_know ,patient
I didn't know ,patient
so  I was afraid to walk ,patient
and uh so he said ,patient
 hold on ,patient
 I'm gonna get someone ,patient
and a nurse came out real fast ,patient
and uh she brought out uh ,patient
she came out first ,patient
and then uh I told the same thing to her ,patient
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair ,patient
I think it was just inside the door ,patient
then  so  she got me in the wheelchair ,patient
and we went in ,patient
and uh I remember looking at the people in the waiting room ,patient
it was pretty full ,patient
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of,patient
and I almost wanted to say ,patient
 sorry  but I think I had a stroke ,patient
but uh you_know just not appropriate to really say anything ,patient
I just felt bad ,patient
and uh so then uh the intake person wanted my health insurance,patient
so  I gave her that ,patient
and uh th she asked me ,patient
 am I on any medications ,patient
and I remembered uh the uh Metformin ,patient
but I called it Glucophage ,patient
I think Glucophage is  I think that's the name brand for it ,patient
but I couldn't think of Metformin ,patient
and uh there were a_lot_of uh supplements I useta take and uh,patient
but I couldn't remember the name of them for the life of me ,patient
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if,patient
and  uh but I just  uh was just uh struggling ,patient
I couldn't remember um the name of them ,patient
and I  it surprised me that I couldn't remember them ,patient
and uh then uh I got put in a room right away and just waited,patient
and that same nurse came back ,patient
and she asked me ,patient
 has anyone been in here yet ,patient
and I said ,patient
 no ,patient
but I didn't think a long time had passed ,patient
um and so she was a_little irritated with that and went back and,patient
and they were back there very quickly ,patient
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do ,patient
and um they had one test where they were gonna need to put me,patient
uh they're trying to find uh the origin of the stroke ,patient
I think at this point they know what happened ,patient
they just can't figure out ,patient
 well  how_come  why ,patient
and they never figured it out ,patient
um but  uh so  they put me to sleep for that ,patient
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to,patient
I don't like to be put under ,patient
I like to know what's going on ,patient
and uh then they're gonna put this thing down my throat ,patient
and I know that there is the possibility ,patient
it's so slim ,patient
but possibility that um something could go wrong there ,patient
or would  some permanent damage could happen ,patient
so  I  I was pretty freaked out about it ,patient
but I thought I  I  I gotta submit to this ,patient
so  they did that ,patient
and  um and when they did either a c_t scan or the m_r_i ,patient
I don't remember which when they ,patient
I've had those done before uh not on the brain though ,patient
um and they told me it was really important that I  s that,patient
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it,patient
 I want them to get the best possible image of my brain right now,patient
so  I'm not gonna flinch ,patient
and so anyway then  then began nine days of in hospital stay ,patient
okay ,patient
um a speech uh therapist told me either that day or the next,patient
and uh for a moment I thought ,patient
 you're making that up ,patient
 it's  never heard of fu such a word ,patient
and uh then she explained what it was ,patient
I was like ,patient
 huh  well  okay  I guess it explains why I'm struggling here,patient
um and uh so while I was in the hospital she provided a_lot_of,patient
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next ,patient
and uh it was like really important to me ,patient
I was just super motivated ,patient
and  um and then when I was released it was gonna be a month,patient
and so I contacted her again ,patient
and I said ,patient
 uh can you email me some stuff because I just ,patient
 okay  so  I can't see anybody for a month ,patient
 but I don't wanna let up here ,patient
and uh so she um sent me a_lot ,patient
and um she  just like in the hospital she was willing to send,patient
and I was so thankful for that ,patient
and uh so I just worked on it ,patient
and then  and so I'm not in the hospital ,patient
so  I didn't give it to her to check it now ,patient
I just figured ,patient
 it's not right ,patient
 but  but it's stuff to keep doing ,patient
and um I got adult coloring books uh because_of a high fine,patient
and uh I went to a teacher supply store and uh got some kids',patient
that's where I estimated my level was at at the time ,patient
and so  um because when I looked at higher grades like,patient
 I can't begin to even do this stuff ,patient
but third or fourth it was like ,patient
 okay this is a little bit of a reach for me ,patient
 let me start here ,patient
and uh so I did that ,patient
and um I got puzzle books for kids um to do ,patient
and so I did those ,patient
and um I always did like to cook before ,patient
but now I had a um special interest in cooking healthy food ,patient
and I want it to be food that tasted good ,patient
and uh so um I got some healthy uh recipes ,patient
and uh worked on those ,patient
and I s s was surprised to see that I struggled with um uh,patient
like a jar of garlic ,patient
half a teaspoon is one clove ,patient
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that ,patient
I was like ,patient
and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon ,patient
so  I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work ,patient
um and uh so  and I learned to highlight in the cookbook,patient
uh everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would,patient
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would,patient
and  um and uh so I did really well with the cooking ,patient
and uh just as time went on uh it was no longer a struggle ,patient
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like,patient
I never did figure it out ,patient
but I was like ,patient
 you know what ,patient
 don't worry about it ,patient
 I'm tired ,patient
 and hey I'll figure it out another time ,patient
but um I went to therapy ,patient
and I went to two different therapists ,patient
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I,patient
and so I thought ,patient
 well  I'm gonna just go whole hog on this and get as much,patient
so  both therapists would see me twice a week ,patient
and uh so  um and there was uh two different locations,patient
and uh so I  I went to them ,patient
and it was uh exhausting ,patient
um I went back to work at about seven  eight  seven weeks,patient
and uh it took me eight weeks ,patient
but I took seven off ,patient
um and uh so you_know I was leaving work to go to therapy ,patient
or I would go um ,patient
no  I didn't do it xxx ,patient
I would  did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the,patient
and my employer bless his heart said ,patient
 you're  you're gonna have to make up any time you miss for,patient
and I thought ,patient
 you're full of crap ,patient
 uh you_know this is uh too many hours in a week you_know in,patient
I can't  I was exhausted as it was ,patient
and I was like ,patient
 there's no way ,patient
but I just agreed to it ,patient
I know he didn't have time to check up on me ,patient
so  I said ,patient
 okay ,patient
so  um uh so  then I just uh did all this therapy ,patient
and my  um there was one uh therapist ,patient
well  first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was,patient
and I think I'd been seeing her for maybe you_know two weeks to a,patient
and um when she was there one evening she recognized me ,patient
and she called me by name ,patient
and I just politely acknowledged her ,patient
but I had no clue who she was ,patient
um and now I've learned that uh since my stroke there's some,patient
um now if the person has something very different about them I'll,patient
um you_know somebody's got a huge nose or a big old wart at the,patient
just uh something that would uh make me remember them uh then,patient
but just uh yeah it's very easy for me to forget uh who I just,patient
and so I remember uh her s pointing that out at the next,patient
she says ,patient
 you didn't know who I was  did you ,patient
and I said ,patient
 honestly no  I had no clue who was talking to me until you told,patient
and uh so  but anyway uh she worked with me for maybe two,patient
and then she moved ,patient
and then  so another person took her place ,patient
and um wasn't real crazy about that person ,patient
um but  um and in hindsight she probably didn't do anything,patient
it was just  I was just struggling with my confidence,patient
um and it  but then I went to another therapist ,patient
um and that lady was young ,patient
and she was very um upbeat and very positive and uh encouraging,patient
and so um that was helpful to me ,patient
and so we did a_lot_of uh focusing on uh short term memory and,patient
I did that with her ,patient
um she taught me some card tricks to do that I've since,patient
um like uh five and two ,patient
I don't remember what it was ,patient
but anyway  so  I was uh practicing with my cards on my,patient
and um uh she didn't give me homework ,patient
uh neither one of them did because I worked ,patient
and uh they felt like ,patient
 you  you got enough going with coming to therapy and work ,patient
 I don't feel like you needta have homework too ,patient
and I was actually kind_of relieved because I was just  I,patient
the fatigue was k just crazy ,patient
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because uh I,patient
and uh so um think I just about covered it ,patient
hm uh something important that happened to me ,patient
um my grandbabies ,patient
uh my daughter and I we struggled a_lot in her teen years ,patient
and uh she met this uh guy when she was uh thirteen or,patient
and uh you_know when I first met him I'm just seeing this skinny,patient
and I'm thinking ,patient
 he's like  I  this is the last thing I want around my,patient
 I got enough trouble with her ,patient
and  uh well  anyway uh they eventually got married ,patient
and then  uh but she was determined she didn't want any,patient
she was so sure she would screw them up ,patient
and uh it's just too hard ,patient
and so me and my husband we'll just  you_know we'll just see,patient
and they did ,patient
they did a_lot_of traveling and everything ,patient
and  um and I had a  dis and I have a son too ,patient
but he didn't seem to have any uh interest in getting married or,patient
and so I just thought ,patient
 I sure would love them ,patient
 but if not then okay ,patient
so  I just worked in the church nursery and  and kinda helped,patient
and uh then uh my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida ,patient
and um by this time you_know I realized uh through some,patient
and I was always super protective of my kids ,patient
uh uh and I realized he was just as protective of her if not,patient
and so I thought ,patient
 he's gonna cart her off to Florida ,patient
 and I don't want her to be so far ,patient
 but at least I won't worry about her because he would die for,patient
and uh so um then uh I don't remember how long they'd been,patient
maybe a year or so ,patient
and uh she  uh she came back to town ,patient
and a relative on his side had a baby ,patient
and she wanted to hold that baby ,patient
and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby ,patient
and she just  whenever I took a picture of her with that baby,patient
and I thought ,patient
 she just looks so natural with that baby ,patient
 like she's held him all her life ,patient
and uh she told me ,patient
 I really want one now ,patient
and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing,patient
she lost uh two or three ,patient
and um then when she had this one um ,patient
and uh maybe about six months in uh I'm in Indiana ,patient
and she's in Florida ,patient
and I'm nesting ,patient
and then my house is reasonably clean anyway ,patient
but  uh but I cleaned my whole living room once ,patient
and I just said  you_know it  it had been a recently,patient
uh and uh so there wasn't a_lot_of junk in there ,patient
but I started uh pulling uh items out and going through them ,patient
and I uh cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows ,patient
and just you_know every crevice I cleaned in that living room ,patient
and I asked her  I said ,patient
 are you going through nesting ,patient
and she said ,patient
 no ,patient
and I said ,patient
 well  okay  well  I'm doing it for both of us because,patient
but once I sɛltu ,patient
I don't remember exactly which room it was ,patient
it might've been my bedroom ,patient
I don't remember ,patient
but anyway then when uh the baby was here um he had uh some,patient
uh I don't remember what it was ,patient
but it  uh it was  they wanted him to be in the uh not,patient
intensive care ,patient
they wanted him there  NICU  I guess ,patient
and so he was there for uh a few days ,patient
but my daughter called me ,patient
and she said  um told me what was going on ,patient
and uh I was  she said ,patient
 you_know we're  h we're  we're okay you_know ,patient
but I could tell her voice ,patient
she was scared ,patient
and I wasn't really worried so much for the baby because what she,patient
 you_know I don't want anything to happen to him ,patient
 but I think he's okay ,patient
but I was really frightened for her ,patient
just her uh mental her emotional being  wellbeing ,patient
and um after that phone call I hop on the airplane ,patient
I hadta be with her ,patient
I was compelled to be with her ,patient
and uh I show up in that hospital ,patient
and she was just shocked to see me ,patient
like I was the last person in the world she expected to see ,patient
and I remember thinking ,patient
 how could you not know I'd be here ,patient
and uh so anyway I  I saw the baby ,patient
and uh uh couldn't touch him ,patient
uh and that was okay ,patient
um but I took a couple of pictures of him ,patient
and um then I came back home shortly after that ,patient
and later I learned that she thought I was coming to see the baby ,patient
and she was kinda mad because she wanted to um decide when she,patient
and uh she thought that's why I got on a plane like I did to try,patient
and I just explained to her that I said ,patient
 honey  I couldn't help myself ,patient
and I said ,patient
 it wasn't to see the baby ,patient
 yes  I was glad to see him ,patient
 he's a beautiful baby ,patient
 and I just uh look forward to many many years with him ,patient
but I said ,patient
 it was you ,patient
and uh s I think she uh was taken back by that ,patient
and I said ,patient
 someday you'll understand ,patient
and I said ,patient
 your heart just tugs you sometimes ,patient
 and you just gotta act on it ,patient
 you can't just sit back and just wait ,patient
and uh so um anyway  but that little guy he's uh so,patient
and uh he  um as I listen to him and his language,patient
 gosh that's  that's uh like my progression ,patient
it was really interesting ,patient
and uh s he's uh almost four now ,patient
but when he was about two he  s he loved dinosaurs ,patient
I think he still kinda likes them ,patient
but I kinda feel like he's maybe sorta outgrown them ,patient
and he's onto other things ,patient
but I was making him videos and  uh because I didn't feel,patient
but this little guy he doesn't know what normal sounds like ,patient
and so I made him these goofy little videos with these little,patient
and they would get into trouble you_know ,patient
and I had a box of toys here for him ,patient
and  and so I had a dinosaur ,patient
I'd  we'd call them saursq because that's why he called them,patient
and I put a  dino a saur ,patient
and I put a saur ,patient
and it was just  and so I would uh make sill ,patient
and I would tell him ,patient
 you're gonna hafta come and see granny ,patient
 help me with these saurs ,patient
 they're out_of control ,patient
 they're  they're into my computer ,patient
 and they're gonna mess up my work ,patient
 and they're into my re freezer ,patient
 and I'm not gonna be able to cook because they're messing with,patient
and he thought those little  stupid little videos ,patient
maybe two minutes long each ,patient
he thought those were hilarious ,patient
and he would watch them over and over and over and over again,patient
you_know they just  a hundred times you_know ,patient
and then  and then uh his uh baby brother came along ,patient
uh and I think there's a two years difference ,patient
yeah two years ,patient
and so the baby um he's uh just uh cute as he can be ,patient
and so he's right about almost two ,patient
and um so much difference between the two and their personalities,patient
and  uh uh but the  the first one he's uh super smart,patient
he's also very manipulative you_know ,patient
and  and uh so he  he works that cuteness angle you_know ,patient
and uh then uh the second one he was a_lot more agreeable ,patient
and he was plenty smart ,patient
but I could tell not to the level his brother is you_know ,patient
it's like he didn't get stuff quite as quickly as like ,patient
you  you hadta work with him awhile ,patient
and  but  but then he'd get it ,patient
he was fine ,patient
um I think he just likes to analyze maybe more you_know and just,patient
so  the second one um just uh super long eyelashes ,patient
so  any girl would love to have and just as  just as cute as,patient
and um I went to go see them um last Thanksgiving I think it,patient
it was last Christmas ,patient
I went to go see them Christmas ,patient
and um I facetime with them a_lot ,patient
and so the older one he's thrilled to see me ,patient
and he just runs to me and you_know says granny you_know and wants,patient
but the baby even_though he'd seen my face a_lot on the screen ,patient
and he  of_course I'd seen him in person too but not real often,patient
it took him a minute ,patient
and he had to watch his older brother ,patient
like I guess it's okay to go sit near her ,patient
it was like  it seemed like uh at some point uh a light,patient
and he was like ,patient
 she's fine ,patient
so  then had both on my lap ,patient
and they just  for about an hour or two I was enjoying,patient
it was just  it was uh just so cool ,patient
so  I  yeah I always heard how f much fun grandbabies are ,patient
but um oh_my_gosh instant celebrity is so much fun laughs ,patient
so  that's the  probably about the best thing that's ever,patient
okay ,patient
uh there's a boy outside ,patient
he's kicking a soccer ball up in the air ,patient
and um the ball winds up inside of a  shattering somebody's,patient
and the ball lands inside this man's house ,patient
and this man is just sitting on a couch and um was surprised to,patient
and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over,patient
and uh so the man picks up the ball and uh looks out the window,patient
okay ,patient
um there's a little boy ,patient
and uh mom is uh strongly advising him to take this umbrella,patient
and uh he is uh not open to that advice ,patient
and uh so he leaves without it ,patient
and uh he waves goodbye to his mom ,patient
and she's still got that umbrella in hand and uh asking him to,patient
but no he's good while he  uh he gets outside ,patient
and it's raining he's noticing ,patient
and  uh and not only is it raining it's becoming t this,patient
and he's walking through puddles ,patient
and he's trying to keep his head dry um with just his hands ,patient
and he gets to the house ,patient
and he sees his mother with this uh I told you so attitude ,patient
and uh she's looking at him where he is drenched ,patient
and  um but the next scene is he's going on his way in the,patient
but this time he's got the umbrella ,patient
and it's open and is keeping him dry ,patient
okay ,patient
um this little girl has a cat ,patient
and the cat is on a tree and the branch ,patient
and the little girl can't reach it ,patient
