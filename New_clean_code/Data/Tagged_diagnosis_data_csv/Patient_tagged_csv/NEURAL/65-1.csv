seems to be adequate ,patient
the eighty four incident last I remember is five days before that ,patient
let's see ,patient
it happened on a Thursday March the eighth of eight four ,patient
I remember we were at some friends' house having supper the previous Saturday night ,patient
and I remember nothing  nothing after that until  until  until after outta i_c_u and started  re started remembering things slowly about uh three days after I was moved out  moved out_of i_c_u ,patient
and the  the  the eight  nineteen ninety uh ,patient
let's see the ,patient
uh I was crossing tenth street Indianapolis ,patient
and I remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk ,patient
crossing with the light and seeing  getting up close in the quarter panel on the car going from west to east ,patient
and then I have the sensation being spun around ,patient
that's the last  last I remember thing from  last thing I remember for probably I don't know twenty  twenty minutes or so ,patient
eighty four  INV,patient
okay ,patient
it was very  that was really troubling uh because  uh really troubling because um didn't know where I was ,patient
and there were visitors in the hospital room  in  in my hospital room ,patient
and these guys were saying  the  the  z the visit ,patient
I  I knew who they were  knew  knew these  these people ,patient
but there's a_lots  lots_of them there ,patient
I didn't know where I was ,patient
there were lots_of  pe there were several people visiting me ,patient
and  and there uh several of them asked ,patient
 well  when  when is his voice gonna come back ,patient
 when is his voice gonna come back ,patient
I thought was perfectly fine ,patient
uh and  but what I didn't know uh was that the  I'd spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat uh in a  in a coma ,patient
and  and it looked like I wasn't gonna come out anytime soon ,patient
they gave me a tracheotomy ,patient
uh and  uh I  and so the  the  s what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords uh changed my voice pretty radically where  where my wife had  had told me ,patient
she said  she said that the  uh uh said that you  you  you had the ,patient
so  I said ,patient
 actually there it  there it was ,patient
 the one thing she liked about me ,patient
 and that was gone ,patient
uh s uh so  but that was  that was extraordinarily troubling because I  d I  like I said didn't know where I was ,patient
my  and people I rec recognize  it's  recognize saying ,patient
 when does  when does voice gonna come back ,patient
and it was rea really really troubling to me ,patient
really troubling ,patient
that was  that was one of the first of my  mem first of my memories ,patient
well  it's  what  what it ended up being was that the  the uh ,patient
in terms of my brain injury if you will uh certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling ,patient
um um and you_know just when  when  when I happen to get  get focus on something I didn't par particularly understand or  or  or approve of I get  get or  it  it didn't show up ,patient
but it was xxx extraordinarily angry ,patient
and did  never did lash  did  never did lash out ,patient
uh but just but real  really angry ,patient
and  and I kept it all internal ,patient
it was very  very  very troubling really troubling for a  lon for  for quite a while ,patient
and  and  and  and I don't want you to ever to relate to that ,patient
I wouldn't  w I wouldn't wish that in  I wouldn't  wouldn't wish that on anybody ,patient
the  almost  nine  uh nineteen ninety was almost a what ,patient
again ,patient
th that's always say ,patient
it was like just  just a  just a  just a rerun but not near  not nearly as severe ,patient
but the  the eighty four incident was  uh uh was  was most interesting because  because uh uh an engineer for my  the company that I was employed by uh uh ,patient
I was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning I had a wonderful career ahead of me ,patient
was gonna go far in the organization ,patient
and  and  uh and my  one of my supervisors told me ,patient
and he wasn't supposed to do this ,patient
told me  told me I was  I was on the highpotnn list which meant again in my  I was going far ,patient
my career was laid out in front of me ,patient
uh there was  there was nothing stopping me ,patient
and then uh after the eighty four incident a personality change which I find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn ,patient
which I find out twenty years later is endemic ,patient
uh and the  uh and  and I sound different ,patient
uh I was slower to comprehend things ,patient
uh but finally did after bit  taking  taking more time would comprehend things ,patient
and  and  uh uh and  and I couldn't do my engineering job to  to  to suit me ,patient
and I didn't  didn't tell anybody that ,patient
I didn't tell anybody that ,patient
tried  I faked it ,patient
I faked it and spent my lunch hours for months I was um by myself in a  in a conference room uh relearning aspects of my job and not telling a  not telling a soul because I just knew ,patient
this was before  before eighty eight ,patient
nineteen eight  nineteen eighty four again ,patient
actually before the American of Disabilities Act ,patient
eighty eight ,patient
and  and I was on  on the accident in eighty four ,patient
I was on company business ,patient
and I knew  I  I just knew that  that uh mɑtu ,patient
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired ,patient
I knew I was ,patient
had three kids a wife and spouse uh just a l lovely  lovely  lovely  lovely woman uh there at home with the three kids ,patient
and I was the  f I was  I was the income ,patient
and I couldn't  I couldn't stand the thought of being fired ,patient
uh and  and so like I say  like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job ,patient
and it took me  but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that  that uh I was no longer on  on the fast track ,patient
no  no  no longer ,patient
it took  I wasn't  it wasn't obvious at first ,patient
but I  I was no longer on the fast track ,patient
and  and  uh uh and the b b biggest most difficult part of that was the  was the short term memory  just short term memory difficulties ,patient
uh and so uh I ended up with uh a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my  help my short term memory ,patient
uh so  it was  it was uh uh uh uh largely the  the um aphasia and  and people seeing me differently at work ,patient
and of_course I'm  of_course I look on back  look back  look back on it a few years after that ,patient
and  and I did not deserve a  to be on the fast track ,patient
I  it  wa it  it  it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me ,patient
but it wasn't obvious to me ,patient
uh and that the uh writing everything down was  was uh the biggest  uh as uh biggest assistant  as assis assistant  assistance to me that uh helped  helped me do my job ,patient
the  basically it was being the  the  the ,patient
I  I  I call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident ,patient
uh that's  that's how my  my  my life has been defined ,patient
uh and uh I  it's  I just  it  um that  that  that is  that is what I call my  my  my defining moment the  the  the  the defining event ,patient
because I've struggled with the  the uh aphasia obviously and memory issues uh ever since then ,patient
and  and  uh uh and  and  uh I_mean like for example uh the  the  um the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was out_of engineering school at Purdue ,patient
had a job in Indianapolis ,patient
and so uh the  ec as economic viability I  I  I paid rent to my folks  lived in the  lived in their house ,patient
and that winter my dad and I put the  uh put an Oldmobile vl eight in a Chevrolet Vega a little small car ,patient
a and uh it was quite an interesting  interesting project ,patient
and  and in interestingly enough I can probably ,patient
the  the  the engine had a Rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties ,patient
and I could probably still today ,patient
now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven ,patient
I could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded ,patient
and  but  but  but I  prob but I could  ask me what I had for supper last night head,patient
can't tell ya ,patient
so  yup ,patient
short  short term memory issues ,patient
but  uh but then things from  from  from long ago  and uh do  uh do  uh do  do som something long ago I  c I can  I can reconstruct like it was yesterday ,patient
uh no  actually I was  uh I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering ,patient
uh and  and I got out_of school the spring of seventy six ,patient
had a job at a company named Shwitzer ,patient
uh they're in Indianapolis ,patient
and Shwitzer no  sh Shwitzer no longer exists ,patient
but uh I was in engine cooling engineering at  at coughs with uh Shwitzer ,patient
and so  so uh I  uh my  my customers were we'll  we'll call it  for engine cooling fans for Shwitzer were uh Ford light truck  Ford heavy truck ,patient
uh uh the Ford  uh one of the small Ford Pats cars had uh a Cadillac excuse_me  Pontiac ,patient
um and the uh uh Chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers ,patient
so  I was already doing that kind of stuff as my  as  as a job ,patient
but then uh my  my father found this  uh this article on engine conversion on the Chevrolet Vega ,patient
uh and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and I to  to  to build together that winter uh while  while  uh while I was working the automotive industry's field ,patient
and  and uh it  uh um it  xxx it's kinda how I  hap kinda how I gravitated ,patient
well  it was  it was real  it was a real sleeper ,patient
meaning that  uh the  the hot car at the time was the  the Datsun two forty zl ,patient
uh it was a real  it was uh the first of the t Datsun uh uh zl cars ,patient
uh and  and uh uh I useta uh from a stoplight dust those guys off ,patient
and they couldn't  they  and those  the  the other guys the drivers of Datsun's zl cars couldn't figure out how in the hell this Vega beat the shit out_of them ,patient
it was  it was  it was  it was  it was a_lot_of fun seeing looks in their faces as it  in my rearview mirror ,patient
uh okay ,patient
this story is there's a  a  a young lad ,patient
looks like uh uh maybe  maybe teenager like a sixth grader or seventh grader kicking a soccer ball ,patient
and then  and here it kick xxx puts the soccer ball through a  through a  a house's window ,patient
and the soccer ball comes through the house's window and  and lands on a  on a  a  on a  an adult male  uh male's lap in the house ,patient
and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the  through the hole in the window and says  trying to figure out what's going on ,patient
and done ,patient
uh looks like a  a  a  a young  a young boy is leaving ,patient
and his  his  we're gonna say it was mother says ,patient
 he here's  here's your umbrella ,patient
uh and he says ,patient
 no  I don't need that ,patient
uh and then  then he  he  he  he leaves saying goodbye and everythings ,patient
and the mom holding the umbrella ,patient
and the  the  the young lad is out and about walking around ,patient
and it starts to rain ,patient
then it starts to rain heavier ,patient
and he's running ,patient
and he gets back to his  to his mom so soaking wet ,patient
and he's not happy ,patient
nor  neither is she happy ,patient
and then he goes out finally with a  with an umbrella ,patient
and  and  and uh it looks like all is well ,patient
well  the beginning it looks like a cat  a pet cat had climbed up a tree ,patient
uh and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree ,patient
got stuck up in the tree ,patient
uh a little girl who was probably her owner uh rode over there on her tricycle uh and  and c wants her cat down ,patient
and looks like uh an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is  and is  and is  and is caught up there by this barking dog ,patient
also  and now then there's also a  a  a bird uh on the other side of this tree singing away ,patient
and there's also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the  the cat and the  and the  and the  and the male  f the  uh the male figure ,patient
there's  that's  that's a tree by the dog ,patient
okay ,patient
thank_you ,patient
Cinderella uh was  uh uh her mother passed away ,patient
uh father uh remarried ,patient
and uh uh the  wick there's the  the wicked stepmother had  uh uh brought with her two  two rather mean spirited daughters ,patient
uh and they  and  and in their  in their home life uh the  uh uh Cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which I always say by the  by the stepdaughters ,patient
uh uh and  uh um and so just  uh just worked  worked very  worked a_lot ,patient
uh and then uh in the kingdom the king had a  uh had a  a  a unmarried son ,patient
and one of zɪdvɑɪzu ,patient
uh and the  and so Cinderella uh with the help of  of the um mice and  uh uh there in the  in the  in the  in the house uh they sewed up a  a really lovely gown for Cinderella to go to  uh to wear to this  to wear  to this dance  uh wear  wear to this ball ,patient
and  uh uh and the  s the stepmother uh uh was intent on getting one of her  her  her  her daughters married off uh and  and then so would not allow Cinderella to go to the ball ,patient
uh uh her uh stepsisters went ,patient
and the  uh uh and a  a carriage which looked like a  a pumpkin and then mice who ended up uh turned into horses ,patient
and I think that the  uh the horse from the house ended up as the  as the  the driver of the  s of the  of the pumpkin carriage ,patient
and uh uh she  she  uh she ended up going to the ball ,patient
also um the  the  the prince uh danced the night away with uh Cinderella ,patient
and  but the stipulation uh buh from the  uh Cinderella's fella fair fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight ,patient
so  it was late ,patient
so  she hurried out_of there and left a glass slipper behind ,patient
uh uh and then  uh and then after the  and the  uh after the  the ball was over the  uh the  the  the prince said there was only  only one person interested in ,patient
it was the  the gal that left the  left the glass slipper behind ,patient
uh and  and so the  the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that  that lady who left the glass slipper behind ,patient
uh and  and it was the  it was the one  it was the  it was the  it was the  the lady whose  whose foot would fit this  uh this small  the small glass slipper ,patient
and uh the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper ,patient
Cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper ,patient
and so she was identified as the one that the  that the prince uh uh wanted to  wanted to  uh wanted to marry ,patient
and  and so the  so  then the  the  the  Cinderella married the prince ,patient
and they all lived happily  and they lived happily ever after ,patient
oh  prefer  uh preferably uh uh on  on a wheat bread ,patient
you would use a knife and  and uh get the  spread the  spread the peanut butter on uh one side of the bread ,patient
aha but then the  on the other  s other side of the other  other  other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly ,patient
and then  so  you take a spoon ,patient
not  not knife because uh you  you cut up  you cut up the  the  the  the jelly and the  and the jar ,patient
but  uh but you take your spoon and  and spoon out the  the  the uh uh grape jelly on the other piece of bread ,patient
use that  use the knife to spread out  spread it out ,patient
then  then put the two halves together ,patient
and you got the ultimate  the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
