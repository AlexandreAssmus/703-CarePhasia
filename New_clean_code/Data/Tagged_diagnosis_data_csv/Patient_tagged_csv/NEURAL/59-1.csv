um I think is better than when I had my s stroke because all I could say for like two weeks was no ,patient
so  I think it's gone s better ,patient
yes I do ,patient
okay ,patient
um so  um on the day that I had my stroke in the um æftrununu ,patient
and I thought I was dying really ,patient
so  I went to the  um m the e_r ,patient
and I had um s um s stones kidding ,patient
um I'll tell you I would never want anyone to ever have that ,patient
um so  they gave me some pills and told me just go home ,patient
and it will  pl it will pass ,patient
um and I'm not really good with um pills ,patient
it makes me feel like I'm not in my head ,patient
so  I dʊdu ,patient
and I went to sleep ,patient
um and then probably around like I think it was eight in the iviŋu ,patient
and I was talking to my husband ,patient
and I kind_of felt like I was drunk ,patient
and I thought it was probably because_of the pills ,patient
um and he told me ,patient
 you need to go back to bed ,patient
um so  I went back to bed ,patient
and um probably around eleven um I got up to go to the bathroom ,patient
and I fell ,patient
I was like ,patient
 that's kinda weird ,patient
and I tried to get up ,patient
and um I couldn't ,patient
and um my husband heard me ,patient
he was in the other room ,patient
and um he helped me get up ,patient
and he knew that sʌmpwɪnu ,patient
um I couldn't say anything ,patient
um so  he went ahead and called nineoneone ,patient
and he went outside to um l um make sure that the æməlɪntsu ,patient
and I was on the um bed ,patient
and I was like ,patient
 oh_my_gosh I'm in my p_js ,patient
so  I was trying to goes ,patient
and I fell inside of the closet ,patient
so  when my husband came with everyone they found me in the collet ,patient
and my hʌzəmu ,patient
 really ,patient
and um then I  r they had to take me to Boise ,patient
um so  that's about almost um twenty five miles to get there ,patient
um my husband could not come with be ,patient
um so  um I just r rode with them to the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
and then I got there ,patient
and my sister and um her husband were already there ,patient
and then my husband came later ,patient
and I know that um after that um I was in i_c_u for like a week ,patient
and that was kinda weird because I don't remember a_lot ,patient
but I know that I hadta pass those stupid stones ,patient
and my mom said that I was um streaming ,patient
and then I was  um then after that for a week then I went to another floor ,patient
I can't remember why ,patient
and after that then I went to rehab ,patient
so  and I was there for about six weeks ,patient
so  that's  that was all my fun stuff ,patient
right ,patient
that's  so  that's why I don't do um a_lot_of  I don't do coffee and popn because I would go  on my way to work I would have like two cups of coffee ,patient
and then I would get to work ,patient
and then we'd go  go out and get a coffee ,patient
and then at lunch I would have a popn ,patient
and then after my midizu ,patient
or I would get another coffee ,patient
um it was really bad ,patient
uh I  sighs and I think y that  I think that was why I had the kidney stones ,patient
it was really bad ,patient
I would never want anyone to ever have that ,patient
right INV,patient
right  um so  when uh w I was in the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
and the guy that helped me with that he was just amazing ,patient
you_know I had to figure out to sorry  how to get u up o out_of the chair and get to the wheelchair and then how to get out_of the wheelchair and get in the bed ,patient
um and then he would make me walk with him um because I didn't want to be in the wheelschair ,patient
um and then we did a_lot_of um the walker ,patient
um and then uh after the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
and then  um and then they ga gave me the brace ,patient
um but um th that was after the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
when I was in there I did a_lot with my foot and my h hands um like how to dress yourself with one arm ,patient
just saying that is kinda weird ,patient
um I had to get ,patient
m my hair useta be really long ,patient
and um I had to cut it off so I can do something with uh my hair ,patient
um and to do your makeup with your left hand ,patient
you_know I can't do my um eye liner still ,patient
but that's been um ɪnstrəstɪŋu ,patient
and then I went to speech a_lot too when I was in the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
and then after the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
and that was a_lot ,patient
um I would get home ,patient
and I would just um go to my bed and just sleep because th they had you do a_lot um so you can walk ,patient
and then we did a_lot_of swimming ,patient
that is really goods ,patient
I don't know how sʊu ,patient
like you don't feel like you're like ugh trying to walk ,patient
when you get in the pool you can walk like you used to ,patient
so  I really like to go to the pool ,patient
um and then after that um just I  um the people that helped me with my foot and my leg they gave me a_lot_of exercises ,patient
and I make sure that I do that at home ,patient
and hoʊpəlɪu ,patient
I don't wanna go there right now until I don't know  ənfɪlu ,patient
so ,patient
oh_goodness ,patient
uh well  probably  y probably you_know I love my kɪzu ,patient
they are the joy uh of my life ,patient
um my um son ,patient
um when I met my husband ,patient
um this is a little bit too much ,patient
but I'll tell you anyways ,patient
um when I met him he just got out_of a relationship ,patient
and me and him were deɪfɪŋu ,patient
and this lady said that she was prɛdjɪntu ,patient
and um my husband I ,patient
this was new ,patient
so  it's like ,patient
 we'll see what happens you_know ,patient
and um we just never left each other's side ,patient
and the lady that he was in um um she got ,patient
after she had my son ,patient
because I say my son ,patient
um she got really into drugs really bad ,patient
and um so my husband and I took him when he was probably two months old ,patient
and he's always known me as mom ,patient
and  um and he lived with us ,patient
and he n didn't really see the other mom for awhile ,patient
and when he was seven um I wanted to um ədɑpu ,patient
and it  groans and then the girl wanna come back and make sure she was a mom ,patient
but she really wasn't ,patient
so  we hadta go through all the  um to the course ,patient
and it was a_lot_of cheers ,patient
um and ill ,patient
and then  um and then we were able to ədɑpu ,patient
and we had to go t in front of the dʒʌdzu ,patient
and it was  t even my uh son was so happy ,patient
it was like the best day ever ,patient
and um sometimes he's a little butthead ,patient
but I would never ever do it  anything different ever because_of it's really good for us ,patient
so ,patient
okay  so  there's um a kid again ,patient
um um he's playing soccer ,patient
and it went through a neighbor's window ,patient
um and it's ,patient
oh it goes through the window ,patient
and it breaks a lamp ,patient
and the neighbor has the ball looking outside to see what's going on ,patient
and that's all I have ,patient
okay ,patient
so  um th the mom told the son ,patient
 you probably need to have a ʌmbɚɛləu ,patient
and he was like ,patient
 yeah I don't need it ,patient
 I  I'll be okay ,patient
and um so then the boy went outside ,patient
it was  it was raining ,patient
and then it was really raining ,patient
and he had to turn around and go back to home and tell his mom ,patient
 yeah you're right ,patient
and she went ahead and gave him the ʌnbrɛlələu ,patient
and then he was able to go for a walk just fine ,patient
um okay so um ,patient
okay  I'm gonna say there  this little girl was riding her bike ,patient
and  um and her dog was with her ,patient
and they came across a cat ,patient
and the dog was trying to get the cat ,patient
and it was up in the tree ,patient
and shoe ,patient
and a  um maybe it's a neighbor saw the cat in the tree ,patient
and he tried to put a ladder up so he could get the cat ,patient
and um the ladder fell down ,patient
and he couldn't get the cat ,patient
so  then the fire ,patient
uh wha what are they called ,patient
um firefighters can see it ,patient
so  they came over to get everyone down from the tree um and the cat ,patient
I guess that would be it ,patient
okay sounds good ,patient
um so  there  w y there was a guy um that had a doctor ,patient
and her um mother was um not there any more ,patient
and he wanted her to have a new stepmom ,patient
so  he um married a lady that had two girls already ,patient
and then he died ,patient
and the  s ste the stepmom was not nice ,patient
and she made Cinderella be the um maid ,patient
she would have to make sure that she did the floors and made food and make sure that everything was clean ,patient
um and the s her sɛpsɪstɚzu ,patient
I can't remember their names ,patient
they were not really nice to her either ,patient
so  really all Cinderella had was the ænmɪnəlzu ,patient
they  h she had a  hor a horse  a dog ,patient
and um she had m um mice ,patient
and she would make um clothes for the mice ,patient
and then there was a cat that was her  sut her  s the cat was the stepmom  m,patient
and he was not nice ,patient
so  um one day when ,patient
sorry ,patient
so  that was kind_of about their house ,patient
um there was also a keen ,patient
and he wanted him to get married ,patient
um so  he did a  um wanted to do a ball and to invite everyone in the kingdom ,patient
so  um at sɛndɚɛləzu ,patient
and when they got the invitation Cinderella was like ,patient
 I can go too because I'm a part of the kingdom too ,patient
and her xxx all your chores ,patient
so  she looked at a um book how she wanted to get her dress ,patient
but her sis otr  her stɛpsistɚzu ,patient
so  she can never get her dress done ,patient
so  the mice saw that she would never be able to go because they were making her s do so much ,patient
so  they səsɑɪdɪdu ,patient
why ,patient
there was like some pearls and some ribbon that they took from them because they said they didn't want them ,patient
and they helped sue ,patient
so  when she was  everyone else was ready to go to the ball sɪnɚɛlu ,patient
so  she went to her room ,patient
and she saw the dress that the mice help ,patient
so  she put it on and was running down the stairs ,patient
and her  stes her stɛpsɪsɚu  p,patient
 oh those are are my bees ,patient
 and that's my ribbon ,patient
and they started to tear her dress apart ,patient
so  she couldn't go to the ball ,patient
and she went to the j grɑrdɪnu ,patient
and she was crying ,patient
um then all_of_the_sudden ,patient
and she told her what's going on ,patient
so  she's like ,patient
 oh you hafta go to the ball ,patient
so  they  she took a pʌŋkɪnu ,patient
and then um I think she took the mice and turn ,patient
and then the horse she turn ,patient
oh  what do you call it ,patient
like a person to open the doors for the koʊʃu ,patient
and um then she made Cinderella um a br a beautiful dress and glass slippers ,patient
and she told her everything will be okay until it's midnight ,patient
and then everything will go back to how it was ,patient
so  she went to the ball ,patient
and she met the prɪsu ,patient
and they were dancing the whole time ,patient
and her  se her stepsisters were kind_of jealous ,patient
um and then all_the_suhven ,patient
and it was rinɪŋu ,patient
and she was trying to leave ,patient
and she was going down the stairs ,patient
and she left one of her glass slippers ,patient
and the prince found it ,patient
and um sorry  so sis Cinderella got home ,patient
and um the  fr the prince said whoever fits in the glass slipper he will marry ,patient
so  wʌdu ,patient
