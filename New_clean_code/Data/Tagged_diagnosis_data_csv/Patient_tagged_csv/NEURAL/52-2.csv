it's pretty good ,patient
but it's pretty good ,patient
understandable ,patient
yes I do ,patient
well  no  I don't remember the stroke ,patient
I remember the first one that I had ,patient
and I remember the third one that I had ,patient
I do not remember the second one ,patient
okay uh I can tell you about the first one ,patient
I'll tell you that one ,patient
um the first one um I was home alone ,patient
uh FirstnameS had gone to get her uh hair cut about twenty five miles away ,patient
and I was working here at the house ,patient
I was  uh I was  I was  I'd been working on  uh on doing some carpenter work in the house ,patient
and uh I started to feel  um I started to feel kind_of numb in my right hand ,patient
um I didn't feel too bad ,patient
but I knew from what people had told me what I'd heard uh many times the  one of the signs of a stroke is uh numbness ,patient
in_fact I remember I was  uh uh a fellow that w I used to work with had a stroke at work ,patient
and I remember going through that and um kinda recognize from that how it looked ,patient
um so  I  I  I  I knew what was going on ,patient
I knew I was having a stroke ,patient
um against my  well  I probably  sh I shouldn't have done it ,patient
but I  I called FirstnameS ,patient
and I said ,patient
 uh you prolly ,patient
 um I'm gonna head  I'm gonna go to the hospital ,patient
 I don't feel right now ,patient
 I'm not sure what's going on ,patient
 but I'm  I  you better  y just come on home ,patient
and uh I'd said ,patient
 I'm  I'm gonna start  I'm gonna head to the hospital ,patient
 just come on down there to the emergency room when  when you get here ,patient
so  I  I did ,patient
I went out ,patient
and I got in my truck ,patient
and I headed for the  went to the hospital which isn't very far away ,patient
it's you_know six or eight blocks away from here ,patient
and um I drove to the hospital and uh drove into the emergency room parking and uh walked into the  uh walked into the hospital ,patient
and I said ,patient
 um I'm  I think I'm having a stroke ,patient
and they d you_know didn't waste any time ,patient
said okay ,patient
somebody you_know ,patient
 we're  come on  come on back ,patient
 we'll  we're gonna take you and have someone look at you right away which they did ,patient
they  they took me put me in one of the examination rooms ,patient
and uh they started to examine me ,patient
uh FirstnameS uh she'd  b it was about a half hour away ,patient
so  she got there after this had started that  uh the ex um z questions ,patient
I think I  w I think I  they'd uh already taken me to  uh to get a c_t scan or whatever it was um while  before she got there ,patient
so  they  they when  when  when she got there I was  already had gone in to  uh to get a scan ,patient
and um so when they had  when I was done with that they took me um uh back into the waiting  back into the room where I was  the treatment room whatever you call it at  at their  in their j emergency room ,patient
and um I  I remember pretty well that uh you_know FirstnameS was there ,patient
and  and uh I remembered  I knew what was going on uh I  that I was  that I had a stroke ,patient
but it felt like it was probably  it wasn't getting any worse ,patient
it was just stroke ,patient
uh so  I wasn't too worried about it ,patient
but  and at that time it was only still in my  in my um right arm ,patient
it wad'nt ,patient
I  I could walk  I could walk fine ,patient
there's no  no problem there ,patient
it was uh in my  in my arm that  that was affected ,patient
uh didn't affect my vision or anything like that  that I know of ,patient
uh I was able to drive you_know to the  as I said to the hospital and walk into the hospital and  and  and  and tell them what  what I thought was going on ,patient
so  uh yeah  so  they looked at me ,patient
they  they then they  they  um I was there for awhile in the  in the emergency room ,patient
and then they took me uh and  took  took me to a  um you_know to the um neuro i_c uh uh i_c_u ,patient
yeah i_c_u ,patient
took me to the neuro i_c_u ,patient
and uh you_know then of_course people came in and examined me ,patient
and the doctor came in ,patient
and  um and of_course FirstnameS  FirstnameS was there ,patient
and uh I remember the  remember the room real well ,patient
um I think I was hungry by that time ,patient
uh uh I don't know how far  how much more you want me to talk  to say ,patient
I can  I can go on talk for awhile if you want ,patient
but that's  that pretty much the story of the  of the time as  when I had the stroke ,patient
okay ,patient
uh yes I can ,patient
um my recovery from that initial stoke ,patient
um I went  uh you_know I was in the hospital for about three or four days ,patient
and  uh and then uh I went home ,patient
uh I went home ,patient
and uh we called a  um a neurosurgeon to um take a look at me and so_forth ,patient
but  uh so  um but I went home ,patient
and um I  actually within a few days uh I was  you_know I said ,patient
 FirstnameS  let's  I wanna try driving ,patient
and  and  and so we did ,patient
we  nice cat ,patient
um so  uh we  we went out to the country ,patient
we live in Wichita and went out to the country and  on some of the country road ,patient
and I did a little driving around ,patient
and I felt like I was pretty good you_know ,patient
and then I did that again a_couple more times other days ,patient
and uh it seemed like things were going pretty well ,patient
and then I  and then we  uh we  as I said  w made an appointment to go see the n uh neurosurgeon ,patient
and we went to see the neurosurgeon ,patient
and um uh his name was Doctor LastnameM ,patient
and um he was in a building right there by the hospital ,patient
and um so went to see him and  you_know in his office ,patient
and he  he explained to me what he thought I had ,patient
well  you_know he had seen the  seen the xrays and  and the scans and all that ,patient
so  he knew what was going on you_know ,patient
and he told me what  told me what  what I had ,patient
and it was a  uh it was a um ,patient
see if I can remember the word ,patient
um it's probably gonna get away from me ,patient
it's a ,patient
it's on the tip my tongue ,patient
it's a um ,patient
I don't know if you can  you can help me with this ɑu ,patient
it's a um ,patient
you can't ,patient
I see you're shaking your house ,patient
okay uh I have a hard time some sorta remembering what this was ,patient
it's not a regular stroke ,patient
it's not a regular stroke ,patient
it's  uh it's a uh situation that I've had probably since birth ,patient
and it  the situation is that there is a  um uh a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the um artery ,patient
and instead of going th through the little capillaries and everything it doesn't go through the capillaries ,patient
it goes directly into a  a vein ,patient
so  there's no  no filter there to  to slow it down or  you_know ,patient
and so that  that con ,patient
and it  I said it probably was there from birth ,patient
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure ,patient
and it  it didn't blow ,patient
it just  there was  and it was not a very big  um uh very big spot ,patient
uh maybe size of a quarter that  where it had bled into my brain ,patient
but it stopped bleeding ,patient
it stopped ,patient
and  er and everything was going okay ,patient
it stopped ,patient
and there wasn't really much damage ,patient
so  um so  Doctor LastnameM then said ,patient
 uh we can  we can fix that pretty easily ,patient
 we'll take you and put you in the hospital ,patient
 take four or five days ,patient
 I hafta cut into your  cut into your skull and  uh and go in there ,patient
 and we'll take that  you_know fix that well  uh actually seal it off ,patient
 and  uh and then you'd be goo as good as new you_know ,patient
 it  everything will be okay ,patient
 and uh you'd be in the hospital four or five days ,patient
 and then you'll go home ,patient
 and everything will be fine ,patient
uh so  I went home from that appointment feeling pretty good ,patient
um FirstnameS I guess both felt pretty good ,patient
I continue practicing my driving and so_forth ,patient
and uh I went  uh went back and made an appointment to go into surgery uh on  uh on May the first ,patient
that had it ,patient
I'm sorry ,patient
May the sixth ,patient
that had all happened on April Fools Day on April first of uh two thousand fifteen ,patient
and um so I went in for the surgery on  uh on uh May the sixth of that year two thousand fifteen ,patient
and uh little did I know I wasn't gonna come home for quite awhile ,patient
I wouldn't be home for s another six months ,patient
and in the meantime ,patient
excuse the  uh the French ,patient
the  the shit hit the fan ,patient
and it did big time ,patient
I'm sorry did I  I'm  I don't mean to um offend you ,patient
okay  so  um that was  that was  that was  that was my second stoke ,patient
and um didn't  I  uh then  uh then uh that was  that was ,patient
well  okay  so  what happened was when I went into the hospital then to have the  that surgery that  that  uh that um ,patient
uh t and again it's on the tip my tongue ,patient
that I wanna say what it is ,patient
maybe I'll think of it yeah ,patient
so  when I went in to have that taken care of while I  when I was in the hospital then um they did the surgery ,patient
and the surgery was a suc success ,patient
uh the problem was that when I went back  when  when I was in recovery from that surgery I was in recovery and um ,patient
I'll  l ignore that if you can ,patient
um sorry uh make  make sure it's not ,patient
no  it's not ,patient
okay  no ,patient
um so  um when I ,patient
the  b let it ring a time or two and go  it'll go away ,patient
I'm sorry ,patient
okay  so  I  I  um while I was in recovery um my bla brain for whatever reason ,patient
and not in the area where the surgery was done but in another area far away from the  that spot ,patient
it started bleeding ,patient
and nobody knows why it started bleeding ,patient
but it did ,patient
and uh even_though FirstnameS kept trying to say ,patient
 there's something wrong ,patient
 there's something wrong ,patient
 I know it's something wrong ,patient
uh because I  I  I  I don't remember it of_course ,patient
I d didn't see it ,patient
my  ha my head was very sw fs sw swollen ,patient
and  uh and she could tell that ,patient
you_know they tried to say ,patient
 uh well  he's have ,patient
they  they  they tried to say ,patient
 well  he's having a little stroke and that ,patient
uh not a stroke ,patient
a  um uh having a uh uh ,patient
I cant remember the word now ,patient
he's having a uh um whatever it is that they said ,patient
well  it happens sometimes after surgery ,patient
it's no big deal ,patient
it'll  it  it is go away ,patient
and uh she kept trying to tell them ,patient
 there's something wrong ,patient
 there's something wrong ,patient
 you need to you_know call the doctor ,patient
well they didn't  well  they didn't get hold of the doctor until number of hours later ,patient
that was at one  about one o'clock  one o'clock one thirty when I came back out_of surgery the first time ,patient
and at finally about ten o'clock that evening they took me back into surgery ,patient
and uh you_know by that time they'd had done scans and so_forth ,patient
and they could see that the brain was bleeding badly ,patient
in_fact uh about the blood  uh the blood was about three quarters of my brain ,patient
it was so bad that they didn't know if I would be ɛbɚu ,patient
uh and if I did come out_of it didn't know for sure if I would ever talk walk ,patient
if I'd even know anything ,patient
if I'd just hafta be spending the rest my life in a care home ,patient
they didn't know ,patient
and uh so um I didn't know if you'd me to go on some more about this ,patient
I_mean I can talk for a long time about this if you want me to ,patient
so  you ready to go on ,patient
I'm sorry I can't even hear you ,patient
yeah ,patient
yes  um yes ,patient
um of_course I when I was  when I was in the hospital um um I don't remember ,patient
you_know for about two months I don't remember anything ,patient
and I wasn't doing anything ,patient
I  as far as I know I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not but probably not because there wasn't anything to work with ,patient
um I  you_know I couldn't talk ,patient
um I couldn't um do anything ,patient
and interestingly in July ,patient
so  that was  that was  that was May ,patient
in July  middle of July somewhere I had another stroke ,patient
and they ,patient
I was at that point  I was in the  uh I was in uh a rehabilitation center  a rehab hospital ,patient
and they  uh they took me uh by ambulance because I  I felt  I could feel that something was going on ,patient
and I was afraid it was stroke ,patient
but I couldn't say it was a stroke ,patient
but I knew there was something going on ,patient
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem ,patient
they took me to the hospital and um did the scans and so_forth ,patient
and sure enough I'd had another  s I'd had another stroke ,patient
um while I was there in the hospital ,patient
um up until that time I could not move my legs at all ,patient
my hands I had  I was no  I couldn't do anything with it ,patient
I you_know was just  that's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again ,patient
but while I was in the hospital um I started being able to move ,patient
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost um my ability to focus my eyes together ,patient
so  I can only see out_of one eye at a time ,patient
so  I was wearing an eye patch over one side ,patient
then I'd wear it for a while over this side then w you_know ,patient
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see um with both eyes ,patient
I can steer with both eyes ,patient
but I'd see different  different things ,patient
and so um when I had the second stroke or well  this third stroke in the hospital uh I  the vision started clearing up ,patient
and I remember telling me  telling FirstnameS ,patient
I said ,patient
 my visions are getting better ,patient
 I can see better ,patient
 I can focus ,patient
 I can focus with my eyes ,patient
and  um and I  uh sure enough I could ,patient
and then I also told her that  that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit ,patient
and uh you_know because when you're  when you're paralyzed you're not sure whether it's moving or not ,patient
you think you're moving it ,patient
but y it really isn't ,patient
and I said ,patient
 you_know look at my leg and see if it's moving and  uh because I really felt like it was ,patient
and indeed it was moving ,patient
it was moving ,patient
so  whenever happened in this second stroke was  was good for me because I was able to start moving my uh uh uh muscle ,patient
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle ,patient
uh and I was able to um see with both eyes together ,patient
so  uh I was there two or three days ,patient
and uh they took me back to the  uh to the rehab hospital ,patient
and um at that point I was able to  um up until that point I'd permy primarily been doing rehab in terms of uh mental stuff ,patient
and uh at that point then I was t able to start doing sʌmpɪŋu ,patient
um and you_know as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to you_know start uh make myself move my muscles ,patient
my arm  I can move my arm ,patient
my hand still wouldn't move ,patient
we just numbed it ,patient
I couldn't do  anyth couldn't move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that ,patient
and uh so I  I do remember that when at that  at that point ,patient
and you  you  I don't know ,patient
are you saying  your question was ,patient
 do you mame remember anything that helped you ,patient
um was that the question ,patient
yeah ,patient
and so I started working really hard ,patient
I started working really hard because at that point I knew that  I knew that ,patient
well  actually you_know I knew it before that ,patient
that I was some  at some point I was gonna get better ,patient
I just couldn't do it ,patient
but at that point when fi I was steɪbəlɪu ,patient
and if I work at it hard enough I'll be able to get better ,patient
so  I  I was in that rehab hospital for  two rehab hospitals for awhile ,patient
and then I went to a  uh a long term uh uh care facility ,patient
and I was there for a hundred days ,patient
and they worked with me with a speech therapist a um physical therapist and a occupational therapist ,patient
uh and the hundred days ,patient
I could've used more but that was the r limit for  because_of Medicare ,patient
but that was  that was total of six months that I was  um I was um not able to um come  come home ,patient
men ,patient
so  we put a  put a  put a lift on the back on the port ,patient
and put one  uh put a lift going upstairs because our is  we have two story house ,patient
and um so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs ,patient
I hadta  I  I'd had some more rehab along ,patient
I had rehab at home for about another six weeks of  uh of rehab ,patient
and uh he was very very good rehab  rehab specialist ,patient
I did some uh other um you_know uh occupational and  uh and  and  and  uh occupational and physical and ,patient
what's the third kind ,patient
uh anyway I'll come  I'll coming up with in a minute  in a minute ,patient
so  I did that ,patient
and  but I  I never did  I  I never did give up ,patient
I always continued to work as hard as I could ,patient
um you_know I  I had  had a very good physical therapist to help me ,patient
and uh so we worked hard on that ,patient
and that took me until ,patient
and it  a actually and then I got uh when I was  when I was uh still at ,patient
then I went to  uh we had uh therapy on an outpatient basis for awhile at a rehab hospital here on outpatient basis for several months ,patient
and um during that time I met uh uh a um ,patient
I don't really know how to describe him ,patient
he's a  he's kind_of a  um he's  he's kind_of a um ,patient
he does not have a  um he's not  he's not a p_h_d ,patient
but he is a  a doctor of education or something like that ,patient
but he is very very good at um working with stroke people um in  in  in terms of  um in terms of cognitive ability ,patient
and  and I worked with him for about almost four years ,patient
and um in_fact I've just got work when  I quit working with him maybe in the last six months ,patient
um we were  went to his office  went to uh ,patient
well  he had an office ,patient
it  it  it  it  he didn't have an office there ,patient
he had a  um he came to a  he came to uh a university here ,patient
and he would meet with people there at the university ,patient
and I  I was still in a wheelchair at that time ,patient
and um I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was  when I was actually in  in a walker for another  s another year ,patient
and then when  when I went to uh uh walking with  uh with a cane I continued working at  with him ,patient
but it  his  his  his ,patient
I witch ,patient
but he works with  with the cognitive abilities ,patient
and he helped me a_lot you_know ,patient
in_fact some of the things that we've done here is  reminded me of some of the stuff that he's done  that he did with me ,patient
you_know t nell telling stories and  and  um and a_lot different tests that  um that I'm sure you're very familiar with ,patient
um but he was  he was able to work with me and just pull stuff outta me and make it work ,patient
and maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was  was kind_of inspire me to keep going and working working working ,patient
um so  I did that ,patient
and I worked hard on that ,patient
and I  I worked hard ,patient
uh when I  when I actually  when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me um I went to the YMCA ,patient
and I got a membership in the yl and  and hired at the yl a uh personal trainer who  who didn't really know anything about strokes ,patient
but she learned ,patient
she was very good at studying and learning ,patient
the first day that she saw me uh and I  I was so stiff that  sh that I couldn't move ,patient
I  I couldn't move any ,patient
my arm was just ,patient
I don't know if you can see it here ,patient
it's  you_know your arm is just like this ,patient
and it has clenched fist and everything ,patient
and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like ,patient
 holy_cow I  I can't move it you_know ,patient
and it wouldn't move ,patient
she worked with me ,patient
uh I went twice a week to go with her ,patient
uh and then in addition to that uh ,patient
buh but after a while I went  started  I'd say ,patient
 FirstnameS take me down to the yl and let me uh ,patient
I was  I was still using my walker ,patient
I'd say ,patient
 let me  just take me down the yl and let me walk around the track with my walker ,patient
and I'm sure people probably thought stupid dumb ,patient
here's this  this old guy walking around with his  you_know very very slowly ,patient
it'd take me  you_know it'd take me ,patient
it  it's uh six  six times arounds ,patient
and it would take me uh probably half hour to walk around that lap ,patient
uh but I was  I was determined to do it ,patient
and I did it ,patient
I did it ,patient
and um then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane ,patient
I still go very slowly ,patient
um but I'm doing it ,patient
so  I'm gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself ,patient
and I'm not trying to pat  pat myself on the back ,patient
I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have ,patient
and I'm sorry for them ,patient
they don't ,patient
but  and I think  I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive ,patient
I did not lose my drive ,patient
always  I've always been kinda driven anyway ,patient
you_know I've always been driven ,patient
but I was driven to  hur to improve and get better ,patient
and I'm still  go I'm still doing that ,patient
and I'm getting there ,patient
and it will never come to an end ,patient
but it  I will keep working at it ,patient
okay ,patient
um well  when I ,patient
okay  I tell you about my wife ,patient
how's that ,patient
at my wife ,patient
I  uh I'd been married before ,patient
my first wife had Huntington's disease ,patient
I don't  n don't know if you're familiar with it ,patient
but she had Huntington's disease for many many years ,patient
and she passed away um oh about twenty years ago ,patient
um I had a  uh uh I had a friend ,patient
now uh uh how do I go into this ,patient
um when she passed away  before she passed away ,patient
um this gets complicated ,patient
okay my  my wife's  my wife's brother  um my wife's brother um had moved to Texas ,patient
um in the  in the nineties they  they moved to Texas ,patient
and uh sh in Texas she met and became very close friends with uh someone in  in Texas there that  that she didn't know ,patient
uh but they  she met ,patient
they  bec you_know they worked together ,patient
and they became very very close friends ,patient
um are you in for a long story ,patient
uh so  so  uh my sister  my sister inlaw  uh sister inlaw her name is FirstnameD  okay ,patient
and uh so they moved to Texas ,patient
and at some point they moved back to Wichita ,patient
and he went to work for  for Boeing  okay ,patient
so  um at some point this friend of  friend of hers was going through a divorce ,patient
she  she'd been married for almost twenty years ,patient
and  and  and it end  didn't end up very well ,patient
so  she was going through a divorce ,patient
and so um FirstnameD who is my sister inlaw invited her to come to Wichita uh just because she needed somebody to  you_know she  wa she  she needed to  needed to get away from the si situation that she was ,patient
and so she  she moved to Wichi Wichita ,patient
and uh because_of the friendship that my sister inlaw had with her um we got to know  know them ,patient
my  my wife and I got to know them ,patient
but not very well because my wife had Hunting's ,patient
and you don't socialize very much when you have that exist ,patient
so  I really did not know her  them  their friend very well ,patient
but we did see them once in awhile when we'd go  like go to uh a family gathering or go to their house because FirstnameD would be there ,patient
and her friend would be there and  and so_forth ,patient
and so that was  that was like nineteen ninety one or something like that ,patient
well  uh to make a long story long um uh FirstnameD's friend then moved to get  got married  got  got married  remarried and uh went to  went and moved to California ,patient
uh she was out there for about a year ,patient
and she came back to Wichita ,patient
and her  hu and her husband he came back to Wichita ,patient
and uh he had his  her husband had a uh heart transplant ,patient
if  if he  you having a hard time following  following this that's okay ,patient
I'll  it  I'll try to bring it all together ,patient
she ,patient
and uh it  uh it didn't take very well you_know ,patient
heart transplants they're long drawn out ,patient
and s she ,patient
and finally he gave out ,patient
in the meantime my  my wife uh with Huntington's disease um was moved to a uh ,patient
w uh we had her at a uh nursing home ,patient
she spent five years in a nursing home ,patient
um now then  and her nursing home was the same town about four or five blocks away from FirstnameS's friend ,patient
I had no idea they  that she lived there ,patient
you_know I had no idea that she lived in that  in that town or anywhere ,patient
um so  um so  at one point my wife finally you_know she went downhill and went downhill and  and  and passed away in uh two thousand two ,patient
uh I called FirstnameD my sister inlaw to tell her that  that FirstnameJ had passed away ,patient
and uh FirstnameS uh and  and no  and uh FirstnameD said ,patient
 I can't believe it ,patient
uh FirstnameC just died yesterday ,patient
and FirstnameC is FirstnameS's husband ,patient
I say ,patient
 they  they both died within one day of each other ,patient
 um strange coincidence ,patient
um over  over time um I  it  and not right away but over time I uh ,patient
FirstnameS was living up there in the  in  in  in Sedrick  the town of Sedrick where the nursing home was ,patient
and at some point FirstnameS said or  um uh FirstnameD said ,patient
 you_know what ,patient
 denay FirstnameD ,patient
 did you_know that ,patient
I said ,patient
 no  I had no idea ,patient
so  uh you_know after  after  y after you lose a spouse um it's very difficult to  for people to understand where you're going through when you lose a spouse ,patient
and uh I  uh uh I went  I was in this little town where FirstnameS lived ,patient
didn't really have any  any  uh didn't have any uh limits on fireworks ,patient
okay  that's only important because uh my kids wanted to have  fire wanted to have some fireworks ,patient
and uh uh you_know oh  oh my kids wanted to have some fireworks ,patient
so  I said ,patient
 well  I'll tell you what ,patient
well  not my kids my grandkids ,patient
I said ,patient
 I'll tell you what ,patient
 we'll  g we'll call FirstnameS and ask her if we can go up there in Sedrick wh where they have no limits on what you can shoot off ,patient
so  went up there  went up there ,patient
and  and uh you_know I just said ,patient
 FirstnameS  can we come up there and shoot off some fireworks ,patient
and she said ,patient
 sure  come ahead ,patient
so  we did ,patient
and then we started  started kind_of getting to know each other at that point ,patient
because like I say you don't  you  you  if  unless you've lost a spouse you don't realize what it's like ,patient
and so FirstnameS I kind_of had an immediate bond there because we had both lost  v recently lost our spouses ,patient
and both of us had spouses that add ,patient
it took years before he passed  passed away and  and my sh my wife ,patient
and so you_know we started  we  s you_know it's  it was a  it was a  nat kinda a natural bond ,patient
and so we ɑtu ,patient
and um here we are ,patient
and uh so FirstnameD is still  FirstnameD is still FirstnameS's best friend ,patient
in_fact she was here just d yesterday or day before ,patient
um they're still best friends ,patient
and uh that's what happened to me was uh you_know my we me wet ,patient
and uh that was fifteen years ago  fifteen years ago that we got married almost fifteen ,patient
wait a minute ,patient
see  lemme think ,patient
lemme think ,patient
no  it's over fifteen years ,patient
it was fifteen last October ,patient
okay ,patient
okay ,patient
well  I is a  there's a  there's a little  little boy ,patient
not a real little boy ,patient
he's not a little boy ,patient
he's maybe I don't know  ten twelve  something in there ,patient
he's out kicking the soccer ball around ,patient
he's  ru he's wearing a ball cap ,patient
and uh he's uh wearing jeans ,patient
and he's kicking the soccer ball around ,patient
and he kicks it  ri uh ha kicks it really hard ,patient
raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air ,patient
and then it goes to um it  uh then you see the  um the soccer ball travels through the air and hits a window ,patient
uh there's shutters on the window ,patient
um it's  um it's a nice size picture  not a picture window  good one  good size window ,patient
and um there's a bushes outside the window ,patient
um and it  the  the  the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp ,patient
knocks the lamp off the  off  out_of  knocks the lamp off the table ,patient
but it knocks the lamp over ,patient
and um no ,patient
uh so  it knocks the lamp over and  and comes through the window ,patient
um the guy is sitting there probably watching tv or something ,patient
but uh he um gets up  picks up the s soccer ball  walks over to the window ,patient
and um uh you_know the  the window ,patient
I think we talked about this last time ,patient
the window is there ,patient
the  uh the lamp where the  w where the  where the um soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore ,patient
it's  the lamp is gone ,patient
the curtains are  are  are little bit different ,patient
um there's  um I'm not sure what  what  I'm not sure what the uh ,patient
yeah it's  there's  there  I'm not sure what some of the s something is there the ,patient
anyway though there's a lady ,patient
um and  but the  the lamp and the chair are no longer there ,patient
um and I think the  uh I'm gonna say that the  uh the window ledge is  is lower than it was ,patient
it just  it looks different ,patient
um but the guy he looks out the window ,patient
and I think  uh I think he doesn't know where it came from ,patient
but I am sure he's probably going to find out ,patient
and he's probably going to uh make somebody's pay for the window ,patient
so  the moral of that story is if you're gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesn't go through the window ,patient
the end ,patient
oh  I forgot the beginning and the end last time  didn't I ,patient
okay  the beginning is that they  uh uh the  the  the  the  the little kid ,patient
I think it's a boy ,patient
is going off to school ,patient
and the mom tries to hand him a  uh an umbrella ,patient
and he says ,patient
 mom  I don't need an umbrella ,patient
 I'm a big kid ,patient
 I don't need umbrella ,patient
 it's not gonna rain ,patient
 I'll walk ,patient
 I'll be okay ,patient
so  he waves goodbye to the mom ,patient
he's got his backpack on ,patient
head for school ,patient
waves bye  tell  tells  uh tells mom goodbye ,patient
and she's standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesn't wanna take with him ,patient
so  he starts walking off to school ,patient
and um there's some  some raindrops coming down  not a_lot but just a few raindrops here and there ,patient
and uh he looks up at the sky ,patient
and he's like ,patient
 oh_no what did I do ,patient
 I didn't  br I didn't bring the umbrella ,patient
so  he said ,patient
 I think I'll  I think I'll go home and get the umbrella ,patient
and he turns around ,patient
and he  and it's raining harder ,patient
and now the wind's kinda blowing because the rain's coming at an angle ,patient
and uh it's  it's quite a bit of rain because as he  as he runs he's  he's uh splashing ,patient
so  there's enough rain that's making  making little splashes ,patient
and he's uh kinda holding his hand up over his head like  as_though he's gonna be able to stop the water off his head ,patient
but he runs home ,patient
and uh you can tell the  say the mom is a little  a_little um perturbed but he get  because he wouldn't take the umbrella ,patient
so  there  there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet ,patient
and the mom just kinda looks at him like ,patient
 you  you  you_know y you  you shoulda listened to what I said ,patient
he said ,patient
 okay  I'm  I'll  okay ,patient
 so  give me the umbrella ,patient
so  she gives him ber uh umbrella ,patient
and he head  heads back to school ,patient
and uh it's still raining ,patient
it's still raining pretty hard ,patient
uh it's coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was ,patient
so  it must be belo blowing pretty hard at a forty five degree angle ,patient
and uh he's walk  he's got his backpack ,patient
and he's walking h off to school ,patient
and uh I  the  uh the moral of the story is listen to your mom ,patient
she knows best ,patient
the end ,patient
oh  yeah  I've seen this one before  okay ,patient
okay ,patient
so  the beginning is  the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree ,patient
and the little girl is upset because the cat's up the tree ,patient
and she can't get her down ,patient
I think she's calling the cat to come down ,patient
but the cat won't come down ,patient
so  uh either cat won't or can't ,patient
but it looks like the cat really doesn't care to come down ,patient
he's like ,patient
 I'm here on this branch ,patient
 and I'm happy ,patient
 so  yall can worry about it all you want ,patient
 but I'm not coming down ,patient
so  the little girl says you_know ,patient
 daddy daddy daddy ,patient
uh and she's  uh the little girl is probably ,patient
I don't know ,patient
she's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle ,patient
and she got pigtails and little black sandals ,patient
um like I said she's riding  riding that little trik tricycle ,patient
the cat won't  the cat won't come down ,patient
so  apparently the  uh uh the  the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down ,patient
and uh he  he leaned the ladder against the tree uh to crawl up there ,patient
and um something happened ,patient
I'm gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree uh ran into the ladder or something ,patient
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down ,patient
the dad's stuck in the tree ,patient
and um I don't know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone ,patient
maybe it's  maybe uh uh ,patient
I don't know ,patient
that's  he musta had a cellphone ,patient
he calls the fire department ,patient
and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters ,patient
and they're carrying their ladder ,patient
and they're running over to get the man down outta  outta the tree ,patient
um meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree ,patient
I don't know if he's  I don't think  I don't think he's mad ,patient
I think he's just ba barking up the kriu ,patient
so  the  um the firemen are on their way ,patient
they've got their ladder ,patient
um truck's sitting out and set on the  setting out on the street ,patient
um there's a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away ,patient
um and um yeah then that's  that's pretty much it ,patient
it's a  it's a  it's a big tree  big tree ,patient
um yeah both ,patient
and it is  it's summertime because the trees have leaves on  on ,patient
uh yeah  okay  well  that's  that's about good ,patient
okay ,patient
okay ,patient
alright  well  at the beginning I  I don't know if this is true or not ,patient
I don't know if this is really what  what happened in the story ,patient
but looks like  um it looks like that for some reason um maybe somebody took  somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else ,patient
and um I don't know the story behind that ,patient
but that's what it looks like ,patient
and then  um so  she says ,patient
 great  you_know I've got my two dollar ,patient
 and she can be  you_know they can all be friends ,patient
well  when  when she's gone it turns out that um Cinderella actually became more of uh a servant than a friend ,patient
um uh she musta  she musta been sleeping in the  um uh out in the stable with the animals  I guess ,patient
um she  in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters ,patient
um she was doing their laundry ,patient
she was doing all the work ,patient
and um like I said she had become more of a slave than  than anything else ,patient
so  um they lived in the  in the shadow of  of the castle ,patient
and  um I think she dreamt about the castle ,patient
um looks like she was in the one picture  it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that ,patient
that's what it looks like anyway ,patient
and um so it turns out that the  that the king  little short fat king ,patient
I don't know why the little short  why the king is always short and fat but he is ,patient
uh is looking for somebody to marry his  his daughter ,patient
and uh he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom so_that the  uh the  the  the girls can have their  their pick of uh ,patient
they can't have their pick ,patient
but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball ,patient
and uh they'll have a chance to show off to  to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him ,patient
so  um he sent out this invitation ,patient
and of_course the  um the  the  the wicked stepmother or the  whatever she is  the mother  she um of_course doesn't let  doesn't want Cinderella to go to the ball ,patient
so  uh um the other girls go off to the ball ,patient
and Cinderella stays home ,patient
and  and she's go gotta tend to the animals or whatever ,patient
um so  the uh fairy godmother came along ,patient
and I'm not sure how she got into the story ,patient
but she came along ,patient
the fairy godmother um showed up and al a with a  uh with a carriage a pumpkin ,patient
uh it was that  um the I guess fairy godmother turned the  turned the  turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a  for the  gir for Cinderella to ride in ,patient
they went to the  uh went to the ball with the two horses and  and the footman and the  and the driver and all that ,patient
they went to the  went to the ball  they went to the ball  but uh they went to the ball ,patient
and the  uh nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful ,patient
so  she uh the  uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the uh pumpkin ,patient
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is ,patient
they  uh up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see it's about a minute before midnight ,patient
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the  uh before the  the um pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while it's still a carriage ,patient
runs ho or  runs and g dʒɛnu ,patient
but uh in the way she lost her slipper ,patient
she was running down the stairs ,patient
the slipper fell off ,patient
and uh she didn't have time to go back and pick it up  I guess ,patient
so  she went on  got in the carriage with you_know the carriage and went home ,patient
the  uh the prince was heartbroken because he and  and me  because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the  who had come to the ball ,patient
and nobody knew who she was ,patient
but he had fallen in love with her ,patient
and so he sent  uh he sent  everyb he sent his um man or servants or whatever out to find this  uh the person whose foot would fit in the slipper ,patient
and so they went to Cinderella's house ,patient
and um of_course the  uh the two sisters there uh they tried it on ,patient
and of_course it didn't fit ,patient
and uh so the  uh Cinderella was there as a servant ,patient
and uh I think the  uh I think the uh fairy godmother or something said  made  um worked it out somehow that  so_that the  uh the  the prince would try the slipper on Cinderella's foot ,patient
and sure enough it fit perfectly ,patient
it was perfectly obvious whose  whose foot it was ,patient
and it was Cinderella's ,patient
and so um everybody was happy ,patient
all the animals were happy ,patient
the  l the animals were  cel the  the little rats ,patient
everyone was celebrating uh as the  uh as Cinderella gets in the  uh the  the carriage with the prince ,patient
and they ride off into the distance and live happily ever after ,patient
you get  uh you  you get some  you got some bread ,patient
that's the first thing  I guess ,patient
get  get  get the bread out_of the  uh out_of the  out_of the refrigerator because I  we keep our bread in the refrigerator ,patient
so  you get the bread out ,patient
then you go to the pantry ,patient
and you uh get out the  uh the peanut butter ,patient
open the peanut butter ,patient
and is  is this a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
I  g I think it is ,patient
so  then I  uh then uh I go back to the refrigerator and uh take out the  uh take out the jelly ,patient
and uh open up the bread sack ,patient
and open up the uh peanut butter jar ,patient
and open up the  uh open up the uh jar of jelly ,patient
uh I go to the uh knife drawer near the drawer where we keep the silverware ,patient
and I take out a knife and uh take out two pieces of bread ,patient
and I spread the peanut butter on  on one of the pieces of bread ,patient
and then I uh take another piece of bread and spread peanut  um jelly on the  on that one ,patient
I put them together ,patient
and um I uh go put the  uh the  wo the knife in the dishwasher so it gets cleaned up ,patient
and uh put the jar  jelly jar back in the uh refrigerator ,patient
and put the uh uh bread back in the refrigerator ,patient
and then I go over and put the uh uh peanut butter back in the pantry ,patient
and then I uh sit down and eat my peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
and that's it ,patient
