my s speech today is doing pretty good ,patient
some days not laughs ,patient
um yes  I had a stroke at the school ,patient
and I was a teacher ,patient
and I had had um headaches for about a week or so and still working laughs during the day ,patient
and um they said um all_of_a_sudden I said ,patient
 can I lay down for a half an hour ,patient
and all_of_a_sudden I  st I was talking to the  the nurse that's at the school ,patient
and she said ,patient
 FirstnameK  are you okay ,patient
and I kept  I was trying  I was talking ,patient
I thought what I was saying was right ,patient
and I kept saying ,patient
 I'm fine ,patient
 I'm fine ,patient
and she kept saying ,patient
 FirstnameK ,patient
and um obviously my talking was not even all there ,patient
and I don't remember anything from that point to um I was  um I had this tube in there ,patient
I got my brain done ,patient
I got  I wa had a tube going ,patient
I was out ,patient
it breathes you and everything ,patient
um I don't rimɛmbvɚu ,patient
um I didn't even know my name ,patient
I didn't know who I was ,patient
they gave me a mirror to know who I was ,patient
and I didn't know it was me ,patient
I thought it was a picture of someone else ,patient
so  yeah  for that long laughs ,patient
so  I had about two weeks of not here laughs ,patient
yes ,patient
um let's see ,patient
at the beginning um I had  I could not walk yet ,patient
so  they were helping me to um stand up s at the beginning um not walking anywhere but able to stand up ,patient
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side ,patient
um so  I had one therapist that  bet ,patient
this one arm was not always going ,patient
so  weights trying to get that going ,patient
um then I had another um therapist um was trying to get me to start uh talking ,patient
um I couldn't really talk of anything ,patient
so  they were showing me like um yesq or noq a_lot ,patient
um I  we had to start with that ,patient
sometimes I didn't really even understand if they said ,patient
 do you wanna drink something ,patient
usually they would show me that ,patient
and I thought ,patient
 what are they doing ,patient
I'd  so  that was hard ,patient
um even at the beginning I didn't even understand cups ,patient
and um they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere ,patient
and um they showed me how to  they hadta show me how to eat again ,patient
um to  um at the beginning I was very  um very scared by myself in a room ,patient
um I also thought we had  I  I thought someone had took me like  um like a bad person taking me ,patient
so  I was trying to run to help myself ,patient
I had those thoughts too of scared um uh to the point where I was trying to um hit people in a way because I thought they were trying to help no  I thought they were bad people ,patient
so  I  I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run ,patient
that was even that part for me ,patient
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way ,patient
um didn't  my mom and dad were there ,patient
didn't know who they were ,patient
um my kids were here ,patient
didn't know them ,patient
um like I said they showed me a mirror ,patient
and they said ,patient
 do you know who you are ,patient
and I  di I thought ,patient
 who is this person ,patient
and it was me ,patient
so  that's when it got started ,patient
um then therapy started with even very small like um saying my name  saying yesq or noq ,patient
um went from that point to we played some games t for numbers like um dice ,patient
um we played some games that were cards like uh p play cards in a way  put  sort all the cards together  what colors matching ,patient
suh little things ,patient
it gives me um focus ,patient
and also I would əlæksu ,patient
if we're playing a game I was okay ,patient
so  we did that ,patient
um then they started giving me cards ,patient
what  the first one I ever saw was a baby ,patient
there's a baby card ,patient
and there was a bird ,patient
and they said ,patient
 what is this ,patient
is it a bird or um a baby ,patient
and it took ,patient
I didn't know ,patient
but I knew it a little bit in my brain ,patient
but not really on what they were you_know ,patient
it was happy thoughts ,patient
but I don't know  I wasn't sure what that was ,patient
that's when it started ,patient
um then I was able to start not walking very well ,patient
but I could stand up  pivot  sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself ,patient
that's when all that started during ,patient
um once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well  not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning ,patient
I still do have to watch my um uh dizzy s feelings ,patient
but um therapy  that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better  stuff like that ,patient
and other therapy was still doing the talking  started at the beginning ,patient
um so  it's  that was about uh a year of just talking  working on all those words and all that you_know ,patient
um then after two years didn't have to worry about the other therapy because now I'm starting to walk uh very well now ,patient
so  only just therapy for  um um for speech ,patient
um then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years um we started working on these numbers which I still not good at laughs ,patient
um I went from um one to now I know one and two to one two three ,patient
I'm not  higher than that not very good so you_know ,patient
and one plus one  not sure there yet ,patient
but  um so  was working on numbers um and trying to start reading of any kind ,patient
um reading  it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading ,patient
I'm still not all there ,patient
now it's been three years ,patient
um I can  I really can't read  I say ,patient
um sentences  maybe ,patient
it depends on what we're talking about ,patient
I'm starting to read um books from like little kids books ,patient
um now I can do some of that ,patient
writing is not as good ,patient
so  I use my phone ,patient
but um therapy people was showing me like apps  stuff like that ,patient
because someday if you can't write again there's other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that ,patient
so  well  I can't remember the first thing we're talking about ,patient
sorry about that ,patient
see  this is me laughs ,patient
okay  kʊzu ,patient
um let's see ,patient
um I  th does it have to  so  what ,patient
are you talking about just um a story are you saying ,patient
or are you saying like something about something like that ,patient
okay  um I think um is  is new stuff ,patient
I  I think um since  since I'm i a teacher ,patient
and I was before ,patient
um but now I hafta um be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school  right ,patient
so  one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke ,patient
they have aphasia ,patient
and we  um when there's a new patient here um I  I like to help them ,patient
they're gonna have the  sa the same struggles most of the time that I had ,patient
and so um now we  we are now friends ,patient
I can help them to have her ,patient
um and um tips I can give them ,patient
um and so now when I do that kind of stuff I'm now a teacher again ,patient
so  I  I like that ,patient
and they're also now my friends ,patient
I  when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back ,patient
so  I haven't seen some of them now for years ,patient
they don't call me back ,patient
they don't understand me now ,patient
um so  my new friends are kinda like me ,patient
we're very  uh we talk a_lot which is good ,patient
but um I think that we have bad days ,patient
um therapy is hard some days ,patient
um um some days our brain  mine  my  I would say my brain doesn't always work some days ,patient
um my eyes don't always work ,patient
um my foot  now that we're talking my foot's not working right now ,patient
um things like that ,patient
but um my life being a teacher and a friend is  uh is an awesome thing to me ,patient
yeah  yeah ,patient
okay ,patient
I can't see us on the last one because we're in the middle ourselves ,patient
so  I'm not sure what's under the last one ,patient
um looks like there's a boy that's been um hitting the ball round ,patient
probably a ,patient
I remember the name of those little guys ,patient
but um they're playing that ball ,patient
and it looks  he hit the window ,patient
and uh um it hit the window and went in ,patient
so  it crashed the window ,patient
yeah ,patient
and I don't know if it's his house or not ,patient
it could be someone else's house ,patient
but  um and he also hit the lamp also ,patient
and the guy ,patient
I'm gonna move this again just a minute and I'll ,patient
um so the guy is  well  he has the ball ,patient
but I don't know if he ,patient
yeah  he's just looking ,patient
so  I don't know if that kid decided to leave ,patient
or if he's gone growls ,patient
so  that  that must be  there should be more story line on that one ,patient
I don't know if he  r he ran or if the  da if the guy's just going ,patient
 where'd he go ,patient
okay  laughs okay ,patient
um one of the kids have ,patient
and mom said ,patient
 there's probably gonna be a rain today ,patient
 and so bring your that's my word  bɚɛləu ,patient
and the kid said ,patient
 nah I don't need it ,patient
and I'm sure mom said ,patient
 okay ,patient
and so  but he went outside ,patient
and here comes the rain um going faster even maybe more raindrops ,patient
and so then d um he said ,patient
 okay ,patient
he went the other way home and said ,patient
 you're right mom ,patient
 I should've had it ,patient
and so mom gave it to him ,patient
and then he went back outside for school with the bɚɛləu ,patient
yes  that's a funny one laughs ,patient
okay ,patient
um it  it looks like there's uh a cat s stuck in the tree ,patient
and so dad said ,patient
 I think I can help and had a ladder and got up there ,patient
and the um ladder fell down ,patient
and so someone must've called the uh fire people ,patient
and they're going to get him out_of the  uh the tree and h maybe even the cat ,patient
um let's see ,patient
there ,patient
yeah I don't know if it's really dad  I guess ,patient
maybe it's just someone who is helping for the cat ,patient
or if it's you_know the little girl's dad that did that ,patient
I'm not sure ,patient
I don't see any houses around ,patient
so  it's hard to tell ,patient
um she had her bike  I guess ,patient
but  uh and there's a dog obviously that's barking because there's a guy up there in the  in the tree ,patient
so  yep ,patient
okay ,patient
I don't remember her name  sorry ,patient
it's hard ,patient
um okay ,patient
she um ,patient
let's see ,patient
I don't remember where she comes from ,patient
but um she's in the  um the house with um the ,patient
it's not her mom ,patient
it's um ,patient
I don't remember what calls that ,patient
but it's not her mom_momnn you_know ,patient
and  but s there's two other sisters ,patient
and they get to do whatever they want during the day ,patient
but the other girl hasta clean and  um and do all the stuff that who wants to do  right ,patient
and um I'm sure she's  uh but she's  yeah she watches the  um the castle the big one ,patient
and I'm sure that she watches and thinks ,patient
 oh I wish I was over there ,patient
and um then th they  um we get a letter that says they're gonna do a ,patient
let's see what ,patient
it's not a party ,patient
there's a word but I don't have it ,patient
the ball ,patient
that's what they call it  yeah ,patient
so  like uh a party in a way ,patient
but you ba dance and look beautiful ,patient
and um everyone could go ,patient
and I think they're going to do that because they want the um prince ,patient
I think he's a prince ,patient
and he finds  he needs to find a lady ,patient
and so there's a way to do it  I think ,patient
so  um they said ,patient
 let's do this ball and find some cute ones for him ,patient
and um so when they got their paper um I think she even gets to go ,patient
she didn't say she couldn't go ,patient
but she had a beautiful dress in her um ,patient
I say it's not  it's not a  a box ,patient
it's something pretty ,patient
but I don't know what they call those things ,patient
and um but she was looking at the dress ,patient
and oh I'm gonna look so good ,patient
and the other girls um they don't look as cute ,patient
but they  um they  s she  l they looked her stuff ,patient
and they wanted this and that and dress  and h um tore her dress and everything ,patient
and so they were gonna go ,patient
and she looked  she didn't have thing ,patient
and so she was sad ,patient
and the fairy um ,patient
I think that's what she is ,patient
I don't remember ,patient
right now she's different than the one you watch her another way ,patient
laughs useta be a small one ,patient
now she's a  l a real lady ,patient
but um she was there ,patient
and she said ,patient
 I can help you ,patient
and so she takes the  um the rats and  and the dog and everything become people ,patient
and the pumpkin they make it pretty for her to go in there ,patient
and they gave her a dress that looks beautiful ,patient
and she said ,patient
 but you can only stay until midnight ,patient
and so she may forget that part at the beginning ,patient
she's just  she's so excited ,patient
she doesn't think about the time very well really  laughs ,patient
and so  um so  then ,patient
let's see ,patient
um she gets in there ,patient
and I'm sure that everyone says ,patient
 ooh she's here ,patient
and  um but the uh ,patient
he's not a king yet ,patient
the prince sees her and said ,patient
 whoo she's cute ,patient
and so they dance and  and everything ,patient
and um all_of_a_sudden she does figure out the time ,patient
and she looks at that and says ,patient
 uhoh I gotta go ,patient
and so um she runs down the stairs ,patient
but one of her um they're not shoes  heels ,patient
I don't know ,patient
there's  there's rɑɾəu ,patient
I don't know ,patient
I say shoes ,patient
um um so  she  um one of them falls ,patient
and um she gets home ,patient
and you could tell she was  she had a good night ,patient
but she's probably also kind_of sad on the fact she never gets to come back in her head you_know ,patient
but it was a beautiful night ,patient
and then um she's back at home cleaning and everything else ,patient
and here comes one of the people who works for the  um you_know the king and guy I'm sure ,patient
so  they bring this guy ,patient
and he has one of the shoes and says he  they want to find the pretty one ,patient
and um those girls of_course they're hoping  they know they're not her sh shoes ,patient
but they said ,patient
 but maybe I could put them on anyway because you never know ,patient
and of_course their usually have big feet or who knows ,patient
but um I don't xxx that part of that story ,patient
but I remember it before ,patient
and then  um so  all_of_a_sudden she gets to decide now ,patient
I don't know if they really  the  I don't think the other mom would've let her even try it ,patient
but I'm sure someone  I don't  I don't  one of the  one of the ra rats figure this out or something ,patient
they  they help her to  to sit down and put them on ,patient
so  um there must be kind_of thing going on to help her to do that ,patient
and then  um and they fit ,patient
and um so uh she gets to come back to the um castle ,patient
and um they get married ,patient
and oh  and the end is always the ,patient
oh  what's the word ,patient
I wish I had it in my head ,patient
but it's not there ,patient
you_know they always say at the end ,patient
 afterq ,patient
like alwaysq ,patient
well  what is those words ,patient
I wish I remember the name ,patient
it was like  it always says the end of all the stories ,patient
afterq ,patient
bah I don't have it ,patient
but I'm excited about it ,patient
so  um and they are always together ,patient
you_know they always do ,patient
yeah ,patient
oh  okay  now I'm going to show you there's another way to do this ,patient
so  I'm gonna give you the real stɔɪu ,patient
so  if you want um peanut butter um jelly right together ,patient
so  the first thing you need is two bread slices ,patient
and then what's weird about it you deed ,patient
and you take some of the um peanut butter ,patient
and you put it in the cup ,patient
and then you get some of the jelly ,patient
and it has to be a certain kind because my dad only says you can have this kind ,patient
I don't know it's one of those things ,patient
and you put that in there ,patient
and you get a spoon ,patient
and you stir it like this ges,patient
I don't know I've done this since I was a kid ,patient
and then you take it out_of the cup ,patient
and you put it on the bread together ,patient
and then you put them together like this ges,patient
and the  you eat it that way ,patient
although when you're a kid you're also go imit,patient
dad only let's you do that part because this is his sæmwɪtʃu ,patient
you get part of the  uh the from the spoon ,patient
yeah ,patient
