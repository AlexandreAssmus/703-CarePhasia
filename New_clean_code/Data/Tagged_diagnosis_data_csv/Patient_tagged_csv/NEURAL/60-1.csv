uh it's pretty good ,patient
I know I s struggle when I get overly tired ,patient
I  I'm told that people wouldn't know I have trouble unless I,patient
my hesitation to them I'm told is  sounds like I'm thoughtful ,patient
they don't understand it ,patient
my hesitation is because I'm struggling laughs ,patient
yes ,patient
sure ,patient
um I went to bed on a Monday night after work ,patient
and uh just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and,patient
um about uh one or two in the morning uh I hadta go to the,patient
and I was struggling to get the covers off ,patient
I was laying on my left side ,patient
so  I trying to get the covers off with the right ,patient
and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were ,patient
and uh that was my first sign something was wrong ,patient
I  at first I thought because I had the two cats ,patient
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something ,patient
but uh they  I  you_know the room was dark ,patient
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might ,patient
and finally they came off ,patient
and then I um tried to take some steps ,patient
the bathroom was the next room over ,patient
and I was um finding that I was exhausted ,patient
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed ,patient
uh I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed ,patient
but I just laid on the floor ,patient
uh I laid there for about thirty minutes ,patient
um my Garmin told me what was going on  the timeline ,patient
and uh so when I got back up I still didn't feel like I could,patient
so  I did and just crawled back into bed ,patient
and uh then about  um I was awake asleep back and forth,patient
and I was trying to figure out ,patient
something's wrong with me ,patient
but I don't know if this is major ,patient
and I was trying to decide ,patient
it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart ,patient
and um I didn't want to go to the emergency room ,patient
and there'd be nothing wrong ,patient
uh but I called uh a guy from work ,patient
I used my phone ,patient
and I thought I was dialing his work number ,patient
but I got his cellphone number ,patient
so  I want to leave him a voicemail message ,patient
and I was surprised to hear him answer ,patient
and that's when he told me ,patient
 you called my cell number ,patient
so  I worked for a very difficult company to work for ,patient
and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on ,patient
so  I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh,patient
but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day ,patient
and I said uh ,patient
 pass the word on ,patient
 m my brain's not working right today ,patient
 I won't be in ,patient
and so he just chuckled and said ,patient
 well  okay  I'll pass that on ,patient
and then I called a friend and uh told him what was going on ,patient
and uh then uh between two of us uh we decided ,patient
um um well  my  my idea ,patient
 I will call him in a half hour ,patient
 if you don't hear from me call me ,patient
 if you can't reach me call for help ,patient
so  a half hour later I called him ,patient
and uh I decided I'm going to call my neighbor ,patient
take me to the hospital ,patient
so  I did ,patient
and my neighbor next door came and got me ,patient
and um w we went to the hospital ,patient
I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did ,patient
it was a great one ,patient
we've got uh four hospitals to choose from ,patient
so  I don't re know why  or remember why we went to that,patient
but um she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago,patient
and uh she was struggling trying to figure out where the,patient
and at that point I couldn't read ,patient
but I saw the red lettering ,patient
and I knew that must be emergency ,patient
and so I pointed to that ,patient
and then  um sh then she didn't know what to do with me once,patient
again she was someone with a brain injury ,patient
so  she was having trouble thinking her way through this ,patient
and so here  me  I just had a stroke ,patient
and I'm having to do the thinking laughs ,patient
so  uh when we pulled up under the awning there was a,patient
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital ,patient
and I caught his eye ,patient
and he came out ,patient
and I told him ,patient
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke ,patient
and I told him ,patient
 I think I had a stroke ,patient
 and I'm afraid to walk ,patient
um at this point I was not having trouble walking ,patient
but I was afraid I might ,patient
um earlier in the day in wee hours I was um having a real,patient
but now I was okay with it ,patient
um so  he said ,patient
 hold on ,patient
 I'll go get someone ,patient
and he got a nurse ,patient
and uh she came out ,patient
and I told her the same thing ,patient
and then she went back and got a wheelchair ,patient
and they got me in ,patient
mhm um I had a_lot_of speech therapy ,patient
um I went to two different um organizations for therapy because,patient
so  I wanted more therapy than that ,patient
and uh so I went to both ,patient
so  for maybe about I don't know  six or eight months I got,patient
um each uh session is about an hour ,patient
um uh I also did some physical therapy ,patient
but I didn't stick with it ,patient
and so I can still feel like my right leg drag a little bit ,patient
um and I also have trouble writing ,patient
so  I have uh some occupational therapy I did as_well ,patient
um and it  it helped a little bit but not a_lot ,patient
um uh but the speech therapy uh ,patient
I found uh some therapists I just connected with better than,patient
and uh the one I spent the most time with I really liked her,patient
she was very good and very positive ,patient
and as she explained it something important to me ,patient
she said  um in the beginning she said ,patient
 I'm going to test you right now to see where you're at right now,patient
then after we work together awhile I'll test you again to gauge,patient
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that,patient
so  when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was,patient
I felt so stupid because I couldn't do them ,patient
but if I'd have known earlier that that's what they were doing it,patient
but you_know they didn't think to tell me that ,patient
but um I did uh games on my phone ,patient
um I went to a local college that had uh meetings on uh,patient
and so the first hour everybody's in the same room ,patient
and then the second hour we're split up into groups ,patient
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into ,patient
so  you go into a group with about four or five other people who,patient
um I bought books uh grade school books for math and reading,patient
um and I did that on my own ,patient
and I did uh puzzle books ,patient
and then uh I went back to work ,patient
I went back to work very quickly ,patient
way before I really was able to do much ,patient
but I just thought ,patient
 I've just got to get in there and do it ,patient
so  I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke ,patient
um there was something ,patient
oh uh I always liked to cook ,patient
but now I really kicked it up ,patient
um I found uh about healthy eating ,patient
and I've always liked junk food ,patient
and I decide to eat really healthy ,patient
I felt like that would help me recover ,patient
and uh so I  uh I got this ,patient
and uh learning to understand measurements again was difficult at,patient
but I learned ,patient
and I still struggle with it sometimes ,patient
making conversions is not so easy for me ,patient
but  um but I see the ingredient list ,patient
and then you've got like a paragraph of everythings,patient
so  I've learned to  if it's the first uh two things you do,patient
and then maybe the next three things you've gotta do something else,patient
then I color those other three with another color ,patient
that kind of thing ,patient
and so um then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods ,patient
and that was motivating for me ,patient
and then I also  uh I was working near a mall ,patient
and uh so at lunch time I would go walk every day ,patient
well  the job that I had that was so stressful ,patient
uh about two years ago now uh they laid me off ,patient
and uh I was happy about that ,patient
I hated that place ,patient
I loved the work ,patient
but the people were just insane ,patient
and uh bullying people to get things done ,patient
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over,patient
but I was afraid to look for another job um because if the next,patient
so  I was really afraid to move ,patient
and there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work ,patient
so  I felt really trapped ,patient
but I was looking ,patient
but it was just  you_know there really wasn't a_lot to pick,patient
and  well  anyway  the day  three months or so before,patient
so  I started collecting my information that I was gonna need,patient
and I put my notes in a notebook ,patient
and I took them out to my car ,patient
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and,patient
I didn't keep them at my desk ,patient
I took everything out_of my office except for things that belonged,patient
uh I saved off programs I had written  everything ,patient
and so then when the boss and the h_r guy came to my office and,patient
I tried not to look so happy about it ,patient
but I was really happy ,patient
and then uh I was out_of work for ten months ,patient
and it was okay because I had unemployment ,patient
I had money in savings ,patient
and I was doing alright with that ,patient
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job ,patient
and now I work from home fulltime for a company that's uh in,patient
and uh so uh my boss that's ,patient
uh he's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice,patient
and I still do the same kind of work I useta do ,patient
but now it's for nice people ,patient
okay ,patient
um this boy is kicking a soccer ball ,patient
and he kicked it right into somebody's living room window ,patient
and it went in and knocked over the lamp ,patient
and the man saw the damage as it happened ,patient
he got up with the ball in his hand ,patient
and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball ,patient
um the mom is uh trying to hand the son a umbrella ,patient
uh but he doesn't want it ,patient
and so she still holds onto it ,patient
um so  now the boy is walking ,patient
and it's raining on him ,patient
and uh the rain is getting heavier ,patient
and he uh shows up in front of his mom all wet ,patient
and he's not happy about it ,patient
and she's not happy about it either ,patient
um but now he's got the umbrella ,patient
and he's continuing on his walk now with the umbrella ,patient
um the little girl wants her cat that climbed up in the tree ,patient
and so the man got up the tree to retrieve the cat ,patient
um and the ladder fell out behind him ,patient
and the dog is barking at all the excitement ,patient
and the firemen are coming to rescue uh I assume the cat and the,patient
and uh there's a bird on another branch that's singing ,patient
um the  Cinderella's dad met the woman with the two ,patient
and um then um the daughters uh were mistreating Cinderella ,patient
um they are planning to go to the b ball ,patient
um and uh they took a necklace off of Cinderella ,patient
um Cinderella was locked in a room ,patient
and uh some m mice came and  with a key and got her out ,patient
and uh then the fairy godmother provided a horse and a driver ,patient
and Cinderella danced at the ball with the prince ,patient
and um then it was almost midnight ,patient
and Cinderella hadta leave ,patient
and uh as she left she was going down the stairs ,patient
and she dropped her slipper ,patient
and uh then um think it was two men came to her house with the,patient
and it fit Cinderella's foot ,patient
then uh they knew it was Cinderella was the one who had danced,patient
and uh then  uh then uh Cinderella and the prince got,patient
um I would get uh two pieces of bread ,patient
and a jar of peanut butter ,patient
and a jar of ,patient
did you said just peanut butter ,patient
oh okay ,patient
and a jar of jelly ,patient
and a knife ,patient
and a spoon ,patient
and a plate ,patient
uh and a napkin ,patient
and then uh I would take the knife and prɛdu ,patient
and then I would take the spoon and spread a jelly on the other,patient
and then you would uh put those pieces of bread together and put,patient
