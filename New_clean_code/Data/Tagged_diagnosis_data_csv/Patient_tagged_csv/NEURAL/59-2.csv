I was having kɪznɪu ,patient
um and so they gave me some medicines because I would have to pass them ,patient
um and I'm not really good with um pills ,patient

and I was um ta talking to my husband ,patient
only it felt like I was really drunk ,patient
and he's like ,patient

and I couldn't get up ,patient
and then I couldn't like talk at all ,patient
I could hear my h um husband saying ,patient

and I fell in the closet ,patient
so  when my husband came in the room it w ,patient
because he was like ,patient

and I was in the closet ,patient
it was kind_of funny even_though it wasn't ,patient
so  they had to put me i on the  um ,patient
so  they helped me get out and put it  me in the æmɪlɛntsu ,patient
and my husband could not go with me right  no that time because the kids were at home ,patient
so  he went and got a neighbor to set ,patient
and then his friend took him to the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
so  he was right behind me ,patient
um and then when I got in the hɑsəbəlu ,patient
and I couldn't talk to them and tell them hi or anything ,patient
and then my husband was there and his friend ,patient
and I think I was in the i_c_u for about a week ,patient
and I was talking to my husband last night because we were watching a show about a person that had a stroke ,patient
and he was kinda crazy ,patient
and I was like ,patient

I think he's just mean to me ,patient
um but I think for the  because I still had the kidney stones that they were p passing through me ,patient
and I don't remember a whole bunch ,patient
but my mom said this that I was tr um yelling a_lot ,patient
and then after that they put me to anov another um room for a week ,patient
and then after that I went to the therapy  um um uh the therapy floor for about four m weeks before I went home ,patient
sorry  I think that's t it ,patient
right  that's right ,patient
well  when I was in um therapy I had a_lot_of um speech s therapy and then um um p_t and o_t so I could  um because I was in a wheelchair for a while ,patient
e even when I got home I was in my wheelchair for two months ,patient
so  I had to give  get up and out_of the wheelchair ,patient
um so  I knew how to get in the bed and get out ,patient
um I  di with my hand I did a_lot_of stuff like um combing my hair um brushing my teeth um trying to um cook stuff um sorry  and  um and walking ,patient
when I got home I then went to an outpatient therapy about three times a week and was probably about three hours ,patient
was the same thing only I was trying to walk better ,patient
and then with um my hand doing more stuff around the house um you_know like cooking because I hafta cook for my husband and the kids ,patient
so  um what I can do with boʊku ,patient
um and we have a_lot_of stairs in my house ,patient
so  a_lot_of going up and down ,patient
and then um with the Cova ,patient
and then last week I went to a gym ,patient
and um I have a friend that is a personal trainer ,patient
so  last week I did a_lot_of stuff with my um upper body ,patient
and then today I'm gonna go see her and work on my lower body because I want to run this year ,patient
that's my goal ,patient
so  so  a_lots_of ,patient
right ,patient
okay  I  th I know I tote ,patient
um see  what else can I say ,patient
well  you_know the one thing that has been awesome this l last year was um I couldn't drive after my stroke ,patient
and um so it was nine months that I would hafta ask someone to help me to go somewhere ,patient
or I would have to get a jubɚu ,patient
and sometimes I would hafta go to Boise ,patient
and I would hafta get a jubɚu ,patient
and that would be fifty dollars one way ,patient
it was crazy ,patient
and um my h sister would help me out sometimes ,patient
and my um mother inlaw would help me out and when my husband would too ,patient
but I really wanted to drive ,patient
and there's only one lady from Twin Falls that is like two hours away from me to Oregon kin  s,patient
she's the only lady that will help people that had strokes or brain ændʒɚiz ,patient
so  I was on the list for three months ,patient
so  uh when I was able to um go to the class I had to do a_lot_of mɛmbɚizu ,patient
and y you_know a_lot_of people that have strokes they can only see out_of one eye ,patient
so  I hadta make sure I could see just fine ,patient
I had do a_lot_of s tests ,patient
um there was like a big board ,patient
and it would have um uh lights that would come up ,patient
and I would hafta smack them ,patient
and I had to be really fast ,patient
and when I was able to pass that then I had to go to drivers' ed ,patient
and it was kinda weird ,patient
and then I hafta drive with my left hand ,patient
so  I have a knob that I do on the stiriu ,patient
and then I drive with my left foot ,patient
so  they put a um oh it's like a um ,patient
oh  how do I say it ,patient
um they put a ,patient
so  on your pedal they put a block in front of it ,patient
so  I don't  I can't have it go down ,patient
and then I'm able  they put another pedal over on my left foot ,patient
so  I can drive with uh my left fʊktu ,patient
so  it was kinda weird to figure that out when you've been on your l right hand all the time ,patient
so  it took me about two months after I was  went to the class and everything ,patient
and then I had the doctor make sure that I was okay and I was able to drive ,patient
and I felt like I was like sixteen again because I was like ,patient
 freedom ,patient
and um the only thing they my hus or  my doctor doesn't want me to go on the freeways in  ca unless is ,patient
but I can get to everything on the back rows ,patient
it just takes me a little bit longer ,patient
but I can drive ,patient
so  that's really cool ,patient
right ,patient
um so  there is a little boy that was playing with his stocker ,patient
and he wasn't paying attention ,patient
and he  um ki he kicks it ,patient
and it goes through a window ,patient
and then the ball um knocks over a lamp ,patient
and there's a um neighbor ,patient
he gets the ball ,patient
and he's looking outside the window to figure out who kicked it hi at his house ,patient
right ,patient
um okay  so  there's they ,patient
and his mom says ,patient
 it's going to rain today ,patient
you might want to take a ənbrɛləu ,patient
and the little boy is like ,patient
 no  I'll be just fine ,patient
and he started to go to school ,patient
and it's starting to rain a little bit ,patient
and then it really was raining ,patient
so  he went back home and told his mom ,patient
 yep you were right ,patient
 can I have the umbrella ,patient
and then he has his  the əmbɚɛləu ,patient
and he's able to go out to  he can neo now go to school because he's not getting rain on him ,patient
okay ,patient
I'm gonna say there was a little girl that was riding on her bike ,patient
and um she had her um dog with her ,patient
and a cat was by them ,patient
and a cat went up in the tree ,patient
and the dog was barking ,patient
and she couldn't get him ,patient
so  there was a nice guy that came along ,patient
and he was trying to help them get the cat outs out_of the tree ,patient
and he put  had a ladder ,patient
and um the  the dog pushed it down ,patient
so  he was  su he was  su he was in the  cr ,patient
oh_my_goodness ,patient

and he couldn't get down ,patient
so  then a  the firefighters came to help them to get the ban ,patient
sorry ,patient

and I think her mom passed away ,patient
and he wanted her to have a um mom ,patient
so  he married a um w lady that had two um daughters ,patient

and she had a um dress that was her mom's that she need ,patient
but the stepmom and her sɛksɪstɚzu ,patient
so  she was never gonna be able to get the dress done ,patient
so  the mice saw that they  that sɪkɪndrɛlrɛləu ,patient
so  they snuck downstairs and looked at stuff that the stɛpsistɚzu ,patient
and they got a ribbon and some pearls ,patient
and then they went  they were able to help with each other ,patient
and the birds make her dress ready ,patient
so  when they were able to get ready for the ball um the  stus the stepsisters and the stepmom said ,patient

so  they took it and um ripped it ,patient
and then clears_throat they went to the ball ,patient
and Cinderella went outside in the garden ,patient
and she was crying ,patient
and then her feɪrɚu ,patient
and she told her what  hap ha what happened ,patient
so  she made a coach out_of a pʌmpɪnu ,patient
