uh sometimes my speech is good ,patient
sometimes it  uh it is not so good ,patient
uh vocabulary I miss some words ,patient
sometimes I can't think the word ,patient
uh sometimes I think I don't enunciate real clearly ,patient
um other times it's better ,patient
sometimes is good ,patient
sʌmzətɑɪmu ,patient
um oh let's see ,patient
yeah sometimes I say things backwards ,patient
does it  does it  is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching ,patient
I said some things backwards ,patient
so  if I'll say ,patient
 um uh if it's  if it  if it's big I'd say small and so_forth ,patient
um I think those are the main issues I have ,patient
no I don't remember anything for about six weeks ,patient
the first memories that I had after my stroke are  were very cloudy ,patient
uh and they were not accurate  uh they were not accurate ,patient
for example I  I remember being in a wheelchair ,patient
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair ,patient
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the weɪrtʃeɪru ,patient
and I was strapped in because I couldn't sit up on my own ,patient
uh those  um for about two months I  I  I really didn't  I couldn't remember  I remembered  al remembered almost nothing ,patient
um and some of the things I had were um very much um incorrect ,patient
um I found out later things I thought ,patient
and then uh when I first started remembering things um I was mooz was at that point I was moved to a uh rɪləbɪləteɪʃɪnu ,patient
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct uh somewhat accurate ,patient
uh and that was probably um month and a half or two months in ,patient
then I  uh I started remembering things but  but it was slow coming back very slow coming back ,patient
um one thing that  that I didn't know was that uh as I was  as it was coming and waking up I guess I was getting  getting around to being able to talk ,patient
I thought I was talking ,patient
but I found out later that I wasn't  that I couldn't talk clearly ,patient
I couldn't say anything ,patient
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling ,patient
and so I don't remember when I started talking because in my mind I was always talking just  just fine ,patient
and I felt like  uh feel like  you feel like maybe I was uh a baby tried to talk ,patient
and I thought everybody should understand me ,patient
but apparently in_fact nobody did ,patient
and um that happened for a long that ,patient
well  in my mind I've always been able to talk right ,patient
now um maybe in the last year or so I'm much more aware of the fact that I don't talk plainly ,patient
um th that  that's  that's kind_of the um the story of my memories that I  that I have ,patient
well  it was laugh ,patient
still is ,patient
well  I was  I spent six months in uh um first of all in some oh I guess critical care places ,patient
and then uh went to  went to  after about two months I went  went into um the um long term ,patient
well  I went to  went to a couple of rehab hospitals for awhile for two or three weeks each ,patient
and uh then I started remembering ,patient
and I started doing some  some therapy of that sort at that time ,patient
um I couldn't do much of anything ,patient
um I thought I could do more than I really could ,patient
um but I really couldn't do much ,patient
I  uh after six months I got  got home ,patient
and I did some  uh I had somebody come uh on outpatient basis and work with me for about six weeks ,patient
uh a physical therapist was  uh a speech therapist and  um and um occupational therapist ,patient
uh at that point I really d wasn't doing much by myself because I really didn't know what to do ,patient
uh probably after about  um oh maybe after about a year I started kind_of figuring out on my own stuff I needed to do ,patient
I started  you_know um I did  I did have somebody that I worked with ,patient
he was  uh he was kind_of a cognitive um specialist is about west ,patient
he worked with me for about three years ,patient
and I really felt like he did quite a bit of good to  in terms of my cognition ,patient
and uh I worked  uh worked on um ,patient
I don't know if you've heard of uh uh Brain_HQ ,patient
have  are you familiar with that program ,patient
okay ,patient
so  I've worked  I worked with the Brain_HQ program um a_lot um for four years maybe five years now whatever ,patient
um of_course I've  I've done  I've  I've worked  I've  when I finished  um when I finished the time that I had for uh physical therapy ,patient
you_know there's a limit  limit on how much you can do in physical therapy according to Medicare ,patient
um I  s I started going to the  um to the YMCA uh twice a week ,patient
and I worked with a  uh worked with a uh trainer there who was really good at helping me uh do some things I needed to do ,patient
uh and then I also started going sometimes to the YMCA on my own um just to get more  more time in of w working at stuff like that ,patient
um I  wor are you familiar with  um with um FitMi ,patient
and uh I can see you're not ,patient
are you familiar with Flint Rehab ,patient
okay y you should be ,patient
um look up Flint Rehab on the line because I have  I have the  um I have the um MusicGlove ,patient
and I have the um FitMi ,patient
and it  an from  from  from um Flint Rehab ,patient
and they also have uh exercises online that you can do ,patient
so  I  y it's  it's helped me to have that resource a_lot ,patient
um I would  uh you_know I'd encourage anybody who's had a stroke to maybe l look at that ,patient
um they have a  uh they have a  the  uh Flint Rehab has  has this uh uh webpage on  on Facebook ,patient
and it's  it's more of  it's kind_of a uh support webpage ,patient
so  you can hear other stories and so_forth other people and what they're dealing with and what they're kʌmpɪnʃtɑu ,patient
um do you work on a_lot with  with stroke ,patient
you work a_lot with stroke victims ,patient
yeah ,patient
yeah I'm  I'm sure you haven't yeah ,patient
but I would  I would  I would  I mentioned that because I think it's a good resource for anybody who had a stroke ,patient
and I'd certainly encourage you as  as somebody who wants to work with stroke victims to  um to become familiar with the reher re resources that they offer ,patient
um I think there's  there's also a  um a re ,patient
become  become familiar with recently was there's a book called um uh stroke warrior ,patient
I think it  it's a  it's a good resource ,patient
um it's  it's a  written by an individual who's  who had a serious  serious stroke when her  in her  in her forties ,patient
um am I getting off the  off the track here ,patient
tell me what  tell me  get me back on track ,patient
and I'll  where should I be ,patient
and  well  you know I  I do a  I've done a_lot_of things ,patient
and I've done you_know a_lot_of uh physical activity kinds of things like my stationary bike ,patient
um I've done a_lot_of um mental stuff uh like the um uh ,patient
or I useta do that when I first came home ,patient
I did a_lot_of crosswords and sudoku and stuff like that ,patient
um I've just tried to do a_lot_of  d I've tried to do a_lot_of stuff on my own to  to get better ,patient
and um that's it ,patient
just something that happened to me ,patient
um you_know I've done a_lot_of traveling ,patient
that count ,patient
that work ,patient
yeah I've  I've done  yeah I've done several trips with ,patient
my wife and I have done several trips ,patient
um and uh we've gone to Europe several times ,patient
and I have just really really enjoyed that ,patient
um yeah I  I just couldn't  couldn't really describe each trip to you ,patient
but that  that's something ,patient
something else that  maybe I should tell you this ,patient
this is  maybe it's  maybe I can go into a little more detail here ,patient
um I  I really enjoy riding bicycles ,patient
and um we've  we've done a_lot_of r riding bicycling uh my wife and I for number of years ,patient
and um we've done you_know like um a bicycle ride all the way across Kansas ,patient
it's called Biking Across Kansas ,patient
we've done  uh we've done  we  we had a group that we went biking with once or twice a week um thirty to fifty miles at a  at a time ,patient
we'd go  go somewhere and ride somewhere for breakfast and come back ,patient
I just  it was a_lot  really a_lot_of fan ,patient
really we enjoyed that ,patient
um yeah it  it  yeah I  I've enjoyed work  you_know riding bike and working on the bicycles ,patient
and it  it  it's been something that we can do together and really enjoy doing it ,patient
so  let's see ,patient
the kid is out kicking the soccer ball ,patient
uh yeah he kicks it pretty hard ,patient
goes up  uh up pretty high ,patient
and it goes pretty far ,patient
and it goes through somebody's window ,patient
and uh then it goes through  it goes through the window ,patient
and the  this guy is  the guy is sitting there in the  in the chair as the  as the  uh as the ball comes crashing through the window and hits the lamp  knocks the lamp off and uh scares him  I guess ,patient
and then I'm not sure exactly what happens after that ,patient
but yeah there's a hole in the window then ,patient
there's a hole in the window ,patient
and he  the guy is holding the soccer ball looking out the window ,patient
uh so  not sure what he's gonna do about the  uh about the kid who kicked the soccer ball through the window ,patient
that's about it ,patient
now  yeah ,patient
I'm not sure ,patient
well  let's see here ,patient
yeah it w hit the window with the shutters on that ,patient
um th there's a  there's a problem here because when the  when the ball comes through the window there's a lamp there ,patient
and in  in the final picture the  the lamp is gone ,patient
uh yeah the chair is gone  the chair he was sitting in is gone ,patient
um and the guy's standing there and next to the window  I guess ,patient
but the chair and the lamp are gone ,patient
so  not sure what happened there ,patient
okay that's about it ,patient
okay ,patient
um well  the  the  the  the little kid is going off to school ,patient
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him ,patient
but he's kinda waving it off saying ,patient
 no I don't need umbrella ,patient
 um yeah I'm going off to school ,patient
 I'll be okay ,patient
so  he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye ,patient
and um he gets out there going on his way to school ,patient
and it starts raining ,patient
and you can see he's kinda a_little worried there and worry it rains more and more ,patient
and s now it's  uh it's a downpour ,patient
and it's raining pretty hard ,patient
and he's kinda running to get outta the rain ,patient
and um he ran back home ,patient
and uh he  he did uh see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the uh umbrella ,patient
so  then he uh gets the umbrella to go off to school ,patient
and he's happy going off to school with his umbrella ,patient
okay ,patient
well  the story is that um this little girl's cat got up in the tree ,patient
and the  uh the dad went up to get the  get the cat down ,patient
and he's got stuck in the tree ,patient
and uh the  the dog is standing there barking up the tree ,patient
I don't know if he's barking because he's trying to get that guy down or what ,patient
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down ,patient
and in the process somehow the ladder ,patient
maybe the dog hit the ladder ,patient
but it  uh the ladder got knocked down ,patient
so  the guy couldn't get  couldn't climb down the ladder ,patient
so  they hadta call a fire department ,patient
and they came ,patient
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder ,patient
and uh they're going to uh get the  get the  get the guy down from the tree ,patient
now the cat in the meantime is sitting up in the tree ,patient
and um I don't know if he's taking a nap or just ,patient
but he doesn't really care ,patient
he's not bothering him ,patient
uh the little girl probably was  musta been riding her tricycle because it's sitting there ,patient
uh but she is now trying to coax the cat down ,patient
uh there's a bird there in the tree ,patient
and he's just kinda singing away and probably i is oblivious to everything else that's going on ,patient
um that's pretty much it ,patient
the girl's got pigtails and all of that ,patient
so  maybe she's a tomboy or something ,patient
I don't know ,patient
that's about it ,patient
that's it ,patient
okay ,patient
well  Cinderella was a  uh Cinderella was I guess ,patient
I think there was a  I think that uh Cinderella was actually had to work for the uh who's the  the got evil sisters ,patient
and they weren't very nice to her ,patient
they made her do the laundry ,patient
um obviously in the story here all the  uh all the animals loved Cinderella because they're all in  they're all around whenever she is ,patient
and they  they found that they  they like her a_lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her thing ,patient
um so the  um the  um the  the king has a son ,patient
he's looking for a  uh looking for a bride for his  his son ,patient
I didn't say that right did I ,patient
yeah he was looking for a bride for his son ,patient
and uh uh they  they were  he had  they were gonna have a ball ,patient
so  they could all come and  and uh see who  who she ,patient
and uh she was looking out the window in this one picture ,patient
she was looking out the window kinda dreaming about it ,patient
but uh she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball ,patient
so  um they all went to the ball ,patient
and  well  the  uh uh I don't remember exactly how it was that she ended up ,patient
I guess the  the fairy godmother came while she was at  while they were at the ball ,patient
the fairy godmother took a  told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that she'd uh take her to the ball in ,patient
and it was a  a pumpkin carriage and uh gonna take them to the ball ,patient
and uh I remember this one picture there that seemed a_little weird ,patient
the horses were sitting on their hind legs with their  kinda with their feet up something like you_know ,patient
they were  they were standing there on four legs ,patient
uh it was kinda weird ,patient
and uh so uh the fairy godmother took her to the ball ,patient
and uh she at the ball and uh went in ,patient
and nobody knew this  knew who it was uh because she was so  uh so beautiful ,patient
nobody knew who she was ,patient
and they had the ball ,patient
and the  and the prince  the prince liked her ,patient
and  um and then the  um the  the um chimes went off in the clock  big clock  Big_Ben or whatever ,patient
and  uh and  w and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before or  back home before midnight ,patient
and it was after midnight ,patient
and uh so she got up ,patient
she ran out ,patient
and uh her slipper fell off ,patient
and she went on ,patient
she got home um without the slipper ,patient
and then uh the  uh the prince started looking for whoever it was that had the  sl the slipper ,patient
and he was trying  t he was uh trying the slipper on  er on everybody in the kingdom ,patient
and um finally the  um the  um the  um they wanted to  he wanted to try it onto Cinderella ,patient
but I think they  they the  the  the bad th th evil sisters didn't want her  didn't want him to ,patient
but he did anyway ,patient
he ,patient
and it fit ,patient
and  uh and the end uh Cinderella married the prince and uh lived happily ever after I guess ,patient
okay ,patient
well  I guess uh first thing I do is go to the pantry ,patient
and I get out the peanut butter ,patient
and uh then I go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out ,patient
and um I'd get some bread out_of the freezer  uh the refrigerator because that's where we keep the bread ,patient
keeps it fresh  fresh ,patient
and uh then I would  um I would um take out two pieces of bread ,patient
and I'd spread  uh I'd spread peanut butter on one of them ,patient
and then I would spread jelly on the other one ,patient
and I would um uh put the two together ,patient
and I'd have a uh peanut butter dʒænu ,patient
and then I would uh put the bread away back in the refrigerator ,patient
and I'd put the peanut butter away in the uh pantry ,patient
and I'd put the  uh um the jelly away in the refrigerator ,patient
and then I'd sit down and eat my peanut butter sandwich with a glass of milk ,patient
