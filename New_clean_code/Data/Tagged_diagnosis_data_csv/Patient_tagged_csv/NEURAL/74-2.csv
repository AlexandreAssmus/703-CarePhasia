text,diagnosis
well  it's doing fairly well except when I get in a hurry laughs and try to describe something for someone ,patient
that's where I have more problem with speech than anything  I think ,patient
is des describing something for somebody else to he know what I'm trying to uh talk about ,patient
especially FirstnameP my wife laughs ,patient
seems like you_know I'm think ,patient
 she oughta know this ,patient
and then you_know get the details ,patient
and then sometimes the details don't  don't work well ,patient
so ,patient
all I remember about the stroke is the fact I woke up one morning with a splitting headache ,patient
and it was so bad that uh ,patient
I think it's probably the worst headache I ever had ,patient
um took a couple aspirin and went to  uh outside and picked up the mail  my  not the mail but  my newspaper ,patient
went back to have breakfast ,patient
and uh as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast I tried to read ,patient
and I could not make  read the paper properly ,patient
the blocks of words ch were just that ,patient
they were blocks ,patient
and some of it  they weren't s all together ,patient
it was like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words not the whole words ,patient
so  I left the newspaper that morning and didn't uh read it and finished getting ready and went to work ,patient
and uh drove to work ,patient
and on the way to work I uh noticed that on the dashboard of the car  again parts of that was  I could see parts of the dashboard ,patient
and parts of it I couldn't see ,patient
I couldn't see all the words all that ,patient
but I was able to drive properly ,patient
and uh drove to work ,patient
got to work ,patient
and when I tried to  got to work I tried to log into my computer ,patient
and I didn't know how ,patient
I think that's probably the best thing I can say about that ,patient
I didn't know how to log in ,patient
I didn't know my username ,patient
I didn't know my password ,patient
anything ,patient
and I just had a total blank with that ,patient
so  uh I worked at it for a while and couldn't  couldn't do anything ,patient
so  I finally went to my boss and said ,patient
hey I've got a problem ,patient
 I've got a headache ,patient
 and uh I just can't  can't log in ,patient
and uh I was asked ,patient
 just take time ,patient
 and find a place to rest and relax ,patient
 and come back in a_little while and try again ,patient
so  I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again ,patient
and I couldn't make it ,patient
so  I finally said ,patient
 I  I can't uh do it ,patient
 I need to go home ,patient
so  I went home and went to bed ,patient
uh when I got home I took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and spent most of the day in bed ,patient
and I  I slept ,patient
and then when I got up in the afternoon I was able to uh read ,patient
I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that ,patient
but it still was problems ,patient
and um I do Sudokus the puzzle ,patient
and uh I did that on the computer and was able to do it ,patient
it took much much longer than normally to do it the puzzle ,patient
but uh I was able to complete that ,patient
and then uh had a normal evening and went to bed early ,patient
got up the next day and went to uh exercise class with a group that we meet at  early in the mornings on Monday Wednesday and Friday ,patient
and this was a Friday morning that ,patient
I'd gone to work on Thursday ,patient
couldn't work ,patient
so  then Friday when I got up I went exercise with the group ,patient
and with the group uh we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up ,patient
and while we're walking we talk and visit with each_other ,patient
and uh when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didn't make sense as far as the  the words that I was uh speaking ,patient
uh the words were correct ,patient
but they were not making sense as complete words ,patient
so  I said  knew there was something wrong ,patient
my friends knew there was something wrong ,patient
so I  when I got through the exercise class ,patient
we spent an hour exercising together ,patient
I went home and uh had breakfast ,patient
and uh I told FirstnameP ,patient
I said ,patient
 there's something wrong ,patient
 I need to  to go to the doctor ,patient
that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor laughs ,patient
and she decided that rather_than that we'd take me to the emergency room ,patient
and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke ,patient
and so I spent the next three days ,patient
well  there was a problem with my heart ,patient
uh my heart was beating too fast and out_of rhythm ,patient
and so they spent most of the time from the next two or three days correcting that issue ,patient
and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia ,patient
and they'd discovered that I'd had a stroke and had aphasia ,patient
so  that's pretty much where I am ,patient
laughs well  I tried to ,patient
no  I  I really didn't you_know ,patient
I just thought I had a headache you_know ,patient
and uh talking with FirstnameP later she said on  on the Wednesday the day before I woke up with a headache she said ,patient
 you had a headache that  that day too ,patient
like Wednesday night late I'd tol mentioned that I had a headache then ,patient
so  I don't remember that at all  that part of it ,patient
but it's ,patient
so ,patient
yes ,patient
yes I do ,patient
yeah  yeah ,patient
well  I think the best thing that happened was uh I got a great therapist ,patient
and uh she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction ,patient
it's finding what uh needed to be done ,patient
and then working with me to uh uh get that ,patient
but basically I went therapy three times a week for several months ,patient
and then dropped down to a couple times a week and uh we  uh til finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us were  you_know I'd al already done all of them ,patient
and um reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it ,patient
so  uh yeah ,patient
but uh starting  I've got a squirrel running across my uh patio laughs ,patient
uh never_mind ,patient
let go of that one ,patient
uh but um part of it starting out was uh almost like we looked at the pictures with the  that we saw with all the drawings of different things ,patient
I had the same thing sitting in a  go in the room ,patient
sit in here ,patient
look around ,patient
and name each object I see in that room and uh say it out loud ,patient
you_know I'd tell I can figure ,patient
you_know sometimes  you_know you know all these words ,patient
you know all these items ,patient
but you don't aim  not able to pull those words out ,patient
and the same thing driving down the street ,patient
you look at uh say a mailbox ,patient
say  say that word out loud ,patient
mailbox ,patient
post off uh you_know and um hedges ,patient
whatever  you_know whatever you see make a name ,patient
you_know bring a name for that item ,patient
and it's something that I've kept along with all the  as long as I've had a  s aphasia now ,patient
it's  you_know when I look at something I'll say the name of that item just to keep  keep it going ,patient
and so that's uh one of the things I do all the time ,patient
I  I don't even think about it a_lot_of the times ,patient
it's just something automatic to do ,patient
okay ,patient
the boy was out playing in the yard kicking a soccer ball ,patient
he kicked the soccer ball a_little too hard in the wrong way ,patient
and it hit a window and broke ,patient
the window ,patient
and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor ,patient
I'm not sure who this person is whether it's his father or neighbor ,patient
and then the uh adult was watching out_of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broken his window ,patient
well  at this point we don't see his face ,patient
and from   I would say he's upset about it ,patient
but I'm not sure how much ,patient
you can't see the expression on the face ,patient
alright ,patient
a mom and the boy ,patient
looks like he's got a backpack on going  getting ready to go to school ,patient
but it must be raining outside or look like it's raining ,patient
and she said ,patient
 you need to take your umbrella ,patient
he said ,patient
 no  I can go out without it ,patient
so  he l left home without the umbrella ,patient
and as he was walking to school it started raining ,patient
and uh he realized that was getting wet ,patient
so  uh ran back ,patient
and uh his mom was upset about it ,patient
but he got his umbrella and went back out to  and went back to school carrying his umbrella ,patient
alright ,patient
at the beginning it looks like the little girl was out in the yard on her tricycle ,patient
the dog was out in the yard ,patient
and the cat was out in the yard ,patient
dog chased the cat up the tree ,patient
and uh the little girl got upset then got her father to get the cat out_of the tree ,patient
he brought the ladder out  climbed the ladder and in the process knocked the ladder down and got stuck in the tree ,patient
and then they had to call the f fire department to uh rescue the father and the cat ,patient
so  and hopefully that's where everybody got back down on the ground after the  from the ladder the firemen brought ,patient
okay ,patient
alright ,patient
Cinderella ,patient
story started out when she was a small young girl ,patient
and her  uh apparently her mother died ,patient
and her father brought home a stepmother ,patient
and uh they met whe when she was young ,patient
and um met with her stepsisters as_well ,patient
uh and as they grew it looked like more and more she was  acted as a servant rather than uh a child  or a girl in the family  as part of the family ,patient
she was more of uh a uh servant ,patient
and uh so they grew up that way ,patient
uh and then uh over time she uh got to know the animals in the home ,patient
uh horse and the dog and the mice ,patient
and uh had more of a friends with those than with uh the other two people ,patient
uh and then uh as she grew the uh family  or the king in that neighbor neighborhood  city whatever uh had a son that was grown same time ,patient
and he decided the son needed to uh meet a girl his age and possibly um ,patient
don't know what the situation was there ,patient
but anyway he decided to uh create a ball to bring all of the eligible girls in the n kingdom and  and uh meet them and decide who might uh be his uh girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it ,patient
and so uh they sent that invitation out ,patient
the uh stepmother saw it and planned on taking his ,patient
Cinderella wanted to go as_well ,patient
so  she with the help of the uh animals made a  build a  a dress for her a gown and uh showed it to her stepmother and the uh daught  or the sisters ,patient
and uh they ended up in  damaged it  tore it ,patient
so  she couldn't wear it ,patient
and somehow she got  her godmother found out about it and uh helped her get another dress and uh changed  and set the uh animals up as a coach and horses and took her to the ball ,patient
and while she was at the ball she met the princess ,patient
prince liked her and spent most of the time with her ,patient
the other people were  the girls were jealous ,patient
uh but they they danced and got along well ,patient
but she had to leave at midnight ,patient
she  w she was running out ,patient
she lost her  one of her slippers as they were leaving ,patient
it was too late ,patient
so  he sent people out looking for slipper to match the girl ,patient
and uh eventually they found it at their home ,patient
the uh stepmothers  stepsisters didn't  uh weren't able to fit it ,patient
the mother tried to break the glass slipper ,patient
and uh they recovered it ,patient
and they got  got the princess or  to the Cinderella ,patient
she was able to wear it ,patient
and she showed them also the other one that she had ,patient
so  she had those to prove that she was the person that uh actually had the slipper ,patient
and uh then got together with the prince again and lived happily ever after ,patient
laughs that's it ,patient
get two pieces of butter or  two pieces of uh bread ,patient
get a jar of peanut butter  a jar of jelly ,patient
put uh peanut butter on one side of the bread on one piece of bread  jelly on the other ,patient
put them together ,patient
and you have a sa peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
