text,diagnosis
um most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well ,patient
but it s seems like when I get in a situation where I'm in a hurry is more uh when my speech or my  I lose some of the  the words that I want ,patient
and I found that the  going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know I'm hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my  my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it ,patient
so  that's what I do for you_know my help ,patient
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache ,patient
uh I normally in the morning go out get the paper  have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work ,patient
and um I went out and got the paper ,patient
I still had a splitting headache ,patient
I took a couple of aspirin  came in and uh had a bowl of cereal for breakfast ,patient
and uh while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper ,patient
and I opened it up ,patient
and I could not read what was on the newspaper ,patient
I couldn't see a whole paragraph ,patient
and blocks of characters were missing altogether ,patient
so  that's the first thing ,patient
so  I just  I set the uh paper aside and said ,patient
 okay  I'll read it when I get home ,patient
and um got dressed and went to work ,patient
I w droving ,patient
and um what I was seeing on the highway again on the uh dashboard of the car I couldn't see all of the inf ins instrumentation on the dash ,patient
but I was able to drive fine and go to work ,patient
uh no problem at all there ,patient
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office ,patient
and I couldn't remember my login ,patient
didn't know how to log in ,patient
and uh I still had the headache ,patient
I uh talked to my boss and  and told her what was going on ,patient
she said ,patient
 just take it easy for awhile and see if you can later ,patient
remember  I took probably a half hour  forty five minutes and still couldn't ,patient
so  I said ,patient
 I  I just can't do it ,patient
 I'm going to go home ,patient
I came home  took a_couple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day ,patient
that was on a Thursday ,patient
on Friday morning I got up ,patient
and I exercise on Friday  Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning ,patient
so  I went to exercise class ,patient
and um I exercised ,patient
but when I was with the group I was talking ,patient
and what I was saying wasn't making sense to me ,patient
wasn't making sense to any of my friends ,patient
you_know they  the words were correct ,patient
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words ,patient
they didn't fit whiff ,patient
and so I said ,patient
 there's something wrong there ,patient
so  I came back home and uh had breakfast when I got back from uh exercise ,patient
and then I normally would go to work ,patient
but I couldn't go to work ,patient
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to uh see my doctor ,patient
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a  hear heart  col the oncolo uh heart doctor ,patient
and she s talked me instead to go to the emergency room ,patient
went to the emergency room ,patient
and they discovered that I'd had a stroke ,patient
and so they put me in the hospital ,patient
and uh I was there three days ,patient
they were trying  basically my heart was out_of rhythm and uh was beating too fast and lots_of different things ,patient
so  they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized ,patient
and then three more days basically discovering that uh I'd had uh a stroke and aphasia ,patient
and um then I was  went home after the  trying to think what day of the week it was ,patient
Wednesday  Wednesday I went home ,patient
and uh Thursday I drove back to the  drove then because I could drive ,patient
I could s everything  do everything I needed to do except talk laughs ,patient
so  I went to make a appointment with the uh uh speech therapy at that point ,patient
and that's where it started ,patient
well  it started out with something simple because basically I could look at  at anything and know what it was ,patient
but I couldn't pull the words out ,patient
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example ,patient
looking around the room ,patient
looking at each object in the room ,patient
naming it ,patient
trying to find the  the word and say the word out loud ,patient
you_know so  that's where it first started ,patient
and it built from there ,patient
you_know just  and some of the things we sa looked at just a few minutes ago you_know like with the pictures ,patient
you_know look at the picture ,patient
name the picture ,patient
and over time that gradually got better and better ,patient
but uh that's where I think the start with the therapy was ,patient
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out ,patient
and I found when writing I  taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldn't spell properly anymore ,patient
and you_know that was something I had to work at ,patient
so  I found that with my uh keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil ,patient
and with a notebood ,patient
it  it has a spellchecker and a  spell ,patient
uh not  I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily ,patient
a checker ,patient
but it starts out  you_know if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work ,patient
so  that sometimes helped a_lot as_well writing ,patient
so  uh I've done a_lot_of that ,patient
but it's mainly uh uh working with seeing what uf  seeing the words and then saying it out loud ,patient
that's done more I think better than anything else ,patient
and I worked hard at it for a long time ,patient
and then I took  got kind_of  st afterwards I've kinda gotten a_little slow about it ,patient
or not slow but just haven't done it as diligently as I used to ,patient
but uh for the first months after the stroke I was  I worked hard at it ,patient
trying to pull those pictures back ,patient
and I found that you  it's  it's like learning in school again grade school ,patient
you look at a word ,patient
and you learn that word ,patient
and  and oh that's that word ,patient
and it comes back and stays back ,patient
but with aphasia it doesn't stay there ,patient
it's  it's more like having uh an electronic dictionary that is  occasionally gets scrambled ,patient
you_know it's like ,patient
 okay  I know that word ,patient
 it's not in the dictionary where it should be ,patient
 it's over there instead ,patient
you_know that type of thing ,patient
so ,patient
happy ,patient
I think when my grandson was born ,patient
he was a joy to be around ,patient
and uh I got to spend a_lot_of time with him when he was little and an infant ,patient
and uh watching him grow ,patient
and just  that was special ,patient
he's ten now ,patient
and he's doesn't spend as much crime ,patient
and he's off doing other things ,patient
so ,patient
okay ,patient
boy's out kicking a soccer ball ,patient
kicked it ,patient
got a_little too close ,patient
kicked it through the window ,patient
I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad ,patient
but the window  s,patient
and a  uh I'd say his dad saw it ,patient
opened looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball ,patient
okay ,patient
in the beginning the mom sent little boy out to go to school ,patient
she ,patient
and he didn't want to take his umbrella ,patient
so  he said ,patient
 I'll be fine without it  mom ,patient
and he went out  and he went out ,patient
and the rain started raining ,patient
and so he ran back to the house ,patient
and his mom was upset with him and  hu for going out without the umbrella ,patient
and so he got a r umbrella ,patient
and went back out with an umbrella the next time ,patient
alright ,patient
well  it looks like the beginning the little girl was riding her bicycle  or tricycle ,patient
and the dog or ,patient
and the dog chased the cat up the tree ,patient
and so she called back to her dad and said ,patient
 the cat's stuck in the tree ,patient
and he got out a ladder ,patient
went out to climb up to get the cat down ,patient
and the ladder fell ,patient
and so they hadta call the fire to help him and the cat get down the tree ,patient
so  that's pretty much the story ,patient
alright ,patient
Cinderella ,patient
well  originally apparently her mother died ,patient
and um sh her and her family were comfortably welloff ,patient
and uh that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters as_well that moved in with her ,patient
and they were not very friendly with her ,patient
and over time  her father must be out_of the picture for some reason because she  the change of the  Cinderella and the family changed dramatically ,patient
and she became more of a slave than a  s a sister and the girl and the mother ,patient
and uh things got worse and worse as she got older ,patient
and uh one point in time she got acquainted ,patient
or how do I say it ,patient
she uh learned to live with the animals in the home  in the family or  in the house and uh outside the home as_well ,patient
and uh they became her friends instead of uh her s stepsisters ,patient
and uh that developed over time ,patient
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his  the princess ,patient
so  he  they planned on a uh ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the  the kingdom ,patient
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave  not take sepmother ,patient
and uh Cinderella had a gown somewhere  I think ,patient
from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but  a trunk someplace ,patient
and she got it out ,patient
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters ,patient
and they ended up tearing it up ,patient
and she didn't have anything ,patient
and then uh the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to uh redo her dress ,patient
her stairy ,patient
there we go ,patient
I got a word laughs ,patient
fairy godmother stepped in as_well ,patient
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into uh horses ,patient
and uh s anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball ,patient
and uh stepmother  the  the prince fell in love with uh Cinderella ,patient
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening ,patient
and they  uh Cinderella hadta  hadta leave at midnight ,patient
and as she was leaving she left her  one slipper got left behind ,patient
and uh they couldn't find her ,patient
they had to looked all over for Cinderella or  for the girl ,patient
and they couldn't find her until they finally came to her home ,patient
and uh her stepmothers couldn't  stepsisters couldn't fit the slipper ,patient
but Cinderella could ,patient
so  that's where they ended it ,patient
oh that's easy ,patient
get two pieces of bread ,patient
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife ,patient
um put the peanut butter on one side of the bread ,patient
jelly on the other ,patient
put them together ,patient
you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient
