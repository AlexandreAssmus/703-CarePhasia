it's been a_lot better than it was  yeah ,patient
ten years  you_know ten  ten years  right ,patient
I had um encephalitis um ten years before ,patient
and I hadta remember everything ,patient
so  it's in my head ,patient
but it's how when you get it out_of there  so ,patient
um I had  um I had like um encephalitis for it was  about a month ,patient
I don't even remember anything about it ,patient
but um I was in the  but when I remember they got me to start up another time ,patient
um hadta remember  how to remember how I'll talking about abck one two three um noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff ,patient
just remember how do you rewrite everything ,patient
um just taking your time ,patient
but it's still in there ,patient
and you can't just get it on there ,patient
you might talk a_couple times about it ,patient
then you're talking about the decks ,patient
and then you forgot about that one ,patient
so  it's always kind_of like that ,patient
but you can still do it ,patient
so  I'm still writing and um preposition and all that kind of stuff ,patient
just sort of thing you can do ,patient
just keep  make sure it's still doing than  better than it was ,patient
yeah  oh  it's unbelievable  yeah ,patient
um um mostly hadta remember how to um ,patient
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get ,patient
it's funny how uh my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that ,patient
I could go in the kitchen first ,patient
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that ,patient
the name ,patient
I don't remember anything about it with my head ,patient
I could sit there and making um breakfast and stuff like that ,patient
and she'd say ,patient
 um don't know ,patient
she'd put toast and I'd say ,patient
but eggs ,patient
 that's right  okay ,patient
but it takes time to get everything out_of your head outta there  so ,patient
um a_lot_of it's there ,patient
but most of it's just you can't get it out_of my head on there ,patient
um it's hard to come back around everything like that ,patient
and also  it's also because when you talk to me doesn't get the same way coming back to me ,patient
um and it's also kind_of weird because if you talk to one person and me it kind_of kills me ,patient
but if you have another person here I can understand a_lot better with that ,patient
but it's depends  depends on how it's coming on to me yeah ,patient
um like I said I hadta remember doing abck one two three everything like that ,patient
um they took me at um oh  to uh um books for the first year ,patient
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that ,patient
um just trying to get back where it was ,patient
um I yu just write trying to re just getting everything on there ,patient
so  it's  um it's like that ,patient
it's just hard ,patient
you start getting little things starting through there ,patient
but then I went to um ,patient
I don't know if you go to Chicago ,patient
there's five weeks ,patient
there we got back how to do different things around there ,patient
how you're kind_of think you're on this place I think then maybe a different one ,patient
it's like you had different places you get around there helped around ,patient
but  um so  it does get out_of there more than you can ,patient
I_mean the first time you're just going straight ,patient
and it's hard to get anything out_of there ,patient
but um I don't know ,patient
is that  did I tell you anything ,patient
when I was little first time ,patient
well  it also can be that too for  like I said for ten years it's kind_of  I really hadta remember start everything ,patient
so  I did get a remember ,patient
I did start up another time ,patient
so  it did help ,patient
um I_mean uh my mom helped me ,patient
and um different places they've  they help everything about it ,patient
but it is nice to get back up um where you can go ,patient
the bottom ,patient
I_mean it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down ,patient
I hadta go up ,patient
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were ,patient
um so  it's been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that ,patient
it helps um a_lot better ,patient
okay ,patient
the boy was out outside with a  with a soccer ball ,patient
and he was kicking around ,patient
and he kicked one really good ,patient
um but it hit right in the middle of the window on the  on the house there ,patient
um so  the next one over there her ,patient
gotta  might have been s sleeping and jumped out ,patient
and the lamp broke down there too ,patient
um but you really can't tell on number four ,patient
um it looks like he is not very happy ,patient
because he got his um soccer ball ,patient
um but he's still looking out there ,patient
and I think the  the boy musta ran away ,patient
he ran away ,patient
so  uh because he's still looking to see what he's doing ,patient
okay ,patient
um looks like mom told ,patient
and he said wellco he doesn't really want that ,patient
so  um he's moving onto the next ,patient
he says no big deal with the  he doesn't  the umbrella ,patient
so  he got outside ,patient
and it rained ,patient
um that was on number three ,patient
he's over there raining on him ,patient
number four ,patient
and it's really raining him ,patient
he's gotten water all over the place ,patient
um number five ,patient
he finally came back ,patient
and  and he didn't look that very good ,patient
and she didn't  she told him it's not very good and probably smarter that he didn't take it ,patient
um so  next time he's gonna take the umbrella when it rains ,patient
um it looks like her dad ,patient
um well  mostly the  the girl who's looking to find her cat up on top on the tree ,patient
she wanted to get it there ,patient
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder ,patient
but it fell down ,patient
so  he's stuck up there the whole time ,patient
um the dog's kinda barking at him xxx ,patient
really helping there ,patient
but um the um firemen are coming over there ,patient
they've got another ladder ,patient
they're gonna help him back up ,patient
um but I don't understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree ,patient
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat ,patient
um and the cat gets by itself anyway ,patient
um it's just kind_of ,patient
yeah I don't know ,patient
it's probably about what it is  I think ,patient
so  I'm ready huh ,patient
okay ,patient
um what it was um she has  um she's not actually with the  the people ,patient
but there's two um ,patient
it's not like they're um cousins or something like that ,patient
there's two girls ,patient
and were next by him and their mom ,patient
they're really bad ones and stuff like that or not very  um very  not very haÉªsu ,patient
of_course she's not very good  very good to her ,patient
um then she always hadta work outside and do all the  the hard things ,patient
um and they dune ,patient
they've got enough money and doing whatever they could ,patient
so  they gave a time that um they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the  the money  p the ,patient
I'm trying to say something ,patient
trying to say all the good people there ,patient
they had to go see them ,patient
and um there's  uh they got to play and music and stuff like that ,patient
um so  she would never get to go there ,patient
but um s I forget how ,patient
somehow she got in here ,patient
but um she got to go ,patient
um say exactly um ,patient
it came that she had a very unbelievable great um clothes and stuff like ,patient
they took her so_that one  one night where they got to see everyone ,patient
um and  and actually it was the  um the guy who came to see her ,patient
he was probably the best one there ,patient
he was very nice and very  the best thing he could ,patient
um and he really liked to see her ,patient
but when it was done that time he ,patient
so  he ,patient
and um so it was all done ,patient
but the next day someone actually brought those to him ,patient
because it was his ,patient
because the only ones that are big enough for him ,patient
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that ,patient
so  it didn't work for them ,patient
so  it came to him ,patient
they just told him ,patient
so  it came on to him ,patient
it goes to that ,patient
I'm not done yet ,patient
um laughs the guy  he's the  the one guy that I saw ,patient
the two um sing with him and play and stuff like that ,patient
that's where he was that night ,patient
so  he came back to make sure it was her ,patient
so  since it's her he's taken with her ,patient
so  it's going to be with her for all this  all the time and stuff like that um as much as it could be for him ,patient
that tell you anything ,patient
okay ,patient
um you should take a bread ,patient
um get some um butter out_of the refrigerator with a knife ,patient
um put some of those on the bread and also some of the um um ,patient
they're not peanuts exactly ,patient
pee close_by the peanuts ,patient
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread ,patient
so  everything feels pretty good ,patient
except for your hand probably gets all over the place ,patient
um but it's a real easy one ,patient
you can do it for about two minutes ,patient
and that's a good one to eat if you  if you you need to get something to eat ,patient
um got enough ,patient
pretty much ,patient
something  probably something to xxx ,patient
um I think you just  you_know you just take the  you took the butters ,patient
the  the um peanuts ,patient
that's not the same thing ,patient
they sit in the  it's in the um kitchen ,patient
put on a bread ,patient
and put it on a  probably put it on a plate ,patient
go over sit down on the on the table ,patient
and um have something to eat ,patient
I guess that's it ,patient
