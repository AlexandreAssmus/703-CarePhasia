my speech um I think they're not too bad ,patient
better than it was  uh it was before ,patient
yeah doing very well ,patient
not a hundred percent but you_know good enough  right ,patient
um yes it's been um a little bit more than um three years ,patient
yeah um right  be about a week before my birthday ,patient
yes had my stroke ,patient
um I had been having headaches ,patient
um and I was  I was a teacher working at a school and um working ,patient
and during that day my headache was getting more worse ,patient
and I went to the nurse that day um at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile ,patient
and as we were talking she looked at me funny ,patient
and she said that um ,patient
 are you doing okay ,patient
and I thought I was talking fine ,patient
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that ,patient
and um she knew that I was having a stroke from that ,patient
and they called five six seven eight  nineoneone ,patient
and um I don't remember ,patient
right after that when they ,patient
I remember being in the  um uh what do you call it  in the ,patient
it's not a car you_know ,patient
it's not a truck ,patient
it's  is being in there laying down you_know ,patient
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions ,patient
but I could not think ,patient
at that point it was getting worse as it goes ,patient
and um they ended up taking me ,patient
and one of the guys who does um brains he found a spot ,patient
w they made it a picture ,patient
they said that you're having  you have a s clot in your brain in the back ,patient
and it's starting to blood ,patient
and it starts to uh take um part of your uh what do you call it  uh like cells in a way that die ,patient
and so he  he ended up giving me surgery at that point and um fixed it pretty much yeah ,patient
so  um I'm still here today ,patient
but the um clot is still here ,patient
it hasn't left ,patient
so  um that's why I'm taking the medicine I am ,patient
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I  t it happened again ,patient
they said I was taking um medicine that um əræktɪdu ,patient
it  um most people don't have trouble with it ,patient
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think ,patient
they're hoping that they ,patient
yeah it's one of those things ,patient
yup ,patient
um I think at the beginning um the first thing they were helping me to stand up um to be able to walk again ,patient
they were more into that at the very beginning than other like um aphasia type stuff ,patient
they wanted to make sure I was able to  to walk again and  because my one side of my um body was starting to have trouble they said ,patient
so  they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning ,patient
they started doing some little task for me ,patient
like um we played cards to see how many cards I can find  looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that ,patient
but we were doing that just here and there feeling ,patient
um I was also very sad very um emotional feeling ,patient
didn't  I couldn't even remember who I was ,patient
and so um getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff ,patient
um once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year ,patient
so  um said ,patient
 let's go for our therapy now ,patient
 let's start walking around and stuff ,patient
so  once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit um we started working on therapy ,patient
and um they said ,patient
 you have aphasia ,patient
um and my talking I couldn't say pretty much any  I couldn't say anything ,patient
they were saying like ,patient
 do you want something to eat ,patient
I didn't understand what that meant ,patient
so  they'd give me like a cup ,patient
 do you want something to drink ,patient
they'd sh take the cup and show me ,patient
and I'd go yesq or noq ,patient
it took me a  lil even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it ges,patient
if you don't want it it goes this way ges,patient
took that long to figure that out ,patient
little things like that that I didn't remember ,patient
um then once I was able to at_least think a little bit more we started with um uh pictures like that bird and the  and the boy and the banana ,patient
and uh we start  that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words ,patient
and um my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else ,patient
so  still working on therapy myself ,patient
I have uh a book at home that I still do my homework everyday ,patient
so  still going ,patient
it's  I  I'm  um the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write ,patient
and I said  but I told myself that I'm going to do it ,patient
so  I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up s you_know ,patient
I'm going to read someday ,patient
and I will write ,patient
and I will have numbers at some point ,patient
so  yeah ,patient
um let's see ,patient
um um let's  let's see ,patient
I  oh one of my um from a long time ago um when I was I don't know  ten fifteen right in there you_know teens in a way um we had  my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage ,patient
and we  on the weekends you went to the cottage ,patient
and um we wouldn't go every weekend ,patient
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools you_know ,patient
we would um take that time ,patient
and um I think that was one my favorite places to go ,patient
we could um fish ,patient
we could swim ,patient
we could ,patient
and it wasn't very deep ,patient
there was a_lot ,patient
now it was deep in the middle ,patient
but right now  y I_mean you could  didn't really hafta swim ,patient
you could just walk around a little bit ,patient
um there were frogs ,patient
there was um um turtles at ,patient
so  I_mean it was  we got up in the morning ,patient
and I think we ate as fast as we could to be  to go outside ,patient
and I think you're pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed ,patient
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that uh um all the fun things that we were able to do ,patient
like my dad let me ,patient
um we useta have a rowboat that had paddles ,patient
but we also had one that had the um motor in the back ,patient
and it  now you're  you were not allowed to go fast ,patient
it was like two what do you call it  like fi no  five fast ,patient
so  it wasn't very fast ,patient
you could almost swim as fast as you can the  you_know the boat ,patient
but um they let me actually m mow  s,patient
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that  that paddle boat and stuff like that ,patient
I loved to  r um to drive ,patient
I just thought that was really cool ,patient
I'm not sure why now it was like  it was such a big thing ,patient
but it was you_know ,patient
and I was by myself on the boat you_know ,patient
and I thought I was something else you_know and all that ,patient
we forgot the gas one time ,patient
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid ,patient
but I think that was ,patient
and at night um we had  uh we had like a  uh a place to lay down outside ,patient
and we would um go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty ,patient
and I  I think um when I have my  if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage ,patient
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads ,patient
I think about that place ,patient
I don't know why laughs ,patient
yeah ,patient
um there's uha boy outside that was um hitting the ball around and having fun  I'm sure ,patient
and  um but as he was going by um he hit the ball on the window ,patient
and it broke ,patient
and it actually went in the house with it ,patient
so  the  um that um ball fell into someone else's house ,patient
and I'm sure the guy ,patient
I can't see that he has a picture ,patient
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously ,patient
but um it even hit the lamp and everything ,patient
and so um he was looking to see you_know what happened ,patient
so  he's looking for the  the kid ,patient
so  we don't know if he took off or if uh he was uh going oops feeling or what ,patient
we don't see him in the picture now ,patient
so  at the end all we know is that the  there's a guy with the ball looking for  to  outside to see what's happening ,patient
yeah ,patient
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened ,patient
we don't know what happens this time ,patient
okay ,patient
um in the morning the  l the little boy are ,patient
and mom had looked at the weather and said ,patient
 I think there's a chance for rain ,patient
and said ,patient
 bring your umbrella ,patient
and the boy said ,patient
 no I  I don't need it ,patient
and so mom said ,patient
 are you sure you're gonna do that ,patient
and okay ,patient
and so he said bye mom and went to school started walking ,patient
and here comes the rain ,patient
and it started probably even more rain as it looked ,patient
and so he ran to come home the other way ,patient
and let's see ,patient
so  he went back in the house probably and said ,patient
 uh mom  um you're right ,patient
 there was rain ,patient
and so she said ,patient
 well  go get your b brɛləu ,patient
and so he put it on the brɛləu ,patient
done ,patient
okay ,patient
um there's a cat that um was going up this tree on that bird ,patient
and um I think it was up there and stuck ,patient
and so this little girl was watching and thought ,patient
 oh_my_goodness how do I get it down ,patient
and um there was probably a guy walking by ,patient
and he thought ,patient
 I can help that little girl to get the cat on the tree ,patient
and uh but he got up there ,patient
and now he's stuck too  it looks like ,patient
and um someone saw the guy up there ,patient
and the firetruck called and said ,patient
 we have a guy and a cat stuck in the tree ,patient
and so they um brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down ,patient
yeah ,patient
okay ,patient
alright ,patient
um so  let's see ,patient
um she  um she ,patient
I think her mom must've died because dad is finding a new  um a very bad lady ,patient
and um now she's here um s stepmom in a way now right and with two girls ,patient
and they come to their really nice place ,patient
and um she hasta um do all the dishes and the laundry and everything ,patient
and the other girls actually they were even doing um um like either singing ,patient
or they do their little um mɛstrəmɛntsu ,patient
they're doing all of that during the day and um having their fun ,patient
and um they found out that there's going to be a  um a ball you_know kind of thing ,patient
and everyone can go and everything ,patient
and um the  so she goes to get a dress ,patient
and um it was new in my head on the fact that  um the  the birds I think and um maybe see others l a little fu friends um helped her to make even brɪɾɪu ,patient
it's one of those things that they lock ,patient
and they got out_of there ,patient
it looks really pretty ,patient
but she's like ,patient
 well  it wasn't a hundred percent ,patient
but it's gonna look pretty ,patient
but then the birds said ,patient
 ooh ,patient
and they um maybe even some of the little mice or something whoever they are you_know were helping to put her  her dress look even better ,patient
and they got it done ,patient
and um she's gonna go too ,patient
and  um but uh she also can't have a ride because they're going  you_know the  uh the mom and the two girls get to go together ,patient
so  she had to find a way to  to go ,patient
and  um and as  as they were leaving they said ,patient
 oh yours  I want this ,patient
I want this and this that you have ,patient
and so that was  um they took all of her beads and everything that was pretty ,patient
and so now she doesn't have ride to get  to be there ,patient
and also her dress was co torn and everything ,patient
and um she found the ,patient
I can't remember what her name is ,patient
um she's like a fairy ,patient
I don't  I don't remember what they call those little guys ,patient
but anyway you_know she's just sitting here and there ,patient
she's there to  s to help you ,patient
and um she said ,patient
 I can help you and to make your um dress beautiful ,patient
and so they get that done ,patient
and all of the little um mice become you_know like guys ,patient
oh and the  um so as one of the  do I think their dog goes and you_know as one of  as one of the guys that doing the um driving and all that ,patient
and um so that  that's how she gets there ,patient
and once gets here I'm sure that they're gonna be like ,patient
 gasps she's there too ,patient
and they won't be very excited about that the fact that she made it here ,patient
and she looks really good ,patient
and so then the  um here is the uh new ,patient
he's not a king yet ,patient
he's a princess ,patient
n no  that's a  that's a guy  that's a girl um not a king ,patient
see  I don't remember whose is whose ,patient
but you_know it's one of the  the  ki the  it's the king's kid in a way  right ,patient
and um he finds her and says ,patient
 ooh you_know she's beautiful ,patient
and so they're dancing and everything ,patient
and then she  she looked at the clock which I  now I forget to tell you ,patient
but you_know she's only allowed  she's only  she is only allowed to be there until midnight ,patient
and so she's kept looking at the clock ,patient
she's good at that ,patient
she's watching ,patient
and um so as they were dancing and everything she thought ,patient
 oops I gotta go ,patient
and so um of_course he probably said ,patient
 can't we just stay longer ,patient
and she said ,patient
 no I gotta go ,patient
so  she's running ,patient
and um I'm sure even the  one of the guys who worked there even had uh a question ,patient
and she  I think she said ,patient
 I got to go ,patient
and um so as she went one of her shoes fall ,patient
and um she gets all the way home ,patient
and of_course you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for you_know back ,patient
and there's the dog and everybody's sitting there ,patient
and I'm sure she's thinking ,patient
 that was the most beautiful day I've ever had you_know ,patient
and um I don't know if she's even a know she ever see her  ag him again ,patient
but at least she had a real beautiful day  night you_know ,patient
and then  um but there's  um there's a guy coming back t at all the houses I think you_know to see where that  um that shoe came from ,patient
and I think that the mom  that new mom said ,patient
 uhoh I think it was her ,patient
which they probably knew it was her at the beginning you_know because she looked way too good ,patient
and so they locked her in the like  in her room or in the palace or who knows she is ,patient
I don't know ,patient
it's always bad over there you_know that ,patient
she's  they stuck her in there ,patient
and um but here comes the one little uh mice that got the key to let her in  t to get outta there ,patient
and so when she got in there they said ,patient
 um you_know of_course it wasn't the two girls because she had big feet ,patient
and  um and she doesn't look good ,patient
so  you_know um I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point ,patient
and then there she is ,patient
she said ,patient
 well  can I try ,patient
and so she sits down ,patient
and it fit ,patient
and so  um so she  uh she made it ,patient
and so they put her  you_know took her back over to the  the castle ,patient
and they get a marry ,patient
and um what is it called  um happy whatever you call it ,patient
it's on my cup ,patient
I wish I could read it because I  it's always the thing at the end you_know ,patient

two slices of bread ,patient
and you need um let's see cu um what's the word  um peanut butter and a knife and um jelly of some fashion ,patient
whatever you  wa whatever kind ya like laughs ,patient
and let's see ,patient
I think the first thing you wanna do is um put the um peanut butter on part of the bread and  and um um spread it around ,patient
there ya go ,patient
and then whatever kind of uh stuff you want with it you can put that together and smooth it around ,patient
and then put the bread t um together ges,patient
and if your ,patient

you_know you always have that bread around it that the kids won't eat ,patient
they don't like that part ,patient
so  I hafta take that off too ,patient
