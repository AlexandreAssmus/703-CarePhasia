and I didn't know about it ,patient
um something's hæpinu ,patient
and I  I says ,patient
 oh  well  it'll go away ,patient
and then I blacked out ,patient
and um on the ground ges now ,patient
and the supervisor looks,patient
um the ambulance ,patient
and I can remember um the  um the hospital or the emergency room ,patient
and I couldn't speak ges,patient
and I was uh really  um I don't  I didn't know what's going on ,patient
and then I blacked out ,patient
um confused ,patient
uh I remember um hearing mom asking a_lot_of questions ,patient
and um I'm silent ges ,patient
I'm  I'm in the hospital ges ,patient
