and with that imit,patient
I fell on the floor ,patient
and this side points,patient
and I thought ,patient

and I kept  I kept thinking my hand grabs,patient
I flopped it down hand,patient
and so I was in the kitchen ,patient
and by the time ,patient
I thought ,patient

I went out and I thought ,patient
 I've got to tell somebody to scream or anything ,patient
and by the time I got to the uh television I have a halfway to go yet ges,patient
and um um FirstnameT was the principal and she came ,patient
and um in the meantime my telephone rang three four times ,patient

he s like um uh ges,patient
i it sounds like they're gonna imit,patient
um i slit  ges,patient
but i on this one he hadta  um it needed repaired laughs ,patient
so  and that's ,patient
I was in Franklin_Square hospital ,patient
and at that time December seventh ninety  nineteen ninety three they didn't have anything to do ,patient
they  they put me in a room and they said ,patient
um I was h hungry the next day and the next day ,patient
and they kept saying ,patient
 we're concerned about your tongue points,patient
 you can swallow ,patient
and he  she  anyhow they finally got me to eat ,patient
but um my sister and brother came down ,patient
and um I  I says ,patient
 what  what  what are you ,patient
I couldn't believe that they came for me ,patient
because I didn't think I you_know ,patient
points,patient
well  I went to um Sinai because um they did not have um a program for people with strokes ,patient
so  um I went to Sinai ,patient
um you know where Sinai is ,patient
and uh they have a really good program ,patient
and  um and boy um they didn't mess around ,patient
and um I liked it there ,patient
and  um but um the speech pathologist was a man ,patient
and he said that he is  after awhile he said he was going to leave ,patient
he and his wife and I think they had two children ,patient
he was going to Texas ,patient
and uh he brought me ges,patient
and he said ,patient
 um you don't hafta do it all at once ,patient
 some of them are hard ,patient
 some of  you can figure it out ,patient
 and do it as you would ,patient
and I did that ,patient
and then um I was there  um I didn't get out_of Sinai until I think  the fourth of um January ,patient
well  I was there until um the twentieth  I think ,patient
and then I went to Sinai ,patient
so  um and then I had  um FirstnameJ was my caretaker because I live by myself ,patient
and  um and she was okay  very good I_mean but she gets tired too you_know of doing the same thing ,patient
and  um and then she  d while I was in Sinai I got  um a woman came ,patient
and she was  dr you were making sure that anything  she was recruiting people with strokes or brain damage because of a car accident ,patient
and um he ,patient
 I think that you would be interested in the Return program ,patient
and maybe  I'm not quite sure whether she told me or my sister FirstnameM ,patient
but  um so the Return program I started in May the beginning of May ,patient
and I had FirstnameS ,patient
and she only  she worked all around the clock ges,patient
she couldn't take like um a half day ,patient
and um so I got FirstnameC ,patient
and uh she could work half days ,patient
and  um but I got  touches,patient
and I kept thinking ,patient
 I don't know what happened because I always get headaches here touches,patient
and anyhow um um I'm w w w w wavering ,patient
that is not the reason you asked the question ,patient
 oh  oh okay ,patient
well  um the  FirstnameJ said ,patient
 why don't you just lay down and go to sleep ,patient
and I slept for  around the clock ges,patient
and I got up and the headache was gone ,patient
but um FirstnameSu is a good friend of mine ,patient
and she called the doctor ,patient
and the doctor said ,patient
 um go to um I don't know  Advanced re radiology and get a scan of her head ,patient
and sh he did ,patient
and when I saw it um it was the  the bleeder ,patient
and I  sh he said  Doctor FirstnameLastnameD said ,patient
 that might have been the first stroke ,patient
and I said ,patient
 no  head,patient
and I had  I  I'm a  well a school teacher ,patient
and ten questions were a second grader ,patient
and I couldn't answer seven of them ,patient
and now when I went back to that I answered three ,patient
and I thought ,patient
 that's it ,patient
so  I kept on going to um the Return program ,patient
and um May June July and i the beginning of August um eh eh FirstnameC was in the hospital ,patient
uh she fell down a flight of steps ,patient
and she was pregnant ,patient
and she was so upset you_know ,patient
and I said ,patient
 that's okay ,patient
 don't call ,patient
because they hafta call somebody to you_know take care of me ,patient
and I says ,patient
 I'm fine ,patient
and when I was sitting there I thought ,patient
 well  it's time t for us to you_know eat or eh for me ,patient
I couldn't get up ,patient
I couldn't get up ,patient
and I called FirstnameR points the next door neighbor ,patient
she came over ,patient
and she says ,patient
 get out_of here ,patient
she pulled me up ges,patient
and she says ,patient
 okay ,patient
 call FirstnameSu ,patient
you_know  she didn't ,patient
like call FirstnameSu ,patient
and I called her and I was back in the hospital ,patient
and um because when I s had the stroke they gave me Ecotrin three times a day ,patient
when I had that  sec my second stroke they said ,patient
 Ecotrin ,patient
and I thought ,patient
 two times out ,patient
 I'm not gonna take Ecotrin again head,patient
and I say that to myself but they decided that it would be good to um a Coumadin ,patient
and um I got very depressed when at ,patient
I was not depressed the first stroke ,patient
it hit me the third stroke ,patient
I thought ,patient
 this is gonna go on and on ,patient
you_know  I never know what's gonna happen ,patient
and um I just really d depressed ,patient
so_that they got to take Zoloft ,patient
and I took it and I thought ,patient
 oh_boy it feels so good ,patient
uh i i and so when I left the hospital laughs I  I ate my cereal every morning and I had um diarrhea every day ,patient
and after I thought ,patient
 I'll hafta call him Doctor LastnameD ,patient
and he said ,patient
 you're allergic to Zoloft ,patient
so  I got to take Crestor ,patient
no  uh um Crestor is that ,patient
um Effexor ,patient
and um I've been on that ever since because I've t tried to take i um it off ,patient
and you hafta do it by um half a month and then ,patient
and by the time I get finished everything bothers me I get really upset ,patient
um and I started to cry ,patient
and you_know I think it's better to be on the um Effexor ,patient
well  um one of the things uh uh I've never been out_of p th uh the Pittsburgh ,patient
uh uh I've been to Pittsburgh a at that time when I was about fourteen ,patient
um I went to Pittsburgh once ,patient
my mother and sister FirstnameK the older one ,patient
and  um but it  w when I was about fourteen in the summer ,patient
um FirstnameMi is my good friend in high school and  um and her aunt were going to New_York because of um their aunt ,patient
there is a problem with her ,patient
and I think that she's becoming senile or whatever but s somebody hasta see what you_know is going on ,patient
and um so I uh kept asking my mother and asking her ,patient
and she kept saying ,patient
 no you can't ,patient
and I says ,patient

and you_know she decided ,patient
 okay ,patient
so  uh we went to New_York ,patient
and um I've forgotten the name of the town ,patient
j j it starts with a gl ,patient
um uh a little town ,patient
and  and anyhow uh we went to see her ,patient
and um one of the things that happened laughs ,patient
oh the  she was upset with FirstnameMi and I ,patient
we both had periods ,patient
and our  the aunt told us you_know how  roll it up and all that ,patient
and we rolled it up and we went off uh to Coney_Island ,patient
and we got back everything would be fine ,patient
and th uh the aunt was mad ,patient
mad as heck ,patient
what happened was he ,patient
and the dog knew ,patient
and he ,patient
it was all over the house ,patient
and she cleaned it up instead of waiting until we cleaned it up ,patient
and um she was upset ,patient
and I  r rightly so ,patient
but we didn't know that the dog would do that ,patient
but  uh and then at the  um the thing that um ,patient
we went to um n not a Broadway play but um Radio_City_Hall ,patient
and we saw um  Eric_Marie ,patient
starts with an rl ,patient
is it  could you spell that ,patient
no ,patient
um it's um long  longer ges,patient
um v but um he wrote the book and they made it into a play  n uh movie ,patient
and we got to see that ,patient

maybe his wife or whatever called the um fire trucks so_that points,patient
because I think the little dog points,patient
well  um  out west uh w they um have a storms ,patient
and um I think in Texas th a couple months ago ,patient
