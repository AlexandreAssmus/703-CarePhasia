and there were two women ,patient
if  it was three fingers,patient
and uh either on ,patient
and a_lot_of language w of eating ,patient
and um um um so then that they felt that was fɛɹiədu ,patient
and then I to inch  s,patient
you_know  it was only three fingers,patient
and I loved it ,patient
and um so uh they əpɹeɹu ,patient
and  uh clears,patient
and she felt that I was not  um i i i she felt that uh I  I  because of my age I guess I think  that was the reason uh that I should uh əstɛndu ,patient
and had I been in the country I would have been fine ,patient
but in the city like this it  it is um ,patient
my mother ,patient
and uh so I uh arranged to have  I sold it ,patient
so  uh within uh actually uh two weeks  uh two ges o ɔɹɪksu ,patient
and clears_throat uh you_know it was unhappy for me but uh that's the way it goes ,patient
yeah ,patient
uh yes ,patient
it  it was about April April  it was August ,patient
and it was ,patient
I  I had it on Rehoboth and the each on the side ,patient
and I had  had driven uh because I'm always driving back and there a great deal ,patient
and  um and I came home in the afternoon and at which for about this period ,patient
and uh went  I came in uh my peri ,patient
I live by  m I live uh myself ,patient
clears,patient
then I ,patient
well  wait a minute laughs ,patient
I feel I'm gonna ,patient
no  okay  I clears,patient
anyway I went in to lie down ,patient
and there was something points,patient
and I  c I think I must have put a phone on and called one of my daughters ,patient
I have two daughters ,patient
and I was lying there and then all_of_a_sudden they came in with uh a daughter of one of them ,patient
and uh they said ,patient
 w we're  go we're going to get the um hospital  the hospital come ,patient
they came outside with the  b ges with the peep  s,patient
I said ,patient

and finally I said ,patient
 alright ,patient
so  I went just  they just took me like I was to gæɹɪsu ,patient
and um when I arrived um ,patient
because I have been there many times for other things ,patient
and um when I went there they put me immediately into the hʌbskulu ,patient
and uh to  uh they thought that I'd had a um uh stroke which I guess that's what they accomplished ,patient
and um so they were  um they gave me um a nice room by myself ,patient
and I  I guess I just sort_of didn't say much ,patient
and I was there for two  two weeks ,patient
and they had many people coming in s suh wʊdnɛksu ,patient
what  I'm trying to think ,patient
d d æpɹiəlu ,patient
some of them I knew and some I did not ,patient

and  and I was doing things like that ,patient
and I said ,patient
 I feel fine ,patient
and um uh I  d I didn't ,patient
and then uh I  I said ,patient
 when I do go home I wanna be by myself ,patient
ɪksɑɪdu ,patient
so  that's what they did of two weeks ,patient
and that's when they did a_lot_of um th th what  applications points right in there ,patient
and what was going to happen ,patient
and um uh so that's uh the way it is ,patient
and  and fortunately nothing else came a great bɪfrɪntsu ,patient
but  um but it was  uh I uh assume it was something in my  points,patient
what  what a_lot_of people that I talk here in this group of people um I will say um ,patient
 I hear one side and I can speak and the other side is different ,patient
