and um they  they treat her very badly because she's the  the steprelative ,control
and they make her do all of the work around the house the cooking the cleaning and  while they sit around and eat bonbons and take baths ,control
um and one day they  let her come to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing this lavish party for his son and is going to be looking for a bride ,control
and the stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince will want to marry one of her three daughters ,control
and Cinderella hears about it ,control
and the stepmother says you_know she's gonna hafta help to make the dresses for the  for her daughters ,control
and  um and she can stay at the house while they go to this fancy party ,control
and they you_know all get all excited and get ready and go ,control
and while um Cinderella's at home  cleaning up her fairy godmother comes and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball ,control
and she waves her magic wand ,control
and um the pumpkin turns into a stage coach ,control
and her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown ,control
and um she's whisked away to this lavish party ,control
and  um and she's uh also given these glass slippers to wear ,control
and  um and she   of_course  she comes into this party ,control
and nobody recognizes that it's her  including her stepmother and her stepsisters ,control
um and so she's this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party ,control
and of_course the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the  stepsisters ,control
he dances with her ,control
and they immediately fall in love ,control
and she  um and they have a  a dance ,control
and  in the middle of this dance she remembers her  god her fairy godmother's instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken ,control
and so she realizes that it's almost midnight ,control
and she runs from the palace ,control
and in doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes ,control
and um she goes  she gets home just in time ,control
and um  you_know she  when the  when the stepmother and the stepsisters come home she you_know is  is home in her tattered clothes again ,control
and she's cleaning ,control
and she asks them how the party went ,control
and they  they're not happy because the prince didn't notice them of_course ,control
um but then the prince  he wants to find this mysterious girl ,control
and the only way that he has to find her is the glass slipper that he found ,control
and  but he decides he's going to go to every house  to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on ,control
and that will be the way he will identify this girl ,control
and so he eventually arrives at the stepmother's house ,control
and of_course the three girls run right over because they  they know that they're gonna one  that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly ,control
and of_course none of them do because their feet are too big ,control
and they  the stepmother figures out that the  the shoe belongs to Cinderella ,control
and she tries to hide Cinderella ,control
but the  I think it was the fairy godmother who  who comes along and rescues Cinderella ,control
or maybe it was the mice ,control

and of_course it fits ,control
