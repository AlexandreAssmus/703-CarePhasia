I've never had a stroke ,control
um serious illness ,control
I don't consider it a serious illness ,control
ongoing  I guess  chronic pain ,control

I have had  yes ,control
um  a serious illness ,control
um my mother has had Eosinophilic Fascitis ,control
um years ago at age forty eight ,control
um and has slowly gotten better from that ,control
yeah  she has done physical therapy to help improve her condition ,control
um she does massage twice a week ,control
and she does um a little bit of exercise but no medication ,control
oh okay ,control
okay  so  I just tell you what happened in picture one ,control
okay ,control
so  there was a little boy who was kicking a soccer ball ,control
and he kicked it  outside ,control
and it went into a window ,control
and then it broke the window ,control
oh  I see ,control
and then it hit a lamp ,control
and  then  this man ,control
oh okay ,control
the ball landed  I guess ,control
the man that caught the ball ,control
and he saw  he looked out the window at the broken glass ,control
okay ,control
so in the first pi picture  okay  so  the mom is gonna hand  a little boy an umbrella ,control
um it looks like he's gonna go somewhere  with a backpack on ,control
then he goes outside ,control
and it starts raining ,control
oh  he steps in a puddle ,control
and his hair's wet ,control
oh  he came home ,control
his hair  his mom is angry at him ,control
I think his mom is angry at him ,control
maybe she's angry at him because his hair is wet ,control
then he went  maybe he forgot to use the umbrella ,control
I'm not sure ,control
then he went back outside ,control
and he used the umbrella ,control
was that right ,control
okay ,control
oh_gosh  there's a_lot going on here ,control
I see a  and there's  there's a cat in a tree ,control
and let's see ,control
the girl is trying to get her cat down ,control
so  maybe the dad climbed up the ladder to help get her cat down ,control
oh  then the ladder fell ,control
maybe he used the ladder to get the cat down ,control
then the ladder fell down ,control
she's trying to catch this cat maybe ,control
I don't know why these people are here ,control
maybe they're coming to help get the cat down ,control
and  I don't know why he's upset ,control
I don't know what the dog is doing ,control
is that it ,control
how I would make one ,control
I would use two pieces of bread ,control
and I would put them down on the table ,control
and then I would take the peanut butter out_of the cabinet ,control
and I would take the jelly out_of the refrigerator where I keep it ,control
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread ,control
and then I would use a knife for that ,control
and I would probably use the same knife and put it in the jel or  I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread ,control
and I put the two pieces of bread together ,control
and then I would cut them either in half or on a diagonal ,control
and then that would be it ,control
and then I would wrap it in cellophane ,control
for one of the boys to take to school ,control
and then I'd put it in the freezer ,control
because I make five at a time ,control
