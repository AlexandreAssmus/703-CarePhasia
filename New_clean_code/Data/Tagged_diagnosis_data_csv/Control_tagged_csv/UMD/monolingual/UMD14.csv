mhm ,control
okay  the boy kicked the soccer ball ,control
and it  flew into the  window on the house next door probably and broke the window ,control
and it fell inside  the man's house ,control
and it hit the lamp and broke it ,control
and the man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid ,control
trying to  and the kid probably ran away ,control
he's gonna go knock on his daddy's door and say ,control
 pay me for my broken window ,control
mama said to the little boy ,control
 it's supposed to rain today ,control
 take your umbrella with you to school ,control
and the little boy says ,control
 ah no ,control
 I don't need an umbrella ,control
 it's not gonna rain on me ,control
and then he walks to school ,control
and it starts to rain ,control
and it rains really hard ,control
so  he hasta run back home ,control
and he's all soaking wet ,control
and he's not happy ,control
and his mother's not happy either ,control
and he hasta change clothes probably ,control
it's hard to tell ,control
and then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry ,control
well  the little girl has a cat that  the  dog chased up the tree ,control
and then a nice man  maybe her daddy  came along ,control
and he had a ladder ,control
and he climbed up in the tree to get the cat ,control
and then the ladder fell down ,control
and then he's stuck in the tree ,control
so   somebody else watched this whole deal while the dog's still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody ,control
and they came with their truck and ladder ,control
not quite there yet but they're getting there ,control
and there's a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them ,control
the cat's on the other side of the tree ,control
says ,control
 I'm gonna catch the bird and eat her ,control
and the firemen rescued them all ,control
yes ,control
hm that's interesting ,control
I don't think I remember the beginning ,control
 I obviously don't remember a_lot_of this ,control
 I don't remember any of these things from when I was a kid ,control
I used to read science fiction ,control
I still do ,control
well   let's see ,control
if I remember Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl ,control
the nice man took her home to his family or somebody ,control
and the stepmother had already had  daughters ,control
and they took her in ,control
but they treated her like  a servant ,control
and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff ,control
and she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out  to wear ,control
and she was usually in the kitchen cleaning ,control
and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball I think in honor of uh  Prince_Charming or somebody ,control
and the mm evil stepmother wanted her daughters to  get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and  be rich ,control
and um so they all got fancied up to go to the ball ,control
and Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go ,control
and she wanted to go ,control
and she was crying about it ,control
and  a good fairy godmother came along ,control
I'm not quite sure how she got there ,control
um and she  was able to  turn ordinary  things and creatures around her into fabulous ones ,control
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses ,control
and  she turned the mice into something ,control
anyway  and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers ,control
and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left ,control
and when she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her ,control
and they danced the night away ,control
and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry ,control
then the mm fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning ,control
and so she hadta be sure to leave by midnight ,control
and she was a little late ,control
and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach ,control
and she lost a glass slipper ,control
and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her  I think ,control
and she jumped in the coach ,control
and it ran away  they ran away from the ball ,control
and it turned back into a pumpkin ,control
and her clothes turned back into rags ,control
and she had one glass slipper on her foot ,control
and then the prince was very sad ,control
and he wanted to find her ,control
and he  they took the glass slipper she had  that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs ,control
and they went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit ,control
and the evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper ,control
and it wouldn't fit cause they had big feet ,control
and uh finally Cinderella got to try on the slipper ,control
and it fit ,control
and the prince and the  was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry ,control
he was in love with her ,control
so  he found out ,control
they told him  I guess ,control
and  all the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of Cinderella then ,control
and she married the prince ,control
and they lived happily ever after ,control
the end ,control
um so  we're gonna do something a_little different ,control
well  oddly enough I never had peanut butter and jelly growing up ,control
I still haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
it was not part of my growing up ,control
but I'd take two pieces of white bread ,control
and I'd put peanut butter  probably if it were me I'd put it on both pieces of bread ,control
and then I'd put jelly in the middle ,control
and I happen to like   well  grape jelly I think would go good with peanut butter probably ,control
strawberry is nice too ,control
and then I'd smush it together ,control
and then I'd cut it in half diagonally ,control
I believe ,control
we didn't eat peanut butter growing up ,control
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all ,control
occasionally I eat peanut butter out_of a jar because it's a protein ,control
and I  my stomach is growling at me  you_know ,control
adequate ,control
a few words of French occasionally ,control
I listen to people speaking Spanish ,control
and you_know I picked up a word or two ,control
and I usually can figure out what they're saying when they're trying to speak English ,control
and people who speak  ,control
I don't know what language is pakis that Pakistan ,control
and that there's multiple languages ,control
and I hear Arabic I  people wherever I go ,control
so  I hear English that's accented that way ,control
most of the time I  can figure them out too ,control
no ,control
illness ,control
well  my daddy died of a heart attack ,control
and my mother probably died of a stroke although they said heart attack ,control
strokes ran in her family and heart attacks in his ,control
and uh my mother had emphysema ,control
I guess these days they call it COPD ,control
she  well  her family were coal miners ,control
and you talk about secondhand cigarette smoke ,control
well  my family's got secondhand coal dust ,control
because they carried it in ,control
and by the time she was  in her early twenties  she already had stuff that showed up on the tv xrays that they do because she worked in a school cafeteria ,control
back in the days where they actually cook real food ,control
that's mostly  I_mean I've got glaucoma and you_know those kind of things but ,control
that's  well  I have diabetes ,control
that seems to run in the part of  my daddy's family ,control
hm well  I always wanted to do horseback riding ,control
and a friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at Rockcreek_Park_Stables in the district ,control
and she wanted to go but she didn't wanna go by herself so she asked me to go with her ,control
and since I'd always sorta wanted to do that I went with her ,control
and they taught um English_style riding ,control
and we took this introductory group of uh lessons ,control
and she quit and I kept on ,control
and um in fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids  my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp ,control
yeah ,control
but it was lots_of fun ,control
I learned a_lot ,control
and uh I enjoyed that for a couple years until I had sort_of a accident ,control
they tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy ,control
you_know  we'd be gestures ,control
and he'd go like that gestures at sound ,control
and I usually went right off  you_know ,control
and  uh so a couple of times  and I don't land on my feet ,control
so  I sorta landed on my lower back and so that's caused me problems ,control
and uh I didn't go back after that ,control
but it was really nice while I did it ,control
little bit of  almost jumping ,control
the best part was riding the jump trail in Rockcreek_Park which is a  a horse trail that they've let the little  little usually trees fall across ,control
and it's rough ,control
and if you take  and my horse because he didn't like his neighbor horses ,control
we were always at the end of the line ,control
that's not a good place to be when other horses are moving along ,control
because horses being herd creatures  they wanna catch up ,control
and stay with their good buddies ,control
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles ,control
and I'm in the back of the line ,control
and he's running to catch up ,control
and um it's a_little more exciting being at the end of the line ,control
but it was really  it was really good ,control
but now I do helicopters and it's better ,control
