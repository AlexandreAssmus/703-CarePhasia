living the dream ,control
I would first get the peanut butter out_of the cabinet ,control

I'd take them back over to the counter ,control
I'd pull out a plate come over and get a knife then go over and get the bread out_of the bread bin ,control
take out two slices ,control
and I would uh put the peanut butter on first one slice and then the jelly on the other ,control
and then fold them and combine them together ,control
okay ,control
uh I see a boy out on the field ,control
and he is  kicking a soccer ball ,control
and the boy is kicking the ball into the air ,control
and it seems like the ball is  in the second picture going through a window  uh the window of a house ,control
not sure if it's his house or a neighbor's house ,control
but it's breaking the window and going inside ,control
to the third picture where there is a gentleman who is sitting in a chair ,control
don't know if that's a family member  father  or a neighbor ,control
but it breaks through the window ,control
and the ball comes right at him ,control
and the man in the picture seems to be uh a_lot older ,control
probably very scared and startled ,control
and he  going into the fourth frame picks the ball up and looks out the broken window to  to see if he could see who  kicked the ball through the window ,control
I see a   uh a lady and a smaller child ,control
I do not know if it's a mother  daughter ,control
the lady is holding an umbrella ,control
they seem to be talking ,control
and in the second it seems to be a little girl but not sure ,control
the second frame  they seem to be continuing the discussion ,control
and the older lady seems to be holding the umbrella and listening to the child ,control
and it seems like the child is discussing the fact that he or she does not need the umbrella ,control
and the child goes out  uh into the um outside in frame three ,control
and they notice  he or she notices it's starting to rain ,control
and he or she puts her hand out uh and feels the raindrops ,control
and this child's going somewhere because there's a backpack on his or her shoulder ,control
and in frame four the rain is coming down a_lot harder ,control
the child is uh panicking and turns the other way and puts their hand over their head and is running presumably back to the house ,control
in frame five uh the uh little uh boy or girl meets the lady again ,control
I'm presuming it's the mom ,control
and he's soaking wet ,control
and the mother  presumably gives uh the child an umbrella ,control
and the child goes back outside in the rain with the umbrella open and goes off to wherever they're going ,control
okay here ,control
um it is a picture of a man in a tree ,control
along with the man in the tree there's a cat and a bird ,control
and there's a dog at the base of the tree barking up ,control
and there's a little girl uh underneath the branch where the cat  is sitting ,control
and her tricycle is there along with a  ladder ,control
and to the right of the tree the fire department  two fire men are bringing a ladder  presumably to rescue the cat from the tree which the older gentleman  seems to be trying  to rescue ,control
uh but from the look on his face has not succeeded ,control
and the little girl is very upset because  she thinks the cat is endangered ,control
okay  Cinderella  uh was a young lady who lived with her two  uh stepsisters and stepmother ,control
and they treated her very badly and uh made her do a_lot_of work ,control
and one day a gentleman came to their house and announced that there would be a ball that the  uh king was having for the prince to find a wife  a princess  for the uh prince ,control
and they were all very excited ,control
and Cinderella thought she was going ,control
uh but her mother  um stepmother said ,control
 no  she's not going ,control
just the two other sisters were going ,control
and she was very sad ,control
and  they got ready to go to the ball and left ,control
and as Cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses ,control
and they went to the ball ,control
but the fairy godmother said ,control
 you hafta be home uh by twelve o'clock or everything will disappear at twelve o'clock ,control
so  she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time ,control
and the prince fell in love with her at the ball ,control
and it was just about twelve o'clock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes  uh crystal shoes at the ball ,control
and she barely made it home ,control
and poof  uh the carriage and horses turned back into the pumpkin and mice ,control
the prince wanted to find her ,control
took the shoe and made a decree that they'd check every uh girl in the village until uh Cinderella was found ,control
and they came to the house ,control
and her two stepsisters  they tried the shoe on but it wouldn't fit ,control
