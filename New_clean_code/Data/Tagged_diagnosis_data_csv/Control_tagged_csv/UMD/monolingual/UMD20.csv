I think that was ,control
well  I was out_of work for about eight weeks ,control
I was in the hospital for about fourteen days ,control
yeah ,control
I was pretty sick ,control
my current favorite story is um a day last year ,control
it might have been the year before last ,control
it was Christmas time  getting towards Christmas time ,control
and I was to meet some friends for lunch at Zaytinia downtown ,control
and I realized when I got down there that I was an hour early ,control
it was kinda cold ,control
DC sets up a um a kind of a Christmas bazaar down on G_Street ,control
I guess it's G_Street ,control
and they had closed the street to traffic ,control
and there were wonderful little kiosks along the street with really nice stuff ,control
and I was kinda cold so I bought a wool beret ,control
and then I felt fine ,control
I walked around ,control
and I walked  I was walking up Seventh_Street ,control
and up ahead of me on the right in descending letters it said Regal_Cinema ,control
just across the street was another sign also descending that said Legal_Seafood ,control
and on the window of the bank facing me right below that sign was coming soon Eagle_Bank ,control
I love  I love Washington ,control
okay ,control
I make up a story ,control
okay ,control
okay  we've got a  a  a perfectly okay little boy playing with a soccer ball ,control
and he kicks it ,control
and it goes through the window of the house  probably his own house ,control
and it breaks the window knocks over a lamp and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father ,control
who then picks up the ball stares out the window and probably swears at the  at the little boy ,control
um this is another little boy ,control
they're a_lot_of trouble ,control
um this little boy does not want to take an umbrella to school ,control
you can tell he's going to school because he's got his backpack on ,control
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella ,control
and he's saying ,control
 nope ,control
and he walks out the door and waves goodbye ,control
and it starts raining on him ,control
and he runs home ,control
and he's soaking wet ,control
and his mother is frowning at him ,control
and the next thing you see is him wi with  walking with an umbrella ,control
okay ,control
the cat went up the tree ,control
the little girl wants her kitty_cat down ,control
and the father clearly tried to go up the tree and get it ,control
and he got up there ,control
and the ladder fell ,control
okay ,control
um Cinderella's father married um for the second time when um Cinderella's mother had died ,control
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters ,control
and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her um clean the fireplaces  hence the name Cinderella ,control
and do other menial work ,control
 um at some point the prince of the  whatever  principality it was um was in need of a wife ,control
said his father and the I don't know   minister of whatever  marriages ,control
so  they cooked up a scheme to have a ball ,control
and um they sent out invitations to um all the eligible young women  in the principality ,control
Cinderella got one but she of_course could not  did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation ,control
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with um white horses and a footman and so_forth ,control
so  she was able to go to the ball ,control
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight ,control
she went to the ball ,control
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated ,control
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love ,control
midnight came ,control
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be out_of there ,control
so  she hurried away ,control
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her ,control
um she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth ,control
but she managed to get home anyway ,control
and um later  the  um the prince was very depressed ,control
he had fallen in love with this woman ,control
and she had disappeared ,control
all he had left was a glass slipper ,control
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else ,control
so  the  his father  who I guess was the king  and the minister of marriages um went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on ,control
and of_course it would not fit anyone at all  including the two unpleasant stepsisters ,control
even_though I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit  try to fit in ,control
but it still didn't work ,control
and it got blood all over the place ,control
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper ,control
it was Cinderella ,control
and of_course she was just um um a sladeyn ,control
but he insisted that she try it on ,control
and sure enough it fit ,control
so  he had found his bride ,control
and there was great celebration throughout the land ,control
and they got married and lived happily ever after ,control
how I would make a peanut butter and je ,control
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it ,control
but I  you would  I would take two pieces of bread ,control
and I'd put peanut butter on one using a knife ,control
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread ,control
and then I'd put the two together ,control
and I would probably slice it ,control
because it would be for a kid I'd probably slice it in quarters ,control
