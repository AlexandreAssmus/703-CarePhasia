how do I what ,control
very well ,control
excellent ,control
well  I have noone to talk Yiddish to so I don't know whether I should include that ,control
well  I  I can speak some Yiddish ,control
but there's nobody to converse with so I don't know whether that would qualify ,control
no ,control
would you consider Alzheimer's ,control
yes  my husband ,control
what ,control
well  it started about six years before he passed away ,control
I noticed that he was very forgetful ,control
he couldn't remember what building we lived in and other things ,control
and even driving  his driving was erratic ,control
and um I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and  uh and canasta that he no longer wanted to play ,control
he didn't want to  we used to square dance quite a bit ,control
and then he decided ,control
he never gave me a reason ,control
and at first I didn't quite understand ,control
and um he dropped out of a_lot_of the things ,control
he was a volunteer at the Kennedy_Center ,control
and he loved it there and they loved him ,control
and the next thing I know he wasn't uh going anymore ,control
and I tried to figure out why ,control
and he said ,control
 well  they want me to use a different technique when I write up a sale ,control
write it so_that he would write it  write the sales for  by hand ,control
and then they put it in the computer ,control
so  the final straw came when uh  I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him ,control
and uh that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts ,control
and he got very confused with the different women ,control
they all happened to be black ,control
and so he mixed them up ,control
and when one wanted to feed him he'd push her hand away ,control
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldn't handle it and I couldn't handle it ,control
and that's when he went into a nursing home ,control
and he remained there ,control
and he deteriorated quite a bit ,control
he forgot how to walk ,control
he forgot how to teach  to um feed himself ,control
uh he didn't remember  whether  where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands ,control
and so um they took good care of him ,control
he was always neatly dressed and clean  out_of bed  until he reached the point where he stopped eating ,control
and he eventually passed away peacefully ,control
I've had so many happy memories  I don't even know where to start first ,control
just one ,control
um I can't think of anything outstanding ,control
I guess the day I got married ,control
uh when my children were born ,control
um I'm trying to think of ,control
one  one really stands out ,control
we were fortunate enough to have my parents babysit for the children so we could get away ,control
and we went to Jamaica for a week ,control
and that was one of the most wonderful enjoyable vacations we ever had ,control
the weather was fine ,control
the food was great ,control
the  the entertainment ,control
the  just being together and um ,control
from all  we've been on many vacations but that one really stands out ,control
the scenery  the beach in front of you and um ,control
it was so enjoyable ,control
that was the only time that I remember crying the night before we hadta go home because I said ,control
 I don't want to leave this place ,control
so  I guess that's the one ,control
 have you been  have you been ,control
well  it's one thing to go with friends ,control
but it's another thing to go with a husband ,control
that's  that's what was perfect ,control
this one here ,control
is this supposed to be one story ,control
or is each picture supposed to be a story ,control
well  uh little Johnny is outside playing ,control
kicking a ball ,control
seems to be having a good time ,control
and lo_and_behold the ball goes through a window and it breaks ,control
and it goes through the window  practically onto the lap of this man who's ,control
is that a baby there ,control
 that's not ,control
it knocks over a lamp ,control
is that it ,control
or is it ,control
I see two feet here ,control
is there ,control
 it  it came through the window ,control
and he's sitting here ,control
now this is his hand ,control
but that looks like another leg here ,control
and that also looks either like a lamb ,control
xxx a chair ,control
what is this round thing over here ,control
is that a lamp shade ,control
and the man is quite surprised ,control
and he is wondering  could his son have done that ,control
and he decides to go to the window and check ,control
and there's nobody there ,control
so  he doesn't know who to blame for this ,control
and I don't know ,control
xxx ,control
well  this mother who tells her son that he needs to take an umbrella because you are going to school and you'll get wet ,control
and he said ,control
 no  it's not going to rain ,control
and uh he insists upon going without the umbrella ,control
and lo_and_behold as he's walking it starts to rain ,control
and his shoes get wet in the puddle ,control
his head is wet ,control
he comes home drenched ,control
and his mother is quite upset by this ,control
 now why haven't you listened to me  young man ,control
 don't you know that mothers know best ,control
and he is a little bit remorseful about that ,control
and as a result of listening to his mother  the next time he goes out he takes the umbrella ,control
mother is happy ,control
he is not getting wet ,control
and everybody is very content with their life ,control
for some reason dad has decided to climb up the tree ,control
he's out on a limb ,control
and maybe he went to s rescue the little pussy cat that was there because his daughter is quite upset that the cat is up on the tree and can't get down ,control
now the dog is barking because he would like dad to come down ,control
somewheres ,control
and we're in the midst of a serious rescue ,control
do we pacify the dog ,control
do we take dad down ,control
or do we rescue the cat first ,control
what a dilemma ,control
these firemen really have a big job on their hands ,control
I'm just wondering who comes first ,control
yeah  I think so ,control
according to this book ,control
0  flipping pages ,control
hm  I don't remember who this man is ,control
the father is the ,control
okay ,control
the best I can ,control
Cinderella had a stepmother ,control
two stepsisters ,control
Cinderella was beautiful ,control
the two stepsisters were mean  ugly  vicious just like the mother ,control
and um she did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just uh indulged themselves ,control
and then they announced that the  the king would have a ball in the palace ,control
and uh everybody was invited ,control
of_course Cinderella was not ,control
and uh she would have liked to have gone to the ball ,control
and um along came the fairy godmother ,control
and he  s,control
 we'll get you dressed up and get you to the ball ,control
and she got into a beautiful gown and a  um a coach ,control
but um that she would hafta be back by midnight ,control
I'm improvising ,control
and off she went to the ball ,control
and um the Prince_Charming asked her to dance ,control
and she danced with him ,control
and I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother ,control
and at the stroke of midnight Cinderella knew she hadta return home ,control
so  she quickly uh ran down the steps to get into the coach  and in the process lost one of her slippers ,control
and uh she got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters ,control
well  Prince_Charming was enamored with her but he didn't know who she was or where he could find her ,control
so  he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball ,control
and when they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into them  into the shoe ,control
and it wouldn't work ,control
and um Cinderella  they would not let Cinderella do it ,control
however the prince or the attendants said ,control
 why don't we have this  uh this young lady try on the shoe ,control
and they finally did ,control
and the shoe fit ,control
and that's when the Prince_Charming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball ,control
and um she uh was  she went back to the palace ,control
and the  the king granted a marriage for uh his son Prince_Charming and Cinderella ,control
and they were married ,control
and they lived happily ever after ,control
well  I guess you would take two slices of white bread ,control
smear some peanut butter on one side  some jelly on the other ,control
put them together ,control
see that they  the top one matches the bottom one ,control
cut them up  across in a diagonal ,control
put them in some Glad bag ,control
and then give it to your son ,control
