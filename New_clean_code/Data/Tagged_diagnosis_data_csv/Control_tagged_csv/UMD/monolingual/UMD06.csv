and the play was  Alice_In_Wonderland ,control
and my father came from work to watch me ,control
 and somewhere there was a line about uh  giving a dog a biscuit ,control

and I saw him laughing at me from the audience ,control
and I will never forget ,control

there's a young boy who is kicking  what's probably a soccer ball ,control
it could be  something else too ,control
and he kicks it and  right into a window ,control
breaks the window ,control
um goes right through the window practically on top of the lap of this guy who's sitting there ,control
and he gets up  and has the ball in his hand  and is standing by the window and looking  out ,control
okay ,control
the child is going outside ,control
and the mother is standing  the mother is standing there with an umbrella ,control
and I don't know whether she's taking it away from him  or giving it to him ,control
in the second one it looks like he's reaching out for it um  although maybe he just gave it back to her ,control
and he's outside now without the umbrella ,control
and it's raining on him ,control
and he's not very happy about it ,control
he goes back  to his mother ,control
she's not happy ,control
and he's not happy ,control
and then he takes the umbrella ,control
puts it over his head ,control
and uh he looks  a_little happier because he took it and is not getting rained on ,control
okay ,control

so  here we have  a cat seems to be stuck in a tree ,control
and  a little girl is right below worrying about him ,control
wanting to get him down ,control
she has a bicycle ,control
and it's probably the daddy  sitting up in the tree ,control
whether he used the ladder to try to climb up there or climbs up without it  I don't know  but he seems stuck up there ,control
the dog is on the ground barking at the   barking ,control
what he's barking at I'm not sure if he's barking at the man ,control
the firemen are coming with their ladder ,control
the truck is  sitting on the street in the back ,control
there's a bird singing away in the tree ,control
the  daddy looks a_little abashed ,control
yes ,control
oh  sure ,control
okay ,control
am I using the book with the pictures ,control

and Cinderella is standing next to him ,control
and he seemed very nice to her ,control
and she xxx ,control

um  the prince is talking to his father ,control
and  they arrange to have a  ball ,control
and uh the invitation somehow get around ,control

I'm trying to remember if that was pictured or not ,control
and of_course they say no ,control
um  and the fairy godmother comes ,control
and she trains the mice  into  white horses ,control
and um  she turns the pumpkin into the wonderful couch ,control

and uh Cinderella's stepmother locks her uh out  locks her in with the key ,control
and the mice find the key and bring it all the way downstairs or all the way upstairs and uh  let her in or let her out ,control
and um the prince comes around ,control
and the shoe fits her ,control
and they all lived happily ever after ,control
