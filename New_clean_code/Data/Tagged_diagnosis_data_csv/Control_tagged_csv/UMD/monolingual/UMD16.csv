did you want something to  raise it up ,control
oh  I think I'm a very good English speaker ,control
everybody tells me I'm very articulate ,control
just like a smattering of Spanish  just really a few words ,control
no ,control
uh well  I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from New_Mexico to the east coast ,control
it was such an immense change culturally ,control
and we  also we lived in a very uh rural area in New_Mexico up in the mountains ,control
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all ,control
so  when we came here it was absolutely shocking ,control
I_mean  just the fact that they had sidewalks alone ,control
they just amazed us ,control
and the street lamps and everything ,control
I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money ,control
it's so much richer ,control
and they can afford to do all of that you_know ,control
we had a_lot_of unpaved roads out there ,control
of_course there's  the  there's a_lot um uh sparser population ,control
so  a_lot_of times they're not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place ,control
but here it was just amazing to us  all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city ,control
it was just  indescribable the impact that it had on us ,control
I think it took us years to really kind_of overcome the culture shock ,control
so  I  I_mean I remember that period of my life all the time ,control
what  just the immense change that we underwent ,control
in fact we had um uh Spanish accents ,control
very heavy ,control
my parents always did their whole lives ,control
but we had such a terrible time at school  people teasing us and everything ,control
and we really tried hard to emulate um English speakers especially ,control
I used to listen to David_Niven for some reason ,control
I was really crazy about him ,control
and I wanted to sound like him ,control
so  you_know and it really was a  it really  it had a huge impact on us  each in their own way ,control
okay ,control
alright ,control
um this little boy Tommy found this ball ,control
oh yeah ,control
found a soccer ball and decided to try his luck at kicking it around ,control
so  he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick ,control
and sure enough it went through the  his neighbor's window ,control
his neighbor was watching television ,control
and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window  knocks over his lamp ,control
he looks out the window but there's nobody there ,control
okay ,control
there's Tommy again ,control
his mother s that morning knew that it was gonna rain ,control
she'd been listening to the weather channel ,control
she told him to take his umbrella ,control
no  he's positive that there's not gonna be any problem ,control
also he doesn't wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella ,control
and he says goodbye to his mother ,control
and he'll be fine ,control
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain ,control
so  he runs back ,control
his mother's quite annoyed with him because she'd argued with him ,control
and he said it was not gonna rain ,control
he feels bad ,control
finally takes the umbrella and goes to school ,control
okay ,control
Susan was out playing with her dog ,control
and uh the dog chased a  a cat up into the tree ,control
and  oh  I guess it was actually her  cat ,control
so  she became quite upset about it ,control
and her neighbor came out and said ,control
 well  that's okay ,control
 don't worry about it ,control
 I have a ladder ,control
 and I'll get up there and get your cat ,control
so  he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb ,control
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground ,control
and then he couldn't get down ,control
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree ,control
so  somebody hadta call the fire department ,control
and they came out and rescued the both of them ,control
oh yeah ,control
uh yeah ,control
I don't remember these animals ,control
I forgot what an involved story it is ,control
okay ,control
okay ,control
um Cinderella uh lived with her father and her mother in this little village ,control
uh when she was very young her mother passed away ,control
it was just her and her father ,control
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry ,control
he met somebody there in their village ,control
and he remarried ,control
and uh then sadly he passed away very shortly after that ,control
so  she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters ,control
and it  they turned out that the stepmother was not very nicely  she was not very nice to Cinderella ,control
so  uh she made Cinderella into kind_of a little maid who hadta sweep out the ,control
sorry ,control
yeah ,control
it's another one of these turtlenecks ,control
these are my favorite things ,control
uh so  um they turned her into a little maid ,control
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her sisters  her stepsisters and her stepmother ,control
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant ,control
she was very unhappy ,control
but she didn't really know what else to do ,control
there was nothing else she could do ,control
then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son  the prince  who was ,control
uh they were trying to find a suitable bride for him ,control
so  they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoi_polloi of the area ,control
so  the sisters decided they'd go ,control
and  uh  at first Cinderella thought that she might go ,control
and they laughed at her ,control
told her she didn't have anything to wear ,control
she was not pretty ,control
so they went to the ball ,control
she was very sad sitting among the cinders ,control
and her um fairy godmother shows up  appears and tells her she'll get it all set for the ball ,control
so  she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses ,control
and I forget what she made her dress out_of ,control
so  she goes to the ball ,control
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers ,control
so  she goes to the ball ,control
and she meets the prince ,control
the prince falls madly in love with her because she's the most beautiful girl there ,control
but the  fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was ,control
so  she saw  midnight approaching ,control
so  she hadta leave suddenly the prince ,control
you_know  she hadta run away from him and hide  run away  jump in her carriage ,control
and just as she got back she jumped out_of the carriage ,control
and everything turned back to what it was before ,control
so  she real thought ,control
 well  that's gonna be my one night of happiness ,control
 but I'll always remember it ,control
but the  pri she had left behind  the way she was running out_of the castle she had left behind her glass slipper ,control
the prince had run  been running around trying to find her ,control
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper ,control
so  he told  um his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper ,control
so  they went around to all the  villages ,control
and they  they had them try  had the women who might possibly be  that  uh Cinderella try on the glass slipper ,control
so  they got to the house of Cinderella ,control
and they asked her ,control
 how many girls do you have ,control
 no  I only have two ,control
because they had found out what was going on ,control
they were having them try on this glass slipper ,control
so  she hid Cinderella  forced Cinderella to stay inside her room ,control
and she  they tried the slipper on to the   um  uh the stepdaughters ,control
and the first one was   uh  was  the heel was too big ,control
so  the mother said ,control
 no  no  that  it'll fit ,control
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel ,control
but it still didn't fit ,control
and they tried on the  for the second woman ,control
and  but her toe is too big ,control
and the mother says ,control
 no  no  it fits ,control
and she cut off her toe in secret ,control
but it still didn't fit ,control
so  they said ,control
 no  this isn't her  these aren't their shoes ,control
so  then they were leaving ,control
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there ,control
I don't remember exactly  who  what clued them into that ,control
so  they insisted on  looking around ,control
and they found Cinderella ,control
and sure enough they tried her  the shoe on her ,control
and it fit ,control
so they took her back to the castle ,control
she married the prince ,control
and she was very forgiving ,control
she brought her sisters to live with them ,control
um well  when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I toast the bread ,control
and then I let it cool off ,control
and then on one side I smear the peanut  peanut butter ,control
then on the other side I smear the um jelly ,control
and then I put them together ,control
