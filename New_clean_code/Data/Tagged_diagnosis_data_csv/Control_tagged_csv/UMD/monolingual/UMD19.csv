I think I do fairly well ,control
I think very well ,control
not fluently ,control
I've not had a stroke ,control
and I guess  no  I've not had a serious illness ,control
um my sister had a mild stroke years ago ,control
and this is the same one who just had um cardiac surgery um about a month ago ,control
mhm ,control
well  she's still in the process ,control
she's still  she's in a nursing home now ,control
they took her ,control
and that was all part of the plan ,control
she had the surgery ,control
she had mitral valve whatever  or a leaky valve or something ,control
and um so she's in a nursing home now ,control
and she's feisty as ever ,control
um so  yeah  she's recovering and probably driving everybody crazy ,control
that's off the record ,control
a happy memory ,control
and I've done this in training so I  I didn't pull this one out from  out_of the air ,control
um I was um the president of the black alumni association at Collegename in m ,control
no  I was the vice  president many years ago ,control
and we had the first black president of Collegename while you_know I was in the post of this um office ,control
and so we invited him for the community  to meet the community ,control
and I literally organized everything ,control
and my father had a liquor store then ,control
and I had the people in the liquor s store  um the liquor business contribute ,control
and I think people smoked then ,control
Phillip_Morris contributed cigarettes ,control
and um I had the chemical bank contribute money and had all kinds of you_know cheese ,control
it was one of the best events they have ever had at the school ,control
and they have said that ,control
it was well attended by the whole community of Collegename ,control
we did an instulement ,control
we did everything for this guy ,control
it's still one of the things I like best ,control
it really was ,control
exactly ,control
and even the president said ,control
 you should really have been the president ,control
and I could have been ,control
I just didn't want the job ,control
I didn't realize I was gonna do his work anyway ,control
right ,control
so  the little boy went out to play kickball that day ,control
I forget what  it's a soccer ball  I guess ,control
and he never expected to  when he kicked the ball that it went through the window  somebody's window and broke it ,control
went in ,control
the gentleman who was in the house was shocked by the noise he heard ,control
and he sees a ball coming ,control
and he went to the window to find out who did this because he was gonna go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games ,control
oh  okay  just the beginning  middle  and an end ,control
okay  so  then I hafta look at it so you don't hafta hear all my thoughts ,control
um there's a mother getting ready to send her child off to school ,control
she tried to urge him to take an umbrella ,control
obviously she's heard the weather report ,control
he went and he didn't listen to his mother ,control
so  he went out and got wet ,control
when he came back he looked very sad ,control
and his mother looked very annoyed ,control
and the next time he took an umbrella ,control
there's a whole lot going on here ,control
um well  okay ,control
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside ,control
and he  and he  he's up on a tree for some reason ,control
oh  there's a ladder so he was obviously trying to do ,control
oh  he was trying to get her cat and  um from the ladder ,control
and he  the ladder fell ,control
he's stuck up in the tree ,control
the daughter is still upset because the cat's still up the tree ,control
the dog is barking because everything's out_of sorts for him ,control
and so the fire engine comes with a ladder  ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them ,control
 don't do that again ,control
yeah ,control
not one of my favorite ,control
I forgot all about this the wicked witch and her stepdaughters ,control
okay  you hid the text ,control
you don't want me to know the text ,control
I gotta  I gotta make up my own ,control
and cinderq means she's sweeping up the cinders from the chimney ,control
and the ugly stepsisters ,control
I don't remember this ,control
they are talking about how there's some young lady they've never seen before ,control
I don't really remember ,control
oh  the invitation  whatever ,control
I don't really remember it too well ,control
not one of my favorite stories but anyway ,control
um so she  the wicked witch talks about the party ,control
the sisters don't want her to go ,control
isn't that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly ,control
and then the xxx fairy godmother helps her go ,control
she captures the eye of the prince charming ,control
she hasta leave before midnight ,control
he doesn't know where she is ,control
she's in her tatters ,control
and her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin ,control
the wicked godmother locks her in ,control
but then they bring the key ,control
and they take the key to the cellar ,control
they try every maiden in the um town whatever they call those old things parish to see who the shoe belongs to ,control
and it belongs to Cinderella ,control
and she marries the prince and gets  prince and gets ,control
lives happily ever after ,control
Cinderella is this  um she's living with her wicked  the wicked stepmother ,control
I guess it's her stepmother ,control
I don't know where her father is ,control
um and the stepmother has these two um not attractive daughters ,control
and Cinderella  she's very pretty but she's left in tatters and rags ,control
her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the  you_know the cinders from the whatevern ,control
and the fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor ,control
and so one day there was going to be a ball ,control
the king ,control
and he makes this announcement ,control
and she wants to go as_well_as his daughters  her daughters ,control
um but they're figuring whom you you_know ,control
but her fairy godmother comes along to the rescue and tells her she will make  um you_know turn ,control
get me a pumpkin and some rats whatever ,control
and the pumpkin will be your coach ,control
other rats will be your coachmen  I think ,control
she gets her a great dress or something to wear ,control
her hair  they don't even talk about all that ,control
and so she goes ,control
and um the prince is dancing with all the young ladies but she captures his eye ,control
and um he dances with her ,control
and of_course it's love at first sight ,control
and she realizes at the stroke of midnight she hasta be home ,control
so  she runs out there before he can find out who she is ,control
and um in running she drops one of her slippers ,control
she runs into the coach which turns into a pumpkin before she can get home  I think ,control
the rats t turn  the coachmen turn into rats and whatever ,control
so  the  the king  the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to ,control
he's gonna go to every house and um see if the shoe fits ,control
and the fairy godmother is like  she's trying to get her daughters now I remember this  their big feet into the shoes ,control
no  it doesn't work ,control
and they say ,control
 is there anyone else ,control
 we see this young lady ,control
 oh  it wouldn't be her ,control
but it's her  you_know ,control
it's  um so  she sits down ,control
and they  the shoe fits perfectly ,control
he knows he's found his princess ,control
and he whisks her off ,control
and they get married ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
that's a long story ,control
okay ,control
how I would make it ,control
from the word goq ,control
go to the cabinet and take down a jar of peanut butter ,control
I'd probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something ,control
so  I'd go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out ,control
and go to the refrigerator where I also keep my bread ,control
take out two slices of bread ,control
I'd put them  open them there ,control
I would take the peanut butter first ,control
and smear it on the  on one side of the bread ,control
pretty thick though ,control
I like a_lot_of food ,control
then I'd take the jelly and put that on  over top of the peanut butter  still on the same side ,control
and I would take the other side and put it down ,control
and then I would take it and cut it in half ,control
and then I would start eating it ,control
