okay ,control
I do very well speaking English ,control
I'm a native English speaker ,control
I've been speaking since  I guess  the normal age ,control
when do kids start to speak ,control
a couple of ,control
young  very young ,control
and I've been reading pretty young ,control
I've learned  sort_of selftaught myself to read when I was about four ,control
so  I was reading pretty well by kindergarten ,control
my speech is  I think  fluent and generally understandable ,control
I talk a_little fast sometimes ,control
that's about it ,control
no  not really  no ,control
not that I know of ,control
yes  my mother had a stroke ,control
and my grandfather had two small strokes ,control
my grandfather's strokes or my mother's ,control
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four ,control
so  she was very young ,control
they think it was because she had um blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx in her  um in her atria ,control
and uh then she you_know unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid ,control
and it basically took out essentially a fistsized portion of her left hemisphere ,control
um so  it's left her pretty severely impaired ,control
um my grandfather's strokes were smaller ,control
I believe they were right hemisphere ,control
he had some serious apraxia ,control
but he had no evidence of aphasia ,control
he was still able to read and write and did not make a_lot_of effort to speak ,control
I was fairly young ,control
um and he was  mm hemiparesis and used a wheelchair ,control
but again he also just was very stubborn ,control
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all ,control
he just sort_of refused to do it ,control
so  he kind_of just lived in his own head for the last um maybe ten years of his life ,control
she's been pretty good ,control
um it's been ten and a half years now  almost eleven years ,control
yeah  it's been a long time ,control
uh she's been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then ,control
um initially she did uh about a month ,control
initially she was  after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute ,control
so  she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname ,control
she was there for about a month ,control
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks ,control
um and actually no sorry  she went home ,control
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a uh hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting ,control
um and then  after that  went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks ,control
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT uh and got to about the ,control
she was not as cooperative with that ,control
she found it very uncomfortable ,control
and  right  and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress ,control
especially given that she was not willing to  to work at home besides doing um range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own ,control
she's very good about that ,control
so  we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay out_of physical therapy ,control
and she  she's doing that ,control
and then  but we  we continue to do speech therapy ,control
we've done it here for at this point  I guess  almost ten years ,control
and um she's done a mix of group and individual ,control
and she goes to an adult daycare program where she's very social ,control
we don't spend a_lot_of time with friends outside of that ,control
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then ,control
but we hafta make an effort unless she's sick or has something else going on to get out_of the house at least once a day even if it's just for a small short activity ,control
it can  it's  it's hard ,control
it takes a_lot_of time and effort ,control
and for her  uh not every activity is easy ,control
um so ,control
see  now you make me wanna think of a really good story ,control
well  I've told you about my mom ,control
that's probably the  like the singular event that's most significant ,control
okay  I'll tell you a story ,control
this is a story um about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird ,control
but it's so clear in my mind and it still doesn't make any sense ,control
so  my first semester of  my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname ,control
but my family was from DC ,control
and I had a car ,control
uh so  I would drive back and forth over break time with my car ,control
um it's about a thousand miles ,control
so  it generally takes about two days ,control
uh so  the first semester back  um it's winter and I'm driving across I_Eighty which is  goes through a bunch of very flat states with a_lot_of corn ,control
so  it is an extremely boring repetitive drive ,control
there is a_lot_of you_know driver tunnel vision that happens ,control
and it's cold and gray so it's not even pretty green fields ,control
it's just empty empty empty fields ,control
um but I'm  I'm kind_of proud of myself because it's  my first semester went well ,control
I was you_know independent  excited ,control
um so  I'm on I_Eighty in sort_of the middle of Illinois ,control
and there is a slowdown ,control
and it's very flat so I can see ahead ,control
I don't see that there is construction ,control
I don't really see an accident ,control
but I you_know figure something's happened  probably a minor accident ,control
it looks like it's a rubbernecking delay ,control
it's kind_of pissing me off ,control
I_Eighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction ,control
um and there's like no exits  nothing  built along it ,control
and we get closer and closer and closer ,control
and I still cannot see what's going on ,control
I'm just like ,control
 what could this be ,control
and we get a_little closer ,control
and I see okay it looks like I'm in the left lane ,control
um and then there's a median between the you_know east bound and west bound routes ,control
and I'm going east ,control
um and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left ,control
and it looks  as I get closer  like an animal ,control
and I get closer ,control
and it looks like a fairly large animal ,control
and I'm thinking ,control
 is it a cow ,control
 is it a moose ,control
I_mean  there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois ,control
but it looks  it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it ,control
so  I'm a_little more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay ,control
but I'm still kind_of internally rolling my eyes going ,control
 why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal ,control
 wasting my time ,control
 I just wanna get home ,control
um and I get closer and I can see that there's these kind_of large hind legs ,control
so  it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car ,control
and there's kind_of a long tail ,control
and it's brown ,control
and it's this big hump ,control
and I'm getting closer and closer and closer ,control
and I  you_know my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern matching  going ,control
 what is this thing ,control
 I don't ,control
 it's not a cow ,control
 it's not a deer ,control
 it's too big to be a dog ,control
and I'm literally  as I'm passing it  like my head is tu ,control
you_know  we're just creeping along ,control
my head is sort_of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view ,control
and it's only until it's like at my shoulder and I passed it that it  my mind kind_of pattern matches and goes ,control
 it's a kangaroo ,control
and then you_know again I hafta turn around and look at the road ,control
and everything's cleared up behind me ,control
and I spent like the next five miles going ,control
 that's no way it was a kangaroo ,control
but it wasn't anything else ,control
it was a kangaroo ,control
it was clearly a kangaroo ,control
I saw the ears ,control
I saw the big massive tail ,control
I saw the big hind legs ,control
I saw the little tiny front legs ,control
it was a kangaroo ,control
and so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know ,control
I just don't know ,control
I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo ,control
I've even start  I_mean  this was ,control
okay  so  this was the winter of two thousand  two thousand one ,control
so  the internet was a thing but it's not like ,control
Google was around but there weren't really  if you didn't know how to search ,control
and I think I've subsequently every now and then done like kangarooq roadkillq kind_of to see if there's any  any information about this but no ,control
I'm pretty sure it was a kangaroo ,control
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that ,control
so  it's not a significant story ,control
but it is kind_of a funny story ,control
laughs I just don't know how ,control
I just  I am so certain and so uncertain ,control
and I mostly just kind_of like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going ,control
 what ,control
it doesn't have a neat little conclusion ,control
I don't know ,control
I don't know ,control
if it wasn't a kangaroo there'd be no story of it ,control
it couldn't be anything ,control
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo ,control
I_mean  it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind  I_mean massive hind feet ,control
I don't know what else it possibly could have been ,control
anything else that it might have been  a wallaby or something like that ,control
wallabys are pretty small ,control
it still wouldn't have been in Illinois ,control
I_mean  basically if it's not a dog or a cow or a deer  it's something that shouldn't be there ,control
okay  what am I looking at ,control
okay ,control
okay ,control
a beginning and middle and end ,control
alright so  there's a little boy named Ralph ,control
Ralph is a science geek kid ,control
his dad is a former athlete ,control
his dad is always on Ralph's back about you_know ,control
 yeah  you gotta participate in a team sport ,control
 you gotta  you gotta learn to be a member of a team and to compete ,control
 and you_know  it's fine if you like science and you wanna become an astronaut ,control
 but you_know  you still gotta learn some skills ,control
 so uh here  I bought you this um  this soccer ball  so_that you can you_know ,control
 it's easy to play soccer ,control
 all you hafta do is run around ,control
 you don't even really hafta have some skill ,control
 but here's this soccer ball ,control
 let's go out and practice ,control
so  Ralph whines and whines and whines ,control
and his dad says ,control
 listen  if you uh  if you don't do this then uh I'm gonna hafta severely restrict your internet time uh to get you to be a wellrounded kid ,control
so  finally Ralph goes outside ,control
and he's practicing with the soccer ball ,control
and of_course he's pretty terrible ,control
and he  he can't quite get it ,control
he keeps doing the Charlie_Brown thing  running up to it  missing  almost falling down ,control
and finally finally finally he kicks it ,control
it arcs high ,control
he sees it ,control
it goes toward the house  toward the house  toward the house  into the living room ,control
Ralph's dad  we'll call him Jake  uh looks up ,control
and the soccer ball comes in and it knocks over this lamp ,control
but that's okay ,control
it's an ugly lamp ,control
he hates the lamp ,control
his wife might be mad but you_know for now ,control
uh and he's just  he's getting really angry ,control
and he gets up and he sees  he  he walks over to the  uh the window ,control
and he looks out ,control
and he's like ,control
 Ralph ,control
and Ralph's like ,control
 I was just practicing ,control
 can I use the internet now ,control
the dad Jake sighs and is like ,control
 yeah  you can use the internet ,control
he gives up at that point on ever making his son wellrounded and decides his son will just be the best damn astronaut that ever there was ,control
the end ,control
okay ,control
um well  this one's pretty simple ,control
there's a mom ,control
we'll call her Sally ,control
and there's a kid ,control
we'll call him Andre ,control
Sally has bought Andre a really really ugly umbrella ,control
Andre refuses to use it ,control
he gives it back ,control
he says to his mom ,control
 listen  mom ,control
 I'm gonna go out ,control
 it's going to be fine ,control
 I don't think there's gonna be rain ,control
 I'm a meteorology nerd ,control
 I saw  on our local news  my favorite meteorologist said there's no way there's gonna be rain ,control
 so  you keep your ugly umbrella ,control
 and uh if it does rain I'll come back and you get to say that you were right ,control
so  of_course little Andre  did I say  goes out into the weather ,control
and it immediately starts raining ,control
he thinks ,control
 ah gosh darn it ,control
 that meteorologist  I'm gonna hafta start watching channel nine instead of channel seven ,control
he runs back inside ,control
he's very upset ,control
he looks at his mom and he goes ,control
 you were right ,control
 the  the channel seven guy was wrong ,control
and mom says ,control
 well  I told you so ,control
 and you told me I could tell you so ,control
 here's your umbrella ,control
and little Andre goes out ,control
and he's got his umbrella ,control
and uh he's in the rain ,control
and he just thinks ,control
 well  I guess I'm a channel nine viewer now ,control
the end ,control
alright ,control
um there's a little girl Jenny ,control
she has a cat named Moggy ,control
Moggy  uh she's trying to play dressup with Moggy ,control
Moggy gets very upset ,control
he manages to dash out_of the door  um where he encounters the dog named Goldie ,control
Goldie starts barking at Moggy ,control
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard ,control
meanwhile little girl Jenny runs after them ,control
she starts yelling and yelling and yelling ,control
the cat won't come down ,control
he's terrified  little Moggy ,control
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder um and tries to  to carry it ,control
it's very awkward ,control
into the yard ,control
she's dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up ,control
he sees her out the window and starts yelling ,control
 no Jenny no  that's too dangerous ,control
so  the dad comes  grabs the ladder  sits it against the tree  climbs up it to try to get Moggy ,control
uh as he's climbing up the tree um uh Goldie the dog knocks the ladder over ,control
poor dad is stuck in the tree ,control
the ladder is too unwieldy for little Jenny ,control
she runs back to the house ,control
she calls the nineoneone ,control
uh the fire department comes running out ,control
on her way back she grabs her tricycle and tricyclesv out to the tree just to you_know save time ,control
and uh all this time the  the uh fire department comes out ,control
they rescue dad ,control
they rescue Moggy after a_lot_of difficulty ,control
and this whole time this little bird is just singing  enjoying the show ,control
the end ,control
sure ,control
okay ,control
well  I remember Cinderella but I will um give it a first shot ,control
oh_boy ,control
it's very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella ,control
okay ,control
once_upon_a_time there was a little girl named Ella ,control
she was the uh daughter of two loving parents ,control
only one day when she's a little girl  her mother dies suddenly ,control
it's very tragic ,control
everybody cries ,control
everybody loved her mother ,control
uh her father  in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom  goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own ,control
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures ,control
um he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they uh immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps ,control
until the father  partly out_of heartbreak and partly out_of just a really bad diet  also dies ,control
uh at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy ,control
um they make her run around working all the time  then begin mocking her for being dirty ,control
and they call her Cinderella ,control
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are ,control
so  one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other brides  all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people ,control
or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball ,control
um and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball um to meet and hopefully find a match ,control
so  the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this ,control
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns ,control
um Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to you_know get out_of the house and to have a bit of glamour ,control
uh but of_course they won't let her ,control
because they  they tell her that she would be an embarrassment ,control
but mostly they don't want the competition ,control
so  they go off to the ball ,control
and uh Cinderella is left alone sort_of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house ,control
and she begins crying ,control
and she's crying and crying by the fireplace when all_of_a_sudden a woman materializes from the flames and says ,control
 Cinderella  why are you crying ,control
Cinderella says ,control
 I just  I just wanted to go to the ball ,control
 I just wanted one night of happiness and joy ,control
and the woman says ,control
 well  I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this ,control
 so  can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and uh some frogs ,control
 and um uh you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do ,control
and she waves her wand ,control
and the pumpkin turns into a carriage ,control
and her ball  her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown  and her slippers into slippers of cut glass ,control
and you_know  none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling ,control
and she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen ,control
and Cinderella is just overcome with joy ,control
and she gets into the carriage ,control
and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says ,control
 unfortunately my magical power is limited ,control
 and at midnight when the  the chimes go  uh everything will turn back ,control
 so  make sure that you are well away from the ball and  and out of you_know an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens ,control
so  Cinderella says ,control
 I will  I will ,control
and she waves goodbye ,control
she goes off to the ball ,control
and she arrives ,control
and it's even more dazzling than she thought ,control
and she comes in ,control
and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming ,control
and uh in the midst of  of her being greeting by  by throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up ,control
and he sees her ,control
and he asks her to dance ,control
and they begin to dance ,control
and of_course they're both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together ,control
uh and the prince is  is about to propose to her there and then on the spot ,control
and the clock begins to strike twelve ,control
and she says ,control
 oh_no oh yeah  I need to go ,control
she  she runs off ,control
and the prince is kind_of stumped for a minute ,control
he's thinking ,control
 wait a minute ,control
 there's a lady running away from me ,control
 what is this about ,control
uh so  she gets a good head start ,control
even_though she's wearing heels of glass she runs out_of the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach  uh the prince chasing after her all the while ,control
on the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes ,control
she doesn't have time to stop and pick it up ,control
she leaps into the coach ,control
it starts racing out_of the palace grounds and  and down the road as the clock you_know slowly strikes midnight ,control
and um on the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and  and her clothes back into rags ,control
and she hasta run the rest of the way home ,control
the prince has been unable to catch up with her in time ,control
he did not have a coach at the ready  you_know being in his own palace and all ,control
uh but he has the shoe ,control
and he looks at the shoe ,control
and it's  it's very delicate and tiny ,control
and he thinks ,control
 I have a clue ,control
 and I shall not rest until I find this woman because truly she's the hottest lady I've ever seen ,control
um it's gotta be her ,control
nobody else ,control
so  he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest um but still a kingdom ,control
and uh goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person  every woman of eligible age ,control
and it doesn't fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason ,control
and uh finally he gets to  to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother ,control
and he tries the shoe on the first stepsister ,control
and it doesn't fit ,control
and he tries it on the second stepsister ,control
and it doesn't fit ,control
and he's about to leave um when he  he sees in the corner of the courtyard this  this little servant girl ,control
and she's  she's sweeping away all of the dust ,control
and he just has a sense ,control
he has a sense ,control
he says ,control
 I don't know ,control
 she's kind_of dirty but she looks kind_of hot ,control
 I don't remember if she's as hot as the lady I saw last night but let's give it a go ,control
so  he uh  he calls her over ,control
and the stepmother the whole time is like ,control
 no no  it couldn't be her ,control
 she's just a gutter wench ,control
 you don't want anything to do with her ,control
 she's dumb ,control
 she's ugly ,control
 she's infertile ,control
 why not consider one of my daughters ,control
 you_know  they're  they might not be your first choice but they're a pretty good second bet ,control
the prince continues to wave her away ,control
and he approaches Cinderella ,control
and he asks her to try on the shoe ,control
and she does ,control
and of_course it fits ,control
and he thinks ,control
 good enough for me ,control
and he whisks her away ,control
and they marry ,control
and depending on um your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters ,control
possibly they just feel really bad ,control
um supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after ,control
the end ,control
well  clears,control
let's assume that ,control
I'm not gonna make the bread from scratch or grow the peanuts ,control
you would uh go to the grocery store purchase bread whatever kind of bread that you like ,control
if it's not already been sliced you would need to slice it at home or have it sliced at the grocery store or bakery wherever you prefer ,control
uh take two slices of bread ,control
take a jar of peanut butter ,control
again if you wanna buy you_know your organic custom ground at Whole_Foods you can do that ,control
or you could just get you_know your jar of generic Jif from Giant ,control
uh also jelly or jam or preserves ,control
there's very little difference between the two ,control
I'm sure somebody could tell you ,control
grape is traditional ,control
also purchase that at a grocery store ,control
open both up both of those jars ,control
might need one of those assistant little clamper things if it's really on tight ,control
um you need a plate ,control
put one piece of bread on the plate ,control
take a knife ,control
spread first the peanut butter on the bread ,control
then in_order_to avoid cross contamination  clean the knife ,control
put it in the jelly ,control
spread the jelly on the other slice of bread ,control
put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing each_other ,control
not outward ,control
it's not a sticky sandwich ,control
and uh then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across ,control
and then stick it in your mouth then chew ,control
