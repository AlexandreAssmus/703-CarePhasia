text,diagnosis
I presume you needed a special one for that  is that right ,control
extremely well ,control
a little bit of French and a little bit of Spanish and some Yiddish ,control
um just the neuromyasthenia INV,control
it  it meant I had a  six month old daughter ,control
uh and I was paralyzed ,control
so  I did hafta hire someone to help me ,control
but I knew that very often people do die from that ,control
but I live by ,control
 anything is possible ,control
and  uh and it works for me ,control
it did take several years ,control
and I did hafta have rehab which was not very effective so many years ago ,control
uh and I  I guess I must have had a residual from that because um I was doing reasonably well ,control
as a matter of fact I  I was leading groups  uh as we traveled and organizing trips and so on for Montgomery_County ,control
but uh the  I  I did find I then needed two hip replacements ,control
and recently I  about two years ago I was in an auto accident ,control
so  I do use a cane now ,control
but I'm fine ,control
and  and  and the daughter is fine ,control
this is a tough one but I'll say it anyway ,control
it was a sad one but it had a great impact on my entire life ,control
I was eight years old ,control
and we were extremely poor ,control
and uh we were dispossessed from our apartment ,control
and it was ice on the ground ,control
and at that time when that happened I made up my mind that I will never be poor again ,control
and that I will not rely on a man ,control
that I can make it on my own ,control
and I certainly have ,control
okay  here's a little boy who's having a good time ,control
and he kicks the ball and unfortunately it breaks a window ,control
and uh the  the ball rolls into the  uh a man's home ,control
and he's very very disturbed over this ,control
he looks at the window holds the ball and looks to see who kicked the ball ,control
I want you to know I'm enjoying this ,control
this is my thing ,control
um mama is telling this little boy ,control
 it's raining out ,control
 you hafta take the umbrella ,control
and he's saying ,control
 aw shucks  I don't need an umbrella ,control
so  he goes outside ,control
and of_course it is raining ,control
and he's annoyed with himself ,control
and he's trying to hold his head uh to get out_of the rain ,control
he comes in ,control
and he finally admits to his mother ,control
 yup  I guess I need the umbrella ,control
and he walks away with the umbrella ,control
 okay ,control
a little girl was riding her bike ,control
and the  the cat was following her ,control
and the cat ran up the tree ,control
she comes back crying to the father and the mother ,control
and the father says ,control
 don't worry about it ,control
 I'll get the cat out_of the tree ,control
and he takes the um  ladder ,control
and he climbs the tree ,control
and the ladder falls down ,control
in the meantime  a dog comes along and is barking at him ,control
and the cat is also a_little afraid of that dog ,control
so  it doesn't come down ,control
and the kid's still crying ,control
 I want my cat ,control
 I want my cat ,control
anyway  either the man uses his cell phone or she cries to her mother ,control
and they get the  the fire people to use the ladder to get the cat down ,control
yes ,control
a little bit ,control
okay ,control
uh Cinderella lives in a home with a wicked mother and two ugly mean sisters ,control
and she's really abused in every way ,control
they take tremendous advantage of her ,control
she's the cleanup person  she wears rags  and all that sort of thing ,control
anyway  they hear that there's a great ball coming up ,control
and uh the two daughters and the mother are going to the ball ,control
and of_course they're gonna leave Cinderella home ,control
they want Cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on ,control
and so she does ,control
and uh she thinks about the ball ,control
and she's really very very sad ,control
and she makes a wish ,control
and the wish is that she can go to the ball ,control
when a fairy godmother appears and tells her ,control
 yes  you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight ,control
and she says ,control
uh okay  I will ,control
and the fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well ,control
and she gets into this big pumpkin ,control
uh what can I call it ,control
anyway  it's  it's something that carries her to the ball ,control
and when she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her ,control
and she hears the midnight stroke ,control
and she gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise ,control
so  she goes running down the steps ,control
and she loses her shoe ,control
and uh she gets home okay ,control
the prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit ,control
and it doesn't seem to fit anyone ,control
and the  the ugly  the mean mother has him try on the  the shoes on the two ugly daughters ,control
and uh finally Cinderella comes down ,control
and although the mother doesn't want him to  he tries on the shoe ,control
and it fits her ,control
and I believe he  he then wants to marry her ,control
uh I would try and get good bread  like whole wheat bread or something like that ,control
and I'd first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick ,control
and then get uh raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on ,control
and put the second slice on top of it ,control
and then cut it in quarters for a young child ,control
