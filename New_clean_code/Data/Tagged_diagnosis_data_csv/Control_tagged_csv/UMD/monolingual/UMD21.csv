well  not bad ,control
I've given several speeches ,control
um haltingly ,control
um  I've had um  uh prestroke incidents ,control
TIAs ,control
serious illness  yes ,control
I was um flat on my back for a year at age ten with uh rheumatic fever ,control
the days before there were antibiotics ,control
so  there was no way to cure it ,control
and I was one of the few who survived at that time ,control
that was one of the close calls ,control
hm well  I  uh I was  uh when  when they told me I could get up I uh was very happy ,control
and I was gonna go out and play baseball ,control
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed ,control
I hadta learn to walk again ,control
um  so   I got into all sorts of athletic activities ,control
um my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again ,control
and uh he also bought a uh one arm printing press because he wanted me to exercise on this printing press ,control
so  I went into business uh printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve ,control
uh but I  I maintained uh some form of athleticism all the way up until  uh up  up  up until the time that I uh enlisted in the  in the navy ,control
I was a uh long distance runner in school ,control
I played basketball with half hour quarters ,control
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time  laughs ,control
um  and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and  got into as much of that as I could ,control
and uh I think it  had a salutary effect ,control
that's the um naval air core flight test which is the toughest uh physical ,control
it's four days of uh physical examinations um as_well_as um um academic ,control
you hadta be at the top  top ten percent of your class to get started ,control
then came the physical ,control
that was a challenge ,control
and so that's why I got into the navy ,control
yeah  there's no  there's no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever ,control
um the few other people who survived  the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort ,control
and uh the first time I went through the navy exam they said ,control
 well  you've had rheumatic fever ,control
 you have a heart condition ,control
 get out ,control
so  when I went back again I  I checked to make sure I didn't ,control
and then I went back again ,control
and I didn't fill out the paper first ,control
I went through the exam and got through  got to the end and they said ,control
 uh well  have you had any conditions ,control
 yes  rheumatic fever ,control
 well  you  you can't be here then ,control
and I said ,control
 well  I just passed your exam ,control
 well  alright  if you wanna go  go ,control
oh  there's so many ,control
what kind of a story do you wanna hear ,control
uh  well  there  there was  there was one uh interesting time uh when I was  uh when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasn't working ,control
we  we had a  we had a good program by all appearances ,control
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms ,control
and they looked like an army ,control
and they'd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight ,control
and still malaria ,control
why ,control
so  I went out looking for answers ,control
and on this one occasion I drove for  across this desert area for about oh  musta been six hours ,control
I'd been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark ,control
and I'm getting a_little concerned ,control
I was also warned about the Danakil people uh also called Afars ,control
very um  no uh I don't think you'd call it hostile ,control
but they didn't have many friends because their  their  uh the way they qualify for marriage ,control
they had these mass weddings that were made ,control
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body ,control
so   after about six hours uh we happened upon this little group of tuplesn  round mud houses ,control
and we stopped the uh Landrover ,control
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys ,control
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars ,control
I thought ,control
 boy  I shouldn't be here ,control
and it turned out that about a third of the community  maybe more  were down with malaria ,control
and they assumed that I was a physician because they'd  on the only white people they had seen before were physicians ,control
just by sheer accident I had a car full of  medication ,control
so  for about the next two hours I was a physician  laughs ,control
peering under eyelids and  and baby bottoms and  and administering this medicine ,control
and uh at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy ,control
and suddenly the chief appeared ,control
seven feet high  long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice ,control
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests ,control
I said ,control
 what's that ,control
they said ,control
 smoked camel's milk ,control
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days ,control
I said ,control
 apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but ,control
and the driver kicked me and he said ,control
 you've been doing fine up until now  FirstnameJ ,control
 don't ruin it ,control
so  we had smoked camel's milk ,control
it's better than Pepto_Bismol ,control
it really works ,control
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds ,control
and the chief got a big smile on his face ,control
it all ended well ,control
I don't know whether this is in your interview or not ,control
but um at my age I very often uh forget the word that I want to say ,control
and it's getting a_little worse  laughs ,control
names especially ,control
well  the dad sends the son out to get a_little exercise ,control
and  he finds the soccer ball ending in his lap ,control
and he looks out there and he says ,control
 good shot  son ,control
end of story ,control
oh  this reminds me of my childhood ,control
um  mom wants son to take an umbrella with him ,control
and he says ,control
 I don't need that ,control
 um it's just something to get in the way ,control
and is surprised on his trip by running into a rain storm ,control
he comes home drenching wet ,control
mother says ,control
 I told you so ,control
and son has learned a lesson ,control
just like my childhood ,control
laughs this  this is an instant right out_of my life ,control
girl's  girl's cat has crawled up into the tree ,control
and the dad says ,control
 well  I'll go fetch it ,control
why is the dog barking ,control
I don't know ,control
possibly because there's a man in the tree ,control
uh and in the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder ,control
somebody called for help ,control
here comes the firemen to get him out_of the tree ,control
this happened to the fellow next door to me ,control
uh when I had a house nearby he got up on the roof to repair it and uh accidentally kicked down the ladder ,control
and he called me over and said ,control
 can you pick the ladder up ,control
and I said ,control
 well  not for a while ,control
 I wanna call the neighbors here ,control
 maybe I can charge admission to see this ,control
mhm ,control
vaguely ,control
this goes way back ,control
wow  I don't remember this version ,control
yeah ,control
these these two  first two pages I don't remember at all ,control
xxx ,control
uh ,control
good lord ,control
this is gonna be tough to remember ,control
0  flipping though book ,control
something missing here ,control
oh  there it is ,control
hm  what's with the key ,control
I don't  remember that part ,control
0  humming ,control
and I don't remember those  first two pages ,control
but I gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who  lives on an estate ,control
and uh  is um  is to have a um ball  maybe coming out party ,control
I don't know ,control
is that the way the story goes ,control
mhm ,control
well  as I recall  Cinderella and  and her  sisters were all workers in this estate ,control
and uh  she being the youngest one was the most discriminated against ,control
the others uh uh treated her badly ,control
she always got the worst tasks to perform   and longed for a different life ,control
uh  I don't remember the bit about the key  uh her ,control
her sister locks her in the room ,control
I don't know ,control
uh  well  that comes a_little later ,control
a fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because she's been such a  good person ,control
and uh uh  the arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight ,control
and uh  at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her ,control
uh but then hasta flee uh on schedule to avoid  the  uh  being converted back into a chambermaid ,control
and in the process  loses her shoe ,control
the uh handsome gentleman  uh upon  upon discovering the shoe  determines he's gonna look for a person that  uh that that fits ,control
uh  and the evil sisters are determined it's gonna be one of them ,control
so  that must be where the key comes in ,control
they lock her room ,control
I don't know  I don't recall how she gets out ,control
but at any rate uh it's eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits ,control
and everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters ,control
almond butter ,control
absolutely ,control
well  I usually put almond butter on one uh  slice of bread and  and jelly on the other and fold it ,control
