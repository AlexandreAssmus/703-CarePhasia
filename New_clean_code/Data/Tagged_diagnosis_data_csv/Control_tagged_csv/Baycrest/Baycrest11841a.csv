hm well  it was when I was a kid ,control
and I went with a group of my friends ,control
I think I was maybe about eight or  between eight and ten ,control
something like that ,control
and we went down to this local creek ,control
we lived in a small village ,control
and it was about a mile down to the creek ,control
and it was springtime ,control
and we were cautioned not to go down because it was  you_know,control
not a river ,control
it was a creek ,control
well  anyhow we  boys will be boys ,control
and we defied laughs all odds ,control
and we went down ,control
and we always had like hammers and nails that we bore from our,control
so  uh we went down ,control
and we uh found some logs and some odd boards ,control
and we put together a raft ,control
and we went rafting ,control
and the water was a very free flowing ,control
and it was fantastic ,control
but of_course we hit one point ,control
and there was a ice floe ,control
and the raft went sideways ,control
and we all went into the water ,control
so  uh you_know and at that time we wore rubber boots ,control
but they were no help because the water was more like uh waist,control
and uh we got soaked from the waist down ,control
water went in the boots ,control
and  and then we finally made it to shore thank_goodness ,control
otherwise it coulda been more serious ,control
and uh when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots ,control
but laughs we still had our socks on ,control
and we were wet ,control
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in,control
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road ,control
and it was like slosh_slosh_slish_slosho you_know ,control
and it was getting colder because when you're wet like that ,control
and we got home ,control
and uh you_know unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in,control
 where have you been ,control
 what happened ,control
so  we  we got a huge reprimand you_know ,control
so  uh but uh thankfully we made it home ,control
but because the temperature was dropping our sort_of uh jeans or,control
they were starting to freeze ,control
so  it was like walking  laughs walking along like a robot ,control
but uh we made it home ,control
and uh everything was fine ,control
but it was sad in_that we got reprimanded ,control
but we were happy when we were doing the  uh you_know the,control
so  we had a good time ,control
and you_know we laughed about it ,control
and you_know we were all chummy ,control
and we walked back ,control
we didn't  we didn't think too much of it ,control
but you_know when we got home it was kind_of sad laughs ,control
thank_you ,control
um typical day I would uh go for a walk throat,control
I would go shopping ,control
um I would try to get involved in some local activity ,control
we have community gardens ,control
we have a recreation center on site where I live ,control
so  there variety of activities ,control
if it's a very hot day I would choose to maybe go downtown to uh,control
sometimes it's kind_of neat to pretend you're a tourist laughs,control
and the tourists seem to be very polite you_know ,control
up in my neck of the woods where I live right now you say hi to,control
and they look at you kind_of strange like ,control
 what do you want ,control
whereas you_know tourists uh they seem to be friendlier ,control
so  I'll go to Harbor_Front ,control
if I've got the funds  available funds I'll go to the islands ,control
and that's time consuming ,control
but during the week it's the best time to go ,control
on weekends you hafta stand in line ,control
and it's a throat,control
you spend more time travel downtown and going across in the ferry,control
and INV,control
and uh you_know there's bicycle rentals  canoe rentals ,control
there's uh lots to do ,control
miles of walkways ,control
so  yeah I try to keep busy ,control
I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities ,control
otherwise I find you_know doing the same thing it's like being a,control
and you have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day,control
so  it's kind_of nice to try different activities ,control
I like uh the you_know variety ,control
yeah throat,control
there's no Cinderella in these ,control
okay ,control
looks like the boy is kicking what appears to be a soccer ball ,control
and unfortunately it goes and breaks the window  a shuttered,control
and in number three the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in,control
the man picks up the ball  looks out the window  uh glances it,control
can I just scan the whole story INV,control
okay ,control
see the progression ,control
looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy ,control
he says ,control
 no no no no ,control
 I don't want the umbrella ,control
 it's not going to rain ,control
and upon leaving for school with his backpack it appears that the,control
and then he's  looks like he's on his way home or way back with,control
and uh stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down,control
and she doesn't look too happy ,control
and he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again ,control
okay  there's a_lot_of action here ,control
uh looks like there's a girl who's reaching up into a deciduous,control
there's a tricycle ,control
perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle ,control
there's a man up in a tree throat,control
perhaps uh he was climbing up the tree ,control
and now there's a dog barking up the tree at the man ,control
he looks very uh perturbed  upset because he can't get down,control

and she was made to do all the work ,control
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person ,control
and she lived I believe in the attic ,control
and she would talk to the birds ,control

she was always working ,control

she was overworked ,control
she'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the,control
there was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse ,control
Cinderella was always mopping  mopping cleaning you_know cooking,control

it was sealed ,control
and the delivery went to the stepmother ,control
stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read,control
Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited ,control
but as it turned out she was not ,control
so  the stepmother denied her that ,control
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the,control
they were invited to a ball ,control
the prince was having a ball ,control
Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the,control
in fact she tried on or  looked at a dress that she would,control

the birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special,control
she was so delighted with the dress ,control
meanwhile the stepmother and the t two sisters were uh prancing,control
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her,control
I believe that they may have been responsible throat,control
she cried ,control
everybody was sad  her friends the animals  small creatures,control
the fairy godmother heard her pleas and  and her sorrow,control
and she came and waved her magic wand and turned pumpkin into a,control
sobs it's a sad story ,control
into a magnificent coach for Cinderella ,control

meanwhile she raced home before the entire dream disappeared in the,control
and  and then she made it back ,control
the dress disappeared ,control
the angry godmother met her ,control
and she uh was very annoyed at her that she came home so late ,control
meanwhile the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom,control
