okay ,control
okay ,control
well  um one of the big  one of the very important things,control
that was like very positive experience ,control
and I was a teenager at the time ,control
and um it was a significant change ,control
it was quite a drastic change ,control
and  um but it was uh interesting in the sense that it was,control
it was just a big  a big change and a big transition ,control
and uh it was you_know with all these expectations and  and,control
learning  you_know getting used to a whole new culture ,control
not language because I spoke English uh where I came from ,control
and  um but just getting used to whole new culture and um,control
like s like you_know we spoke differently from how we s,control
and  um and so  just getting used to everyone and the culture,control
it wasn't  well  one of the  one of the things uh,control
we drive on the  we drove on the left in the other  in,control
it's former British_Guyana ,control
and um you_know just getting used to consumerism ,control
that was one of the big shock you_know ,control
we didn't  we didn't spend money there like we  we did here,control
like my parents certainly didn't spend money and buy clothing and,control
and there was just money that was  money that's so,control
right ,control
it is just a dispensable commodity ,control
and I guess it's just like everything else today ,control
especially in the last fifteen twenty years you_know ,control
it's like everything has become dispensable ,control
you_know it's like you buy a shirt ,control
you wear it a few times ,control
and then you can go get another one because it's so inexpensive now,control
and  um but there's a premium on education ,control
and that's where I invested my time ,control
and um I spent many years in education while  while working,control
I just did it because I felt I could do it ,control
and it was immensely challenging ,control
but I struggled through it ,control
and I was very successful ,control
a typical day  a workday ,control
I'll describe a typical workday ,control
I'm up at five a_m ,control
I'm just  I just got useta getting up really early ,control
and I would um have a cup of coffee ,control
and I would uh brush my teeth and shave and shower ,control
and then I would put on my sweatpants and tshirt ,control
and if it's the wintertime I'd get on my jacket and uh winter,control
and I would go around the block for a walk a couple  two,control
espe especially when it's colder you kind_of INV,control
and so  by the time I'm  I've done I would go out  go out,control
by then I'm sweating ,control
um so  that gives  gives my  my  it revs up my whole,control
and that's  that's great because it just jumpstarts my whole,control
and then um I'll just undress and cool down and um then get,control
and I don't typically have a morning breakfast ,control
it's just something I got used to ,control
and it works really well for me ,control
I  I don't consume dairy products because I'm lactose intolerant,control
and um so  I'll walk to work ,control
it's about a twelve minute walk  twelve to fifteen minute walk,control
and then when I get there and I  um I'll have another half,control
well  maybe almost a full cup but with brown sugar again ,control
and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative,control
and you check your email and other  voicemail and all these,control
so  administration consumes a_lot_of time ,control
and by then it's eight o'clock ,control
then I'm ready to get into my work like for another half an hour,control
I'm ready to get into my  you_know the chargeable work,control
but it's the auditing or accounting or tax work ,control
whatever is  whatever I have on my desk or whatever is ,control
and so  that will take up  consume most of my morning ,control
I tend not to eat or snack in the  during the day ,control
I  um I'm  I'm a little bit disciplined with that ,control
because I used to ,control
and I useta be very um ,control
and it didn't work well for me ,control
I was very overweight at one time ,control
and I  it didn't work well for me ,control
so  I  and  and then I sit down all day ,control
and so  that's  uh that became a problem because I was,control
so  I really hadta uh get rid of the weight ,control
and it changed  it made a huge change ,control
so  I'm actually a pure pure vegan now ,control
and for the last three years ,control
well  a total of five years now but mostly so the last three years,control
and um so  lunchtime will come around ,control
and I take my lunch ,control
so  I  I make my own lunch ,control
and  um and so  I'll have lunch between eleven thirty and,control
uh I actually go out for a walk ,control
I always get up and go for a walk  get some fresh air and come,control
not a long walk but a short walk ,control
and then I'll have lunch ,control
and by twelve thirty  between twelve thirty or one o'clock,control
but in the middle of the day again you might have some,control
you gotta check your emails or voicemails  deal with any other,control
and  um and then around one o'clock then I really get back,control
and you_know so  one to  one to three ,control
so  I give it a solid two hours one to three ,control
and then I take a break at three o'clock to three fifteen ,control
and I did get some water or  or go downstairs and go for a walk,control
and um any other issues that come up again  the same  the,control
administrative  administrative stuff goes on all the time,control
and then between three fifteen to five o'clock I xxx the chargeable,control
and then I try to get out_of there right after five o'clock ,control
so  I'd pack up at five o'clock and um you_know do the routine,control
it depends ,control
it could be personal stuff ,control
it could be client related matters ,control
and um then I try to get outta there right at five o'clock or,control
and I make sure I'm there at that time every day ,control
tell me the story ,control
okay so  he's kicking a soccer ball ,control
and uh the soccer ball broke the window ,control
and the soccer ball went through the glass pane  broke the glass,control
and he's gotten up  the fellow who was sitting at the ,control
it looks like it entered in someone's house through the broken,control
and he's now gotten up ,control
and he's picked up the ball ,control
and he's looking out to see who did that ,control
so  starting at one ,control
okay so  the mother is giving her child the umbrella because it,control
and so  he's ,control
okay so  he didn't  he just said goodbye ,control
and he did not take the umbrella ,control
but then when he went out it started to rain ,control
so  he  I guess he regretted not taking the umbrella ,control
so  he became wet ,control
he went  he walked through the rain ,control
and he became wet ,control
and he went back home ,control
and looks like he went back home ,control
and he got the umbrella after all ,control
and this story is ,control
alright  it looks like the pet  the child's pet is up in the tree,control
and the father is trying to get the pet ,control
and it looks like he's stuck in the tree now as_well ,control
and the dog is barking up the tree ,control
but they call the fire department ,control
and so  the fire  the ambulance  the fire guys are,control
and they're gonna go rescue the pet and maybe the father ,control

and this is Cinderella ,control
they  she was more like the housemaid or the house servant ,control
and  um and these were her friends ,control

and she was their  their maid essentially ,control
and uh the knight who he the ,control

and so  there you go again ,control
she was uh always  she was their cleaner and housemaid ,control
and that's what  that's what that picture shows ,control
and uh the  oh  this is the delivery of the invitation ,control
there was the  they were going to a ball ,control
right ,control
so  there she  that's the invitation being delivered ,control
and sh okay  there's the  the stepmother uh who's reading,control
and  and I guess this is probably Cinderella inquiring whether,control
and this is the wicked wit witch  witch uh telling her that,control
or she wouldn't gonna show it to her or something like that ,control
and okay so  there's Cinderella getting her dress ready for the,control
and what is that ,control

I'm not sure who that is ,control
that's the fairy I guess  the fairy godmother ,control
and okay so  the fairy godmother is  uh c has come to her,control
I take it ,control
and um okay so  the fairy godmother is ,control
