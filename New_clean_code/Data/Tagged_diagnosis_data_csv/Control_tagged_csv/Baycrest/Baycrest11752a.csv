oh okay ,control
um I guess the  one of the earliest memories that I have is,control
it was a wonderful experience because uh I was living in a small,control
and there wasn't the opportunity to partake in any sort of,control
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports ,control
um they had rowing ,control
and they also had arts and handicrafts  music theater which I,control
um and so  that gave us the opportunity to have a really full,control
and also what I really laughs enjoyed was the fact that they,control
uh we could eat we if we wanted ,control
if we didn't feel like eating we didn't hafta eat ,control
there was never anybody saying that you_know you weren't allowed,control
so  that was  I was in uh my glory because I would have,control
and that was enough for me ,control
um also um we uh resided in these cabins uh in the woods ,control
and every morning the uh counselors would take us swimming before,control
and it was always really  really chilly in the morning ,control
and so  this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks,control
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water ,control
I don't know ,control
I can't remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to,control
but it was always freezing cold ,control
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake laughs ,control
used to attach themselves to your leg ,control
of_course suck on your blood ,control
and that the only way that you could get them off is  was if,control
and then you could pull them off your  your leg ,control
um and then we'd all go back  get dressed and then go and have,control
and um in the evenings of_course you_know we useta sit around the,control
everybody used to sing songs and tell stories  ghost stories and,control
and then um you_know that would be the end of the day ,control
and it was just  it was glorious ,control
I just  I loved camp ,control
um and arts and crafts was really good ,control
we  they always had lots_of materials and uh somebody who had,control
and there's painting and things that we useta create with um wood,control
and then I_mean I think I was only there for a week ,control
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity ,control
because the days were just so  so  so full ,control
and then at the end of the week you_know they'd bring in the school,control
uh I was living in Montreal at the time ,control
 go back to Montreal ,control
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it,control
and I made such good  good friends and people that I really,control
and um once home I kept in contact with a_lot_of the people that,control
a_lot_of the  the girls that I met at the camp ,control
so  that was kind_of nice ,control
and then I went to you_know every year I'd go back to that same,control
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back ,control
and so you would meet the same people over  and  over and,control
so  it was  it was nice xxx ,control
every year it's you_know looking forward to seeing FirstnameE or,control
and um yeah those were  those were some really really really,control
it was just so nice to be away from the city and living in the,control
mhm ,control
laughs well  uh today  laughs today I'm here ,control
uh no  usually I've  uh I retired as_of last year ,control
um so  at the moment I'm involved in uh renovating our house ,control
we haven't done anything to the house in the last twenty five years,control
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by,control
and being elderly she wasn't able to do any of the housework or,control
so  uh it was pretty run down when I bought it ,control
and she musta been a real cat lover because uh there were stray,control
inside the house the  the carpets just reeked of cat urine ,control
the walls were crumbling ,control
the plaster was cracked ,control
there was water damage everywhere ,control
I guess she'd left the windows open ,control
and the rain had come in ,control
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck ,control
so  anyways  we did a little bit of renovations ,control
but we haven't done much since then ,control
and that was twenty five years ago ,control
so  anyways  we hired somebody to you_know put together some,control
and  um and hired a contractor ,control
and at the moment what's happening is that the contractor and the,control
um so  they're arguing about everything ,control
the  the  the  the guy who designed the space you_know,control
 that's the way it hasta be ,control
the contractor says  is arguing that it can't work that way,control
 if you're gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support,control
and all this kind_of stuff ,control
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera ,control
so  I've been dealing a_lot with that on a daily basis at_least,control
um so many issues ,control
so many details ,control
um you_know and I can't really afford a designer ,control
but I know I should because I'm not very good at it laughs ,control
uh but anyways  so  just trying to figure out you_know,control
that's  that's the major thing in my mind at the moment ,control
okay ,control
um so  the young  young man is kicking around a soccer ball,control
the soccer ball breaks uh a neighbor's window  goes into the,control
the neighbor gets up out_of his chair to look out the window to see,control
um imit,control
so  it was a  there's a mother and her son ,control
and she's telling him ,control
 look  it's probably gonna rain today ,control
 you better take your umbrella ,control
and he's there ,control
 no no no  I don't need my umbrella ,control
 I'm fine ,control
 I'm fine ,control
sure enough as the mother had said it starts to rain ,control
and he doesn't have an umbrella ,control
he gets all wet ,control
and he comes home ,control
he's dripping wet ,control
and his mother frowns at him  says ,control
 look  why  you_know you shoulda brought your umbrella ,control
so  anyways  she dries him off and gives him an umbrella ,control
and out he goes into the rain ,control
laughs this one ,control
uh this man was being chased by a dog ,control
and the only way that he could get away from the dog was by,control
no  no  no  no  no  no  no ,control
there was a dog who was chasing a cat up a tree ,control
