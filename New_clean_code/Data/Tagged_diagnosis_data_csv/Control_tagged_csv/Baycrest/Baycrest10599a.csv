sounds like a ten minute interview ,control
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk,control
um it was important to me to get into law school ,control
that was something that happened that was very important ,control
I have no idea why I was accepted because I don't think I met any,control
thirty two ,control
I was thirty two when I started ,control
so  I guess I was thirty one when I applied ,control
and in my year the median age was twenty two ,control
so  I was one of the oldest in the class  had nothing in common,control
I_mean they still remembered high_school ,control
who thought about high_school ,control
and they all knew each_other from high_school ,control
and they were there because they didn't get into medical school or,control
and I was just flummoxed ,control
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came,control
they were just there because ,control
well  I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the,control
and I was there because I just really cared ,control
and so  I really didn't fit in um really ,control
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real,control
up until then I was friendly with people but I didn't understand,control
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study,control
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what,control
like they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious ,control
why would anybody say the obvious ,control
so  people said the obvious ,control
and they were rewarded ,control
so  those were the people sought after to be in the study groups ,control
not me ,control
so  I did almost everything alone for the entire year ,control
and when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she,control
so  I said ,control
 thanks but no thanks ,control
 don't bother ,control
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didn't,control
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it ,control
so  that was me laughs ,control
so  I was part of that group for some classes ,control
at the end of the year i in the subway station I met someone who,control
um but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy,control
and she was in the other group ,control
so  I never saw her ,control
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I,control
and that was good ,control
like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one,control
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the,control
and he said ,control
 please  when you write your exams don't think that your mark is,control
and I thought ,control
 wow it is so amazing to hear something like that ,control
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged,control
it was in law school that I learned that competentq was a,control
 oh he's a competent lawyer ,control
and that the positive term was brightq ,control
if you weren't bright you were nobody ,control
so  um because he wasn't bright the students didn't respect him,control
and I th made the mistake of saying to someone ,control
 you_know yeah h okay but he's decent ,control
 like he's a decent person ,control
 he has a heart ,control
and she said ,control
 a heart ,control
 I didn't come to Oz where this one doesn't have a brain and this,control
 I came to law school ,control
didn't talk to her again ,control
U_of_T ,control
U_of_T was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada ,control
I don't know why ,control
and I also didn't understand that law schools had their own kind of,control
but I didn't  I didn't know that ,control
I didn't even get it until after I left ,control
so  really it wasn't the right school for me ,control
I really should have gone to York ,control
but when I came to Toronto people were saying ,control
 oh U_of_T ,control
 it's the best school ,control
 and why would you wanna be way out at York ,control
 you're in Toronto ,control
 you wanna be downtown ,control
so  I thought ,control
 okay I wanna be downtown ,control
so  I was downtown ,control
boy kicks the ball ,control
flies into a glass window  breaks the window and falls into the,control
it knocks over the lamp ,control
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see,control
it looks like he's got his gun in the pock pocket ,control
okay  the mother tells the child to take an umbrella ,control
and the child doesn't want one ,control
oh the  uh but in this  st in the second one the,control
well  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh I see ,control
so  the mother offers the child the umbrella ,control
the child refuses ,control
the child says ,control
 goodbye ,control
goes outside ,control
it's raining ,control
it's really raining ,control
and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother who's not,control
well  w what's happening is that um firefighters are rushing,control
but it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was,control
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat ,control
and then he got stuck ,control
and then the firemen are coming to save the man ,control
maybe the cat was chasing the bird ,control
no  I think the dog was chasing the cat ,control
am I allowed to make it a xxx ,control
the bane of feminists everywhere  Cinderella's story about a,control
and I don't think we find out how she got to that situation but,control
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a,control
she always  she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking,control
and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes ,control
and she wasn't given the best food to eat ,control
and anyway she was just treated horribly ,control
one day uh the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an,control
Cinderella  thinking she's a member of the family thinks she can,control
but she can't ,control
so  she h has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get,control
and then they go ,control
after they leave she's very disappointed because she really wanted,control
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her,control
so  she gives her a beautiful dress to wear  lovely new shoes and,control
and the only rule is be back by twelve ,control
so  Cinderella went to the ball ,control
she had a wonderful time ,control
nobody knew who she was ,control
everybody was saying ,control
 oh who's that woman ,control
 who's that woman ,control
the prince danced with her the whole evening ,control
she had a lovely time ,control
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta,control
so  she ran out ,control
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper,control
um following that  the prince found the missing slipper ,control
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper ,control
so  he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's,control
it didn't fit anybody ,control
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly,control
and he tried it on their feet ,control
it didn't fit any of them ,control
and he saw Cinderella and said ,control
 why don't you try it ,control
or possibly she said ,control
 why don't I try it ,control
and he tried it on ,control
and it fit ,control
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after,control
and she of  co of_course  being swept off her feet  agreed,control
that she'd just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and,control
