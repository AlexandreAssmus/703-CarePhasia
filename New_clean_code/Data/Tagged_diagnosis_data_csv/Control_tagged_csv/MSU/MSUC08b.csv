 the  sighs the most  the most memorable event was ,control
it  but I think I did tell you about it ,control
the  the yeah ,control
it was about the  the possible scare ,control
it was just a lump in  in my breast ,control
and that  w I'm  I'm pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of  of our son to think about ,control
and I didn't think because of my age or the  the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything um more than precaution to do the  um the procedure ,control
click but as close as I came was uh you_know the  the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and  g and caring ,control
and I  I felt supported the whole  the whole time ,control
just that um I  I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasn't sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so  um the uh dressings and bandage were so tight ,control
but I just remember thinking um the  s the they'll be  I'll do whatever I hafta do on it ,control
and whatever's next I'll find out about and take care of ,control
so  it's a moving progression ,control
I don't usually write the end of a story um if it's something like that ,control
if you tell me I'll say ,control
 oh  we'll go through it step by step ,control
 and we'll get there ,control
it was like that ,control
so  I'm fortunate that it hasn't been anything worse than that ,control
just  f I can only remember being busy because with  uh with uh a toddler ,control
he was a year old then ,control
and  uh and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another ,control
it was nothing short of click uh show up for a doctor's appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done ,control
so  I didn't think about ,control
uh I knew I had  it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright ,control
so  it wasn't much to do except you_know just take care of  of the healing part uh and cooperate ,control
but uh I was sure everything was going to be alright ,control
something important ,control
well I think   I think oddly enough uh fi of  of meeting and  and continuing a  a life with Joe ,control
it was um I'm sure the most important th thing that ever happened ,control
um the most memorable day was the day our son was born ,control
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how  how interesting that all was ,control
we were students at Montclair_State ,control
and in those days  freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and  in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus ,control
we hadta sing the  the alma_mater ,control
but w the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at  s at Life_Hall ,control
and he noticed the sign and said something about ,control
I think I had  part of it was covered ,control
and he said ,control
 are you a  a speech major ,control
I said ,control
 no English ,control
and I  I un unveiled the  the words English ,control
but he was a senior ,control
and I was a freshman ,control
and so I got to meet one of the  you_know the upperclassmen got his signature ,control
and then later um we just had  it was an easy conversation ,control
we just  we talked a_little ,control
he  laughs he continued um when I  whenever I saw him to say hi ,control
and I  uh people would tell me ,control
 he's a BMOC ,control
you_know  he's a  he was a  a vice president of student government ,control
and I said ,control
 oh_my_goodness ,control
but the more we hadta talk about ,control
I was a student leader in my high school ,control
and I thought when he  when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee laughs ,control
but it turned out that he we  he was interested ,control
so  our first date I think  was the ,control
it was something like the Kingston_Trio or something like that ,control
some folk group ,control
it was really nice ,control
they were on campus laughs ,control
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come clears,control
that was one of his duties ,control
but when I just s think of how all that unfolded just uh ,control
I knew I  I was gonna finish school ,control
and so we  we paced ourselves I guess  you_know to  to be logical about things ,control
get to know each other no surprises uh along the way ,control
because you have time with a person and you  you see them in all the seasons and all ,control
but I think when it finally came to  to getting married um I don't think there was a formal uh ,control
we  we  people ask us but this was f not even a formal proposal ,control
I think everyone around us assumed we would m marry ,control
click so  we did ,control
laughs and so I  I wasn't engaged ,control
you_know  I w we  I was pinned ,control
and someone said to me the next day ,control
 you_know you're  you're engaged to be engaged ,control
I said ,control
 no  I'm not ,control
and they said ,control
 well  that's what that means ,control
and I said ,control
 oh  I thought it meant sort_of going steady college style ,control
they said ,control
 no  you're engaged to be engaged ,control
I said ,control
 well  we have some time to go before ,control
I said ,control
 it means what it means to the individual couple too ,control
so  I tried to assert myself ,control
but I guess they might have been right ,control
but I don't  I don't care ,control
it didn't mean anything ,control
but that it  when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross I_mean that's  that's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married ,control
and all that happened at once ,control
it all converged ,control
it's alright that we've done this before ,control
okay laughs same story ,control
now um uh was it little Ned ,control
no  this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself ,control
and the trajectory is off ,control
it goes right through a window ,control
and we hear the crash ,control
and um the lamp has gone over ,control
and  and I'm assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody who's startled that this uh intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture ,control
and he says ,control
 I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard ,control
okay laughs ,control
it's still raining ,control
okay  in the first picture it's about to rain ,control
mom is telling little sweetie ,control
 take your umbrella with you because I think it's going to rain today ,control
and the little  little Sammy this time says ,control
 no no no no no I don't need it I'm a big kid ,control
and as he says goodbye his mom is just g offering it one more time ,control
he says ,control
 so_long ,control
see you later ,control
but as he steps out the door wouldn't you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall ,control
and as he's  getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says ,control
 oh  drat ,control
and when he back  gets back home and looks at mom I think she's restraining the ,control
 I told you ,control
and he's looking a bit sheepish little Sammy ,control
but he's out in  in the last frame clears,control
but he's still going in the opposite direction here ,control
okay ,control
we're in a time warp you_know ,control
you guys have not moved forward from last  last week laughs ,control
okay ,control
groundhog day clears,control
no  this is cat up in a tree day ,control
click oh_my_goodness my_goodness ,control
uh this is little sweet Sue ,control
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree ,control
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb ,control
the ladder that he must have taken to  to get to  um to the cat has fallen ,control
so  he's stranded ,control
and little Fido is barking and saying ,control
 what the heck are you doing up there ,control
but thankfully the  the firemen are on their way ,control
kindly neighbors must have called and said ,control
 help help help ,control
and so they're rushing along with the ladder ,control
they will rescue him shortly ,control
and uh I think they'll get dad down before they get the cat down ,control
I think that's the priority ,control
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world ,control
it's all going to work out just fine ,control
alright  I think last time it was a combination as_well ,control
what  uh once upon a time there was a  a family uh where the  f there was a widow ,control
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to uh a woman he had met ,control
but the woman had two daughters of her own ,control
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after uh the woman and her daughter the  became the stepmother and the stepsisters and a joined the  f the um household of Cinderella and her dad ,control
I'm assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again ,control
and she must deal with the family  her new family ,control
and they're not very kind ,control
there's  uh they're um mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother ,control
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of  Cinderella at every option ,control
and so she did the serv uh chores and she was treated badly ,control
um simultaneously there is another father and a s and a  sib and a offspring a prince this time ,control
and the father is a king ,control
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son ,control
and I assume that it's time for him to be married ,control
and so the prince  uh a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful  maidens who are available ,control
an invitation goes out to Cinderella's  stepmother  to the household ,control
and everyone is smiling ,control
and Cinderella I guess  assumes that she might be able to go ,control
but this is not going to happen ,control
um this  the  the book ,control
and I don't know what's going on with that little book yet ,control
but she I  maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house ,control
the little animals or  uh begin to help out ,control
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as  sh as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready ,control
and Cinderella uh now knows that with the help of her f godmother she will get to go ,control
there is a little admonition from  after she's dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably ,control
 be sure you're home by midnight ,control
and then it switches to the  ba to the ball ,control
and I  and the prince sees and falls in love with um at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty ,control
when he could see all that ,control
so  they dance and dance ,control
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase ,control
I guess the the  the right hand man  the  the first secretary  first VP of the king is running after her to say ,control
 w wait a second ,control
 wait a second ,control
but she runs back to the  to  to home ,control
and uh then comes the search for who matches the slipper ,control
and it's he in your little booklet  the uh first vice president then who comes to the door ,control
and there's a funny little picture of somebody tripping laughs and a cushion ,control
but I don't remember any of that from my stories or my film memory ,control
but uh apparently there uh the key  there was a key there that still doesn't mean anything much to me ,control
they must have let him in ,control
um the  the match m is made when she tries on the slipper ,control
and so I  I suppose the  the fella ,control
 xxx we've got our girl ,control
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot ,control
and I don't know why I thought it was th direct ,control
but he could afford to hire help to do that so  so the help took care of it ,control
anyway um uh it's a happy ending ,control
they  uh they get back together again ,control
and I'm sure it's um the prince and his sweet Cinderella and hap life is f happy from then on happily ever after ,control
 oh_my_goodness ,control
did you try it with the little wall ,control
and did we say there's only one piece of bread and we want  we think we want two ,control
we can do it either way ,control
we'll do a half one this time ,control
we'll use the  just the one piece of bread but we're going to make it the same way ,control
we're gonna lay all the ingredients out first because I'm analretentive ,control
we get everything out ,control
the knife  butter knife ,control
we open up the peanut butter first ,control
and we spread a  s a thinnish layer in the middle because we're gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges ,control
all four edges will have a slightly raised click um perimeter ,control
we're going to put ry red raspberry jelly ,control
uh s open that cap up ,control
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesn't cross over the walls so it doesn't hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your  your hand as you're enjoying ,control
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich ,control
if you like you can fold it over which was the way a_lot_of people in my neighborhood did it ,control
click but I think that's it ,control
that's how we'll do it ,control
