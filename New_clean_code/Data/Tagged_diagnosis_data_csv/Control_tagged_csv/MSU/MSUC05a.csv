okay  um I had fallen at one point ,control
and I fractured my right wrist ,control
and I remember that ,control
well  it was um how many years ago ,control
it was probably in nineteen ninety th two or three ,control
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream ,control
and I was looking at the sign ,control
and then I tripped and fell ,control
and I was holding my keys in my right hand ,control
and so I've  but I got a little fracture ,control
and I hadta go to the emergency room ,control
hm well I was casted for quite a while ,control
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge I think  was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own  recovery ,control
um but it wasn't really a bad thing all in all ,control
I had the cast on for awhile ,control
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist ,control
yes  I do ,control
I have a very dear friend  cousin who is  um has aphasia ,control
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and she's now seventy one ,control
and I visit her regularly ,control
and we communicate in a very interesting way ,control
well  I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to ,control
and I don't give her many choices ,control
and we do a_lot_of hand motions ,control
and she has a way of communicating ,control
she's pretty amazing ,control
um she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats a_lot ,control
she  she likes to say she wants to go home  indicating her frustration with her situation ,control
but I can see when I speak with her that she's very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts ,control
she has the thoughts she  if she could only put the words together ,control
and it is very very frustrating for her ,control
but I think that she's kind_of come to terms with where she's at ,control
it's hard ,control
wow  well the first thing that came into my mind because I'll  I'll take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place ,control
and the most  so it's a trauma event where my grandfather passed away ,control
and he was not sick ,control
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was um at work ,control
so  he went off on a normal day ,control
and I remember playing you_know with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital ,control
and a friend of mine and I made  put some cookies together and  for when he was going to come home because we didn't entertain the thought of this person  because it was my first experience with the death ,control
so  it's kind_of a sad story ,control
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life um in the sense of the pro cycle of birth and death and whatnot ,control
so  it turned out he passed away that night ,control
and I never did see him again ,control
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship ,control
and uh so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life ,control
and then looking back on it as an adult now um realizing that this man was really an angel of mine ,control
I didn't realize it then but I came to believe ,control
and I don't know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there ,control
came to learn about that ,control
and it just served as a  a real learning in my life in many different ways ,control
okay  well  this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went out_of the way and broke the window ,control
not his intention but it was an accident ,control
and lo_and_behold his dad was sitting in the living room ,control
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad ,control
and um the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didn't see the boy because the boy ran away in fear ,control
um this is the story about a  uh a little boy who was on his way to school ,control
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella ,control
but he didn't wanna take the umbrella because he didn't wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain ,control
so  he went on his way ,control
he got caught in the rain ,control
it started to rain very hard ,control
he got very wet ,control
and he came home ,control
and he got the umbrella ,control
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom ,control
 that's right ,control
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson ,control
 okay  well   little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park  with her dad ,control
and as they were going along they noticed that uh a cat was running along the field ,control
and a dog was chasing it ,control
and don't you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree ,control
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so ,control
she encouraged her dad to uh get the ladder because they lived right across the street ,control
and uh the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree ,control
but then he got stuck in the tree ,control
and uh looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down ,control
so  I'm sure someone had a cell phone in this picture even_though it's not shown ,control
so  the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat ,control
and they all lived happily ever after ,control
hm okay once upon a time there was a young girl ,control
and she hadta go live with um her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldn't take care of her anymore ,control
so  he brought her to this house where these uh stepsisters and stepmother lived ,control
and they took the  the girl in ,control
and um turned out they really um didn't treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted ,control
and she was sort_of like their maid ,control
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent a_lot_of time among the cinders by the fireplace ,control
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball ,control
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball ,control
so  when they got the announcement uh Cinderella knew about it ,control
but of_course the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball ,control
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball ,control
so  the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things ,control
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house ,control
and then they saw how sad she was ,control
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such ,control
but um Cinderella  I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball ,control
so  as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go ,control
and they had beautiful dresses ,control
and she hadta help mend them ,control
and um let's see what happened um clears,control
um she  I think she went out in the garden ,control
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad ,control
and she was crying ,control
and she really wanted to go to the ball ,control
and her fairy godmother had said you_know ,control
 you may go to the ball just um  change ,control
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress ,control
and she said ,control
 fetch me a pumpkin ,control
and then turned it in to a coach ,control
and shen ,control
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin ,control
and so she was able to go off to this ball ,control
and when she got there the ball was in full swing ,control
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the  the prince ,control
and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious they really weren't gracious people ,control
and one had a tic and a n creaky knee ,control
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just ,control
things that they just didn't know how to uh interface with the king in a proper way or  the prince in a proper way ,control
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her ,control
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince ,control
and there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love ,control
and um they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting ,control
and suddenly the struck ,control
and um she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight ,control
and uh with that she ran away ,control
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind ,control
she made her way home ,control
she was a_little sad because I guess  she thought she'd never see this prince again ,control
and then the prince s found the slipper ,control
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper ,control
so  he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on ,control
and then they did come to the home of the  um where Cinderella lived ,control
then they  the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot ,control
wasn't going to fit ,control
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe ,control
and it fits ,control
and they get married and live happily ever after ,control
that was not the best version of the story that I've ever heard ,control
well  if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would um open up the freezer and get some glutenfree bread out_of there ,control
and I would um put a paper towel on the counter ,control
and I'd put the slices of bread on the paper towel ,control
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly ,control
put them on the counter ,control
and I would retrieve from the drawer a  implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly ,control
and I would then open up the peanut butter ,control
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread ,control
and then I would close the jar ,control
and then I would open the jelly jar ,control
and I would take a nice heaping ,control
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around ,control
and then I would um put the top on the bread ,control
I'd close up the jelly and put the knife uh and the spoon in the sink ,control
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater ,control
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate ,control
and I probably wouldn't cut it ,control
and I would go sit down ,control
and I would enjoy  a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich ,control
