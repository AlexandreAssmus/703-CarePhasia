I will tell you about a cheerleading accident ,control
um and I broke my arm ,control
and I was in I th believe it was sophomore  it was my sophomore year in high_school ,control
and I was in the gymnasium ,control
and we were practicing ,control
and I did a back flip ,control
and I came down on my arm ,control
and I remember hearing it crack ,control
it was CYO so it was  it was not uh uh like in a public school ,control
and um I remember the  some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest ,control
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital ,control
and I remember that um I was in the hospital for almost a week ,control
I'd never really been sick and have since really been sick ,control
but  um  so  I  I remember being in a cast for quite a long time ,control
and  and  um and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long ,control
I had a Christmas sling and a  and whatnot ,control
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling ,control
but um  I can now tell the weather ,control
oh  well  I was  I was fourteen years old ,control
your body just gets better ,control
I  f I  there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that ,control
it was um going back  I never went back to the squad ,control
I tried to do twirling ,control
and I just couldn't do the hand motions ,control
and um so I never went back to that ,control
so ,control
besides my husband ,control
well  after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him um  and realizing that  he needed time for processing and  and sort_of  understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them ,control
so  that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability ,control
so  he  he was able to do that ,control
so  after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sort_of s a little bit of self teaching and  and um and giving him time to find his words and  and thinking of the process as as  as a child learns speech again ,control
so  I tried to educate myself on  uh on how children learn language ,control
and then from that um he sort_of followed that same process but only speeding it up ,control
so  he had the foundation there so shrugs ,control
um but mostly just giving him time ,control
happy sad ,control
xxx ,control
uh um in the summers we would go to the beach ,control
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins ,control
and we were always close ,control
and we went to a place in um Long_Branch ,control
and it was this sort_of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families would  would get into a room  would get a room ,control
and then you would get a parcel of a  of a kitchen ,control
and  and you_know when you think about it now ,control
but  um and so we would go ,control
and my folks never had much money ,control
and  and um so they would sort_of save up for this week ,control
and  and we would go to the  and we  we would all stay in this one room ,control
and I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother ,control
and  um and we would just  we would go to the beach ,control
and we would just have a great time ,control
and I  so I remember um going to the pool ,control
they would have salt water pool ,control
I remember it being really cold ,control
so  you would jump in in the morning ,control
and you_know you would just spend your whole day there ,control
and you would be spent by the end of the day ,control
and  and I still remember the smells and the sights of it so ,control
you_know  and I remember the  um the routines ,control
being Catholic on a  on a Saturday ,control
there was a place called Rutt's_Hut which I think is still around ,control
um but it was this little um over the boardwalk over the beach kind of place ,control
and it was um ,control
and on Friday nights my  my mother and my aunt and m and  they'd wake us all up to go to r Rutt's_Hup ,control
and that would be like our  our treat ,control
we were probably like all in our pajamas ,control
and  and  but w we would all get out there ,control
and  and so it became a  a  sort_of a ritual that we all did together ,control
but uh I remember just playing on the beach and th you_know th ,control
so  it was just a good time ,control
yeah it was ,control
it was a_lot_of fun ,control
and with those cousins we're still close and still share a_lot_of things  so ,control
a boy is outside ,control
and he's playing a game of soccer ,control
so  he's out for the afternoon and playing with um ,control
I don't see any friends so I think he's just playing sort_of a kick the ball ,control
and he's in his  in his neighborhood ,control
and uh lo_and_behold the ball finds its way into a window of a  either his own family or  um or a neighbor next door ,control
and um there is a gentleman that's sitting um maybe watching tv ,control
I don't see a newspaper so he's watching some tv ,control
and um the window ,control
he gets up to see who it is ,control
and you kind_of wonder did the boy run away or is the boy still there ,control
I guess the mother heard the weather report because she had an umbrella in hand as the  as the little boy is walking out the door ,control
but he I guess  took a look outside and said ,control
 no you_know I don't see any  w I don't see any rain so I don't wanna take a  an umbrella ,control
so  he says goodbye to his mom ,control
and um he's walking out the door ,control
and then maybe he gets a couple steps ,control
and here comes the rain ,control
and he's like ,control
 uhoh I better get back home and um see if I can get that umbrella ,control
so  he gets in the door ,control
and his mother is looking at him and saying ,control
 I told you it was going to rain ,control
so  let me give you the umbrella ,control
and then you can walk to school ,control
and you'll be dry ,control
 a girl is riding her bike ,control

and she's going through the neighborhood and um all_of_a_sudden looks up and sees her cat in the tree ,control
and calls to her dad and asks her dad to come on  come over and help her get the cat ,control
and the father brings over his ladder and puts it against the tree and starts to go for the cat and the ladder falls ,control
and so now he's stuck in the tree ,control
and the dog is barking trying to  get everybody's attention I guess ,control
or he's barking at the dog ,control
or he's really barking at the cat probably ,control
and um  the girl has  the father takes out his cell phone ,control
we'll put it in that situation now ,control
calls the firemen ,control

and they come on over ,control
and they um will rescue the cat and the  and the man ,control
and the bird will uh still sing their ,control
