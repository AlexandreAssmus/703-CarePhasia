text,diagnosis
 click the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast  my right breast ,control
and  our son Joseph had just been born uh a year ago  a year before the  di the diagnosis or the concern anyway ,control
and so uh I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him ,control
but there was surgery required ,control
and there was a waiting period ,control
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on  not on me so_that I could get back to um taking care of him ,control
as it turned out everything was fine ,control
the lump was removed ,control
it was benign ,control
and everything was alright ,control
so  but it was a scare for awhile ,control
and uh important that I kept the priorities that I thought was  were important ,control
there was very little recovery ,control
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasn't too sure whether they had removed the breast or not laughs when I first woke up from um the anesthesia ,control
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright ,control
and I was so busy ,control
I don't recall anything special laughs other_than  a dressing and uh  keeping up with whatever medications  o whatever they told me to do ,control
but I  di nothing was  in was bothering me after it was o over ,control
yeah ,control
mhm ,control
um I useta teach English as a second language ,control
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation  exercises that we did ,control
I always uh tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew ,control
but uh yeah there's difficulty when someone is not fluent in  uh in your language ,control
um click sigh sometimes with elderly ,control
click I um took care of my mom and my dad uh as they were really in advanced years ,control
l nineties ,control
and uh sometimes my father would go back to Italian ,control
um it was a place of comfort I think  especially as he was uh maybe dying ,control
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow ,control
all I  real but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking ,control
but click it was uh memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another ,control
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too ,control
but I was very interested in where he was going with  uh with the Italian at the end ,control
 with my mom she was more  more grounded ,control
sometime it was hearing  it was her hearing problem ,control
was a_lot_of shouting laughs going on ,control
so  it's  sometimes for me it's that ,control
it's like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive ,control
yeah ,control
you're welcome ,control
oh I've had so many happy things ,control
laughs oh what's happy ,control
I'm sure the happiest day was o the day Joseph was born ,control
click um we were in East_Orange_General hospital ,control
I had a wonderful doctor ,control
um my husband Joe clicks who had a_little too much background in s language uh problems that can occur with babies and children laughs made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like  monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food ,control
whatever the heck his  he worried about my doctor removed from the diet ,control
so  when it was time for Joseph t to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural ,control
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes ,control
so  when the day come  came I  for Joseph's birth I was one lesson short of the full  le of the full  course I guess of childbirth preparation ,control
so  I was going fine without any medication ,control
it was just taking awhile ,control
and then I said to them ,control
 this is all I know ,control
 I don't know any more ,control
so  they were laughing ,control
and they said ,control
 um we'll take over ,control
and they just pushed my head from the pillow and said ,control
 let's line up the mirror correctly ,control
everything was going fine ,control
still no medications ,control
everything was going fine ,control
Doctor_Sobol my doctor said ,control
 Firstname this is going on ,control
 I wanna get home for supper ,control
I said ,control
 I'll get you home in time ,control
laughs so  it was a little bit longer but at five twenty on December ninth ninety sixty nine Joseph was born ,control
no medications ,control
no  nothing ,control
I was on a high ,control
I can  I've never been on such a high ,control
laughs but it was  it was such a happy day ,control
and everything was fine ,control
it was the way Joe had hoped  without any interference ,control
he got a really nice Apgar s score ,control
yes he was a ten right off the bat ,control
so  I said ,control
 well  did my job ,control
 now comes the scary part ,control
 raise the kid laughs ,control
so   happiest day ,control
for sure ,control
mhm ,control
once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball ,control
um and  not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where  dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair ,control
and shocked out_of his  ennui  clicks he looks out the window and  with ball in hand  has  judged  correctly that he's going to hafta go outside and  speak to little Ned ,control
well  I think this is my daughter  inlaw Tanya ,control
and this is Nick ,control
and t Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him um to school that day ,control
and as he's waving goodbye he is reassuring my  daughter inlaw that he surely doesn't need an umbrella independent little soul that he is ,control
um within uh the first block on the way to school he  it begins to rain ,control
um as he's sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he  understands what his mom was trying to say after all ,control
click a bit reluctantly he has returned home and uh  just hasta stand there sopping wet  while my daughter inlaw tries very hard not to say ,control
 I told you so ,control
but he  um clicks he happily accepts an umbrella and returns  to school in the opposite direction it looks like laughs ,control
returns to school ,control
umbrella ,control
and dry ,control
and happy ,control
enough ,control
laughs well  this is little Mary  little Mary_Boyle who has uh click noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree ,control
and  uh and has called the only person she knows who can rescue uh Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household ,control
and that is her dad ,control
um he has gone to help her uh climbs the tree ,control
but the ladder has gotten away from him ,control
is falling ,control
as if things aren't noisy enough uh the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark ,control
and so now the neighbors I guess  have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue  in this order dad Fluffernutter ,control
and they're not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because he's the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with ,control
there you go ,control
you're welcome ,control
there was a  uh a widower with a daughter n whose name was Cinderella who had remarried  a  f a mean woman ,control
uh he didn't know that at the time but that's what marriage reveals over time laughs ,control
she had t two  s two daughters ,control
and so his stepdaughters um were part of the household that  clicks Cinderella and her father had enjoyed ,control
clicks but things changed once they all arrived together ,control
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude ,control
um the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her  in every way ,control
she performed servile  tasks ,control
um clicks at one point an invitation comes to a ball ,control
and uh they're considering uh happily going ,control
Cinderella's face is lighting up ,control
but she doesn't realize uh what's going on ,control
the ball was held because the  uh the King decided that his son  it was time for the son to marry ,control
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of  the town ,control
well  Cinderella would love to go ,control
and uh it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and  uh the stepmother and the  s and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves ,control
so  they prepared  uh had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy ,control
but sh she was  there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family ,control
well  there's a book in the picture  and the b picture book I don't remember at all ,control
she discovers a book ,control
I don't know if that's where she um comes across an incantation ,control
but a fairy godmother appears ,control
and uh because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her ,control
fairy godmother helps her ,control
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too ,control
and as  um as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball um I'm going to just remember that she uh dances with the handsome prince ,control
and at  s as she runs back  um tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair ,control
I didn't see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though ,control
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight ,control
but she hadta get out_of there by midnight ,control
and uh she does ,control
but then there's the  there is the return of the slipper  uh the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what uh he remembered about his beautiful  date for the night ,control
clicks um but as I said the book seems a little bit different ,control
there's a key ,control
and I guess when she lets everyone in  finally ,control
where is he ,control
why is the key there ,control
I don't remember that part ,control
but um as I just remember the story ends happily ,control
that he does find her and the slipper ,control
and they're u reunited ,control
and so happily ever after ,control
uhhuh ,control
click well click I would  click keep all my ingredients um at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly ,control
lay the bread down ,control
get a nice  butter knife ,control
and I begin with  spreading a  s a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the  e the well around all four sides so_that when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesn't actually go over the side ,control
it just stays within the  the borders ,control
click um click I useta like mine folded over laughs ,control
I think I  I like it just the one slice ,control
so  it just looks really kind_of beautiful with a little wall  a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle ,control
okay ,control
you're welcome ,control
