haven't had that many ,control
but um when I was I guess  around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader ,control
and I was in practice ,control
and I was doing ,control
which I can't believe I did ,control
 but headstands and head  back flips ,control
and doing a flip I fell ,control
I tripped ,control
and I came down ,control
and I broke my arm ,control
so  I remember that instance ,control
I remember it quite clearly being driven ,control
uh it was a CYO thing ,control
so  I remember being driven in  in the car by the priest and the  my  my other friends around me and going to the hospital and  um and having my arm taken care of and having surgery ,control
so  ,control
I was in a cast ,control
you hafta remember it was a long time ago ,control
so  I was in a cast ,control
and I was in a cast for a long time ,control
I do remember my father making me s um slings that were um  the holidays ,control
so  because it went through many holidays ,control
and  um and then once it was  uh you_know once it uh m ,control
I went back to being a cheerleader again ,control
um it's a_little misshapen ,control
but it's fine ,control
so  I no longer do back flips to say the least laughs ,control
well  my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight ,control
well  the problems were that he  could not communicate ,control
right after his stroke he really had no language at all ,control
so  the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and  um and has continued at this clinic ,control
um and this is almost four years later since his stroke ,control
so  I've seen the development of the speech patterns emerging ,control
and um what I have seen is him  is him recapture language ,control
I I think very similar to what I see in a child ,control
so   in moving in  in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see ,control
okay ,control
well  I guess the thing that always uh st stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and  and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident ,control
and  and I remember asking the question ,control
 is he alive ,control
and it was such a strange question ,control
but uh I needed an answer to it ,control
and they said on the other  on the  su the other side of the phone um they didn't know ,control
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and  and getting out there ,control
and I remember hearing the sirens as I was  as I was approaching ,control
and when I got there um you_know he had already been in a  st he had already been out ,control
um he didn't know who I was ,control
and he didn't know who anyone was ,control
but luckily and  um but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him ,control
so  they knew that he wasn't drunk ,control
they knew that he wasn't impaired in any other way ,control
and he knew enough to know that he was  he had a stroke ,control
and  I remember he was the one who said to me ,control
 get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible ,control
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to ,control
and I remember this police officer ,control
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him um when Anthony was on the force ,control
so  he came in as a  as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant ,control
and so you_know I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you_know in that it was very much like a  um like a movie or you_know ,control
but and I remember getting down into the  in into the brain attack center ,control
and um everybody was doing what they needed to do ,control
and it was all this kind_of prescribed dance that went on ,control
and um you_know getting him there and  and getting him that shot and  and that starting ,control
and  and  you_know  and then from there it was just the recovery ,control
it was the day in day out routine ,control
but um I do remember that ,control
that stays with me ,control
yeah  it does absolutely ,control
okay ,control
well  a boy is outside ,control
and he's playing  looks like soccer ,control
so  he's kicking the ball ,control
and lo_and_behold it goes  into the neighbor's or his own um window and crashes through that window ,control
and there's the  f the man who's sitting and either watching t_v or talking or having a conversation ,control
and the soccer ball comes through the window hits the lamp ,control
and um the gentleman inside is really quite surprised ,control
he then um has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man ,control
and the mother is saying to him ,control
 take this umbrella because I think it's going to rain ,control
and he's saying ,control
 no no no I don't need that umbrella ,control
 I'm leaving ,control
so  she's got the umbrella in hand ,control
and he's out the door ,control
and then gasp lo_and_behold the rain starts ,control
and he is caught in the rain ,control
and he is really wet ,control
and he makes his way home ,control
and his mother is looking at him saying um h h ,control
 I told you so ,control
 and let's get the umbrella ,control
 and then you can go back out ,control
well  it's a series of circumstances ,control
and  the little girl's cat is in the tree ,control
she was  looks like she was riding her bike ,control
and she was  s um she saw her cat up in the tree ,control
she could have called her dad ,control
and her dad said ,control
 okay I'm going to help you and go get the cat ,control
and took the ladder ,control
and it doesn't seem like the ladder is quite as  l as uh high as what he needed to ,control
so  anyway the ,control
no  I'm sorry ,control
then it looks like he used the ladder ,control
and the ladder has fallen ,control
and he is stuck in the tree ,control
and  the dog is barking  because they are all up in the tree ,control
and the firemen hafta come and rescue ,control
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house ,control
and there was um a stepmother ,control
and the stepmother had two  daughters ,control
the father dies ,control
and the daughters  um the stepmother um has a sense of favoritism towards her children  her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they  so to speak ,control
so  um Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and  and all of that ,control
and then the  um the  s the stepsisters um  grow meaner and meaner as the time goes ,control
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more  jealous of Cinderella ,control
um and then comes the  um the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the  um for there to be a dance ,control
and everybody is all  um is all you_know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the  the perfect outfit ,control
and  and Cinderella um is not going to go to the ball ,control
and she is at home ,control
and  and  um and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot ,control
so they find  I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the  in a   in a hope chest or I guess  what I would call now a hope chest ,control
and um so that becomes ,control
I don't  n wait a minute ,control
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing ,control
um so  the sisters go to the ball ,control
and  and s poor Cinderella is home with her mice ,control
and  and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe ,control
so  the fairy p godmother creates the  um the carriage to take her in ,control
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect ,control
and  and her fairy godmothers then help her um to go to the ball ,control
so  when  when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there ,control
and uh everyone is just gasp ,control
takes her breath away  and she takes their breath away ,control
and she meets the prince ,control
um and they dance ,control
and they have a wonderful time ,control
um but what happens is the clock strikes twelve ,control
and she needs to be home ,control
and um she is running out the door ,control
and her slipper is  her shoe is left behind ,control
so  she goes home ,control
the sisters and whatnot they all go home ,control
and  and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper ,control
and he combs through the village ,control
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers ,control
and it doesn't work ,control
and then lo_and_behold he finds Cinderella ,control
and the f shoe fits ,control
they get married ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
the end the end ,control
and way too many girls are looking for Prince_charming ,control
but that's a whole other issue yes ,control
I would get the bread ,control
first  well I would get the bread out_of the ,control
for me I keep my bread in the freezer ,control
so  I would take it out_of the freezer and let it defrost ,control
um my peanut butter stays in a cabinet ,control
my jelly is in the refrigerator ,control
so  the bread comes out first ,control
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out ,control
um once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first ,control
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter ,control
put the other slice of bread on ,control
and slice it in a triangle motion ,control
there you go ,control
