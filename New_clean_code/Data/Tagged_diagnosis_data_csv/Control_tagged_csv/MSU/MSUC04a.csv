yes I had in  um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor ,control
and he told me that if  as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen ,control
and two days later it ruptured ,control
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm ,control
and uh fortunately it was  y he needed do surgery ,control
but after that I was  fine ,control
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain I've ever experienced ,control
so  that's the f first thing that came to mind ,control
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically ,control
and it could not be ,control
so  it was full blown surgery ,control
and I remember being  um I was m obviously much younger ,control
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience ,control
and I hadta go very slowly ,control
and I was out_of work for a long time which is what I remember the most ,control
and then little by little I just got my strength back until ges,control
I had the  the privilege of working um with a hippotherapy um organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who uh worked with children with multiple sclerosis and  uh and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally ,control
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying ,control
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would  would elicit your sympathy ,control
and you just sort_of hadta tell them to you_know to b to buck up and do it ,control
um but it was very  it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that ,control
and now of_course here I'm doing that in  in  um in a much broader spectrum ,control
there are several ,control
um let me think what would be a good story ,control
well  very recently um two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country ,control
and since we didn't have complete leisure time we div divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every major league  coun uh major league stadium in the country ,control
and in two thousand twelve we completed that ,control
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in  in thirty  cities ,control
yeah  and it was absolutely wonderful ,control
and then of_course they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami ,control
so  on Memorial_day weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there ,control
and um in August we'll be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there ,control
so  when we hear if you build it they will come we think it's meant for us and that we're going to go see baseball games ,control
um and even_though I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had ,control
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that we'd never seen or never would have seen ,control
and it was just the  the  the best six years the best time I can  I can recall ,control
and we love to talk about it ,control
yep ,control
okay  um there's a young boy kicking a soccer ball ,control
um he doesn't know his own strength so he kicks it har very far and very hard ,control
and it breaks the window ,control
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball ,control
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked ,control
oh that's the ball ,control
I'm sorry ,control
he's holding the ball ,control
and he's looking out the window to see who kicked the ball ,control
okay  um a little boy is leaving for school ,control
and his mother obviously thinks it's going to rain or knows it's going to rain offers him the umbrella ,control
and he says ,control
 no mom I don't need it ,control
 see ya ,control
 I'm leaving without the umbrella ,control
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder ,control
and he gets really really wet ,control
so  he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry ,control
and he's  he's happier at the end ,control
okay  the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree ,control
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree ,control
uh a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat ,control
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure ,control
and now the man is stuck in the tree as_well ,control
and the  defi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat out_of the tree ,control
okay  um Cinderella is a story about a little girl uh who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled ,control
and she is not treated as an equal ,control
she is treated as a real stepchild ,control
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders out_of the fire ,control
and she grows up in that role where her  s her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not ,control
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry ,control
and the invitation comes ,control
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball ,control
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball ,control
and Cinderella thinks she won't go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures um makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball ,control
noone knows who she is ,control
and part of that is the glass slippers ,control
she has her glass slippers ,control
and she gets into the pumpkin that's turned into the carriage ,control
she rides to the ball ,control
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight ,control
so  she goes to the ball ,control
and she has a wonderful time ,control
and the clock strikes twelve ,control
and she's running out_of the ballroom ,control
and she loses a glass slipper ,control
and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry he's going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his  his true love ,control
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live ,control
and the two  stepsis two stepsisters try on the slipper ,control
and of_course it does not fit ,control
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him ,control
but the slipper does not break ,control
she tries on the slipper ,control
it fits ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
and that's about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella ,control
I would take a knife ,control
um I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly ,control
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first ,control
and then I would spread the jelly ,control
and then I would fold the bread in half ,control
