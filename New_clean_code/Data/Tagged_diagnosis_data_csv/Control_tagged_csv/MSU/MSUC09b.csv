text,diagnosis
yeah well the big one is my cancer uh Hodgkin's disease ,control
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven ,control
I had symptoms before then but didn't connect the dots ,control
I had night sweats ,control
I was tired and yuh just didn't think much of it ,control
but then I noticed that I was losing weight ,control
and that's what caused me to seek a doctor ,control
so  I went to ,control
I hadn't been to a doctor in years ,control
uh so  I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses ,control
she's now both  uh our physician for both of us ,control
she did uk an office exam and uh was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something uh the lymph nodes turned out ,control
so  I went for a sonogram ,control
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan ,control
that led to the need for a biopsy ,control
so  b at that  by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong ,control
uh the decision was gonna be is it ,control
it  it was lymphoma ,control
but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non_Hodgkin's lymphoma ,control
so  I went to Mountainside hospital ih in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasn't enough  uh th not enough tissue was obtained ,control
so  I hadta go into the city  into New_York to Sloan for uh a more complete biopsy ,control
and that clinched it ,control
uh it was Hodgkin's lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two ,control
uh Hodgkins's is much more treatable at a higher success rate ,control
so  I started chemo ,control
and uh after the first session I developed a rash ,control
and we d weren't quite sure what was going on ,control
one of the nurses ,control
the  the oncologist wasn't sure ,control
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment wuh for the  for the Hodgkin's ,control
but one of his nurses said ,control
 this is an allergic reaction ,control
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol ,control
I think I mentioned this last time ,control
um which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney ,control
it's actually a drug for gout ,control
but it has a protective effect uh for kidney  function ,control
that landed me in the hospital with  with what's called Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is treated like a burn ,control
it  ips people with Stevens_Johnson are often sent to burn units ,control
my mouth was inflamed ,control
I  I  it was just awful ,control
I couldn't drink water ,control
it  j it burned ,control
that of_course suspended chemo ,control
I  w we w worked through the laughs Stevens_Johnson ,control
I was looking forward to chemo ,control
it was  it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation ,control
uh so  um and I ended up having really a mild case ih ih from what I can gather ,control
but still I  I couldn't take solid food for  for t uh two weeks or so nor water ,control
it was  it was  the only thing that really worked was  was um uh iced tea ,control
um so  I got through the Stevens_Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months ,control
it ended  last May ,control
um had my Pet scan at that time which was clear ,control
oncologist waited another six months ,control
had another Pet scan ,control
that was clear ,control
uh and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed ,control
I don't know if you know about ports ,control
uh so  that sorta  that sorta clinched the  uh the idea that I'm you_know home free ,control
you_know  I hafta be monitored every six months ,control
um and chemo ih wasn't  it wasn't all that bad ,control
I_mean  Firstname got me through it if  as I said last week ,control
I ub broke down ,control
um she was just super uh in getting me through all of this ,control
and the chemo wasn't bad ,control
I  I really wasn't nauseous ,control
um my appetite started to come back ,control
in_fact  we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo ,control
we'd send out for lunch ,control
um so  the  it was  t it was tired ,control
I'd  I would get tired ,control
um but I had chemo every two weeks ,control
and uh my hair came back ,control
and  that's where I am now ,control
uh not all that much ,control
um clears,control
I'm a  I'm a very bad uh eater when it comes to nutrition ,control
uh fish ,control
um but it  it  it wasn't all that much t to do ,control
the  the chemo was the  the primary source of  of treatment of_course ,control
uh the oncologist um was very responsive ,control
and he  you_know he  he gave uh me antinausea medication ,control
but I didn't  I took it once during the whole treatment time ,control
and  and even then it wasn't because I was starting to  to vomit ,control
I just felt a bit queasy ,control
um a_lot_of rest ,control
I slept a_lot um and had tender loving care from Firstname ,control
so  um ih ip it  I didn't do a_lot different you_know ,control
um  so  I  I really can't go beyond that ,control
it was the chemotherapy and the rest ,control
uh you_know  um that was pretty much it ,control
well  I guess one of the most important things ,control
I think  I think last week I mentioned my son's birth so I  I won't go through that again ,control
um another milestone was  was getting a job at Montclair_State ,control
uh I  I had  uh d I was a speech clinician um doing work as a  as a  s a speech language pathologist ,control
but I missed um interacting with students ,control
uh I had  and  and  and I  I had some experience in doing that because I  my undergraduate degree was in history ,control
and I actually did student teach uh at a high school uh ih ih in history and had planned to do that ,control
uh but then things  things sort_of changed obviously ,control
um but I  d I  I missed that kind of interaction ,control
I worked mostly with children uh when I was a speech clinician ,control
and uh mur Firstname was teaching English at the high_school level ,control
and she would come b back home with stories about you_know working with students and discussions they had in class ,control
and I was sorta jealous um of that ,control
and so when I was invited to  um to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance ,control
that  that changed everything ,control
um click and I was warned that  from  from ih friends  ug uh uh colleagues that I was taking a big d risk in  in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure ,control
that they were  guh I was gonna be taken advantage of ,control
uh I don't know where they got the idea ,control
um uh but that I would  you_know I  w I would work for xl number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldn't get tenure ,control
um but I wanted to be in the classroom so much ,control
um and it was more that than doing research actually ,control
it was actually teaching that drew me to it ,control
uh that I said ,control
 uh the heck with it ,control
 et you_know  I'm gonna do it ,control
and so I  I did ,control
and it  it changed everything ,control
and that was a very very positive uh event you_know ,control
and I spent forty five years after that laughs being here ,control
yeah ,control
so  yeah ,control
yeah laughs ,control
well no lucky for you ,control
okay  a young boy is kicking a soccer ball ,control
he's out uh I guess  in the backyard ,control
but as he's  k uh when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbor's house or maybe his own house um and lands on the lap of a  of a man sitting in a chair uh who then gets up holds the ball in his hand and looks out the  the hole in the window ,control
um and that's where it ends ,control
so  we don't know if he's gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what ,control
but he's just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened ,control
this is a story about not listening to your mom uh especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella ,control
mother is suggesting that he  he do that ,control
that he's  i there's  r it's going to rain ,control
and he's  f he's rejecting the whole thing ,control
um says goodbye ,control
and mother's a bit dismayed because he's not taking the umbrella ,control
and sure enough once he's outside it starts to rain uh hard enough that he f hasta run back to the house ,control
he's not very happy ,control
um he's soaking wet ,control
mother is looking at him almost saying ,control
 see I told you show ,control
and next we see he's out back in the rain but with the umbrella ,control
well  it seems as though uh this y young girl's father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat who's up on a limb ,control
uh he himself though ends up being stuck ,control
his facial expression indicates that he  he's having difficulty ib ih moving one way or the other ,control
and uh ih being of no help the dog is uh barking making a racket ,control
and s someone evidently called the fire department ,control
and there are  two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder ,control
and they're going to try to get him down ,control
his ladder  uh father's ladder um is on the ground uh I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him ,control
so  the fire  f fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope ,control
story of a young girl whose uh ,control
I guess she's uh a uh teenager ,control
whose mother dies and father remarries ,control
and she's introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters ,control
and um they immediately take advantage of Cinderella ,control
uh z s she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and uh hasta at at attend to their needs and the needs of the household ,control
and evidently father ha was of no help in mediating uh any of this ,control
so  the girl ends up uh uh being in a household but  but being rather a member of the household being a  uh a servant as I said ,control
one day uh a ball is announced ,control
she  s she lives in uh I guess  a principality uh headed by d you_know royalty ,control
and one day a ball is announced ,control
if I recall correctly it's because the prince uh is in need of finding a wife ,control
his father z s tells him that it's time for him to marry ,control
so  a ball is uh organized ,control
and all of the eligible young ladies uh in the principality are invited to attend ,control
um and the three stepsisters and  and uh their  muh their mother um go  plan to go ,control
and they get their gowns ready ,control
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too ,control
but it turns out that she's not gonna be allowed to go ,control
uh she of_course is very sad about that ,control
enter her fairy godmother ,control
um th th they g  they go off to the ball  the  the  the  the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball ,control
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella ,control
 you're gonna go too ,control
 and we're gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen ,control
um and I guess the mice too become horses ,control
I'm not sure which animals become the horses maybe the mice ,control
um she's outfitted  Cinderella's outfitted with a gown uh and a pair of ih ih gol uh glass slippers ,control
why glass ,control
I don't know ,control
um but she's told she hasta get home by  t by midnight ,control
because at the stroke of twelve everything's gonna turn back to what t it was ,control
the coach will become the pumpkin ,control
the coachmen will become the mice ,control
ih she'll lose her beautiful clothing ,control
so  she goes to the ball promises to  to leave by twelve ,control
uh but she's having a great time ,control
and the prince is very much drawn to her ,control
and uh she's still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time um and gets  gets back home uh in time ,control
but as she's running out one of her slipper  uh g slippers comes off ,control
and the prince picks it up ,control
and it turns out that uh uh  she's the one that he wants ,control
and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady uh into the  s into the glass slipper ,control
so  um a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess  with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper ,control
and the  the  s the stepsisters of_course try ,control
and they don't fit ,control
and they try to f push their feet into that slipper ,control
and it doesn't work ,control
and they're very upset ,control
and lo_and_behold Cinderella's foot fits perfectly ,control
it was her slipper ,control
and they're very very surprised shocked and upset ,control
uh but  she's the one ,control
the prince is delighted ,control
and they end up being married and live happily ever after ,control
well as I said before I'm not very good at nutrition ,control
so  I would not use what looks like whole wheat bread ,control
I would use American white bread um two slices ,control
on one slice I would spread the peanut butter ,control
and the other slice I would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich ,control
