mhm ,control
well  I recently had Hodgkin's disease ,control
uh was diagnosed  I guess  about three months after I retired ,control
I spent uh s several months in chemotherapy ,control
uh but pri prior to that  before the chemotherapy started I had uh an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks ,control
that was  was a Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no  no burning to my skin ,control
it was all a result of the allergic reaction ,control
and that stopped the chemo ,control
I had one round of chemo ,control
and then the allergic reaction took place to the  medica not the chemo medication but to uh a medication that's designed to protect uh kidney function ,control
so  I was in the hospital for three weeks ,control
that resolved ,control
I started chemo again ,control
and uh I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since ,control
so  my hair came back ,control
my weight came back ,control
and I hafta watch it now because it's  it's laughs back more than it has been ,control
um but it was  it's been uh quite a year and a half or so ,control
well  I had married my wife about forty eight years ago ,control
and it was cries ,control
sorry guys ,control
pretty much her  her doing clearsthroat plus my oncologist of_course ,control
um so  it was  you_know it  ih I had chemo every two weeks ,control
and the oncologist was just great ,control
and  uh and Firstname was quite a support ,control
cries sorry ,control
and I  d d I didn't do much else because it was you_know the chemo and  and uh eating as best as I could and uh uh resting as  as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasn't too hard ,control
um click so that was it you_know following doctor's orders as they say  and my wife's orders ,control
so ,control
a story ,control
well  this being Saint_Joseph's day in the Roman_Catholic calendar and since my son's name is Joseph as_well_as my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday ,control
that  uh I do know the day of the week uh in December December ninth ,control
uh and uh it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that  that we found out that uh we were pregnant  that my wife was pregnant ,control
uh he's our only child ,control
um so  his  his  the announcement of the fact that he was  that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess  are happy memories prompted by  as I said  today because of  of  the uh of Saint_Joseph's day ,control
about the  da about Saint_Joseph's day ,control
it's a  it's a feast day in  in the  uh in the Roman_Catholic calendar that comes just after Saint_Patrick's day which I think  overshadows  overshadows it ,control
and it's  um as the Irish celebrate Saint_Patrick's I think Saint_Joseph's day is mostly celebrated by the Italian_Americans and by Italians ,control
and there's a special pastry that is consumed ,control
and it's called a Zeppole or the  the donut of Saint_Joseph ,control
it's quite rich creamy fattening cholesterol laden but quite delicious ,control
uh if you  if you meant my son's birthdate um we prepared for uh childbirth ,control
uh I was to be a coach ,control
it was very early in the time when the socalled painless childbirth developed or Lamaze ,control
um but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didn't allow fathers in the waiting ,control
so  even_though we prepared  we prepared for uh the day of birth going to childbirth classes  Lamaze classes ,control
when it  when ,control
pun intended ,control
when push came to shove I couldn't go into the waiting ,control
uh so  I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days ,control
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery ,control
and  and I  we did use some of the coaching ,control
so it  and  and she did m uh employ some of the um uh techniques that were taught to her ,control
um so  yeah  so  that was  that was the day of his birth ,control
a boy is kicking a soccer ball which goes through w a house window smashes the glass ,control
and it's falling into the lap of a man who's sitting in a chair in the house ,control
he picks up the ball looks out the window  actually looks through the hole in the window ,control
 okay ,control
the mother is handing an umbrella to  her child because it's probably raining outside ,control
he uh is saying ,control
 no I won't  don't want the umbrella ,control
he walks outside ,control
it's raining ,control
didn't listen to mom ,control
he runs back with water now drenching him  the rain drenching him ,control
back in the house mother's not happy ,control
she's frowning ,control
the boy's frowning soaking wet ,control
he leaves the house this time with the umbrella ,control
well  a cat is stuck up in the tree ,control
and this child's father probably he  he did climb the tree to try to get the cat ,control
uh but he now himself is stuck up there ,control
the dog is barking at him ,control
and someone called the fire department ,control
and two firemen are rushing over with a ladder ,control
and they're gonna take him down as_well_as retrieve the cat ,control
okay ,control
Cinderella is a young girl who  um whose mother died ,control
and she's brought by her father to live with uh I  I think  a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age ,control
uh father meant well ,control
but uh the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought uh and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully ,control
uh she became uh their maid essentially and uh hadta clean the house uh take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella uh do the cooking do the washing while they uh enjoyed life and uh uh did what they wanted to do to  to please themselves ,control
one day the prince ,control
they  they lived in a  in a principality ,control
the prince uh whose father wanted him to marry uh was uh asked to or  was told that there would be a ball held at which uh many of the or  all of the single women in the principality would  would be invited ,control
and the idea would be that he would  the prince would eventually uh pick one of them to be his wife ,control
the three  Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball ,control
the mother  their mother's very excited ,control
and of_course Cinderella is excluded ,control
she cannot go to the ball ,control
uh and so she's left at home alone while the uh stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball ,control
click she's visited by her fairy godmother uh who uh grants her uh her wish of attending the ball ,control
because Cinderella says ,control
 how am I gonna get there ,control
 what am I gonna wear ,control
uh so  the guh fairy godmother uh makes a very nice gown for her out_of magic uh takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach ,control
mice become the horses ,control
uh I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too ,control
I forget  which animal becomes the coachman ,control
they take her to the ball ,control
um she's not really recognized by her stepsisters and  and the stepmother ,control
click uh but they  the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight ,control
otherwise  or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was ,control
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera ,control
so  she promises to return at midnight ,control
but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight ,control
so  she panics ,control
rightly so ,control
runs uh gets back in the coach and is taken home ,control
but one of her slippers  glass slippers that was part of what the uh fairy godmother made for her is left behind ,control
and the prince uh at  at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and uh wanted to  to know who she was ,control
because she was going to be the one ,control
uh and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind ,control
so  he uh has all of the young ladies in the  munici uh in the principality uh try the slipper on ,control
uh it  their  it's brought to each of their houses ,control
and the  of_course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one uh he was looking for the one who was at the ball ,control
and sure enough um it is Cinderella's foot that fits uh the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and  but to her great delight ,control
and um the prince marries her ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
well  I would take um two pieces of bread ,control
on one of them I would uh take a knife and spread the peanut butter ,control
and on the other  piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together ,control
and I'd have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
