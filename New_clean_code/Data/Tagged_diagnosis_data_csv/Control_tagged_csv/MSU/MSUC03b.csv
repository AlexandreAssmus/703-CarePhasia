oh gee ,control
hm actually I fainted  once ,control
and that's a terrible feeling ,control
and I guess  you_know I guess we could compare that to a  a stroke in the sense that it's a sudden onset ,control
and uh you do have a  a short window if it's the same as a stroke ,control
there  in my case there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong ,control
and you do have time to  to be cognizant of being in big trouble ,control
in_fact  I remember one time I  I uh  I fainted ,control
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house ,control
and that was  I was really afraid of  of the fact that I was in a hard tile room ,control
and um my daughter was downstairs ,control
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight ,control
and I  just in a panic I said ,control
 Dolly call nineoneone ,control
so  I knew I was in trouble ,control
and I  I  then I  I was able to just slowly go down myself ,control
and then I went out_of the picture ,control
and uh the paramedics did take me to the hospital ,control
and I had food poisoning ,control
and uh when I got ,control
th now that was really frightening as you_know they  they're racing me through the uh the e_r ,control
they're asking me you_know all sorts of information ,control
and  and the pocketbook disappears ,control
and then you_know testing and monitors and all that ,control
and they said ,control
 you_know your potassium level is in the basement ,control
so  it was really a ,control
and you_know you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either you_know in the hospital or even dying ,control
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to uh those sort_of sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly ,control
so  it was truly an emergency situation ,control
so  and my daughter as young as she was you_know I credit Natalie with you_know the fact that it wasn't worse ,control
that she  she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed nineoneone ,control
yeah  so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice  I think ,control
right ,control
and that's probably as scary li just like that ,control
yeah  yeah ,control
I was in the hospital for the night ,control
and uh they gave me a liquid potassium ,control
and then uh in i_vs ,control
and then um I left the hospital with uh ,control
well  before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions you_know to  to call ,control
but it was liquid potassium and i_vs for uh many hours ,control
and they were monitoring me and you_know taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that ,control
so  but you_know I was out you_know by the next morning ,control
but still ,control
I felt really weak and tired ,control
I_mean you needed to recover ,control
the  the  the rest of that day was really kind_of not on the map you_know ,control
but I_mean I  I just felt really really tired ,control
and j wiped out maybe is better ,control
tired  tired doesn't capture it ,control
laughs you_know it was scary ,control
you_know  when you see these stories right ,control
you  you hear them ,control
somebody died ,control
like how do they die ,control
right  right ,control
it can be serious ,control
and I had been doing a good deed that day ,control
I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium ,control
at the time  and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation ,control
and I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium working um an event ,control
it was family day ,control
and they had  uh I had some chicken ,control
and that's  that's what did me in laughs ,control
trying to do a good thing  right laughs ,control
they almost killed me laughs ,control
yes ,control
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it ,control
um a very dear friend of mine was  was  had cancer and was dying ,control
uh you_know  she was at that you_know close point ,control
and uh she  I guess it was uh the liver starting to shut down ,control
you_know  the  again the organs the  the kidney and liver especially the liver ,control
and she was incoherent ,control
and she was s speaking to me ,control
this was a very strange experience ,control
she was speaking to me ,control
um but I couldn't understand a single word that she said ,control
and it was just gibberish ,control
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way ,control
and she would  it would be frustrating for her that I  wasn't understanding what she said ,control
and it sounded like words too ,control
but it wasn't ,control
and um I spoke with the  uh the uh nurse who was caring for her ,control
she was at home ,control
and uh I was told that th when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen ,control
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of you_know the medical sequence of events ,control
but  but that  that's very frustrating to be ,control
and I could see the frustration on her face ,control
and then uh I feel badly ,control
and I feel frustrated too because I  I really wanna understand and  and can't ,control
well  you could only have simple communications at that point sort_of like point to things ,control
and then I would  um I would  I would tell her at di different ilver intervals ,control
 I cannot understand what you're saying ,control
and she would feel t even worse ,control
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was  saying words ,control
I  w I realized that pretty  pretty quickly ,control
she  she thought she was you_know saying things ,control
so   I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or um  just  pretend sometimes I even understood ,control
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever ,control
you_know  then she would  it would be pretty clear I'm not coming with the water ,control
but that  that  that's very frightening ,control
and  and it's frustrating for everyone ,control
you're imprisoned in your own body in a way aren't you ,control
yeah  that hasta be a hell ,control
hm ,control
something important ,control
uh  I guess a_lot_of important things sort_of happened you_know ,control
um be hard to uh ,control
I think  I think um  in a sense I made my own important things ,control
um for instance um uh I grew up uh in a family ,control
uh I was one of five children ,control
and now I don't want this to sound you_know politically incorrect but laughs my father was uh Italian of Italian descent ,control
and he had this mind set that girls just don't go to college ,control
and unfortunately four of us were girls ,control
so  he didn't  that wasn't a ,control
he wasn't pleased with that either I don't think laughs ,control
and I was the third one ,control
can you imagine ,control
in a row ,control
no boys yet ,control
mm so  anyhow  laughs it was made very clear that uh college was not on the map ,control
uh and his  his  his idea was that um ,control
 I've been supporting you all these years ,control
 and now  you owe me ,control
 you_know you hafta go to work  and contribute to the household ,control
so  this was a builtin thing ,control
at the time I wasn't realizing how grave it was ,control
in_fact  there was something that felt almost exciting about it ,control
that I'll be going to work soon you_know laughs ,control
and the good news was that I was also an honor student ,control
and I got to high_school at twelve ,control
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete laughs ,control
and now I was going to work laughs ,control
so  my guidance counselor at the school was  she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student ,control
she actually wanted to call him ,control
and I was very calm about the whole thing ,control
I said ,control
 there's really no point ,control
 you_know it's  y you're not going to get anywhere ,control
this is the state of things ,control
it's the state of the art at the Lastname household ,control
and that's that ,control
so  anyway um she then uh decided to take me under her wing and um knew someone down on Wall_Street and  uh who worked at a personnel department at what was then the Irving_Trust_Company which no longer exists ,control
and they took great pride in that  that company ,control
th they  they were at one Wall_Street ,control
and they considered themselves at the top of Wall_Street ,control
and this was verbalized ,control
so  anyway laughing um she called her friend ,control
and uh I'll never forget her ,control
her name was Firstname_Lastname who I went to see ,control
so  I  I put a suit on uh went shopping and bought myself you_know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview ,control
and I think I was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her ,control
and so she hired me ,control
and I ended up in a subbasement ,control
not just a basement ,control
it was a subbasement ,control
I think I was lower than the vaults ,control
in a secretarial pool where else laughs ,control
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool ,control
I did ,control
and good  good on me ,control
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to ,control
even_though I had an academic um uh course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study ,control
and I  and I  I took typing and stenography ,control
I thought this might help me ,control
and maybe my job won't be so random ,control
I have at_least a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up you_know laughs ,control
so  I end up in a secretarial pool ,control
and um they  banks are notoriously very frugal ,control
and uh back then the things were even worse ,control
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization ,control
and um I  I  I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved ,control
so  if somebody you_know in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches you_know where I was ,control
so  I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in ,control
it was sort_of like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at  being at any orphanage where a call comes in ,control
and they pick you laughs ,control
so  they  a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust uh department on the twelfth floor ,control
he was a  a  a senior vice president of the bank ,control
uh his secretary was unexpectedly out ,control
and uh they needed a fillin ,control
so  they selected me ,control
and up I went laughs ,control
and I walked in ,control
and you could hear a pin drop in this place ,control
I could tell it was going to be ,control
I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of you_know lightheartedness ,control
you  you_know it  it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water ,control
and you should genuflect you_know before you  to sit down at your desk laughs ,control
so  there I am ,control
and uh it turned out that his secretary ,control
I'll fast forward a_little ,control
so  here I was ,control
you_know  my skills were good ,control
I'm answering the phone ,control
I'm taking shorthand letters ,control
uh things are getting  things are humming along laughs ,control
everything is great ,control
and um it turns out that she  the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back ,control
uh she was pregnant and uh was having some uh difficulties some complications so the  the absence was going to be long term ,control
and they hired me ,control
so now  uh and I had a raise right away ,control
I thought this work life is a cinch ,control
I'm here for a week and I got a raise laughs ,control
I got out_of the subbasement you_know ,control
I'm in the light of day ,control
things were  you_know like things were moving along so quickly that I  I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall_Street laughs you_know ,control
it was the trajectory I was on ,control
so  one day I was there  I was there for about three months I guess ,control
and I was out uh to lunch still trying to you_know explore the area ,control
uh it's a very exciting place you_know ,control
Wall_Street ,control
and I found the New_York Stock_Exchange ,control
and I  you_know I was cum sort_of like a pseudo tourist ,control
so  I was walking up Broadway one day ,control
and I encounter the Marine_Midland_Bank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories ,control
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving ,control
it just  you_know  it was a great place light and airy modern ,control
I went in ,control
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was ,control
so  I was directed there ,control
I sat down filled out uh an application ,control
and um I was drunk with power by then you_know because I had gotten the raise ,control
things were moving so quickly ,control
so  I filled out the application ,control
the interview with the personnel uh manager went very well ,control
she told me about three different types of positions I could have ,control
and uh visited all three of them ,control
and I could pick whichever one I wanted ,control
so  I picked the one in the international department ,control
that sounded really interesting to me ,control
and was working for an executive there ,control
and um it was just a wonderful environment ,control
and I was in the Latin_American division ,control
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and  Chile ,control
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when uh there was the coup_d'etat in Chile when Salvador_Allende was ,control
and we had lots of money ,control
uh we  we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin_American area ,control
so  those were  those were some pretty exciting times ,control
and I then I was there for a few years ,control
and uh my direct boss who was the  he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office ,control
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor ,control
so  of_course you_know how romance always wins out ,control
I had a boyfriend ,control
I didn't wanna move to Paris ,control
and many people probably would have said Paris you_know ,control
and like it would have been ,control
I look back ,control
I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didn't work out either ,control
but that's okay ,control
so  I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a_little more fast moving and exciting ,control
I  I figured ts this is a good you_know juncture to get out_of banking ,control
it seemed very staid no matter where you were ,control
so  I  I  I got a  an agent ,control
I had you_know kind_of felt my way around you_know how things work down on the street by then ,control
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms ,control
so  to fast forward ,control
hope that wasn't too long a story ,control
laughs then I  I  I  I had my daughter ,control
I was a stay_at_home mom ,control
and the college thing was always on my mind ,control
so  I applied to Montclair_State ,control
and  and I was accepted ,control
uh I came in at the time was a second career program ,control
and uh the important thing was that I did it ,control
I got my degree ,control
and I graduated summa_cum_laude ,control
and I had marvelous experiences ,control
and plus I was a day student ,control
um and that was another thing for me ,control
I realized that I could still kind_of live the life I might have ,control
when I mention a day student it's because I was a young  uh always among young mainstream students ,control
and I thought ,control
 gee  maybe I'll be sort_of ostracized from main society here ,control
but I wasn't ,control
and they liked me ,control
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience ,control
so  I got the degree anyway ,control
and here I am ,control
yeah ,control
you're welcome ,control
yeah  this is that same disaster that we had last week laughs ,control
disastro ,control
the boy is outside having fun you_know kicking around the soccer ball ,control
and crash ,control
it goes right through the window ,control
looks like his father ,control
knocks the lamp over too I see ,control
the father was happen  happened to be sitting in the chair ,control
and uh he gets up ,control
and uh he's got the ball in his hand ,control
he looks out the window ,control
and um seems like the boy is going to have um a bad evening ,control
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that ,control
funny he was just sitting there ,control
you don't even see a newspaper or something you_know ,control
he was just sitting there like waiting for disaster to strike laughs ,control
well  we have what looks to be a mother and her child ,control
it's funny ,control
my first impression is a girl  a little girl ,control
but in other pictures I don't know ,control
I think it's a little boy ,control
maybe it's sposta be ger generic ,control
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella ,control
child says no ,control
you_know  that  that whole idea is rejected ,control
mother offers the umbrella again ,control
 no bye ,control
uhoh  outside started to rain ,control
now it's pouring ,control
child comes in soaked ,control
the mother is standing there with that you_know I_told_you_soqadj attitude and  and kind_of annoyed  I guess ,control
but that's what mothers do you_know ,control
y y you wanna protect your child ,control
and the child  they don't like the idea ,control
they think you're mean and difficult ,control
you just don't want your child to fall down and skin their knee ,control
you don't want them to get wet ,control
you don't want anything to happen to this child ,control
I know that's how I was laughs ,control
and so now it's another rainy day ,control
or later  maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella ,control
learned a lesson ,control
listen to the mother ,control
and you_know so maybe a lesson learned for the future ,control
that maybe mommy you_know isn't that bad after all ,control
trying to protect me ,control
well  we have a cat uh emergency here ,control
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like ,control
and I guess the  father or maybe some  well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder ,control
got up in the tree ,control
he's stuck up there too now ,control
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to  get the cat ,control
and now I see the fire department is on the scene ,control
and they're going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after ,control
well  for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a  being a maid working for this family ,control
and it was a mother and her two uh daughters ,control
they were  just very shrill and very unattractive young women ,control
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and uh just  just very nice ,control
these two were  were very spoiled and  and didn't have any appreciation for anything ,control
I_mean  Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard you_know animals loved her ,control
the horse the  whoever was out there ,control
mice even laughs you_know ,control
she was a delight ,control
anyway  um there's a  a  an  an announcement comes to the uh unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their  their  their mcmansion I guess  where they live ,control
they weren't in a castle ,control
uh they got an invitation to  to a ball ,control
the prince was going to give a ball ,control
and Cinderella useta  she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance ,control
and so when news came of this ball uh she was also silently very excited about it ,control
but the two girls you_know of_course they were going ,control
they had an invitation ,control
uh and somehow  I forget some of the details in between ,control
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up you_know helping working some magic ,control
and Cinderella does go to the ball ,control
uh like a pumpkin that  that  that  what was  that gets turned into a  a  a carriage and with horses ,control
and she's got a beautiful gown on ,control
and she just looks  really just beautiful ,control
and she  uh the prince of_course you_know um sees her right away ,control
and uh you_know one of those across the crowded room ,control
and they danced all night ,control
and it was very romantic ,control
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the  that  or whoever or that  they were ,control
was that the stepsisters or was that another story laughs ,control
the wicked stepsisters  I don't know ,control
anyhow um those horrible faces like grimaces laughs ,control
so  anyway  the  the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight ,control
and you see the  the  the clock is  is striking twelve ,control
and she's saying goodbye to the prince ,control
and of_course he doesn't wanna let her to leave ,control
and she's late ,control
she's running down this  you_know a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe ,control
one of her glass slippers ,control
and uh the uh butler or whoever  majordomo from the  the palace was sent around you_know to the town to find who fits into the shoe ,control
and uh Cinderella gets locked up ,control
you_know  the mother the  that horrible mother thought that you_know they'd cram the shoe on one of her daughters' feet laughs ,control
and I remember their feet were ugly too laughs ,control
and uh the mice end up getting ,control
oh she was locked in this room you_know ,control
they didn't want her on the scene ,control
and um the mice brought her the key ,control
she got out and um tried on the shoe ,control
of_course  it fit perfectly ,control
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after ,control
one hopes ,control
and I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at the wedding those  those  horrible people laughs ,control
okay ,control
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here ,control
otherwise it's an open face ,control
they don't call it a sandwich right laughs ,control
so  be nice ,control
we'll  we're pretend we have two pieces of bread ,control
and uh I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread ,control
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread ,control
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both ,control
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly ,control
and just gently spread that on ,control
close it up maybe cut it in half ,control
because I love sæmɪdʒɪzu ,control
but I don't like a bite of the crust first ,control
on a peanut butter it's ,control
so  that's why I ,control
yeah  and I like to cut it like on the diagonal ,control
hasta be a particular way  you_know ,control
