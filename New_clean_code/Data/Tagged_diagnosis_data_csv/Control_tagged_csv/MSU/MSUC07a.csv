okay ,control
um I remember uh hurting my back about five or six years ago ,control
and I really didn't do anything to hurt my back ,control
I just kind_of moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back ,control
and it was weeks of uh going to the doctor going  finally just having physical therapy to  to fix it ,control
but it all worked out ,control
yeah ,control
it was a_lot_of exercises ,control
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield ,control
and um they had me lift weights and do uh different exercises stretching  mostly stretching my back ,control
and they used some kind of electronic uh like  stimulation therapy ,control
and that really helped ,control
it was the big part ,control
yeah ,control
uh  not really ,control
I_mean a little bit here and there ,control
you_know  I've know people who have had strokes and ,control
uh I think a_lot_of it was sort_of just waiting them out ,control
sometimes they just couldn't get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign  uh sort_of a sign language where they kind_of point to what they're looking for or what they need ,control
uh that was mostly ,control
 kinda what did it ,control
I guess I'll tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace ,control
um it was a long  haul ,control
it was a_lot  you_know a_lot_of discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it ,control
and we  probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents ,control
and uh w at one point I would be kind_of more wanting to do it ,control
and Eileen would be busy ,control
her parents were ill ,control
and we were trying to take care of them ,control
and then it would swap ,control
I was busy at work ,control
and she was more interested in talking about it ,control
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind_of we were on the same page at the same time ,control
and um we made this decision kin to  to  that we should look  possibly look at foster care ,control
and we looked into it closely ,control
and it just wasn't going to work right for us ,control
and then we decided to  to adopt ,control
and um we  identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family ,control
and we um looked into all of her medical records and things ,control
and um then we traveled to China ,control
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that ,control
and then we  mov then we went to China ,control
and actually the adoption occurred there in China ,control
uh and we have an older daughter who came with us also ,control
uh so  we're all part of  all became one big family all at once ,control
thanks ,control
well  there was a little boy who was playing  practicing his soccer kicks ,control
and uh looks like he kicked the ball a_little too hard uh right through the  living room window uh where his father was sitting there watching tv and keeping an eye on the baby ,control
and uh his father hadta gather up the ball and look out the window at him and  and say you_know ,control
 what are you doing kicking the ball re right near the window ,control
okay ,control
a little boy was on his way to school ,control
he's getting ready to go to school ,control
and his mother uh offered him the umbrella to take with him in case it rained on the way to school ,control
and he said ,control
 no  thank_you  I'm fine ,control
and he walked out ,control
and on his way to school it started raining really hard ,control
and he hadta turn around and run home ,control
and uh get  you_know when he got home his mother wasn't happy that he did not take the umbrella from the beginning ,control
uh and he  uh he took the umbrella ,control
and off he went again to school ,control
 it looks like there  a little girl's cat uh climbed up the tree ,control
the girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard ,control
and the cat ran up the tree ,control
and she went in to get her father to help her ,control
and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air ,control
and uh the  while  once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too ,control
so  they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree ,control
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out_of the tree ,control
okay  um there was a little girl named Cinderella ,control
and her mother died ,control
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own ,control
and the new mother the stepmother didn't really care for Cinderella that much ,control
she was more concerned about her two daughters ,control
and then as they grew up the  the  she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her ,control
and uh one day there was a  an invitation to a  uh a big ball to meet the prince because the prince was looking for a wife ,control
and uh his father was having a big party  a big ball to  so he could meet all the eligible women in the  in the  kingdom ,control
so  she wanted to go to the  the ball ,control
but she was too busy ,control
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for  everybody else uh because they all hadta have their clothes made  cleaned and ready to go ,control
so  she  in  she started to get everybody's  everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball ,control
and in the meantime her friends the  the  mi the mice put  sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball ,control
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go ,control
uh but the sisters found out ,control
and they tore up her dress ,control
and she was  uh she thought she'd never get to the ball ,control
uh and then she met her  s her fairy godmother ,control
she went out in the yard and was crying ,control
and the fairy godmother came ,control
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the  the mice into horseses ,control
but told her that she needed to be home by  mid leave by twelve o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point ,control
so  she went off to the ball ,control
and she met the prince ,control
and they fell in love ,control
and all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight ,control
so  she uh hadta run out ,control
and she ran down the steps of the  the castle ,control
and left the prince ,control
and she lost her shoe on the way ,control
so  the prince thought he would never see his  this girl again ,control
and so the next day the father and the  and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on ,control
and that was Cinderella ,control
so  then she married the prince and lived happily ever after ,control
I would take the bread ,control
and I would spread the peanut butter  open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread ,control
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter ,control
and then put another piece of bread on top of it ,control
