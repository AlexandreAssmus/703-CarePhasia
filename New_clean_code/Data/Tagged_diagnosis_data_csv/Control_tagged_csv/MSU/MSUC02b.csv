and I had that in two thousand and five ,control
I had an elec lumpectomy in October ,control
and then they didn't get it all ,control
and I hadta have another one in  in December ,control
and they didn't get it all ,control
and it was my last chance in_order_to save my breast ,control
I had  I had one more in February of two thousand and six ,control
and that one worked ,control
that was  that was good so ,control
um it  uh I remember recuperating was a long process ,control
I also had radiation ,control
and it made me tired ,control
um but I worked  I worked every day ,control
I didn't miss any work ,control
still came to work ,control
um it was therapeutic to come to work uh just to  because if I was home I would go nuts thinking about stuff ,control
so  it was good to be busy and come to work ,control
and um I got through it ,control
you_know  and  and luckily all is well yet  you_know ,control
so  that's a uh ,control
but it's uh it was a long haul at the time ,control
sleep a_lot ,control
I slept a_lot whenever I was tired and  which would happen randomly ,control
um not at work ,control
I didn't  I didn't sleep at work though you_know laughs ,control
but I felt like it  I know ,control
but I  um like I'd  I'd come home from work and just take a nap before I even had dinner with my husband ,control
like we'd  we'd take a nap ,control
and then  uh and then got up and had dinner and took another nap and then went to bed ,control
but uh I slept a_lot ,control
um that's about all I remember as far as the uh ,control
it  w I guess it was a way of uh dealing with it too ,control
like you_know at the time I  I was  if I slept I didn't hafta think about things ,control
so  it was uh ,control
but uh my husband was real great ,control
he took good care of me ,control
and my daughter ,control
and  and um I don't know what I would have done without them ,control
they were  they were good ,control
yeah  have good support you have  it makes you better real fast you_know ,control
uh well  I have  I have an eight eighteen month old grandson who's just learning how to speak ,control
and uh um but yet I understand what he wants you_know by  by you_know like the different sounds mean different things even though they're not English ,control
uh you kinda know what he's talking about ,control
and uh uh otherwise uh ,control
well  I do have a  my  my  my  um my stepdaughter's inlaws uh speak Spanish ,control
and uh the  the  the  uh her mother inlaw does speak a little English but not much at all ,control
and the  f her father inlaw doesn't speak any English so ,control
and I don't speak any Spanish so ,control
but we do  we do have a conversation ,control
it's kind_of funny ,control
I don't know if we're talking about the same thing ,control
but we  you_know we both seem to think we are ,control
but  uh and we  uh like he passes me the things when I need it at the table  you_know ,control
like if there's salt and pepper like uh ,control
so  I  d we  you_know you do  you find sign language ,control
but you make your own sign language I guess  if you  you_know if you don't know sign language ,control
which but you you_know you  there's ways of indicating what you need or wants  m,control
I guess they know ,control
that uh but that's I guess that's the only  I  my mom had a stroke in two thousand and nine uh but didn't recover from it ,control
she  uh she  she passed away from it ,control
so that was  you_know so that was  I only had three days of dealing with uh her  her speaking ,control
but uh and it was  it was repetitive ,control
like she was like stuttering speaking at that point ,control
everything was uh ,control
 I  I need  need  need  need ,control
you_know  it was like that kind of talk ,control
it was hard for her ,control
but  um but then I really didn't  I didn't have that long a  long a time t t to really develop any kind of a language with her ,control
about something that happened ,control
hm  well I remember when my kids were  my  my son and daughter were in um middle school ,control
and every President's_Day week we useta take the auto train down to Florida for that week and meet my parents down in  um down Di by Disney_World and go to Disney_World ,control
and uh the one time we got on the train my husband worked for the train ,control
and uh there was a deadhead ,control
uh deadhead means when they're towing uh the  a part of a train back to where it needs to be ,control
there was a deadhead  deadheaded presidential car being towed back uh to uh ,control
well  actually I guess it's  we  r we rode it the whole way ,control
it was going down to Florida ,control
because it  it wasn't just to DC ,control
well  we picked it up in DC ,control
so  we went all the way to Florida in that one ,control
uh so  we ended up uh being able to use the presidential car ,control
and uh we each  on the train we each had our ,control
my  it was my son my daughter myself and my husband ,control
and we each had our own bed our own bathroom ,control
um it was  and it was just  uh it was just amazing to go  to travel like that ,control
how I guess the  uh the rich and famous travel like that ,control
but it was  I said to my kids ,control
 enjoy it now because we're never probably gonna ever do this again you_know ,control
it was  it was amazing ,control
but it  uh and to lay in bed and watch as you're looking out the window at uh the scenery going by ,control
it was just  and we had two pillows each you_know ,control
it was  it was just living it on the train ,control
it was so nice ,control
and uh and we went to Disney_World too ,control
that was fun too ,control
but the train ride was an amazing trip ,control
it was  it was fun ,control
and uh that was I guess  one thing that I do remember ,control
that was fun  a really fun time that we had on the train ,control
well  there's this little boy who's outside with a soccer ball ,control
and he's kicking it around ,control
and he's kicking it around ,control
and all_of_a_sudden he kicks it a_little too hard ,control
and it goes into the window where it comes almost on the lap of uh the man sitting in his chair ,control
and uh it startles him gets him scared ,control
and he gets up ,control
and he's looking out the window for that little boy ,control
I'm sure that little boy took off ,control
you_know  but he  uh he's looking out the window for him ,control
well  there's this little boy again and his mom ,control
and he's off to go to school ,control
and his mom says ,control
 you_know it looks like it's gonna rain ,control
 you better take the umbrella ,control
and he says ,control
 mom I don't need the umbrella ,control
 it's not gonna rain ,control
 I'm not gonna need it ,control
and he leaves to go ,control
and all_of_a_sudden it starts raining ,control
and it starts raining raining ,control
he gets drenched ,control
and he hasta turn around and go back and tell his mom ,control
 you were right ,control
 it's raining ,control
 and I need the umbrella ,control
and he gets the umbrella and goes off to school ,control
that's  uh moms always know ,control
well  it looks like I think  there was a cat that was being chased by a dog up the tree ,control
and the little girl it was her cat ,control
and  she's  she wants her cat to get down from the tree ,control
and so I imagine it's her father that uh decides to climb up the tree ,control
but he gets stuck up the tree ,control
he can't get down ,control
and finally somebody called the fire department to come rescue all of them ,control
they  uh the father and the cat were stuck up the tree ,control
so  uh they  uh the fire department came through again ,control
so  it's a story about a daughter and her father ,control
and her mother dies ,control
and her father remarries ,control
and the woman he mar marries has two daughters ,control
who  the  the stepmother thinks her daughters are  beautiful magnificent and uh does doesn't want Cinderella to get any  anything once the father passes away ,control
like makes Cinderella do all the work ,control
and uh her  she wants uh Cinderella to be her servant and  uh and clean the house ,control
and there's this handsome prince that lives um in town ,control
and the f prince's father the king decides it's time for his daughter ,control
and he sends a notice out to everyone in town all the women that are eligible to come and uh to a ball  to dress up and come to this ball ,control
and Cinderella wants to go ,control
and uh the  she gets her dress ,control
I think it was her mother's dress if I remember correctly ,control
and she's gonna wear that ,control
and the sisters find her trying it on ,control
and they  they rip it on her and make a mess of the dress ,control
and so she can't go to the ball in that dress ,control
and off the  sis the  the stepsisters go to the ball ,control
and the fairy godmother comes and helps Cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up ,control
and she looked just  gorgeous ,control
and sends her off to the ball with a coach and a coachman ,control
and uh goes to the ball with glass slippers ,control
and dances with the prince ,control
and the prince falls in love ,control
and the only one thing was that she hadta be  leave the ball by twelve o'clock on the strike of twelve ,control
she hadta  get out_of there or she was gonna turn back into her rag clothes again ,control
so  she was having a wonderful time ,control
and she  hasta leave the ball when the  when the clock starts striking twelve ,control
and she loses one of her glass slippers ,control
and the prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this s glass slipper ,control
and finally they  they  um they weren't gonna try Cinderella because she  they  nobody thought she was at the ball ,control
but they finally try her foot in the slipper ,control
and it fits perfectly ,control
and she turns back into this gorgeous gown and clothing again ,control
and  and uh the prince marries her ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
okay ,control
uh to make a sandwich if I'm gonna make a whole sandwich I would use two pieces of bread ,control
and smear the peanut butter on one half and the jelly on the other half of bread ,control
and then put them together ,control
and cut it in half or fours whatever way you like it ,control
and eat it ,control
