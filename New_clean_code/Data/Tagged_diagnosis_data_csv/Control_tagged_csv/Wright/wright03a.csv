when I was was  a time that I was really sick ,control
there would only be one instance in my life when I had surgery for malignant melanoma in the middle of my back uh fifteen  years ago or longer ,control
I had never seen it ,control
it was discovered by my skin doctor when I went in for a rash ,control
I was in the hospital with surgery within four days ,control
was in the hospital ten days ,control
had skin grafts ,control
losing a section of my skin on my back that was about the size of a small saucer ,control
the skin grafts were taken from my left hip ,control
um I don't know which was worse pain  the wound in back or the skin grafts on my hip ,control
but you can't hardly get comfortable in bed ,control
you just sleep under lights that dry up the uh skin wounds ,control
and then that was   I was out_of the hospital ,control
I was back at work within six weeks um  with still the sort_of a semi open wound over my spine in the back which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years ,control
in order to close the wound on the back they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar take the flaps of skin close them back over the um original scar wound ,control
and so I had for about six weeks a lump on my back where they were infloating ,control
that was done and I had ten years with an oncologist ,control
and now I have a clean bill of health ,control
that's about all I can remember  laughs ,control
as far as their speech is concerned I  I had a husband who had a stroke and had cognitive reasoning problems that made it difficult for him to understand what I was saying or under ,control
he knew who I was but he did not connect with what I was saying ,control
and when people came to visit him in the hospital we had the same problems ,control
now he could communicate reasonably well but he did not comprehend so his communication was  ta it was just difficult ,control
uh oh he was in therapy for uh ,control
and I useta watch ,control
uh he was given many many tests ges,control
ges,control
ges,control
he was to write elephant ,control
ges,control
a great deal of therapy ,control
and was um really doing fairly well ,control
six weeks after the uh stroke ,control
so  I had him back home by that time ,control
and he was doing reasonably well ,control
mhm ,control
 did you do some  when you were communicating with him ,control
uh no  I did not hafta do anything ,control
they just um gave me instructions on always ges,control
and he had hearing aids ,control
 ges,control
and that sort of thing just to help him ,control
no  because by the time he was home and an outpatient uh he was doing  he ges,control
and it was  it had affected his swallowing and that head,control
so  so  there was some speech difficult only because of the swallowing ,control
that was about my only experience with ,control
I'm sure there were many instances when I was frightened ,control
um hm ,control
but not  certainly I was afraid but not a terrified type of fright ,control
um maybe like boo scared but not hysteria  hysteria scared ,control
it's  that's a hard  that's a real hard question ,control
I have been afraid when I'd been dreaming because I was lost ,control
but that was a dream not  and I always seem to get out_of it ,control
let's see  what ever  where would I have been lost ,control
I have been lost but not afraid ,control
it hasta be  hasta have the fear ,control
hm,control
I certainly worked in a very large industrial plant where there were certainly dangerous situations all around with mechanics and equipment and furnaces ,control
but um ,control
it's not anything that was  uh it's not scary because you are trained to cope with that but you are working constantly around large equipment ,control
and I think probably many times since I was a supervisor I was probably more concerned about a young man working on one of the drill presses or on a lathe that would lose a finger or was injured by uh a grinder or something happening to one of the men uh that worked for me ,control
and then the furnaces in a large plant it's always a concern ,control
um an industrial plant is  is something to be very cautious ,control
not t to be fearful of but to be cautious about your people who are working for you and also that your own behavior you don't do stupid things ,control
um and I worked midnights which was ,control
I was the only female in the plant ,control
and that still was not a fearful situation ,control
but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was and the machinery was working ,control
and we never had an accident we never had a fire we never had ,control
we had a blizzard ,control
um but uh they would have never left me alone with ,control
I_mean they  they picked me up at the plant took me back home ,control
but not  that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in ,control
but it wasn't  it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job ,control
you were just more aware of what was going on around you because there was just a_lot_of mechanical equipment and dangerous electrical and that sort of thing ,control
but that was about the only situation that I was ever in that was ever  might  might have been life threatening but certainly never was ,control
but it was an interesting experience ,control
no  it was when I worked in the automotive industry back East ,control
yeah  no  there  we don't have any really heavy equipment ,control
matter of fact Boeing is here but ,control
 oh yes ,control
oh we had terr ,control
oh Ohio ugh ,control
from Ohio okay ,control
we had  gee it was terrible ,control
we were  sno we hadta shut down all the furnaces in the plant ,control
and then of_course they  we let th all the people go ,control
the only people who hadta stay of_course was the management ,control
but then they would not even let us get in our cars ,control
they actually brought emergency equipment in to take us when they fin ,control
well  we hadta shut down all all the heat treat ,control
we hadta shut down the entire plant for four days ,control
in ,control
it was outside of Columbus in a town called Newark Ohio with the Wabco_International_Automotive_Operations_Plant outside of Newark Ohio ,control

this story begins with a whole family of mice coming out_of their house uh and climbing into their big red truck ,control
there's a  it looks as if there are either two blind mice or there are two grandparents a mother a father and several babies ,control
and one baby is carrying his doll which is sort_of a pink mouse ,control
they all get inside the big red truck ,control
and they start up a very very steep hill ,control
they go across country ,control
and all_of_a_sudden they hit very deep rough rocky road ,control
and baby mouse in the back goes bouncing out still clutching his  her  its pink doll ,control
and all_of_a_sudden looks up from the middle of the road laying on its back with its doll and watches the truck disappearing off into  in into the horizon where it's watching it disappear ,control
the mouse family arrives at a lovely big glen with lovely big shade trees and flowers and decide this is the spot for their picnic ,control
so  they all pile out_of the big red truck carrying the picnic basket the tables the various and sundry items that they need for the picnic ,control
they spread the table down ,control
they're beside a pretty little pond with a diving board dock ,control
they're dancing they're playing they have musical instruments ,control
the   either the grandfather or the blind mouse has a white cane ,control
they have a big basket of food ,control
they have a Thermos jug with um a beverage it must be iced tea ,control
the little mouse with the red cap is dancing with the little girl mouse ,control
and they're all having an absolutely wonderful time ,control
the next scene they're playing the instrument ,control
the mother and the father are sitting on the edge of the picnic cloth on the ground ,control
all  the beautiful picnic is all laid out ,control
the mother or the  f the grandparents are up on the side of a small hill playing music ,control
the kids are playing baseball ,control
somebody is swinging from a tree over the brook ,control
and then we flash back to the baby who got bounced out_of the truck who has still got his ladybug by his side and his doll his pink doll ,control
he looks all around ,control
doesn't see much ,control
doll is upside down but he's still hanging onto him ,control
all_of_a_sudden spots a whole bush full of red  berries or flowers ,control
I would assume maybe berries because the flowers on the page look like flowers ,control
back to the picnic ,control
everybody is having a wonderful time ,control
the picnic baskets have now been opened ,control
they're taking pictures of one another ,control
one of the baby mice is jumping off of the dock into the water ,control
they're  two or three of them are playing in the water ,control
somebody is sailing a boat ,control
the baseball glove is now laying on the ground ,control
mother is pouring milk ,control
one of the babies is in the salad ,control
another one is eating watermelon ,control
and now the mother is calling to the children out in the water that are playing um to come in and eat ,control
uh grandmother with glasses on is taking a picture of grandfather ,control
back to the baby mouse who now has spotted ,control
the lost baby mouse has now spotted the red berries ,control
and since it's getting to be meal time he begins eating the red berries ,control
all_of_a_sudden we're getting ready now with everybody lined up beside the picnic ,control
all the food is out ,control
we count noses and we're minus a kid ,control
we're minus a mouse the smallest mouse ,control
the red hat is there grandmother and grandfather are there mother and daddy are there  various and sundry other folk in the family are there ,control
the picnic is all ready to be eaten ,control
no baby ,control
um now they start looking ,control
they look under rocks and in the water ,control
and there's a frog now in the pond ,control
somebody else is looking in the patch of weeds ,control
they are crying ,control
they're looking under rocks ,control
they're looking behind the grass ,control
no baby ,control
so   the mouse family picks up the entire picnic ,control
and heads back for the big red truck up on the bumpy road ,control
meanwhile  down the road is baby mouse flat on his back full of red berries with his baby  his pink baby fuzzy animal sitting beside him ,control
his doll his baby his stuffed animal ,control
everybody is loaded back into the red truck now ,control
and we haul off back down the road ,control
and we go down the  down the country lane ,control
and we start back down the steep road ,control
and all_of_a_sudden baby mouse in the grass hears something ,control
and starts towards the noise ,control
and runs into the middle of the road ,control
and here comes the red truck with the entire family group shouting and hollering and telling him hello and the red hat is flying in the air and they have found the baby ,control
they are all hugging and kissing the baby and having such a good time ,control
and then all_of_a_sudden goodness gracious throws his hands up to his head and says ,control
 oh_my_goodness I forgot my my teddy bear or my baby stuffed animal ,control
takes off through the grass again ,control
finds his baby ,control
picks it up ,control
gives it a love ,control
runs back to the group that has now spread the picnic table out again and is once again getting ready to have a picnic ,control
this time with a found baby mouse and his toy ,control
