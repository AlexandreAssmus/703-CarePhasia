Dixie_Cup  Lisa's kitty  had gotten up into the tree ,control
and was caught up on one of the upper branches ,control
Lisa was calling for the little kitty to come down ,control
but the kitty was afraid so the kitty stayed up in the tree ,control
so  her father got the ladder ,control
and decided to climb up the tree to see if he could get the cat down ,control
well  while he was climbing up and the dog was barking  the ladder fell down ,control
and so he was stuck up in the tree ,control
so  the mother hadta call the fire department ,control
and the fire department brought their ladder a on their fire truck ,control
and they came to rescue father and kitty out_of the tree ,control
and here's the bird up here watching all the goings on ,control
okay ,control
 remove two slices of whole wheat bread from the,control
put them on a plate  side by side ,control
go to the refrigerator ,control
and get a jar of peanut butter and a jar of strawberry preserves ,control
get a knife out_of the drawer ,control
take um one  take a knife ,control
and put it in the peanut butter ,control
and spread the peanut butter on the one slice of bread ,control
take a clean knife ,control
put the knife in the jelly ,control
and spread it on top of the peanut butter ,control
put the second slice of bread on top of the first slice of bread ,control
use one of the knives to cut the peanut butter sandwich in half ,control
and proceed to eat ,control
n i_c_us were not um known then ,control
and so I was put in a semi private room which was um what they used during those days ,control
and my um classmates specialed ,control
what do I remember about it ,control
I remember being so ill  before I had the surgery that um I refused the baby because actually we thought  I thought that I had the flu ,control
and I was just feeling so badly ,control
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didn't know really what was wrong ,control
but they really didn't think anything was wrong ,control
they just thought that I didn't wanna take care of my little girl ,control
um finally after three days I had that ,control
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three a_m ,control
and finally I had surgery at um Monday evening ,control
so  I was really very very ill ,control
in_fact  I had um peritonitis ,control
and they really did not think that I would live ,control
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they  um that's just the way they did things ,control
and I actually chose  you could choose if you wanted to have the baby um to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby ,control
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are  um healthy and not ill ,control
and I chose the baby  to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby ,control
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kind_of thought of her as their own ,control
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses ,control
and consequently from that uh I had ototoxic drugs ,control
so  I lost my hearing that way ,control
okay since I am hearing impaired um I understand that situation really well ,control
so  I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing  and not admitting it or not having hearing aids ,control
because you can  you just notice um that they're not understanding or they're not interested in what is being said or they're just on a different page ,control
and what have I done about it ,control
actually  what you do is you just talk to them ,control
and you just go right in front of them so_that they can see your face and your lips ,control
and also if you're in a really noisy environment go outside and  uh where it's quiet ,control
okay ,control
oh don't put that on yet I hafta think ,control
 laughs ,control
sighs  well the only time that I can really remember ,control
is it on ,control
okay  the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon ,control
and we were driving in Florida ,control
and seatbelts were new ,control
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car ,control
and we were just driving down a country road ,control
and all_of_a_sudden this truck just came right out barreling down the side road ,control
and came right out in front of us ,control
and we actually drove into the ditch ,control
and if we wouldn't have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured ,control
but since we had our seatbelts on we just took  th my husband just turned the car ,control
and we continued on ,control
and that guy just never  that truck just never stopped and just kept going ,control
I_mean he was oblivious ,control
okay ,control
well  you sure like beginning middles and laughs ends don't you  ,control
okay ,control
well  it looks to me that it had been raining for many days or  raining very hard ,control
and  this   hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream ,control
and managed to grab a hold of a branch ,control
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in ,control
and uh the man is there rescuing her ,control
and pulled her to safety ,control
well  looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking ,control
well  Johnny was kicking really too hard ,control
and kicked the ball right through the neighbor's window ,control
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair ,control
and the ball came through the window ,control
knocked over the lamp ,control
and the neighbor went ,control
 oh ,control
and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball ,control
 well  it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school ,control
and mother said ,control
 well  you_know  it's sposta rain today ,control
 you should take your umbrella ,control
and Johnny says ,control
 no  I'm not going to carry that umbrella ,control
 I don't like to carry umbrellas ,control
 I'm going to go to school ,control
and you can ha ke keep the umbrella at home ,control
so  he started walking to school ,control
and sure enough it started raining ,control
in_fact  it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands ,control
and run through the puddles ,control
and run home ,control
and by the time he got home he was really really wet ,control
and mother said ,control
 see  I told you it was going to rain ,control
 why didn't you take your umbrella ,control
so  Johnny started off to school again in dry clothes with his umbrella ,control
okay ,control
oh sighs c ,control
 when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters ,control
and so Cinderella uh grew up with two stepsisters ,control
but then the father must have died because all_of_a_sudden it's the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella ,control
and Cinderella became the um cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day ,control
um it was   the  everyone had grown up and gotten older ,control
and they received an invitation from the prince  from the castle because the prince was um old enough to get married now ,control
and he was looking for a bride ,control
so  they were having a big party at the castle ,control
so  the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters ,control
and Cinderella overheard it ,control
so  she ran to her room ,control
opened up her trunk ,control
and got out her special gown that she'd been saving for a long time ,control
she tried it on ,control
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was ,control
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart ,control
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball ,control
so  the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball ,control
and Cinderella was left home all by herself ,control
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and especially the mice were  felt very sorry for her  and were very upset ,control
and then all_of_a_sudden a  f Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared ,control
and said ,control
 Cinderella we  you are going to go to the ball ,control
and so she fricked ,control
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown ,control
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach ,control
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach ,control
and I think the dog became the footman ,control
and everybody went off to the ball ,control
and she had a wonderful time ,control
oh and she had glass slippers ,control
that was the special thing ,control
the g fairy godmother had given her glass slippers ,control
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything  the coach would turn back into a pumpkin ,control
and she would not have her dress anymore ,control
so  she had a wonderful time at the  uh party and s danced with the prince all night ,control
and then all_of_a_sudden the clock started striking midnight ,control
so  she ran down the steps ,control
and ran into the coach ,control
and ran all the way home ,control
but  she had lost her one shoe ,control
so  the prince had found the shoe ,control
and said ,control
 I will only marry  the  girl that fits into their shoe ,control
so  there was a proclamation sent around that the  uh prince's  uh footman would be going around with the shoe ,control
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe ,control
so  s the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball ,control
so  she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket ,control
and the mice connived and got the key out_of the pocket ,control
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe ,control
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe ,control
but they didn't make it as  um because their f feet were much larger than Cinderella's ,control
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave ,control
and th the mice had just gotten the  door open to Cinderella's room ,control
and she came running down the stairs ,control
and said ,control
 may I try on the shoe ,control
and the footman said ,control
 yes of_course ,control
and he went over to  try the  put the shoe on her ,control
and the stepmother used her cane to trip him ,control
so  the shoe fell to the ground and broke ,control
and so the stepmother said ,control
 well  that's that ,control
and Cinderella said ,control
 no ,control
and she pulled the shoe out_of her apron pocket ,control
and said ,control
 here it is ,control
and so the footman put it on her foot ,control
and the prince said ,control
 oh  Cinderella ,control
and everybody was happy ,control
the mice were dancing ,control
and everybody was happy except the stepsisters and  the stepmother ,control
the end ,control
