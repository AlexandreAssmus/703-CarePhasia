they get a notice  because the prince hasta get married ,control
and the king is just beside himself ,control
he must find a wife ,control
so  they're going to have a ball so_that he can pick out a wife ,control
 and Cinderella says ,control
 oh  may I go too ,control
 well  if you get all of your chores done ,control
and then help your sisters get ready ,control
 then if you have any time you can go with us ,control
so  they give her all kinds of work to do ,control
in meantime her little friends the mice help with getting her dress ready ,control
now the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they don't want ,control
they're no good ,control
so  they take them and make her dress ,control
she has this pretty little dress ,control
and she's ready on time ,control
the evil stepsisters take the  the necklace and the ribbon and they just rip it right off of her dress ,control
and off they go to the ball ,control
Cinderella is very very sad ,control
sitting outside crying to her mice friends and her dog ,control
when her fairy godmother comes ,control
and says ,control

in the meantime the mice get uh the key from the stepmother ,control
and unlock the door ,control
and Cinderella comes downstairs ,control
and says ,control
