today was little Johnny's birthday ,control
he's four years old ,control
now what's gonna happen for him today ,control
well  he's got friends co are coming over to the birthday party ,control
mom made him a nice cake and she frosted it and put four candles on top of it ,control
but when she went back into the kitchen to make sure everything was cleaned up for the party their dog jumped up got on top of the table and started eating the birthday cake ,control
when mom heard the commotion in the living room she grabbed a broom and chased the dog under the couch ,control
just then the doorbell rang ,control
the guests were arriving ,control
and the cake was destroyed ,control
mom was more worried about the cake than the little kids were though ,control
they enjoyed the rest of the cake just fine and had a great time ,control
uh when I was seven years old uh I went swimming at the Northern_Michigan university pool with a good friend of mine ,control
uh I started feeling chills while I was swimming but I thought it was just because the water was cold ,control
I went out and uh showered off afterwards ,control
and the hot water felt really good ,control
but I was getting stiffer and stiffer ,control
when we left the sun was shining and it was about eighty degrees ,control
and just standing still in the sun felt really good but moving was getting incredibly hard ,control
since my friend only lived a couple of blocks away I sat down and said ,control
 I'm just gonna sit here ,control
 can you go home and have your mom call my mom and have her come and pick me up ,control
well  my mom came to pick me up ,control
sh she felt that I had a fever took me to the hospital and they found out that I had meningitis ,control
and I was in the hospital for four days ,control
oh  it might have been five I can't remember ,control
it it  I was seven okay laughs ,control
and they gave me a spinal tap ,control
and that's terrifying because they have you laying on your side ,control
and here I was seven ,control
 saying ,control
 now don't move ,control
 this'll hurt but don't move you might end up paralyzed ,control
well  that certainly calmed me right down ,control
but with the exception that they bring in uh uh the uh flavored uh uh pops whenever I wanted from the nursing station ,control
the refrigerated uh like fruit drink things that are frozen ,control
that was okay ,control
but they didn't turn the tv on t for my room until the day I left ,control
so  I was in the hospital for four days with no tv ,control
but I'm ,control
okay ,control
um my mom uh when I was twenty one had a brain tumor ,control
and she went in for surgery ,control
and when she came back out ,control
uh this is in the late seventies ,control
they did the surgery ,control
they got the tumor out ,control
but at the same time it caused some damage to her ability to speak well and to uh understand well ,control
um it  it was difficult uh trying to develop uh lists of things that she wanted done around the house ,control
um but we managed to work out a pretty good system of uh you_know ,control
she'd write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper which she always kept with her ,control
and that seemed to help a_lot because you_know she could remember something short term but an hour from now forget it ,control
but just by carrying that pad around with her all the time she was able to make lists of things so when I came home I knew what she wanted done ,control
and we were able to you_know bridge the gaps for awhile until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home ,control
I've had a stress free life laughs ,control
okay ,control
when I was in high school I was out with some friends at Presque_Isle ,control
there's no death in this story ,control
um and uh we were walking along ,control
and it's all rocks along the edge of Lake_Superior ,control
it's not a beach at that particular spot ,control
and it was a big rock cliff on one side ges,control
and I looked over at it ,control
and I thought I could climb it ,control
and one of my friends said ,control
 I don't know head,control
 looks,control
 oh  no  head,control
well  I managed to climb head,control
it was probably a sixty or seventy foot cliff ,control
and I got up within about five ten feet to the top and then ran out of hand holds ,control
and I was looking down looks,control
I didn't wanna look down anymore ,control
it was way far down ,control
but I was able to move off to one side ,control
and there was a tree that was actually raises,control
and I was able to reach up with one hand raises,control
but at that point I was pretty darn scared because I didn't know how secure that tree was ,control
but there was only one way to find out ,control
and it was strong enough since I'm here laughs ,control
uh this woman was walking ,control
and all_of_a_sudden a flash flood came up and swept her down stream ,control
fortunately she was lucky enough to grab on to a tree branch and hold on ,control
and a rescue  worker came along looking to see if there are any victims in the flood saw her out there begging for help ,control
and he climbs out on a long branch to rescue her ,control
and brings a belt so_that they'll be able to  with a rope attached to it that so_that they'll be able to pull her back to shore safely ,control
and boy she looks cold ,control
little boy is getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella ,control
he says ,control
 no  Mom ,control
 I don't need an umbrella ,control
 it's not raining ,control
once again she asks him ,control
 you really oughta take your umbrella with you today ,control
 no no no  Mom  I'm just fine ,control
he walks out the door and starts walking to school when all of a sudden it starts to rain ,control
it starts raining harder and harder ,control
he turns around runs back and runs into the house ,control
he's soaking wet ,control
his hair's plastered down ,control
his shirt is soaked ,control
his mom looks at him and says ,control
 now didn't I ask you if you needed that umbrella ,control
so  he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school again ,control
there's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can ,control
the ball sails quite a ways ,control
in_fact  it sails s so far it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room ,control
when it comes through the glass after breaking a window it even knocks over a lamp in the living room ,control
the man who's sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through jumps up grabs the ball and looks out the window ,control
but the boy's run away ,control
there once was a young girl called Cinderella ,control
she had three ugly stepsisters ,control
and her family  didn't like her very much and made her do all,control
she hadta scru,control
and she hadta cle,control
and she hadta cook and sew and everything all by herself while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun ,control
um one day the prince was gonna have a big ball ,control
and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear ,control
looking around buying dre new dresses checking out how they looked ,control
but Cinderella couldn't go ,control
when all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appears and says ,control
 what's wrong Cinderella ,control
 why are you so depressed ,control
Cinderella says ,control
 I can't go to the ball that the prince is having but my stepsisters get to go instead ,control
and the fairy godmother says ,control
 well  nonsense ,control
and she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears ,control
and she says ,control
 well  you're gonna need a horse or  horses and a coach to ride ,control
so  she snatches up some mice that were playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage ,control
and she gives her  gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball ,control
but the stepmother said or  uh the fairy godmother says ,control
 be sure you're home by midnight ,control
 the magic's only good for one day ,control
 at the stroke of midnight all of this will disappear ,control
so  Cinderella goes to the ball ,control
and she has a wonderful time ,control
she's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince ,control
he just wants to dance with her all night ,control
when she all_of_a_sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight ,control
oh_goodness ,control
so  she turns and races out_of the ball ,control
and in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers ,control
falls off of her foot ,control
hops into her carriage ,control
and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight the horses change back into mice ,control
the carriage changes back into a pumpkin ,control
and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen ,control
she sneaks into the house ,control
and all her stepsisters wha were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady ,control
he tries to find her ,control
and all he hasta go by is the one glass slipper that she f lost behind her ,control
he goes around ,control
he tries every girl is town to see whose foot the slipper will fit on ,control
the three step  stepsisters all try to squeeze their feet into that glass slipper as hard as they can ,control
but they can't make them fit ,control
when the prince looks over at the  s f what he thinks is just the maid and says ,control
 why don't you try it on ,control
 oh  she's just the maid ,control
 it couldn't possibly be her ,control
well  wouldn't you know he tries it on her and it fits perfectly ,control
and they lived happily ever after ,control
there was a cat that was walking outside when all_of_a_sudden a dog came along and chased the cat right up a tree ,control
a little girl on her tricycle saw that her cat was up the tree ,control
and started crying  that her cat wouldn't come back down ,control
dad deci came out to see what all the commotion was about ,control
and saw that he could get the cat back down by grabbing a ladder from his garage and climbing up the tree to get the cat ,control
unfortunately once he got up the tree the ladder fell down ,control
and now dad was trapped up the tree with the cat while the dog was still barking ,control
