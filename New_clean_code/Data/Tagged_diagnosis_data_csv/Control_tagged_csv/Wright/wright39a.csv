my mom decides to cross the road ,control
and fill up her gas tank ,control
uh Grace and I decide we got our Slurpees so quickly we'd go across and meet her at the gas station ,control
uh g we cross one lane no problem ,control
get across to the other side ,control
Grace decides to cross back because she doesn't like the traffic going across the next road ,control
um I stay ,control
and there's a_lot_of traffic ,control
and I decide to cross ,control
sure enough I cross ,control
there's a blind side ,control
uh I'm hit by a car ,control
flipped ,control
and we find out later my leg is broken ,control
it happened so fast I didn't remember any of it ,control
my mom uh unfortunately got to witness the entire thing ,control
and uh called an ambulance ,control
they took me to the hospital ,control
set my leg ,control
I had a cast up to my hip ,control
I went home ,control
and was homeschooled for about three weeks ,control
but all in all it was very comfortable ,control
friends came to see me ,control
and it turned out it was a student teacher at our school laughs that hit me ,control
that was kind_of um an odd coincidence in our town ,control
but I healed very well ,control
and that's my story laughs ,control
can you imagine how the poor ,control
I take a class ,control
and at the class I noticed a,control
and then I heard him speak to the teacher ,control
and ges,control
it was s slightly impaired ,control
but you could understand him ,control
but it was uh uh very kind of nasal in the back of his throat ,control
um this is a tap class ,control
so  we dance ,control
and I was amazed to find out later that he actually was deaf ,control
um and he wears um heavy duty ges,control
I don't know much detail about it ,control
but yet he can feel the rhythm ,control
and he can tap dance ,control
but to understand him I just hafta look at him ,control
and listen very closely ,control
and I can understand him completely ,control
he's a responsible adult ,control
holds a job ,control
um and it hasn't affected him negatively in any other way ,control
um it just  you just hafta take time ,control
and listen carefully ,control
and watch him ,control
and that's how we've overcome it ,control
okay ,control
um my friends and I decided to go for a hike ,control
uh one is especially adventurous ,control
uh his name is Leo ,control
and my roommate Suzette and the man I was dating at the time was named Lee ,control
we took off on a hike ,control
well  equipped with backpacks full of snacks waters ,control
it was an beautiful day ,control
uh coo,control
and we planned to spend the whole day ,control
a_lot_of it  uh our plans were based on Leo ,control
he was uh more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy ,control
so  we went not knowing where we were going ,control
we just trusted him ,control
we got along ,control
had a snack ,control
and been gone about two and a half hours ,control
and nex,control
ready to head back uh to our destination ,control
and we're lost ,control
um three of us have absolutely no clue no concept of where we are ,control
we're surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look ,control
so  there really was no direction ,control
and we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend Leo ,control
uh Leo doesn't panic ,control
I started to feel a_little panicked because I had uh twisted my knee a little bit ,control
so  I had a_little compromised gait ,control
and it was a_little tender ,control
but I didn't wanna complain ,control
and I knew there's nothing we could do about it ,control
we just hadta get back home ,control
so  for the first time I really felt quite uh afraid that we might not make it ,control
and what to do about my knee ,control
we persevered ,control
we trusted Leo ,control
he  he uh went off on a couple wrong paths ,control
but he got us back on track ,control
got us back to the car ,control
my leg was fine ,control
and it all ended very well ,control
it was a great memory ,control

and came up to the bottom level of their house ,control
they decide to move upstairs ,control

and they didn't see their daughter ,control
their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddy_bear ,control
and the water had already risen that high ,control
so  she had been swept away by the river ,control
the parents suddenly realized ,control
they heard a yelling and a screaming ,control
they looked from the rooftop ,control
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river ,control

they dialed nineoneone and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid ,control
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out ,control
they threw out a line across the river ,control
it was secure ,control
he climbed out clinging to the rope ,control
and saw the Jones' daughter ,control

okay ,control
there was a young woman and her father ,control
and they lived in a town all alone ,control
her mother had died ,control
the father was lonely ,control
and one day he met a another woman ,control
and decided to marry ,control
make a new family ,control
s the woman had two daughters ,control
and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created ,control
well  sadly the father died ,control
leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and the two  her two halfsisters ,control
the stepmother was not happy about this ,control
and she did not see Cinderella as her own ,control
so  she made her more of a house servant than a daughter ,control
and she made her wait on th her  her two daughters ,control
and clean house ,control
and take care of them ,control
Cinderella was not happy about this ,control
but she felt like that was her destiny ,control
so  she  cleaned and cooked an and did everything that she was told to do ,control
Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart ,control
she made friends with the animals ,control
they were her only friends ,control
she was so busy ,control
she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends ,control
Cinderella's um gentle heart would carry her a long way ,control
she ,control
uh let's see hm ,control
let's back up a little bit ,control
um I ain't ,control
um on the other side of  of th the town the was a castle ,control
and clears_throat the town was ruled by a king ,control
the  kin this king had a son ,control
and the son was of age to be married ,control
they needed  when he  they needed a new heir to the throne ,control
um and if he wasn't married he could not become king ,control
so  the  the  fath the king decided to throw a ball inviting all eligible young women ,control
so  he would have a large  uh uh large number to pick from for his future bride ,control
uh the invitations were delivered ,control
and certainly the stepsisters were invited ,control
in_fact  every young eligible woman was invited ,control
Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation ,control
but the stepmother was not about to let her go ,control
so  she um was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses ,control
and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives ,control
once in a lifetime opportunity ,control
but she was unable to go ,control
so  off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball ,control
and Cinderella stayed at home very sad very lonely ,control
when suddenly uh uh some m magical event appeared  uh uh occurred ,control
and the uh ma or  her fairy godmother appeared ,control
and said ,control
 do not cry ,control
 you can go to the ball ,control
and Cinderella was very concerned about her dress ,control
and the stepmother ,control
and um turned a pumpkin into a carriage ,control
and the mice into horses ,control
and Cinderella had  uh was ready to go to the ball ,control
but one warning she was given was um ,control
 if you don't return before midnight everything  all the magic wears off ,control
 your dress will become rags again ,control
 and your uh carriage will become a pumpkin again ,control
and she said ,control
 don't worry stepmother  s,control
 I will ,control
so  she goes to the ball ,control
has a wonderful time dancing with the prince ,control
and he is entirely taken with her ,control
noone knows who she is because she's never been dressed this way ,control
the stepsisters didn't even recognize her ,control
well  it's getting close to midnight ,control
and Cinderella knows she must say goodbye ,control
and the clock starts to strike ,control
one two three four ,control
all the way up until it's almost twelve ,control
and she flees ,control
she tells the prince she hasta leave she hasta leave ,control
she takes off ,control
and as she's running away her clothes begin to change ,control
an yet one of her s glash ,control
she gets back to her house ,control
and finds that she still has one of the glass slippers left ,control
but she had a wonderful time ,control
it was a wonderful memory ,control
so  magical she can hardly believe it happened ,control
well  the next day the king set out to  fin the king uh realized uh that his son said ,control
 I cannot  I don't know who this young maiden is ,control
 I'll  I don't know her from our town ,control
 I've got to be able to find her ,control
and so they sent out um ,control
I don't know what you would call them ,control
uh sent out uh couriers to find out where this princess must live ,control
she must live in the community ,control
uh and the only way they know  they'll know if she's the one is if the remaining glass slipper that was left on the stairwell would fit her ,control
so  the  the uh prince's men take the slipper and visit from house to house in the town ,control
they come upon th Cinderella's home ,control
yet the stepmother in no way is going to allow Cinderella to try on the slipper ,control
only  she only wants her two stepdaughters ,control
because she wants one of them to marry the prince ,control
well  both stepdaughters try on the  the shoe ,control
and of_course they're trying to force it ,control
but it does not fit them ,control
Cinderella um is able to escape from the locked room ,control
and comes down ,control
and they try on the  sl the slipper ,control
and of_course it fits ,control
so  the prince finds his princess ,control
and they live happily ever after laughs ,control
oh_gee ,control
it's a beautiful spring day ,control
and the Carlson family uh are at home enjoying themselves ,control
and suddenly they hear a meowing ,control
 what is that ,control
is that Tabby the cat ,control
they run outside ,control
and they see the cat is stuck within the tree ,control
well  dad says ,control
 I can take care of that ,control
 I've got a ladder ,control
he runs to the garage ,control
gets the ladder ,control
brings it up to the tree ,control
climbs the tree ,control
and his daughter's clapping and clapping ,control
she's so proud of him ,control
next thing you know Misty their dog runs up with all the excitement ,control
and knocks over the ladder ,control
Daddy's stuck in the tree ,control
 oh_no ,control

so  the little girl runs to the house ,control

 Daddy's stuck in the tree ,control
next thing you hear is an ambulance siren imit,control
and the fire firemen pull up ,control
and bring their ladder ,control
and rescue daddy ,control
and all is well ,control

and found her way home laughs ,control
