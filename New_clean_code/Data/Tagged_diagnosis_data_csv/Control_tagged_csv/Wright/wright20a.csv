okay  there's a home um with a little boy and a very upset mother ,control
it looks like the little boy was going to have a birthday party ,control
and  the mother had placed the birthday cake on a table ,control
and the family dog had come in ,control
and gotten into the cake ,control
eaten part of it ,control
and retreated under the couch because the mother caught him in the act and was chasing him with a broom ,control
so  he's under the couch ,control
the mother's very upset ,control
the little boy is crying ,control
and the guest are starting to arrive ,control
um there's um another woman with probably her son bearing a gift ,control
and then another mother coming with a daughter with a gift ,control
and they're just standing in the doorway um watching what is going on ,control
I take two pieces of bread from the loaf of bread ,control
put it on a plate ,control
I open the peanut butter ,control
and get a knife ,control
and spread the peanut butter on the bread ,control
I would put the two pieces of bread together ,control
and cut them in two ,control
and I have a peanut butter sandwich ,control
okay  the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago ,control
I had vertigo ,control
extreme vertigo ,control
and I was working at the time ,control
um I couldn't walk without bumping into things ,control
um I was afraid to drive ,control
and I went through all this testing ,control
I was never hospitalized ,control
but I hadta take six weeks off from work ,control
I never miss work ,control
and I've never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me ,control
um I did cat ,control
and they could never find any reason for it ,control
um all the blood work was fine ,control
um it's very frustrating because they don't know how to treat it or what to do ,control
you just hafta wait it out ,control
so  I um stayed at home ,control
uh went through all the testing ,control
went to the doctor's ,control
um finally decided to go to a chiropractor ,control
and my doctor agreed that was fine ,control
so  I went for massage therapy and uh muscle and nerve stimulant ,control
and that helped ,control
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck ,control
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium ,control
now that's not proven ,control
my regular doctor of_course doesn't go along with it  laughs ,control
my chiropractor thinks that's the answer  laughs ,control
but it was just a terrible ordeal ,control
and um I've not had it return ,control
um just a little bit once in awhile ,control
but I find that when my back is out_of alignment and my discs are compressed that it kind_of slows down your  your functioning ,control
so  anyway that was the worse thing I've probably experienced ,control
um somewhat yes ,control
well  my husband um has been treated for lung cancer ,control
and he had extreme um hard core treatment ,control
he had chemotherapy and radiation ,control
and he had brain radiation ,control
uh they do that to uh ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain ,control
but in the process of doing this my husband's been on a_lot_of medications ,control
and he's a very bright man and very articulate ,control
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow ,control
his thought process was very unlike him ,control
he just didn't process well at all ,control
so  you hafta be very patient ,control
hafta listen ,control
hafta try not to lose your temper ,control
try not to be argumentative ,control
um tried my patience as much as it's ever been tried ,control
um just kind_of wait  wait it out ,control
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self ,control
and um you work back into it from there ,control
um he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment ,control
but it  his,control
and uh the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me laughs ,control
um it's just a matter of speaking distinctly ,control
I hadta repeat my  myself ,control
I hadta make decisions for him ,control
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it ,control
so  we did work through that ,control
actually  it went pretty well ,control
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be ,control
and head,control
head,control
I do not wanna be a care giver  laughs ,control
but you work through it ,control
you do what you hafta do laughs ,control
 oh yes ,control
hm let's see ,control
um I guess the most frightening time would be um I lived in Colorado ,control
and I worked for the telephone company ,control
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley ,control
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down ,control
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities ,control
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne ,control
that  once they closed my office I commuted first to Fort Collins ,control
we closed that office ,control
Boulder we closed that office ,control
and then I went to Cheyenne ,control
and that's about um just under a seventy mile trip ,control
and it's on il twenty five ,control
it was winter time ,control
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible ,control
um I was on the road and a storm came up ,control
I slid off the road ,control
ditched my car ,control
and I hadta call for help to come and get me ,control
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up um transmission ,control
so  I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley ,control
and he came with a tow truck and got me out ,control
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there ,control
and it's very frightening because you're not really sure what's going to happen laughs ,control
but he did get me ,control
we got back to town ,control
they got my car back ,control
and um I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne ,control
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over laughs ,control
okay  I'm not real sure ,control
is that ice ,control
it looks to me like there's water with ice on it ,control
and a young girl has fallen through the ice ,control
and she's unable to get out ,control
and there's a rescue person probably a firemen um that is holding onto um a stick or an overhang of some kind ,control
and he has on a life jacket ,control
and he is going out to rescue her ,control
and it looks like he is very close to getting her ,control
um and it looks to me like he's within reach of  of grabbing her out_of the water ,control
very scary ,control
there's a young boy playing with a soccer ball ,control
and he kicks it ,control
it goes through a window ,control
breaks the window ,control
goes inside a house ,control
knocks a lamp over ,control
and there's a man sitting in a chair by the lamp ,control
he gets out_of the chair ,control
retrieves the ball ,control
goes to look out the broken window ,control
but I don't think he finds the young man who kicked the ball ,control
he's just standing there looking out the window wondering where the ball came from ,control
there's a mother with an umbrella ,control
and her son with his backpack going to school ,control
um he is trying to leave ,control
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella to take ,control
but he doesn't want it ,control
so  he waves goodbye ,control
goes off without the umbrella ,control
gets outside and it starts to rain ,control
and it starts to rain really hard ,control
it's coming down ,control
and he's getting quite wet ,control
so  he turns back ,control
goes home ,control
and he appears to be quite soaked ,control
his mother is scolding him ,control
he then evidently leaves with the umbrella ,control
and walks to school in the rain with the umbrella ,control
mother does know best ,control
okay  um Cinderella lives with her father ,control
and her mother had died ,control
and her father decides to remarry ,control
so  his wife and her two daughters come to the house to live with them ,control
and the mother  the stepmother of Cinderella is very mean to Cinderella ,control
and the stepsisters are very mean to her also ,control
and the father is away ,control
he really doesn't know this is going on ,control
but Cinderella hasta clean the house and feed the animals ,control
and she becomes more of a chambermaid than a daughter while the stepsisters are pampered and get lots of nice clothes ,control
um Cinderella makes friends with all the animals in the yard ,control
and she longs to be part of the family and to be happy again ,control
she's looking out the window one day ,control
and there's the castle where the  the beautiful  the handsome prince lives ,control
and she daydreams about being pretty and meeting the prince someday ,control
well  the prince is in the castle ,control
and his father says it's time for him to marry ,control
he needs to take a wife ,control
and in order to find a nice young wife for him they're going to have a ball and invite all the  the eligible ladies from the kingdom to come to the ball ,control
so  they send out invitations ,control
and an invitation goes to Cinderella's house ,control
but the wicked stepmother gets it ,control
and she reads it ,control
and the daughters of_course are going to go ,control
and Cinderella thinks she should get to go also ,control
so  the stepsisters get all the  get these beautiful gowns and get prepared to go to the dance ,control
and Cinderella goes to the chest where her mother had her things ,control
and she gets herself a dress ready to go ,control
and is going to go to the ball along with the stepsisters ,control
well  they get ready to go ,control
and the stepsisters tear her gown ,control
and they're very mean to her ,control
and they tell her she can not go ,control
so  she hasta stay home and clean the house ,control
and the mother  the stepmother takes off with her daughters to the ball ,control
well  Cinderella is crying ,control
and her fairy godmother appears and wants to know what's wrong ,control
so  Cinderella tells her she wants to go to the ball ,control
and the fairy godmother says ,control
 I will grant your wish ,control
and she gives Cinderella this beautiful gown with some beautiful slippers ,control
and turns a pumpkin into a coach ,control
and the mice into beautiful horses ,control
and she sends Cinderella to the ball ,control
but she cautions ,control
 you must be home before midnight because if you aren't the magic will go away ,control
 and the coach will become a pumpkin ,control
 and the horses will become mice again ,control
 don't forget to be home by midnight ,control
so  Cinderella goes to the ball ,control
and she is the most beautiful girl at the ball ,control
and she dances all night with the the prince ,control
and he is very taken with her ,control
and they are dancing ,control
and all_of_a_sudden she sees that it's going to be midnight ,control
and she runs away from the prince down the stairway ,control
and she loses one of her glass slippers ,control
she gets to the coach ,control
and they barely get back home before the magic goes away ,control
and she returns to her life cleaning the house ,control
and the wicked stepsisters and the mother come home ,control
and they're very distraught about this beautiful girl that was at the  the ball but she disappeared ,control
well  a notice goes out to the kingdom that they have a slipper that they wanna fit to the beautiful girl who left the ball ,control
and the prince visits all of these women and tries the slipper on all of these women ,control
nobody can fit into this beautiful glass slipper ,control
he comes to the house of Cinderella ,control
well  the stepsisters of_course wanna try on the slipper ,control
well  it wont fit either one of them ,control
and the prince asks if there is anyone else in the house ,control
and they don't want Cinderella to come out forth ,control
but she does ,control
and she tries on the slipper ,control
and it fits ,control
and she turns into this beautiful princess again ,control
and the prince marries her ,control
and they go away and live happily ever after ,control
