married life is never always nice and smooth ,control
people argue  and even at times walk out in a huff leaving the other spouse in this case the husband ,control

shortly later the door opens ,control
a very sheepish wife comes walking in ,control
he welcomes her with open arms ,control
will this last ,control
maybe maybe not ,control
as she  bum as she  banged into a tree really destroying the car ,control
what a happy occasion ,control
here come the kids for a uh birthday party ,control

mom is mad to say the least ,control
the birthday boy is crying ,control
and the other guests well at this point they're being polite ,control
can mom salvage this ,control
sure  that's what moms do ,control
a carefree day along the highway ,control
except  neither the driver nor the passenger know exactly where they needta go ,control
so  they stop ,control
see a  farmer or  farmer uh  digging a hole to plant a tree ,control
ask him directions ,control
he's giving very specific ones ,control
and off they go ,control
whoops ,control
back again ,control
directions uh apparently didn't um stay put in the minds where they were sposta be ,control
so  let's try over again ,control
going on the assumption you've already bought the flowers ,control
we'll go out ,control
take a uh trowel or some ges,control
dig a hole approximately  couple inches in circumference bigger than the pot that you're going to take the flower out_of to put into the hole ,control
put in  some fertilizer ,control
put the  take the flower out_of the pot ,control
ges,control
gently pat  ges,control

 tell my husband ,control
 let him do it ,control
 it's his department laughs ,control
 so is the coffee making ,control
go ahead laughs ,control
okay ,control
take out two slices of bread from the uh package that's sitting on the counter ,control
take the jelly out_of the fridge ,control
take the uh peanut butter out_of the cabinet ,control
get yourself a knife out_of the drawer ,control
take the knife and dig into the jelly ,control
slobber it very generously on one slice of bread ,control
take the knife ,control
dig it into the uh peanut butter ,control
slobber it generously on the other slice of bread ,control
and then put the two together peanut butter and jelly facing each other ,control
put them on a plate and indulge ,control
and don't forget the milk laughs ,control
no  that one's usually mine laughs ,control
so  we are going to step off with this family of mice who are packing for a day in the woods for having a picnic ,control
and I don't do well upsidedown laughs ,control
off they go ,control
all squeezed into the truck bouncing along having a merry old time ,control
at  spe at one very rocky point on the road  a  ba the little mouse falls off clutching tightly to his  to uh his mouse doll ,control
the rest of the family bounces along not realizing that the baby has fallen off ,control
and the little one sits there on the road watching his family go off ,control
family gets to the picnic grounds ,control
everybody gets out ,control
starts running around having a great old time ,control
they go swimming in the  swimming hole ,control
mommy mouse and daddy mouse start to set up the picnic ,control
others are picking flowers just running around dancing around having lots_of fun playing baseball playing music ,control

baby is nice and safe ,control
me being uh ,control
oh laughs ,control
I didn't know if I was sposta remember what you had said there ,control
or if I'm sposta tell you what I did last weekend ,control
last weekend we did  uh my husband and I did our usual Saturday lunch at Sue's ,control
he decided he did not wanna share a  a dish with me so we each had our own meal ,control
after that we ended up  since we didn't share we each ended up with leftovers to be finished the following day or days ,control
after lunch we decided to meander a little through one of the antique stores down in Chandler ,control
nothing to buy ,control
we have a house full of stuff that we really don't need anyhow ,control
but it was fun meandering with my husband ,control
went on home ,control
I grabbed a book ,control
he put on noise also known as television ,control
and we spent the rest of the day together very comfortably ,control
Sunday was again a lazy day ,control
read the paper ,control
had lunch ,control
finished reading the paper ,control
other than that it was a nice comfortable day for the two of us laughs ,control
in how many words ,control
laughs okay  I'm telling you the truth ,control
this  the last vacation uh was in the early part of  middle part of September ,control
uh we flew to Copenhagen ,control
we spent an extra day ,control
had a wonderful time and feel we must go back ,control
if we can ever figure out how and when ,control
uh picked up our cruise boat um on a Sunday from ,control
got to meet people ,control
um met most of our dinner companions ,control
very very nice very compatible ,control
as we were traveling with friends we decided we better set up our side trips ,control
our first trip was London uh where we had been before but our friends hadn't been ,control
uh did a wonderful trip of seeing the highlights  high points of there ,control
and then they dropped us off at Covent_Garden uh for a couple of hours ,control
we grabbed a bite and meandered ,control
um prices being what they are we d really didn't buy much but enjoyed ourselves ,control
uh the trip both for Paris and London ,control
the ports are two hours by bus from each of them so we enjoyed country sightseeing ,control
following day was Paris ,control
took a  f a tour of the city and a three hour boat ride on the Seine ,control
again it was our first trip and their first trip to Paris ,control
again a city that needs to be visited for a longer period of time ,control
uh from there we had a day at sea ,control
enjoyed lazing around ,control
um  the ship itself I would not particularly recommend but enjoyed being with the people we were with ,control
from there we spent a few hours in Vigo Spain ,control
haven't figured out yet why they stopped there ,control
from there Lisbon a  s again a city we had been to before ,control
our friends had not ,control
enjoyed a tour of the city ,control
spent some time uh meandering in the square and of_course have  finding some pastry my husband's favorite ,control
um  from there we went to  Cadiz then Malaga ,control
a very nice city very friendly people interesting architecture ,control
back to Genoa  and then on to Genoa where we spent a night and then flew home ,control
uh we'll leave the airplane trip back  in the realm of nightmares at_least from Charlotte to Phoenix on U_S_Air ,control
and don't ever ask me to fly U_S_Air again laughs ,control
and how was that for a vacation laughs ,control
you caught me at a good time in terms of  something worth talking about ,control
I'm sorry  what ,control
past Christmas ,control
like last year ,control
um I'm going to hafta say ,control
I'm trying to remember ,control
I don't even remember if we went up to Vegas ,control
you'll hafta understand Christmas is not a holiday for me ,control
 laughs so  so  it is not something that  other than ,control
 we went some ,control
the last holiday would be Passover ,control
and we go with  f to a friend's house for the Seder ,control
the meal beforehand ,control
and joined with  as we have done for the last fifteen years or so ,control
the friends we are with we have known for many time ,control
our hostess is a friend from high_school for my husband and me ,control
and we had our usual family ges,control
 laughs to the  but to the extent that especially now ten months later nine and a half months later ,control
uh frequently we would go to Vegas because at_least restaurants are open laughs ,control
but I  for some reason I don't think we went at Christmas time ,control
I think we went at a different time so ,control
 laughs so  I'm trying to be truthful laughs ,control
 right ,control
xxx ,control
never broke any bones ,control
uh are you sure you wanna get into female surgery ,control
laughs other than hospitalized I have two children ,control
laughs and that is the extent  laughs ,control
um that's not quite true ,control
I had my tonsils out when I was in the eighth grade ,control
where do you want me to go from there laughs ,control
now eighth grade is going to be quite a few years ago ,control
 injuries ,control
 illness ,control
a cold laughs ,control
I can't remember rea ,control
I_mean  I can go back ,control
okay  I'll make something dramatic ,control
and I'm going back ,control
let's see  nineteen sixty eight nineteen sixty nine ,control
married two young children ,control
not living in Phoenix at the time ,control
it was a bad year for our whole family ,control
not for  my  my side my grandparents three sons inlaw all died in nineteen sixty eight ,control
it was a bad year ,control
my aunt  who was  her husband was one of them came and lived with us for about nine month  ten months until she could get herself together ,control
I was sick ,control
I had a cold ,control
I couldn't lift my head up ,control
I mommy I've got two small children ,control
but my aunt was there ,control
and she took over ,control
she'd bake meals ,control
she took care of the kids ,control
of_course they adored her ,control
everybody should have an aunt like my kids had an aunt ,control
and I  it was my aunt too ,control
and I could be miserable ,control
and sleep ,control
and wallow in my misery ,control
unfortunately I got better in a day or two ,control
but I did enjoy being sick that day laughs ,control
that's the best I  the sickest I could be  laughs ,control
it was  laughs ,control
 right ,control
I went back a few years ,control
the greatest example or the most recent example I can think of is a cousin of my husband's who had Parkinson's ,control
he lived with it for some twenty plus years ,control
one of the problems with Parkinson's is as it progresses you lose the use of your vocal cords and your voice gets softer and softer and softer ,control
I have a hearing problem ,control
I understood how frustrated he was ,control
he was in a wheelchair by that time ,control
and basically I tried to get him to raise his voice a little ,control
and blame me ges,control
and since my husband has Parkinson's I am using all those lessons laughs ,control
the closest I can think of is being scared in retrospect ,control
I probably  was  maybe five  at the most ,control
and my parents my aunt and uncle ,control
the same aunt laughs from a previous story ,control
and I can't remember if my grandparents were there or not ,control
we were at a lake not too far from the house ,control
walking distance if one walked ,control
we didn't ,control
we drove ,control
um  anyhow I was in the lake ,control
apparently nobody was paying too much  overly amount of attention to me ,control
and I stepped ges,control
and the next thing I know my uncle has grabbed me and pulled me out_of the water ,control
 huh  that was nice ,control
 I like playing games in the water with him ,control
however I realized afterwards I had disappeared from their sight and they were scared ,control
so  of_course  if they were scared I guess I was scared too laughs ,control
can I keep looking at it ,control
oh okay ,control
a whirlpool or eddy s  turns and twirls and sucks whatever is in its path into its vortex ,control
a woman  for some reason  fell ,control
what she was doing in the lake or the  ri in the river  does not show ,control
however  she is being sucked into this whirlpool ,control
and the rescue squad  has gone in to rescue her ,control
as you can see  he does have his life vest on ,control
and is holding on to a branch that hopefully will hold both of them ,control
since he is well trained in his profession  he will grab her and get her out_of  her  uh get her out_of the uh  river  safe but more than a little wet ,control
ah  the care ,control
oh ,control
ah  the carefree days of youth ,control
kicking a ball around ,control
playing no school to worry about ,control
whoops ,control
right through the window ,control
looks like s the lamp is broken the window is broken ,control
and  the man has my ball ,control
what is going to happen now ,control
 okay  young man ,control
 time to get going to school ,control
 looks like it's going to rain ,control
 take the umbrella ,control
 oh mom it's nice ,control
 I don't need an umbrella ,control
oh dear ,control
oh dear ,control
it's raining ,control
it's raining ba heavily ,control
 mom  mom  I need my umbrella ,control
 okay  I told you you needed to take the umbrella ,control
 here you are ,control
 now get to school before you're late ,control
once upon a time long long ago in the land of makebelieve there was a man that lost his wife but had a young daughter ,control
a sweet young wo gal  sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella ,control
he decided it was time that he got  took a wife for himself and got a mother for Cinderella because she needed a woman as she was growing up ,control
she needed a mother ,control
and so he married a widow ,control
a lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters ,control
s the woman who was Cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her ,control
and she banished her to the kitchen to do lots_of chores lots_of jobs ,control
and her  tol her own two little girls who were really nasty little brats  got to sit around get lots_of new clothes and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked ,control
but she had her little cat who she loved ,control
and the cat kept her hompany ,control
and this went on ,control
daddy was completely unaware ,control
he did not know what was going on ,control
and so he blithely went along his way enjoying his wife his two stepchildren and every once in awhile seeing his daughter who was so sweet and didn't complain to daddy ,control
meanwhile  in this kingdom that they lived so long ago and far away the king and queen decided that their oldest son needed to get married ,control
it was time ,control
and so they planned a great ball ,control
which is a big big party with lots_of dancing and music and people ,control
and they sent out a herald that is a messenger who tol told everyone throughout the land that all the single girls were to come ,control
all the single young women because they hadta be old enough to get married ,control
to come to this big fancy party in their prettiest dresses ,control
and so the k stepmother heard about this ,control
and was very very excited because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince ,control
and she plotted and planned and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get ,control
meanwhile poor Cinderella didn't get  wasn't going to get to go ,control
her stepmother said ,control
 no ,control
 you hafta help me get the girls ready and dressed ,control
 and then you have work to do ,control
 you hafta keep this house clean ,control
 you hafta make sure that it is spick_and_span when the prince comes to claim his bride ,control
poor Cinderella ,control
after the  girls and their stepmother left for the ball she sat and sat and cried ,control
she wanted to go to this fancy party also ,control
all_of_a_sudden  a light started shining ,control
and a balloon came down ,control
and it got bigger and bigger and brighter ,control
and  she heard a giggle ,control
and she looked ,control
and there in front of her was this sweet little bouncy bubbly lady ,control
 why are you crying Cinderella ,control
asked this sweet bouncy bubbly lady ,control
 because I wanna go to the ball  to this fancy party where the prince is going to be and dance with everybody ,control
 well  we'll hafta see about that ,control
 and by the way just so you know I am your fairy godmother ,control

 but I can't go in these rags ,control
 oh ,control

 okay  okay  okay  okay  okay ,control
said a few more magic words and lo_and_behold there was Cinderella in a gorgeous gown ,control
her hair  beautifully combed ,control
lovely  outfit ,control
sweet beautiful princess looking ,control
 okay now you hafta understand ,control
says the fairy godmother ,control
 my magic only works a little bit  or for a little bit of time ,control
 so go along ,control
 have a good time ,control
 dance with the prince ,control
 but remember when it start  when the clock strikes twelve everything goes back to the way it was ,control
 okay  I'll remember ,control
and off she goes ,control
makes her grand entrance because she's late ,control
the prince sees her and dances with her ,control
dance after dance after dance ,control
everybody is wondering ,control
 who is this beautiful young lady ,control
the stepsisters don't recognize her ,control
the stepmother doesn't recognize her ,control
they have never seen her so nice and pretty and clean and all dressed up ,control
Cinderella is having a wonderful time ,control
but all_of_a_sudden the clock starts to strike twelve ,control
oh  she remembers ,control
 gotta go  gotta go ,control
she tells the prince ,control
and s  scoots off ,control
and runs and run ,control
but the prince is so startled  he doesn't coughs realize what's happening ,control
and she gets all the way out from the palace  before the clock finished striking ,control
and the coach disappears ,control
the beautiful dress disappears ,control
everything ,control
but as she had been running she lost her shoe ,control
now for some reason it does not change back ,control
before you ask me why that doesn't happen ,control
I had kids who uh  asked questions ,control
so she keeps running ,control
eventually she gets home ,control
back to her hearth ,control
the pumpkin s is squashed ,control
the prince has only the shoe ,control
but he has fallen in love with Cinderella ,control
a proclamation goes out the next day ,control
he wishes to see every woman  every young woman in the  kingdom ,control
and whoever's foot that glass slipper fits will be his bride ,control
and so he goes around to all the ,control
and so his messenger goes all around the country  trying it on ,control
some's ,control
gets to the house with Cinderella ,control
older stepsister tries it on ,control
s can't squeeze her foot in ,control
her ges,control
the other sister says  tries ,control
they push and they squeeze and they push and they squeeze ,control
and they still can't get her foot in there ,control
messenger says ,control
 is there anybody else around ,control
 I have tried everybody in the kingdom ,control
 no ,control
says the stepmother ,control
 there's nobody else in here ,control
at that point Cinderella peeks around the corner and the messenger sees her ,control
 oh  here's a young lady ,control
 let us  let me try ,control
 we've gotta try her ,control
 the prince says everybody ,control
even_though the stepmother is saying ,control
 nah  she's nothing she's nothing nothing ges,control
so Cinderella comes in the room ,control
slips her foot in easily into the glass slipper ,control
it's not too big ges,control
it's not too small ges,control
not too wide ges,control
not too narrow ges,control
and the messenger says ,control
 proclaim ,control
 I have found the prince's princess ,control
the prince comes to claim Cinderella ,control
and they get married and live happily ever after ,control
and yes the stepsisters  mended their ways and really became nice little girl  nice girls instead of the mean spiteful ones they had been ,control
