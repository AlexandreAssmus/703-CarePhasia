today was little Timmy's birthday ,control

his mother had baked him a large chocolaty cake with beautiful drippy icing and five wonderful candles ,control
but as the guests were arriving the dog took the opportunity to take a large bite of the beautiful chocolaty cake ,control
and a,control
but the dog hid underneath the sofa ,control
tracking chocolaty footprints all the way ,control
the little boy was crying ,control
but his party guests two of them were standing there with their presents ,control
and the mother angrily  continued angrily to threaten  continued to angrily threaten the dog with the broom ,control
however  the mother counted to ten ,control
put the broom away ,control
put the dog out ,control
cleaned out the mess  cleaned up the mess ,control
cut the cake in half ,control
and everybody got a huge slice of the untainted side of the birthday cake ,control
and little Timmy had a wonderful fifth birthday with his little friend John and his little friend Greta ,control
the end ,control
sings no ,control
one day I was out to lunch with my friend Bill ,control
it was a work day ,control
and we were at Mimi's cafe ,control
and my stomach started hurting ,control
and I thought shrugs that it might just be stre,control
so  I ignored it ,control
but by seven o'clock that night I was throwing up constantly ,control
it never  the pain never let up ,control
and I was just throwing up throwing up throwing up ,control
at five o'clock in the morning I decided well I had decided before but  at five o'clock in the morning I felt comfortable calling my exhusband's father my ex father inlaw to come get the two older kids ,control
who were shrugs  ten and nine at the time ,control
and I didn't have my third one ,control
so  my two kids ,control
um and take them to his wife ,control
and drive me to the hospital ,control
which he did ,control
and I spent from,control
uh they did a_lot_of tests on me ,control
they found out that I have one kidney ,control
I was thirty one years old ,control
and I had no idea I only had one kidney ,control
but they looked for kidney stones ,control
and they only saw one kidney which was huge ,control
and they thought ,control
 what's going on ,control
they looked for the other one ,control
they never found it because I don't have another one ,control
so  I found out I didn't have another kidney ,control
and I also found out I didn't have kidney stones ,control
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis ,control
and it was about to kill me ,control
so  Doctor Geiger came ,control
he was the anesthesiologist ,control
he introduced himself ,control
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists ,control
I said ,control
 yes ,control
I was in a_lot_of pain ,control
because the pain medication they had given me um ,control
I couldn't have any more ,control
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons ,control
so  I was in a_lot_of pain ,control
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things ,control
and so Doctor Geiger put me under ,control
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly ,control
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a ges,control
what are those things called ,control
a ventilation tube down my throat ,control
um and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up ,control
and they gave me some medication ,control
and sent me home ,control
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo ges,control
and now I have a third baby ,control
the end ,control
okay  one time I was at ,control
oh was it Sea_World ,control
it was Sea_World in San_Diego ,control
with three children ,control
uh one of which was in a stroller ,control
and I was walking ,control
and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said ,control
 look ,control
so  I was looking ,control
and then there was a man off to the right of the  of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily ,control
and I looked up at him and there was  he was indicating to me something ,control
and I looked to my right ,control
and there's a woman there with a stroller ,control
and she's fuming at me ,control
and she's telling her husband six feet away to tell me that I'm in her way ,control
and I look over at the woman ,control
and she looks at me like she wants to  hit me ,control
and she's points yelling at her husband to tell me points,control
um so  I looked at her husband ,control
and I looked at her ,control
and I said ,control
 she can talk to me ,control
 and the words excuse me work very well ,control
um and so I looked at her ,control
and she continued to fume at me ,control
didn't say a single thing to me um until after her husband had told me to move ,control
um then she cussed at me and called me a name ,control
and um so I basically let her live her miserable life ,control
and um that's all I really did about it ,control
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred and six degree temperature ,control
so  I took her to the emergency room ,control
and um she wouldn't take anything orally ,control
she jus,control
um and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard even_though her temperature was a hundred and six was a good sign ,control
so  they gave her um um ,control
um what's the nice way to say this ,control
a rectal fever reducer ,control
and she eventually got better ,control
we got her on antibiotics ,control
um but I was extremely afraid because it was my first child ,control
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred and six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature ,control
so  I took her to the hospital ,control
and she eventually got better ,control
okay  once upon a ti,control
it was raining very hard ,control
but she hadta get home ,control
and so she crossed the bridge ,control
but the bridge wasn't very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was ges decaying the under girders ,control
made that up ,control
and so the bridge gave way ,control
and the girl fell off of the bridge ,control
for she was really riding a bike ,control
and it was a rumbly bridge ,control
and she fell into the water ,control
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help ,control
eventually someone heard her cries for help ,control
and put on all the rescue  necessary rescue gear ,control
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her ,control
and she was very grateful ,control
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him ,control
and he said ,control
 don't ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain ,control
 and be safe ,control
the end ,control
one day a bo,control
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball ,control
and he kicked it into the air ,control
and it crashed through a neighbor's window ,control
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window ,control
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window ,control
but the boy ran away ,control
and the man walked outside looking for the boy ,control
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball ,control
the man scolded him ,control
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge ,control
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even ,control
the end ,control
one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain ,control
and told him to take an umbrella ,control
the boy said ,control
 no I'll be fine mom ,control
and the mother was hesitant ,control
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella ,control
then the boy was walking to school ,control
and it started to rain ,control
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did ,control
and so he,control
and wetly came in the door saying nothing ,control
but showing his mother that she was indeed right ,control
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being ,control
so  she gave it to him ,control
and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mother's love ,control
the end ,control
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella ,control
I would guess ,control
there was a little girl ,control
and her father was widowed ,control
and so he remarried ,control
and the new stepmother had two daughters the w girl's age ,control
and the stepmother was not very nice ,control
and as the dad got out_of the picture by an unfortunate series of events um the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave ,control
and turned her into basically a scullery maid ,control
and made her clean out the fireplace ,control
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I don't know what her name was before ,control
and the  one da,control
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife ,control
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress ,control
and the ,control
let's just call her the wicked stepmother ,control
the wicked stepmother um was not interested in letting Cinderella go ,control
so  when Cinderella came downstairs she,control
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress ,control
actually  not Cinderella ,control
she didn't do that at all ,control
and um they had taken things from the sisters ,control
so  the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress ,control
Cinderella was very sad ,control
but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle ,control
and a,control
her rather plump fairy godmother came ,control
and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown ,control
turned the mice into coachmen and  horses ,control
and turned a pumpkin into a coach ,control
and Cinderella went to the castle ,control
the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her ,control
what are the chances ,control
and um as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight the magic would wear off ,control
and so when the crock ,control
leaving one of her beautiful glass slipper,control
uh however,control
so,control
even_though the prince had spent couple hours with her ,control
and went looking for her using the glass slipper ,control
and when the people came to the door of Cinderella's abode ,control
um the stepmother locked her in  had locked her in because s they didn't want her to find  she didn't want him to find  she didn't want them to find her ,control
and so they,control
she raced downstairs ,control
the shoe fit perfectly,control
they found Cinderella,control
and Cinderella went to the palace ,control
married the prince ,control
rode off in a coach ,control
and they lived happily ever after ,control
the end ,control
one day a girl was out playing ,control
and she had her do,control
and no she had a cat ,control
and she and the cat were playing ,control
and the  do a dog came by and chased the cat up the tree ,control
the little girl couldn't reach the cat ,control
so  she called her dad ,control
her dad came with a ladder ,control
and climbed up the tree ,control
but the ladder fell ,control
the dog continued to bark ,control
the dad was stuck ,control
the cat contentedly sat at the end of the branch ,control
and the little girl still couldn't reach the cat ,control
so   she called the fireman to come save the dad and the cat ,control
and they brought their ladder ,control
and saved them all ,control
and sent the doggie home ,control
and had a talk with the doggie's owner about a leash law ,control
the end ,control
um well  I guess I can back up and say that the girl rode her bike to the place where she played with her cat ,control
but that was a long time ago ,control
and there was a bird singing happily in all the cacophony ,control
the end ,control
