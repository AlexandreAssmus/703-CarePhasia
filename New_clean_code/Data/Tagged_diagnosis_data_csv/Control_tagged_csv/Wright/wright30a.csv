oh okay ,control
first you take two pieces of bread ,control
and you get out the peanut butter and a knife ,control
and you smear the peanut butter on one side of the bread ,control
and then you get out the jelly and a knife ,control
and smear the jelly on the other side of the bread ,control
then you take the ges,control
and that's your sandwich ,control
um you dig a hole in the soil ,control
and then you take the flower out_of its pot ,control
and you hafta loosen the roots ,control
and if you want you can put Miracle_Grow laughs underneath ,control
I love gardening ,control
and you put the flower in the hole ,control
and then you fill it back up with dirt ,control
and then you water it ,control
it is the little boy's birthday ,control
he's having his birthday party today ,control
but the dog found the cake ,control
and ate a big chunk out_of the cake ,control
and left caky doggie footprints laughs all the way under the couch ,control
the mother is ma,control
she's got the broom ,control
I think she's gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why it's hiding ,control
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived ,control
so  they are coming in with their presents um seeing a  a mangled cake for the birthday ,control
oh  and it looks like the little boy is crying ,control
um okay  so  I was hospitalized well sort_of um in November for abdominal surgery ,control
and um I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before ,control
but it kicked in really fast ,control
like they tell you to take three deep breaths ,control
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out ,control
um and it was kind_of like taking a long blink ,control
and then I opened my eyes ,control
and it was like three hours later ,control
which was really strange because usually like you_know when you sleep you can feel time passing ,control
like it didn't feel like any time had passed ,control
so  it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that you_know three hours had gone by ,control
everything was all over with ,control
um and then I was on pain meds ,control
I stayed overnight ,control
um and then I went home ,control
I was on pain meds ,control
um but then I  I was able to go off of those ,control
um I'm not sure what else you wanna know about it laughs ,control
um no not off hand ,control
um okay  so  I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator ,control
um she would hold things in ,control
and you_know you could just feel the energy that she was upset ,control
but um she wouldn't talk about it ,control
I asked her on numerous occasions to  you_know if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her ,control
she always said ,control
 no ,control
um and then um she kind_of passively aggressively started you_know not participating in things or you_know just kind_of being rude  I guess laughs ,control
so  it finally you_know broke my last little straw ,control
and I yelled at her one day ,control
and kicked her out_of the group ,control
so  laughs that's what I did about it laughs ,control
okay  well  I'm afraid of heights ,control
even little heights ,control
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder ,control
so  I decided uh one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving um you_know thing  you_know jump  I guess that's what you call it a jump  for his birthday ,control
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too ,control
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights ,control
so  we went sky diving ,control
and it was terrifying ,control
and when I  when we jumped out_of the plane you_know you're attached to someone else ,control
so  when we jumped out_of the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute laughs while we were free falling because I was just like ges,control
um and then the parachute opens ,control
and then you start gliding which is kind of nice ,control
that was  that was better ,control
it was a little bit more like being a bird you_know and flying ,control
um so  that was nice for a little bit ,control
and then we landed ,control
and then that was that ,control
and I said I'm glad I did it ,control
and I'll never do it again laughs ,control
and I'm still afraid of heights laughs ,control
um so  the story starts with the flood ,control
there's lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city ,control
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat  um to save her cat from the flood and the rains ,control
so  she got caught in the flood ,control
she got swept downstream ,control
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out ,control
and she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her ,control
um someone saw her ,control
called the fire department ,control
and now the  the firemen are there ,control
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on ,control
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him I think that's what that looks like  uh to get her out_of the water ,control
and that's the end ,control
okay  the boy is playing soccer outside ,control
he kicks the ball really hard ,control
it goes crashing into the window ,control
um it crashes through the window into the lamps  m,control
um he jumps up ,control
he grabs the ball ,control
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it ,control
yep ,control
the boy is leaving for school ,control
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella ,control
it might rain ,control
and he says ,control
head,control
 I'll be fine ,control
 bye mom ,control
so  he leaves ,control
he goes outside ,control
and it's sprinkling a little bit ,control
and then it's r,control
and there's puddles all over ,control
and mom was right ,control
so  he's running back home in the rain ,control
he comes home all sopping wet ,control
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face ,control
and he gets the umbrella ,control
and leaves again for school with the umbrella ,control
okay  well  the father his wife dies ,control
and he is left in the care of his um single daughter ,control
and he remarries ,control
and he remarries um uh evil  but ee she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella ,control
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own ,control
and they live together ,control
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen ,control
and the dad is kind_of nowhere in this part of the story  laughs laughs ,control
and then um there's  Cinderella  let's see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them ,control
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream ,control
so  then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married ,control
and he must have a ball to find his wife ,control
so  they send out invitations to  around the town ,control
and the stepmother gets the invitation ,control
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince ,control
so  they get ready ,control
Cinderella has the  the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress ,control
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them ,control
but her sister's say no she can't go ,control
she hasta stay and clean ,control
and they rip her dress ,control
she goes back up to her room crying while her sisters and  stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball ,control
um then the  fair her fairy godmother appears ,control
and says she will create  the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball ,control
but she has back by midnight or she'll turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin ,control
so  and she gets glass slippers ,control
so  she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers ,control
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her ,control
and her stepmother and the sisters don't know who she is because she looks so different ,control
and then it gets to be midnight ,control
and she says ,control
 oh  I needta go home ,control
so  she runs away from the prince ,control
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs ,control
and she runs home ,control
and the  her dress turns back to rags ,control
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin ,control
but she still has her glass slipper ,control
then the next day the prince sends out um someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was ,control
so  they show up with the slipper at her house ,control
and the stepmother locks her in the room  locks Cinderella in the room ,control
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsister's feet which it doesn't fit because they have big feet ,control
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room ,control
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper ,control
and lo_and_behold it fits ,control
so  they bring her back to the prince ,control
and they get married ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
um the little girl's pet cat is stuck up in the tree ,control
she's gotten off her tricycle and is concerned ,control
jumping up and down trying to get the cat to come down ,control
the father decides to help ,control
so  he gets the ladder ,control
climbs up the tree ,control
and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down ,control
and the dog is barking at him ,control
and is probably going to bite him when he comes down ,control
um but in the meantime the fire department is coming ,control
they're on their way with the ladder to come save both the man and the cat ,control
