well  I'd like to say that being a European I was not brought up to enjoy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches ,control
but I have learned to make them for various visits that I have from my grandchildren ,control
uh I would get two slices of wheat bread which I uh enjoy very much ,control
I  first I would uh get the peanut butter jar out_of the cupboard ,control

an and she suddenly saw her cat in the tree ,control
and she called her father points,control
the dog points,control
the mother in  b in meantime had obviously called points,control
and  points,control
and he ,control
uh we were living in LA ,control
and we lost our house in an earthquake ,control
and uh in which time we decided to move to Arizona ,control
um shortly after we arrived in Arizona I was diagnosed with breast cancer ,control
it was a very hard time for me because I knew noone here ,control
I had no friends ,control
ah luckily I had a wonderful doctor who uh performed an operation on me ,control
and put me on a drug which I hadta take called Tamoxifen ,control
uh I live in the Lakes_in_Tempe which is a very pleasant place to live ,control
and over the years  over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication I got to know very many friends who were extremely good very supportive to me ,control
and uh I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time ,control
and also grateful for the knowledge that it's been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer ,control

I could remember when I,control
I was  I was an actress for many years in London and in Sydney_Australia ,control

and um I already had one child who was born in Australia ,control
and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home ,control
and I hadta do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could which wasn't very e easy because I had a sister inlaw who was not very kind at that time ,control
and every time I made a mistake in Germany she useta  she useta laugh and make fun of me ,control
and I useta be very resentful about that ,control
but because I was s I guess  so ambitious at that time and because I was good at dialects ,control
and I  I think this has something to do with musical ability because I'm able to hear ges,control
I learned  t I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year I would say ,control
and that's  um that's all I could say about laughs language difficulties ,control
very much so ,control

and grabbed ges,control
and with that he was able to help the little girl on land ,control
and both their lives were saved at that time ,control

and it threw   it flew  the ball flew through the window ,control
and uh made a big hole in the window ,control
and bounced right next to dad ,control
dad of_course was not pleased ,control
and shouted through the window ,control

it was time for little Johnny to go to school ,control
and because the weather was looking gray and cloudy outside his mom said ,control

that was the only thing that the prince hadta identify her with ,control
uh shortly after that the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman ,control
