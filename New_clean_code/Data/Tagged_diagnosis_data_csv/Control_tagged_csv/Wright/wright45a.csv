it looked like this little girl was out riding a bicycle ,control
and she happened to look up and see a cat in the tree ,control
now the cat might have been up at the tree because he saw points,control
but that's what hafta be happening ,control
and I guess the father came by with a short ladder and tried to help ,control
and he got up in the tree ,control
the ladder fell over ,control
and he was stuck there ,control
and the little dog who happened to g be out walking with the father at the time  is at the tree barking to help his father ,control
and the fi two firemen came to the scene ,control
and they have a better ladder ,control
and they're going to go up and rescue the cat ,control
and the little girl can then go on and continue her bicycle ride ,control
and get the father down off the tree ,control
and he can continue his walk with the dog ,control
well  the closest thing I ever had that  the oddest that's ever happened to me ,control

it looks like the river as was frequent at this time of the year has risen above its banks ,control
and in one section this little girl  got trapped ,control
she was probably with her mommy or her daddy in the car or with a friend playing on the banks and fell in ,control
and the river is with a xxx coming down ,control
and she managed to hang onto a branch   a little thicket ,control
and while she hung onto that branch people had noticed her ,control
and they called the fireman ,control
now the fireman with great great courage went out into the water to save the young girl ,control
came out to the branch ,control
picked her up ,control
tied them to  tied a rescue line ,control
put a safety jacket on her ,control
as you can see points,control
the harness that will go on her with her safety jacket ,control
tied a rope to it ,control
and then they pulled both the fireman and the young girl to safety ,control
young boy was out practicing his soccer balls and kicks and everything else and ,control
like anything else that happens with a young boy and a pane of glass and a sports object you know the pane of glass is gonna get broken ,control
and bam there it goes ,control
it not only breaks the ball when he kicks it  not only breaks the window ,control
it also knocks over the lamp ,control
and disturbs the father ,control
or worse yet it could be the neighbor next door who wasn't a very nice person ,control
but they pick up the ball ,control
and he says ,control

and she's treated just as a lowlife servant ,control
she can't do nothing about it because Daddy's gone ,control

and then all_of_a_sudden the aunt gets an invitation to the great ball ,control
or the king was saying to the  before that time the king was saying to the son ,control

and unbeknownst to her but those two c sisters or  cousins or  whatever they were  stepsisters ,control
they were so upset and depressed ,control
