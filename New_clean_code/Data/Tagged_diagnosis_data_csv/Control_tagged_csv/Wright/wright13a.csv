okay  when I was seventeen years old after I'd gra graduated from high school ,control
I went to Anaheim for a week long conference ,control
and while I was there I developed meningitis ,control
and uh I couldn't lay my head down on the pillow ,control
it  it  it was excruciating ,control
you_know  the  my scalp is very sensitive so I couldn't lay my head down on anything ,control
I really didn't know what was wrong with me ,control
I just thought I had a bad headache ,control
so  I went out to the kitchen and uh just sat there for about an hour or two ,control
it was the middle of the night and uh didn't really know what to do because I couldn't lay my head down ,control
but I was exhausted ,control
and uh so I ended up um going ,control
and uh there was someone staying in the room with me ,control
I  I told them that I couldn't sleep ,control
something was wrong with my head ,control
and uh he was actually a neurologist ,control
uh but uh he ended up giving me some pretty strong uh um pills to help the pain go away ,control
and it helped through the morning ,control
but then the next day it continued to hurt ,control
so  uh I ended up going to the hospital that evening ,control
I was actually staying with three doctors ,control
so  they took me to the the hospital ,control
and uh they checked me in ,control
they did a  um first did a elec ,control
let's see what was it ,control
a cat ,control
think it was a cat ,control
uh um and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me ,control
uh so  that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture ,control
a  it was a  it was a resident it was a teaching uh hospital it was U_C_Irvine ,control
and uh he didn't do a very good job at it ,control
so  the the doctor was watching him took over ,control
it was painful ,control
but they had given me morphine by this point ,control
so  I felt much better ,control
uh I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside ,control
and uh I was still in the emergency room at that point ,control
and eventually the next morning got me into my own room ,control
and uh I felt fine by the next day ,control
um but they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much ,control
but when I was seventeen I was only eating uh one meal a day ,control
but they said I they would let me go home if I didn't eat more ,control
so  I hadta eat three meals a day ,control
and they wanted to monitor me ,control
and but I felt great ,control
and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there ,control
and they kept me two more days ,control
and uh they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go ,control
and to check my white blood cell count ,control
and it was pretty much the same as it was before ,control
so  it didn't show much of an improvement ,control
but I felt great ,control
so  they let me go home ,control
hm,control

my niece and my  one of my nieces one of my nephews had a speech delay ,control
it was  it was mainly with phonation ,control

and um I think both of them had that same problem and a couple of others you_know problems with uh liquids ,control
but that's not a big problem ,control
you_know  you develop later ,control
um I  I actually did work with one of my nieces in regards to that ,control
she was very responsive ,control
um but uh it  it wasn't that big of a difficulty ,control

wasn't a big problem ,control

Cinderella was a little girl ,control
her mother had passed away ,control
and her father uh ended up remarrying a woman who had two daughters ,control
uh the  this woman and her two daughters ,control
well  eventually Cinderella's father also passed away ,control
and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother ,control
her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her um their servant basically ,control
and uh everyone  they were very cruel to her ,control
and she lived a very um meager life ,control
and um but she was f friends with all the animals ,control
uh the animals were the people she got along with people she could talk to or  the  the creatures that she could talk to ,control
and uh then one day the there was a prince in that um country ,control
and uh they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife ,control
and  uh as it was time for him to marry ,control
and all  and Cinderella and their  her stepsisters were very excited to go ,control
uh however Cinderella uh could not go unless she had finished all her chores ,control
her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish ,control
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first ,control
um so  um by the time uh it came to go um Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to um make a dress or prepare herself to go ,control
but uh unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters' clothes and such that uh they had cast away because they didn't want it ,control
um so  Cinderella was very happy um that they had the dress for her ,control
and sh while the  the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it um Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go ,control
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away ,control
and um they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters ,control
and she went out to the yard and was crying ,control
and then uh a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight ,control
she made her very beautiful and uh all that ,control
but she warned her ,control
it would only last til midnight ,control
and you_know she turned you_know uh a pumpkin into a carriage and you_know transformed all these elements uh to make her look very beautiful ,control
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince ,control
and uh I guess it was love at first sight ,control
and they were dancing together ,control
and you_know he he very much enjoyed his time with her ,control
and uh they were dancing outside ,control
and she saw the clock ,control
and she knows it's almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs uh leaving one of her glass slippers behind um ,control
and she went racing off in the carriage ,control
and um she actually didn't make it quite home in the when it struck midnight ,control
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin ,control
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin ,control
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers ,control
and so this prince um after this happened he uh was very interested in finding her ,control
you_know  he was  wo he wondered why she had ran away ,control
and so he um set out to search for her using the glass slipper ,control
you_know  whoever's foot it fit would be that girl ,control
he sent out his  um I don't know it was the duke or something uh to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit ,control
it was very small ,control
um and eventually that duke got to Cinderella's house ,control
and uh Cinderella got excited ,control
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella ,control
I don't remember how ,control
and um locked Cinderella up there ,control
and  um while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper ,control
their feet were way too large ,control
they went flying you_know every time ,control
and uh the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the  the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind ,control
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper ,control
the stepmother was very angry at this ,control
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper ,control
and uh the stepmother tripped him ,control
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces ,control
and you_know the duke thought that everything was over ,control
and everything was ruined ,control
and they'd never find her ,control
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity ,control
and she ended up marrying the prince ,control
and they lived happily ever after ,control
one day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat Patches was in the tree stuck and was crying ,control
she ran home quickly to get her dad to help him  to help the cat out ,control
ah the dad brought a ladder just in case ,control
and as they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree ,control
the father then climbed up the tree ,control
