that's water ,control
 looks like a little girl f fell into the creek or  in the river  river  where there was branches or  logs or  or  branches from trees there and sw twigs ,control
she fell in there ,control
and I guess she was hollering and scared et hollering ,control
and perhaps the people ,control
 wait I can't see that ,control
 maybe it was in a  a boat or on the bank or something with them lifejackets on ,control
and they jumped into the water ,control
and I don't know what that is there ,control
jumped into the water ,control
and saved the little girl ,control
she hadta hold onto the branch  to save the little girl ,control
but there's really dangerous ,control
but evidently she was saved xxx laughs ,control
well   well  the little boy was out ,control

 the little boy was out playing with the basketball I guess  soccer ball ,control
kicking it  and playing ,control

and his dad looked very surprised ,control
the last picture he looked at the window ,control
the father was just loo ,control
he has the ball ,control
and just looking at the window ,control
and  that's it ,control
 that's what I can see laughs ,control
 the little boy was going to school  I guess ,control
he was going to school ,control
and uh it was ready  ready to rain ,control
his mother wanted to give him the umbrella ,control
and head,control
so  eh she was giving the umbrella ,control
and he wouldn't take it ,control
he said ,control

he's going on to school ,control
so  when he got out there it started raining real hard ,control
he ran back to the house  in the rain ,control
and his mother  told his mother ,control
she gave him an umbrella ,control
and he went on to school laughs ,control
once a ,control
there was once upon a time a  a motha ugly mother and her two ugly  gir and her two ugly girls  daughters ,control
and they were very selfish children ,control
and evidently the ,control
I don't know who it was ,control
 but it brought  it brought the other  Cinderella to her home to take care of ,control
she hadta take care of the  ch the Cinderella ,control
well  Cinderella was a very beautiful little girl ,control
and uh th they  the stepmother and daughters treated her terribly ,control
so  she just went  uh uh try to do the best she could ,control
she hadta do all the work for them ,control
and one day uh she looked in a trunk ,control
and there was a beautiful dress in there ,control
so  she hung this hand,control
and uh I  and then the fairy godmother came and  to her and was talking to her ,control
so  then the  w evidently the fairy godmother must have talked to her ,control
then  the  the  moth the h ugly mother received a invitation to the  uh a ball for them all ,control
and Cinderella wanted to go ,control
and the fairy godmother was there  for her ,control
and uh uh  she ges put on  I think she put on this pretty pink dress ,control

beautiful clothes ,control
she had this glass slipper on ,control
and th she was leaving she dropped it ,control
and they looked all over for the slipper and uh where the little girl was ,control
because uh the prince was very enchanted with her ,control
 well  I guess the jester or the footman or somebody had tried the  sli the slippers on all the other daughters and the mother ,control
wouldn't fit ,control
but it fit the little girl Cinderella ,control
then  cinder then uh I guess the bo footman went back to the prince and told him ,control
