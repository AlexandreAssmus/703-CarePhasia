okay ,control
a little girl was playing outside in the yard with her kitty and her puppy ,control
and suddenly she realized her kitty had gone up into the tree and was lounging on the branch ,control
the birds were singing ,control
so  it must have been in the springtime ,control
and she was very upset ,control
she'd been riding her tricycle also ,control
and she was very upset ,control
she went and got her dad ,control
her dad came out ,control
climbed up in the tree ,control
but he got scared ,control
couldn't  the kitty was on a branch he couldn't reach ,control
and so he was sitting there and didn't know how to get back down ,control
the dog was barking at the dad ,control
and someone  mommy probably  realized what was going on ,control
she called the fire department ,control
and the fire department came with a ladder ,control
actually  it looks like a ladder laying there ,control
so  dad probably climbed up on the ladder ,control
and then the ladder fell down ,control
and he couldn't get up  get back down ,control
okay  sighs you get two pieces of bread ,control
and you get um your peanut butter and your jelly ,control
and first you put the peanut butter on one slice of bread ,control
and then you put the jelly on the other slice of bread ,control
and then you place the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and jelly touching each other ,control
and then you slice it in half ,control
well  it was in,control
and it was April first ,control
and um I has  was working ,control
um and I had been ill for a couple of months ,control
going to the doctors  different doctors and doing tests ,control
and um I wasn't getting any better ,control
and I went to the doctor that day ,control
and he took one look at me ,control
and said ,control
 you're going to the hospital ,control
and so the hospital was right next door ,control
and I went next door ,control
and um they admitted me ,control
and I called work to tell them where I was ,control
and that I wasn't gonna be in ,control
but I was so kind_of out_of it I didn't even know where I was ,control
and laughs they couldn't figure it out for quite awhile ,control
and um  I was in the hospital for a week with them doing intraveneous ,control
which I've been on antibotics ,control
and they did all kinds of tests ,control
they couldn't find out what was wrong ,control
but I was slowly dying ,control
and they knew that ,control
and um that I was filled with infection ,control
and they couldn't locate it ,control
and so finally a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory ,control
and I agreed sighs because I knew that I was not gonna make it ,control
and so they went in ,control
and what had happened I had like peritonitis ,control
and um I'd had diverticulitis ,control
and one of them burst hands,control
and that would have been peritonitis with the infection bu,control
and they  h it had sealed it except for a ges,control
that ges,control
and so I was w I guess what they call septic ,control
and so they did the surgery ,control
and it was a long long surgery ,control
and um I ended up with a colo colonoscopy no  colostomy  colostomy ,control
it was the bag ,control
and um then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that ,control
um and then six months later I was able to go back in the hospital because they had removed a section of my colon ,control
went back in the hospital ,control
and they resectioned ,control
and I was able to not have the bag anymore ,control
sighs so  I can remember all of that laughs ,control
and  and it was life threatening ,control
but  um and I knew that ,control
and  and that's why I'm not afraid to die now because it was very peaceful ,control
it wasn't  it wasn't like a scary thing so ,control
yes ,control
well  it's still on going ,control
my mother as I said is eighty eight ,control
um she has a pretty profound hearing loss ,control
and has for probably uh at_least ten years ,control
but she refuses uh ta ,control
so  we have hadta deal with this ,control
um so  when I take her ,control
and I'm the one that's responsible for taking her to all of her doctors' appointments ,control
and when she's in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth ,control
and so I hafta yell at her all the time ,control
and it's so rude and awful to be yelling at her ,control
and even when I explain to the doctors they still turn and talk ta ,control
um and that's uh frustrating for her ,control
um and once I leave I'm feeling really tense and frustrated because I've been yelling points,control
and our bodies  when points,control
and my mother also is getting some dementia ,control
and so the combination  a what I've realized is more to just allow her to talk ,control
and not really have a conversation with her anymore ,control
and that's very sad ,control
laughs it's  i I guess it's not that unusual fo ,control
and I've already told my boys ,control
and I've had my hearing test here that I won't do that to them ,control
you_know  it's really really bad ,control
laughs yes ,control
and right from the beginning so  that you_know you don't hafta make that huge you_know li ,control
and  and I don't think that it works as well when it's done later on you_know ,control
um so  anyway ,control
hm I'm sure there has been ,control
well yeah  um obviously I've got  with two boys ,control
um they're adults now ,control
but with them growing up there was you_know always something going on ,control
um because they were getting into stuff different things ,control
um probably one of the times that was really scary that co first comes to mind is my oldest boy ,control
um when he was maybe,control
and they were doing swim lessons and  i in the neighbor's yard ,control
uh wher with  the pool was next door ,control
and the neighbor  and the  and the instructor would come out to the pool ,control
so  he was very familiar with the pool ,control
and there was two friends there that ,control
and so we were over there um just as a  pa at a party ,control
and so he had been practicing going off the board ges ,control
it was just a little board ,control
but he'd been practicing doing that and he wanted to do that ,control
but then he got scared just as he started to jump off ,control
and he jumped toward the side ges,control
and so he hit his chin points,control
and it just opened it up ,control
and um of_course he was hysterical ,control
and I was getting pretty scared ,control
but it  wa you could see the bone ,control
I_mean it was really really scary ,control
and so we had ta ,control
and w he wasn't knocked out ,control
so  we took him to the hospital into emergency ,control
and then they  of_course they hadta do stitches ,control
and um yeah laughs it was kind_of scary ,control
but they survive those things most of the time ,control
laughs ,control
 there was a family that was going home ,control
um and there was um some water in the road where they were going to cross ,control
um and the father decided to go ahead ,control
and that they could make it ,control
but as they got about half way across the water was too deep ,control
and started washing the car away ,control
the windows were down luckily ,control
and they were all getting  ou crawling out the window ,control
and some people they had called nineoneone ,control
and there was a res first responder that came ,control

and he was able to rescue her ,control
 there was a young man that was learning to play soccer ,control
and he was on the soccer team ,control
and he was excited ,control
and he was practicing with his kicks in the front yard ,control
and he kicked it really good ,control
only thing he kicked it too hard ,control
and wasn't careful about where he was aiming ,control
and it hit the window ,control
and he had kicked it so hard that it broke the window ,control
his dad was sitting inside when the soccer ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp ,control
um and he jumped up and grabbed the soccer ball ,control
and looked out the window ,control
and saw that it was his son that was practicing ,control
and so he understood ,control
he was  uh had been a boy before ,control
and knew that it was just a window and it could be repaired ,control
 sighs the little boy was getting ready ta ,control
he had his backpack on ,control
and Mom told him ,control

and suddenly it started sprinkling ,control
and he was getting wet ,control
and he went running back through the puddles and through the rain back to the house ,control
and he was all wet ,control
mom looked at him and said ,control
 I told you so ,control
and so he got the umbrella ,control
and then he was walking to school uh with the umbrella even though he was already wet ,control
