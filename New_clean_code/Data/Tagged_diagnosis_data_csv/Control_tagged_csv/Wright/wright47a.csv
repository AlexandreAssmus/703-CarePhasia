and how do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
um you take out uh ,control
if I points,control
uh I like uh peanut butter butter and jelly on white bread ,control
so  two pieces of white bread ,control
and then uh you put a layer of peanut butter on one slice of bread ,control
and you put a layer of butter on the laughs other slice ,control
and then you open up the jelly ,control
put a slice  a layer of jelly on that slice ,control
and then you fold or  put the two slices together ,control
and then if I'm really hungry I put a second layer and make it a doubledecker ,control
uh it's little Jonathan's seventh birthday and he's having a birthday party ,control
he's invited his friends and his friends' parents over um for  to open presents and have cake ,control
and um right before everyone is sposta arrive ,control
um the dog smells the delicious cake on the table ,control
and jumps up on the table ,control
starts to eat the cake ,control
and little th Jonathan comes in and finds the dog  um eating the cake ,control
and begins to cry ,control
and the mom gets uh really angry and grabs a broom to punish the dog ,control
and the dog sees the mom with the broom ,control
gets scared runs under the couch ,control
trailing icing on the carpet after him ,control
and for all the sc screaming and crying going on the  the birthday guests arrive at the door ,control
and they open the door to see what's going on ,control
and they come in living room ,control
and they see an angry mom and little Jonathan crying and cake everywhere ,control
and they wonder if there's still gonna be a party or not ,control
you'll probably laugh because uh this is kind_of a unique story ,control
um I  uh I once st owned uh two blacktailed prairie dogs ,control
and we  uh some friends of ours liked uh our prairie dogs so much that two hand,control
so  we had hand,control
and then one of them was going out_of the country and needed us to watch their  dum their prairie dogs ,control
and so um  we did ,control
and uh one of them was a male ,control
and he was a_little aggressive ,control
and he didn't like me very much ,control
and uh so I was trying to hand,control
uh hand,control
and uh so I was trying to pet him ,control
and I was rubbing his chin hand,control
and he was getting all hands,control
and I really didn't read the warning sign very much ,control
and he bit me ,control
and took out a good chunk of my shows,control
so  uh so  I'm actually home um alone ,control
and I looks,control
and I can see shows,control
it's pretty good bite ,control
and uh I realize well ,control
 I should probably not  um I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it ,control
and I  I don't always do well with the sight of my own blood ,control
like I have no hands,control
but I got ges,control
and then like ,control
 oh_boy what do I do ,control
so  ironically or  hand,control
so  I hadta wrap hand,control
and interrupt points her class ,control
and  laughs to get her hand,control
and uh so I was standing there when she hand,control
you_know  I'm standing there ,control
I'm like ,control
 um the prairie dog bit me ,control
 can you drive me to the urgent care ,control
and she's like ,control
 okay ,control
so  she hasta ges,control
and then I get to urgent care for stitches ,control
and prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona ,control
um w I had bought it in Texas ,control
and you can also buy them in Washington state ,control
ah but they're  they're considered restricted wildlife here ,control
and so I hadta completely lie about the entire ,control
because they ask you how you got the bite and was it an animal and whatever ,control
and I hadta hand,control
they probably would have come and taken the prairie dogs away ,control
so  laughs all_of_a_sudden it became a  uh um like I think I said a  a ferret ,control
because you're allowed to have ferrets here ,control
a ferret bite laughs ,control
anyway shrugs laughs that's my experience ,control
um uh my grandmother who's almost eighty is in a nursing home ,control
and uh she's slowly been losing her mental points,control
and I'm actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama ,control
and um so every time I visit her I'm never quite sure what mental state she'll be in whether she recognizes me ,control
she  uh she usually  she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year ,control
and uh those people that she doesn't hand,control
so  usually  i sometimes I'm me her grandson ,control
but other times I'm other grandsons who see her more often ,control
and um so  uh um so you just hafta sort_of  uh it's easier to just sorta ,control
and get her  you_know sort_of uh force laughs her to realize who you really are ,control
um so you're  so you just sort_of play along ,control
and you basically just ask her how she's doing ,control
and she kind_of um makes stuff up or doesn't make a_lot_of sense ,control
um although I_mean h you can under  you can  she  hand,control
and you can understand what she's saying ,control
it's just that the  it's not coherent sometimes ,control
and so you just kind_of hafta um  take it as it goes and stay for about ten fifteen minutes ,control
and then  then you leave ,control
and it's kind_of sad ,control
but I think she at_least is somewhat happy to have a visitor ,control
so  there's some solace in that ,control
um this is when uh my parents were still married ,control
and we were  I was a little hand,control
I was probably like  exhales seven ,control
and uh we we're all camping at a lake in  north of Dallas ,control
and we'd all gone to bed for the night ,control
and uh we're hand,control
and a really bad storm came ,control
we were camping hand,control
like in hand,control
and a really bad storm came that night ,control
and the winds really picked up ,control
and uh blew the tent  started to blow the tent hand,control
off its ,control
and uh actually started rolling all the way ,control
so  we were all in the tent ,control
and it was like rolling hands,control
and as it broke hands,control
and hands,control
laughs and  and my mom's screaming ,control
and my dad's freaking out ,control
and ges,control
um I probably would have handled it different now as an adult ,control
but as a kid it's really traumatic when you don't know head,control
and everything's hands,control
and  and it stopped hand,control
it like hand,control
and my dad was able hand,control
luckily we never got in the water ,control
and he was able hand,control
but then  um but then everything hands,control
but we couldn't really leave that night ,control
and there was some hand,control
so  my laughs dad sat up all night just to hands,control
and  and it was just a really bad camping experience ,control
and luckily I  we kept going and I had better experiences so I'm not afraid of camping anymore ,control
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid ,control
um I'm going to  assume  I'll  I'll say this is  uh this takes place in Arizona ,control
and unfortunately  I_mean it was in monsoon season ,control
and um there was a huge storm ,control
and caused uh what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent ,control
and um this poor woman decided that uh while she had gone that way home every day ,control
and she really needed to get home to um ges,control
and she was determined to get there across the wash that she crosses every day ,control
but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash ,control
and um didn't make it but a few feet ,control
and the water started um surrounding her car and uh pushing it around and f flooding her car ,control
and um she head,control
she couldn't go  reverse to get back ,control
and started to tumble the car ,control
and she managed to get her window down ,control
and uh um get on top of the car ,control
and uh waved to some people that were on the bank to call nineoneone and uh ,control
a rescue crew came out ,control
and um  um  she was able to  um well she got  uh right as they got there the water got higher ,control
and she got swept off the top of her car ,control
and it was floating downstream ,control
and they were able to uh shimmy out on a  a limb ,control
and she was able to get close enough to him ,control
and uh they were able to grab her and uh pull her to safety ,control
and she was okay ,control
um Bobby is home from school ,control
and he decides to go out and play with his soccer ball ,control
and he's just out on the lawn ,control
and uh practicing his uh dribbling skills ,control
and he's bouncing it on his kn uh knee and foot ,control
and he accidentally kicks it a_little too hard ,control
and it goes flying right into um tongue,control
whadya ,control
one of their  uh just  um ges,control
and crashes in and breaks the window ,control
and hits a lamp and knocks it down breaks the lamp ,control
and dad's just sitting there inside watching the evening news ,control
and he's totally surprised ,control
and he grabs the ball ,control
and he runs to the window um to  uh to see what was going on and who did it ,control
and uh by that time his son had run ,control
and he doesn't see anything ,control
so  um so  he goes outside to  uh to uh catch the perpetrator ,control

 I'm starting to get wet ,control
and then it really starts coming down and puddling up in the street ,control
