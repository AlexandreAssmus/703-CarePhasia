gee ,control
I haven't broken a bone since I was five ,control
and  I haven't been hospitalized since I was twenty nine ,control
I haven't been really sick ,control
so  it's gonna be hard to come up with something  laughing ,control
let's see ,control
 oh  okay  I will laughs ,control
I was  uh  I was five and my folks were  we were ,control
I was an only child ,control
so  the three of us had gone to  um to see the Von Hindenburg ,control
which had  which was a big dirigible that was transporting people across the ocean ,control
and it was the last one before  as it turned out before it exploded and  um in  in its return trip ,control
and so my dad was real anxious to see this thing that  that he had been talking about ,control
so  we went to see it ,control
and on the way back they decided they'd stop at a little uh kind of amusement park but it had uh monkeys and other small animals down in the front area ,control
and so uh my mother hadta go into the restroom ,control
she said ,control
 now you watch her ,control
 don't let her get into trouble ,control
and so I was watching the monkeys ,control
and he was standing there talking to me ,control
I poked my finger in the cage ,control
and the monkey ges,control
uh so_that although it didn't actually break the bone it twisted my finger so_that it's always been crooked ,control
and of_course when my mother came out she said ,control
 it does look like for five minutes you could watch her ,control
laughs and I remember that very vividly  laughing ,control
because  laughing because it was my fault but my dad got into trouble laughs ,control
laughs it was laughs ,control
sighs not really ,control
yeah  that gets to be difficult ,control
oh okay  laughing ,control
well  um I spent last summer taking an ASU class in Florence Italy for a six week summer session ,control
and of_course I do  do not speak Italian ,control
so  it became imperative that I be able to at_least read enough so that I knew what was going on ,control
but lots of times I misunderstood ,control
and so I would hafta um point to what somebody else was eating if that's what I wanted to order ,control
or uh we'd go in a  caf a cafeteria and so I could point to the food that I wanted ,control
and um I needed directions I hadta show them the map of where I wanted to go ,control
and  laughing  and point to you_know what I wanted to do ,control
and then they usually could point me in the right direction ,control
so  I used objects ,control
I used um food that other people were eating ,control
and I used a map ,control
uh and I tried one of the few of my other words but they weren't very good so ,control
laughs they would always smile at me ,control
they usually figure out what it was I wanted  laughing ,control
I don't get so ,control
 I  I can't remember any time when I was really scared ,control
um I me I  uh I've never been in fear for my life ,control
but um I did have an automobile accident ,control
um I was driving south on Central ,control
went to turn on Bethany home ,control
and I looked at the oncoming traffic and there wasn't anybody ,control
but there was a car about a block down the street ,control
and I started to turn ,control
and before I got through the intersection the car hit me uh broadside ,control
and knocked me into the telephone pole ,control
and my  I had on an Indian necklace that had a wire that was strung on jeweler's wire ,control
and they hit me so hard that it broke that necklace off my neck ,control
and the pieces went all over the xxx ,control
and I wasn't frightened from that ,control
but I was really nervous because we didn't have very much money and the car was relatively new ,control
and I didn't wanna hafta go home and tell my husband that that I'd wreck the car laughs ,control
and so when I got home ,control
my mother uh came and pick me up because he was out_of town ,control
but she called him ,control
and told him that I was  that I'd had an accident ,control
so  he came home ,control
when he got home I was standing out in the driveway waiting for him ,control
and he said ,control
 oh  what did you do ,control
laughs and I told him ,control
and he said ,control
 oh  as long as you're okay ,control
 I don't  the car can always be fixed ,control
and so that was as close as I came to really being scared laughs ,control
 oh I  it was ,control
it really was ,control
oh  I guess I hafta take that back ,control
the only time I really was scared when I went in to take my dissertation defense laughs ,control
 okay ,control
the young woman fell into the icy water ,control
and she was calling for help ,control
and they called the uh fire department to come and rescue her ,control
the police the fire  de the fireman put on a inflatable vest ,control
and he had a tree limb that he was holding onto ,control
trying to help her uh out_of the swirling water ,control
which he was successfully able to do because of the team that helped him as he uh wrapped the belt around his arm and around her to help pull her out_of the water ,control
so  she was not hurt ,control
laughs ,control
okay ,control
young boy was playing soccer ,control
and he hit  kicked the ball ,control
and it went through the window ,control
the man inside was very upset because it not only did it break the window but it knocked over the lamp ,control
and glass shattered all over the living room where he was sitting ,control
then he picked up the ball and looked out the window to discover that it was his son ,control
and so he called him inside and said ,control
 how are we gonna take care of this ,control
and the boy agreed that he would pay for the window out_of his allowance ,control
 laughs ,control
laughs ,control
um the mother wanted the little boy to take an umbrella to school because it looked like rain ,control
and he said ,control
 oh  no ,control
he didn't need it ,control
but he got halfway there ,control
and realized that it was already raining ,control
so  he ran back in the mu mud puddles ,control
and he was all wet ,control
his mother made him go change clothes ,control
and gave him the umbrella ,control
and he started off with the umbrella again in dry clothes ,control
Cinderella had a very happy home ,control
but her mother died ,control
and uh after a bit her father remarried ,control
and stepmother had two very unattractive and unpleasant daughters ,control
and they made Cinderella's life miserable ,control
um as they grew Cinderella became the  the housemaid and took care of everything for the  um for the girls ,control
did what they wanted her to ,control
fetched whatever they wanted from her ,control
and in the meantime the young prince had grown ,control
and the father was disturbed because he hadn't found uh the princess that he wanted to marry ,control
so  he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday ,control
and he sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball ,control
so  the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation ,control
so  they got their new dresses ,control
and had Cinderella polish and shine everything so_that they would look just elegant ,control
and so because the invitation went to everyone Cinderella decided she would prepare a  uh a dress to go too ,control
all the animals had helped her prepare it in the movie ,control
and she sewed this lovely little ,control
it was simple dress but very very pretty xxx ,control
and when she  um what this  the time came for them all to dress and go to the ball why she helped the stepsisters get dressed ,control
and then she went up and put on her pretty little pink dress ,control
and when she came down the stepsister says ,control
 oh ,control
they couldn't  she could not go with them ,control
that was absolutely impossible because she was nothing but a chambermaid ,control
and so they actually tore her dress so she couldn't wear it ,control
they got in their coach and left ,control
and Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball ,control
and the sisters were so mean to her ,control
and all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appeared ,control
and she said ,control
 I will take care of this ,control
 I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land ,control
which she did ,control
and it was just gorgeous ,control
and Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful ,control
but she said ,control
 how am I going to get there ,control
and the fairy said ,control
 bring me the pumpkin and mice ,control
and she made a coach out_of the pumpkin and horses  and mice became horses ,control
so  they carried her to the  to the ball ,control
when she entered the prince was just dazzled by her ,control
and he asked her to dance ,control
and they danced again ,control
and they danced again ,control
and finally it struck midnight ,control
and she knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave as soon as  uh before midnight ,control
so  she dashed out_of the uh ball ,control
and in her hurry she lost one of her slippers  um glass slippers ,control
and got into the coach and uh took off ,control
but unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve ,control
and she had nothing but a pumpkin and mice ,control
and she had lost her pretty dress ,control
but she still had one single glass slipper ,control
and so she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she didn't think she'd ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had ,control
and the  the sisters came home ,control
and they were talking about this strange young woman who was there ,control
that she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her ,control
and they wondered who she was and how_come he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once ,control
and then the prince was dis  so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing Cinderella ,control
and the  um the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper uh on all  all of the eligible young women ,control
and so the stepmother said ,control
 we have only two ,control
and um so he  they tried to push their big feet into the sli sli glass slipper and it wouldn't work ,control
they were too big ,control
and he said ,control
 but isn't there another young woman here ,control
and Cinderella came out ,control
and she said ,control
 yes I'm here ,control
even_though the stepmother said ,control
 no no no we don't have anybody else ,control
and the envoy said ,control
 oh  well  then you must try it on ,control
and so she pulled out the slipper that was in her pocket that she'd been carrying ,control
and said ,control
 I think this matches ,control
and he slipped the other shoe on her foot ,control
and they both fit beautifully ,control
and he then took her back to the palace ,control
and they had a beautiful wedding ,control
and Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after laughs ,control
