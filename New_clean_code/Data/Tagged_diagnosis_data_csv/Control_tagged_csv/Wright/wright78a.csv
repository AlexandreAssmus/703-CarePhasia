to make a tp peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients ,control
inhales that would include two slices of bread ,control
lips_smack or one slice that you'd fold in half ,control
inhales peanut butter and jelly ,control
with butter or margarine being optional ,control
depending upon the individual's taste ,control
inhales let's assume that you have two slices of bread ,control
lips_smack inhales you then hafta make a decision as to whether or not you're going to,control
or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly ,control
inhales some people prefer tha to put the peanut butter on the bread first inhales because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth ,control
inhales so   trying to satisfy as many people as possible inhales we're going to take a knife ,control
and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread ,control
one slice or two ,control
depending upon how much you wanna fill the bread ,control
inhales and then we'll put the jelly on top of the peanut butter ,control
put the two pieces of bread together ,control
and you are finished ,control

but  the little girl remembered what she had learned at kindergarten ,control
 if there's a big big problem all you needta do is to push nineoneone on the telephone ,control

lips_smack I have  been fortunate to have had excellent health ,control
um I have not been hospitalized since having my tonsils out when I was in fourth grade ,control
um I do remember that ,control
and uh know most people remember the great difficulty of swallowing ,control
what I remember was the inhales aftertaste of the ether that was used for anesthetic in those days ,control
and the um nightmares that were prompted because of the anesthetic ,control
with inhales recurring dreams about giant pythons and jungle creatures ,control
but lips_smack inhales other_than that uh  my life has been pretty free of uh physical difficulties ,control
 um exhales head,control
nothing prolonged ,control
inhales um exhales probably the first thing that I  came to mind was inhales um maybe seeing our son when he was maybe four or five years old inhales go down a f,control
inhales and uh hitting a cement floor on the  uh on  on  on the bottom ,control
that kind_of stopped our hearts momentarily ,control
but uh inhales both of us were  um trained in rescue procedures ,control
and so therefore we didn't particularly panic ,control
we just uh inhales dealt with him by the prescribed manna manner fr we learned from our emergency medical services training ,control
and it all turned out well ,control
but it was quite frightening at the moment ,control
lips_smack inhales my experience has been very very limited with that ,control
being that uh inhales we've not had people in our family who have been physically challenged ,control
and in our acquaintance  uh group most of them are been very very healthy ,control
inhales I do have one rather  humorous incident of uh inhales a good friend of mine who had uh a slight stroke ,control
and uh  lips_smack complained about it that his uh inhales his mind was going a thousand miles an hour as usual but his mouth only went about twenty five ,control
and he was very frustrated about that ,control
inhales um this story lips_smack takes place in Arizona ,control
uh during the monsoon season ,control
in which um inhales one of Arizona's drivers um did not heed the warning signs about ,control
 do not enter inhales uh when flooded ,control
and drove her car down into a low area ,control
inhales and found that her car was quickly filling up with water ,control
that the motor had conked out ,control
and that um the  um the car was actually being pushed off the road ,control
inhales she was uh eventually req forced to crawl out the window and crawl up to the top of the car ,control
and try to  uh to wait there until some help would be arrive ,control
uh she did have her cellphone with her ,control
was able to call nineoneone ,control
inhales and the sheriff's department dispatched uh both their helicopter and the inhales paramedics and rescue s squad crew ,control
uh the  the car eventually from the force  great force of the water inhales was tipped over onto its side ,control
and  and the lady in distress was washed down the uh fast flowing stream ,control
inhales where she caught on to uh a branch ,control
and eventually uh h hung and clung on to the branch until such time as a helicopter ,control
which was hovering overhead ,control
inhales was able to lower inhales one of the um lips_smack paramedic technicians inhales by rope uh down uh to be able to uh rescue her ,control
inhales and to retrieve her back to safety ,control
inhales um her life was saved ,control
even_though she put the paramedics into great danger ,control
uh the car was lost ,control
and she paid her ten thousand dollar fine for dispatching the f helicopter ,control
inhales um exhales Billy liked his new soccer ball ,control
which he had just gotten for his birthday ,control
inhales and he was practicing kicking it ,control
inhales when the ball slipped off the side of his foot and went right through the picture window of his neighbor's house ,control
inhales and landed in the lap of his neighbor ,control
lips_smack knocking over the lamp shade ,control
inhales and breaking the window ,control
lips_smack inhales his neighbor ,control
who was the soccer coach ,control
inhales would probably have been more angry ,control
but he knew about the skill and he knew that accidents happen ,control
inhales so,control
 inhales you_know I think what we needta do is to be able to fix your directional kicking ,control
inhales and so they went to the playground ,control
inhales and to the ball field ,control
inhales and the c coach soccer gave some direction to the ball player ,control
and it all turned out well ,control
how's that for a positive spin ,control
sighs a mother was reminding her son that it was uh ,control
 inhales the weather forecast looked like it was going to be rain today ,control
and she handed her son an umbrella ,control
lips_smack um lips_smack and he said ,control
 no no no ,control
 it won't rain today ,control
 and I don't wanna ,control
 that's really twinkie ,control
 and  inhales and I don't wanna have my friends laughing at me for carrying an umbrella ,control
so  off he went to school with his backpack on ,control
inhales and he got halfway there almost inhales when it started to pour rain ,control
and he didn't wanna go to school ,control
inhales and he didn't wanna face his mom ,control
so  he hadta choose between two bad choices ,control
lips_smack and he returned home ,control
inhales where he changed clothes ,control
inhales mom handed him his umbrella ,control
and off he went to school ,control
on his second trip that day ,control
but was late ,control
tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can ,control
lips_smack inhales um exhales there was a  exhales lips_smack  man and a woman got married ,control
and uh the woman had two little girls  young girls inhales by her first marriage ,control
and the man had inhales a little girl by his first marriage ,control
and so they combined their families ,control
inhales and um  the two stepsisters I think  were uh not very  nice to the new stepsister ,control
um and they were a_little older ,control
and they ordered her around ,control
and  inhales and they were really really mean to her ,control
so  she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her inhales new stepsisters or siblings ,control
inhales um in the land that they lived there was a  and they  gr and the girls grew up and  to become young ladies ,control
and  with Cinderella virtually becoming the  uh the personal servant of her two stepsisters ,control
inhales uh in the land that they lived there was a  inhales a king ,control
who  who had a son ,control
who would take his place ,control
but the king was concerned that his son uh inhales was unmarried ,control
and they needed to socialize ,control
and decided that they would uh inhales have a ball ,control
in which they would invite all the young  eligible young ladies in the inhales kingdom to come and to enjoy a  inhales a marvelous ball at the royal palace ,control
inhales and the invitation came in the mail ,control
and uh the two seps stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to uh inhales um go to the ball and dance and maybe find the  the young prince to be of interest ,control
inhales but they um planned and schemed that Cinderella inhales would not be allowed to attend and  and uh  was excluded ,control
and uh when it came time to leave for the ball Cinderella was left behind ,control
but was um  visited by a   a  a fairy prince ,control
inhales who uh knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella ,control
inhales said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella ,control
and inhales turned her into this beautiful young lady ,control
and inhales provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin ,control
inhales um  and told her that she wud ,control
which she did but that she hadta leave ,control
inhales and be home by midnight ,control
at which time  she would be re restored to her   her normal self ,control
inhales so  Cinderella went to the ball ,control
and inhales much to the chagrin of the stepsisters and the other young ladies in attendance ,control
inhales was immediately noticed by the prince ,control
who was captivated by her ,control
and inhales the prince and Cinderella danced and danced ,control
inhales until almost the stroke of twelve when Cinderella remembered inhales that she hadta back into th her pumpkin coach ,control
and inhales ran ah out_of the palace ,control
and jumped into her pumpkin coach to return to her home ,control
but inhales in her haste one of her  slippers that I think  was made of glass or something would  had fallen off ,control
and uh she returned home ,control
well  inhales the prince who was in hot pursuit ,control
inhales was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin ,control
lips_smack drawn by these horses ,control
inhales but did find the slipper ,control
and um commanded his  uh  his helpers to search throughout the realm for inhales um a young lady that's foot would fit in that uh slipper ,control
and so the h,control
and eventually came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters ,control
inhales and try as they may the stepsisters inhales could not  put their large uh feet into the glass s,control
but the  lips_smack uh the attendant tried the glass slipper on Cinderella ,control
inhales and Cinderella's foot fit perfectly ,control
inhales and so the attendant knew that Cinderella was the inhales the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball ,control
inhales and took her with him back to the  inhales back to the royal palace ,control
uh where she and the inhales prince were united ,control
and became a couple ,control
and were married ,control
and lived happily ever after shrugs ,control
or something like that ,control
