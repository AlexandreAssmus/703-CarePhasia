uh well  it's birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old ,control
and uh maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite out_of cake which he obviously knew he wasn't sposta do because he's hiding under the couch ,control
and the boy's crying ,control
and the mother is waving the uh broom threateningly ,control
and the guests are looking a_little startled ,control
and that's the end of that ,control
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich ,control
get  hafta get two pieces of bread ,control
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top ,control
and put them together ,control
well  this is fairly minor but many years ago I was  uh when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was uh w cleaning a glass ,control
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand ,control
and uh it  it started to bleed all over the place ,control
but I was also pregnant at the time ,control
and I don't know if that had something to do with it ,control
but I had this weirdest feeling ,control
and my husband came in and I just passed out ,control
it was the first and last and only time I've ever done that ,control
I guess the most  the time  the  ti most of the instances I've had with people that have trouble communicating it's usually more of a language barrier ,control
uh I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man um who had a stutter ,control
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too ,control
but you_know I found it so hard to  to talk to him that uh I tended to avoid him in a way ,control
uh so  I can't say that I really  other_than saying hi Julio how are you I never really went much beyond that ,control
and plus at the time I couldn't excuse me  I couldn't hear well ,control
so  I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway ,control
so ,control
that's about it ,control
one time I was just m moseying down the street in a car and uh was preparing to turn left ,control
and I thought I had my signal on ,control
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough ,control
but then somebody else who I don't even know where he came from I think he was walking out_of the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done ,control
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something ,control
laughs thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didn't  you_know wasn't upset ,control
he just said ,control
 oh  I ran into you ,control
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness ,control
oh apparently uh this girl has fallen into some water that's  maybe there's a flood or a storm ,control
and a man uh is trying to rescue her ,control
apparently she's been holding onto a tree branch ,control
and he's trying to get a hold of her ,control
but she won't let go of the tree branch probably ,control
about all I can say ,control
well  hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window ,control
it's really improbable ,control
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp ,control
um but uh obviously the boy has ran away because the man can't see him when he goes in at the window ,control
this is kind_of improbable too ,control
the mother wants to give the  the boy an  an umbrella ,control
he doesn't want it ,control
so  he goes off and gets wet ,control
um this is the improbable part ,control
he doesn't like getting wet ,control
he runs back to his mom who's mad ,control
and he's wet so he takes the umbrella ,control
now my son would love getting wet ,control
um laughs looking at that I can hear the music laughs from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old ,control
um Cinderella uh is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother ,control
uh wicked and stepmother always go together ,control
she has two ugly  sist two ug ugly stepsisters ,control
I can't remember their names ,control
one of them is Drizella or something equally ugly ,control
um anyway uh Cinderella is forced  forced to work like a drudge for the  the rest of the family who are cruel to her ,control
um but an edict comes from the uh ,control
I think I'm spinning tales here ,control
an edict comes from the prince that they're going to have a ball ,control
and every maiden is uh eligible to go to the ball ,control
uh but Cinderella's mother  stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready ,control
uh and at last the girls drive away uh in their carriage and Cinderella's left behind um crying in the cinders ,control
um then the little mice come to her aid and start uh ,control
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working ,control
um and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because uh yeah they didn't want her to go ,control
so  then the fairy godmother enters the picture ,control
um this is not in sequence at all ,control
laughs um and of_course she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the  the pumpkin carriage ,control
laughs oh yeah ,control
and she goes off to the ball where of_course she is the bell of the ball meets the prince ,control
the prince falls in love with her on sight ,control
but at twelve o'clock she hasta run off ,control
she leaves her slipper ,control
um I guess that story goes all the way to the end ,control
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the  the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper ,control
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they don't fit ,control
so  he find  m,control
here's one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree ,control
and then this uh the  the father has climbed up to rescue the cat ,control
and now he needs to be rescued ,control
for some reason  the ladder is on the ground ,control
and nobody has put it up there ,control
so  here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad ,control
that's all ,control
