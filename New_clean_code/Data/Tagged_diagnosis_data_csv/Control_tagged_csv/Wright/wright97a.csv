so  little Amina went outside to play with her cat ,control
and her cat  got excited and scared because the dog started to chase it ,control
which is what the neighbor's dog always does ,control
his very annoying dog ,control
and the neighbors just don't keep it in his yard like they're sposta ,control
and so the cat ran up the tree ,control
but it got stuck because it went ges,control
and Amina's father came and said ,control
 no problem ,control
 I'll go up ,control
 I'll rescue the cat ,control
and he climbed up ,control
but then the ladder fell over ,control
and he got stuck ,control
so  then the neighbors even_though they're very bad with their dog they were also very kind neighbors ,control
and they noticed he was stuck in the tree ,control
and they called the fire department which is kind_of an overreaction because they could've just fixed the ladder themselves ,control
and the  c and the bird was singing very contentedly over this entire scene ,control
the end ,control
um,control
I did um trail riding recreational trail riding on horses in Northern_California in college and most weekends ,control
and I went out um with the other riders ,control
and I actually fell off the horse and got a concussion ,control
and in the midst of that um got back up onto the horse ,control
fell ,control
I_mean very tall horse actually ,control
Quasar was like sixteen hands or something ,control
and fell right ges,control
I lost consciousness for a few minutes ,control
and then when I came back to the college campus I went to the health clinic ,control
and they sent me to the hospital to get a cat ,control
and they kept me overnight ,control
um I remember  I remember one of the girls at the end of the hall ,control
I think it was like Thanksgiving weekend or something ,control
it was some holiday weekend ,control
there weren't a_lot_of people around ,control
and so Katie of all people happened to be around ,control
not a close friend but someone I knew ,control
and she was so nice ,control
she took me  to the hospital ,control
and it was the emergency room ,control
and it was just like crowded ,control
and I think it was maybe even a Saturday night ,control
and there were police bringing in like people with  ges cocaine in their stomachs ,control
I_mean it was an interesting ,control
it was like one of those like tv movie situations where there are all these things going on ges ,control
I think there was like some ges gunshot wound  you_know ,control
and here I am just sitting here with like points,control
and they needed to keep me overnight ,control
they did the cat ,control
um they kept me overnight ,control
I remember I just really really wanted to go home and take a shower ,control
and the person I was sharing a room with I think  was having some sort of family difficulty ,control
or she was very unhappy and possibly very sick or in pain or something ,control
and so she was having a hard time and ,control
I remember that my friends came the next day to pick me up ,control
and uh they forgot to bring clothes with them ,control
so  I was wearing a hospital gown with a  a ges,control
um basically um that's the time I was in the hospital laughs ,control
uh certainly ,control
I'm going to recall  yeah ,control
frightened or scared  whispering ,control
oh slaps,control
um last spring right before summer vacation I was laughs in my house  small apartment uh complex  small apartment just doing some schoolwork or something ,control
and I suddenly started hearing this imit,control
um and I,control
and I went into the kitchen ,control
and I notice there's a bee in my  inside my house which I don't understand how ,control
covers,control
because it's absolutely closed all the time ,control
screens on the window ,control
there's no way ,control
so  I thought that was odd  you_know trying to get out the window ,control
and I captured it ,control
and I put it outside ,control
and I noticed there were some bees flying around outside ,control
ges,control
I go into the bathroom ,control
and my bathroom  my shower stall has been invaded by about fifty bees ,control
I'm telling you it was like a horror movie ,control
it was the sound of ges imit,control
yes points,control
and I'm not overly phobic of bees ,control
I like them in their place ,control
I'm not like someone who runs away from them ,control
but a_lot_of them in my house in my bathroom ,control
and that feeling of going in ,control
and it was like a horror movie like imit,control
so  ges,control
ges,control
ges and they're all trying to get out the window which was good ,control
they were focused on the window ,control
so  yeah I  I freaked ,control
um I,control
I actually got a dirty towel and like ges,control
because you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes ,control
and uh gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying ,control
 um you needta get here now ,control
 we needta figure this out ,control
 what's going on ,control
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole ges,control
they were looking for a new um place to start a hive ,control
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting ,control
we hadta get someone um ,control
you_know  were they going in everywhere ,control
how were they getting in ,control
they hadta call a bee expert ,control
so then  but yeah that was a freaky moment ,control
and I was very creeped out ,control
I remember going into my closet and like ges,control
and I_mean ges they were very focused on the windows ,control
but it was a_little creepy to think that like it might be ges,control
points,control
ges,control
that was creepy uh for sure ,control
you_know  and the bathroom is the last place you need anything ,control
yeah  you're vulnerable enough ,control
let's be honest ,control
like you just don't need anything coming at you with a stinger ,control
so  yes that was  that was  that was scary ,control
certainly ,control
sighs I'm trying to think of specific examples in the moment  whispering ,control
it's interesting  whispering ,control
um  um I'm trying to think of,control
certainly while teaching um sometimes having students  particular students who really are struggling ,control
and you feel like there's not clear communication ,control
it's not uh a coherent reason for why it's not working and a resolution kind of thing ,control
and you're struggling to understand ,control
um certainly sending emails to find out ,control
taking a moment saying ,control
 I wanna talk with you ,control
 I'm feeling you_know this  this is  this is  these are my concerns ,control
 um how can I better support you,control
 is there anything going on that you wish to share with me ,control
like those  ges trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy um and whatever they'd be interested in ,control
asking them ,control
you_know  I think it really helps to just start with you_know ,control
 these are my concerns ,control
i_e missing work or behavior in class or something like that ,control
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of ges where to go next um with that ,control
I'm trying to think ,control
I've had  I've had some really difficult situations with students of you_know basically just really disagreeing over the  the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences ,control
and um oh I'm trying to think specifically ,control
I_mean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because  then it's not just ges you and the other person ,control
um ges,control
is it just in this situation ,control
or is it a broader picture ges uh problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers ,control
and shrugs those are things I can think of ,control
mhm ,control
hm ,control
one day after schoo,control
and he did an amazing kick that kicked so well that the ball went all the way through  the window of his house and right into his dad's lap ,control
his dad was very surprised and went to the window and looked out to see where the ball had come from ,control
the end ,control
mhm ,control
 one morning this little boy was going to school ,control
and his mother was saying ,control
 you should really take your umbrella ,control
and he was saying ,control
 no no no waves,control
 I don't want it ,control
 I don't believe in umbrellas ,control
so  he left ,control
he said ,control
 goodbye  Mom ,control
and he started walking out the door ,control
and then lo_and_behold it started to rain a few drops ,control
he put his hands out hand,control
and all_of_a_sudden a_lot came down ,control
he was covering his  head excuse me  and running back to the house ,control
he was all wet ,control
he went into the house and he was soaking wet ,control
his mother was very displeased because she ,control
and this was something they were working on ,control
his ability to listen to her and accept her direction ,control
long term goal ,control
and then he took the umbrella and started walking back to school ,control
and it was okay because the umbrella kept him from getting rained on ,control
the end ,control
okay ,control
so  slaps,control
and she loved her father very much ,control
but her mother died ,control
so  her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl ,control
her name was Cinderella ,control
this woman came with two daughters ,control
but they were unpleasant ,control
and they were ugly ,control
we hafta be honest ,control
they were very ugly ,control
so  there's a great deal of stress after Cinderella's father,control
she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters ,control
and they useta make her clean fingers,control
and they useta make her cook fingers,control
and they were very mean to her,control
and they made her live in the attic fingers,control
and they made her wear ug old ugly clothes fingers,control
but she was very very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative ,control
and she befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds ,control
and when she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of Fantasialand ,control
and laughs so she useta dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress  a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown ,control
but she never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear ,control
and they always said to her ,control
 you'll never go to the ball ,control
 you'll never go the palace ,control
so  one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big  a very big dance because the king was slaps,control
seriously ,control
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men ,control
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day he's going to be the king ,control
and he needed to have children ,control
and he needed to have a wife ,control
so  they were gonna have a big ball ,control
so  they were having a ball ,control
and Cinderella's ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go ,control
and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes ,control
and Cinderella really really wanted to go ,control
she was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go ,control
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds ,control
and they knew how to sew ,control
and they knew how to accessorize ,control
and they knew how to design dresses apparently ,control
so  they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella ,control
and she was so surprised and so excited ,control
I wonder what was next  whispering ,control
then she,control
and at the ball she met the prince ,control
and it was just love at first sight ,control
the way it should be ,control
he loved her and she loved him ,control
and they had a wonderful time dancing ,control
and  then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there ,control
and they were pulling her dress ,control
and they were tearing her scarves ,control
and they chased her away and made her go home ,control
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry ,control
and so he sent out a message to ges,control
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry ,control
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper ,control
so  the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out ,control
and then the prince did find her ,control
and then they got married ,control
and then the king was happy ,control
and we don't really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters ,control
the end ,control
