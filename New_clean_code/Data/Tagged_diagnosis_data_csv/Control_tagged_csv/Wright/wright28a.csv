this is a story about a birthday party gone awry ,control
here was a beautiful birthday cake with candles on it ,control
and the neighbors were invited over with their children for Tommy's birthday ,control
apparently he was four years old ,control
there were four candles on the cake ,control
but Tommy's dog saw the cake unattended and took a big hunk out_of it ,control
and then he ran underneath the sofa to hide from the mom who got very angry and had her broom out and was gonna beat the dog with the broom for chewing up the cake ,control
in the meantime all the guests were arriving ,control
there was a little boy guest with a  present and a little girl guest with the present and their moms ,control
and they were seeing the whole event unfold as they approached the room for the birthday party ,control
the end ,control
the boy was crying ,control
he wasn't very happy on his birthday ,control
in order  you take out your bread ,control
you lay out your two pieces of bread ,control
you can put your jelly on one piece and your peanut butter on the other ,control
flop them together ,control
slice them ,control
and voila you have your peanut butter and beh jelly sandwich ,control
um I had a gallbladder attack on my um twentieth wedding anniversary ,control
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs ,control
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown uh gallbladder attack which is very very painful ,control
and so I went to the hospital ,control
I was beginning to turn green ,control
and um I had the surgery done ,control
I was in the hospital about three days ,control
that's before they did it with any kind of scopes ,control
you_know  they did a regular open laparotomy ,control
so  um ,control
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work ,control
so  um I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure ,control
and then once it's over you feel a_lot better that's for sure ,control
okay  the problems are word finding and the ability to speak ,control
uh my mother's disability is apraxia aphasia ,control
and so she sometimes uses different words um to try to get her point across ,control
what I do is I offer her extra time ,control
sometimes extra processing time helps ,control
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the is it this and touch ,control
if it's an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever ,control
um sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a_little better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it ,control
and then because we live with each other and we're together so much I can kind_of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs ,control
like today with  th I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring ,control
and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card ,control
so  for the most part I can kind_of guess so ,control
uh a little bit like Vanna_White ,control
is it this ,control
is it that ,control
does it begin with the letter ,control
sometimes beginning letters help ,control
so  that's how we work it out ,control
um my husband and I were in Washington_D_C doing some sightseeing ,control
and it turned  when we came off a  a boat trip it  it got a little darker ,control
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel ,control
and so we were walking along ,control
and it went  was pretty isolated street ,control
there wasn't a_lot_of people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station ,control
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us you_know maybe twenty yards back ,control
and it was three young kids  d uh three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough ,control
and so I was very  I  I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing ,control
and my husband said if they come after us I'm gonna take laughs the  the movie camera ,control
and I'll hit em ,control
and you run like hell ,control
laughs so  we were picking up the pace ,control
as we picked up the pace they picked up the pace ,control
and as we turned the corner there was a bus station ,control
and people were waiting there ,control
so  we were just so grateful to see other people ,control
and they backed off ,control
and they left us alone ,control
so  I think it was a  could've been a robbery you_know ,control
and that's it ,control
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldn't ,control
and this lady was driving her s_u_v thinking she could get through the wash ,control
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along ,control
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her ,control
and so it appears as though the  he's strapped  he's got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot ,control
he's uh holding onto a branch that's hanging into the rushing water ,control
and he is attempting the rescue ,control
no  I'm not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but I'm assuming that's the belt for helping her ,control
I don't know ,control
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer ,control
so  he's kicking a soccer ball down the neighborhood street and inadvertently kicks the wrong way and hits a bi,control
and the soccer ball goes through the neighbor's picture window ,control
goes through the window ,control
knocks over the lamp ,control
scares the neighbor ,control
the neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it ,control
and he's got the  soccer ball in his hand but he can't seem to find who kicked it ,control
but I'll bet ya ,control
the end ,control
well  it's time for Joey to go to school ,control
and his mom said ,control
 you_know Joey I looked out the window ,control
 it looks like in the  looks like it might rain today ,control
 and the weathermen said that rain could be coming today ,control
 oh ,control
he said ,control
 no Ma,control
 I don't wanna take that umbrella ,control
 only sissies carry umbrellas ,control
 not kids like me ,control
 I'm not gonna take that umbrella ,control
 and I don't think it's gonna rain anyway ,control
well  there he goes out ,control
and what's happening but his mom was right ,control
it starts to rain ,control
first just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder ,control
and the puddles are deep ,control
and when he comes home he is soaked to the skin ,control
his mother is very angry with him because sh he did not listen to her and take the umbrella ,control
so  the next time that this occurs and there's rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry ,control
that was a lesson learned ,control
hmhm,control
Cinderella's mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls her stepmother and her stepsisters ,control
as time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls ,control
and she is very cruel to Cinderella ,control
she uses her as a servant ,control
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning ,control
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along ,control
and uh the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals um were not treated as well ,control
but Cinderella loved them all ,control
and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice ,control
and  um and they all loved her ,control
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle ,control
um in the castle there was a wonderful prince handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married ,control
and the prince's servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife ,control
and so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball ,control
and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery ,control
and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time ,control
well  the stepmother got the invitation ,control
she only considered her daughters and she didn't consider sa Cinderella at all ,control
so  she got the  her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery ,control
and they were ugly stepsisters ,control
and Cinderella made her own dress ,control
and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress ,control
and when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball that they are gonna go to the ball but she is not ,control
so  she was put into  locked into a uh room ,control
and she was visited by the um fairy godmother ,control
and the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the  the ball ,control
so  the fairy godmother um with her magic bitty  bippety_boppety_boo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown ,control
and out_of a pumpkin she made a carriage ,control
and out_of the mice she made horsemen  um horses to carry uh the carriage to the palace ,control
and she was dressed in her  the most beautiful woman in the  in the land ,control
but she did have a stipulation ,control
she said that uh she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear ,control
so  she went to the ball ,control
and she was the bell of the ball ,control
and she caught the eye of the prince ,control
and the prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters ,control
so  she danced the night away ,control
and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes ,control
and she knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the  the night would disappear at that time ,control
so  she ran from the prince ,control
and as she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps ,control
and she ran and she ran ,control
and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night ,control
the pumpkin returned to its former self ,control
and  and the animals were no longer horses ,control
and everything returned to theirselves  to what they were ,control
when she returned home the um stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the   the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace ,control
and they would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper ,control
so  the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it didn't work ,control
and they  a mouse brought her the key  Cinderella the key ,control
she got out_of the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on ,control
she tried it on ,control
it was a fit ,control
and the prince then designated her as his princess ,control
and they got married and lived happily ever after ,control
we have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard ,control
but we also have a kitty_cat who loves  to go up the tree ,control
and the kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and couldn't get down ,control
so  dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all ,control
it appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree ,control
he then took a ladder dad did ,control
put it up against the tree to climb and get the cat ,control
but the ladder fell down ,control
so  after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree ,control
the fire department not police department laughs ,control
and there's also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree ,control
that's it ,control
