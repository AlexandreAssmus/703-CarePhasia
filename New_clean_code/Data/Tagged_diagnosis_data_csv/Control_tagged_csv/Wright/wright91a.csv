okay ,control
first of all I pull out the bread ,control
then I hafta go in the cupboard and get the peanut butter,control
and we keep our jelly in the refrigerator ,control
so  I hafta open up the refrigerator pull out the  jelly ,control
spread the peanut butter onto the one slice of the bread ,control
uh actually I like a_lot_of peanut butter ,control
so  I usually would put it on both slices of the bread ,control
and then just put the jelly in the center of it ,control
and close it up ,control
put the bread away into the cupboard ,control
and put the other items away of_course ,control
yeah ,control
the uh family pet  the girl's pet which is a cat got stuck up in a tree ,control
the father tells his uh daughter that he will get the cat down out of the tree ,control
climbs up into the tree ,control
and uh the  loses the ladder that he got up into the tree ,control
so  now the cat and the father are both stuck up in the tree ,control
the dog is of_course barking and barking ,control
but uh that's just to laughs see what's going on ,control
because the dog probably is the one that chased the cat up in the tree to begin with ,control
and then uh somebody called the fire department of_course to get everybody out_of the tree ,control
I got  uh I  head,control
I have a back problem ,control
I guess that's my worst problem right now ,control
and um I uh have pains points,control
and I have uh appointment with the uh neurosurgeon in March to see what it's all about ,control
but they think what it is it's a pinched nerve points,control
I have hand,control
and uh I have bone spurs and things like that up there ,control
so  I'm sure they probably are gonna be doing a surgery of some sort ,control
because I  right now I hafta take pain pills to get to sleep at night ,control
that's my only problem ,control
it doesn't bother me too much in the day time ,control
because it's not that great of pain ,control
I can  I can uh deal with it ,control
just at night I can't ges,control
because it hurts too much ,control
uh the pain does ,control
so  I hafta take a pain pill right now at night ,control
which I don't like to do ,control
because I don't really like to take uh any kind of pills ,control
the only any kind of pills I take at all are for high cholesterol ,control
but  uh so  I don't like that at all ,control
but um I do take those at night ,control
so  I can least sleep halfway decent ,control
and  uh but that's about all ,control
I don't really  I been  ges,control
 I've been  uh been fortunate basically uh throughout my life ,control
uh I never smoked and  and um only really drink at like Christmas and special occasions  and stuff like that ,control
so  I didn't drink a_lot ,control
the reason I don't do that is because my mother died from drinking ,control
and uh my father was German ,control
so  he drank a_lot ,control
so  maybe that's why I don't drink ,control
but uh uh uh so I been living a healthy life ,control
and um you_know I just head,control
sorry ,control
laughs ,control
yeah ,control
I was the  uz the other night ,control
um  ,control
okay ,control
for the first time in my life um uh we went out to eat in_fact at Ihop points right over here ,control
uh because I didn't pull out anything for dinner ,control
and um so we decided to go and eat at Ihop ,control
we went over there ,control
and  and uh oh it was about  it wasn't too late ,control
it was about four thirty in the afternoon ,control
lips_smack uh I have a thing where I don't eat anything  anything with sugar in it uh like snacks or anything after six or seven o'clock ,control
because I found out for whatever reason I wake up in the next morning with a headache if I  if I have sugars in the evening ,control
but anyways we had  I  uh we ha both had a cup of cocoa ,control
and then I just had a hamburger ,control
so  can't believe it was the hamburger ,control
so  we figured it was the cocoa ,control
but anyways uh came back ,control
lips_smack and I started feeling queasy in my stomach ,control
and  and um uh I just  just was like  I was  it  wa I was like having anxiety attack ,control
my whole uh stomach was going all over the place ,control
and we usually go to bed around ten o'clock ,control
so  I went to bed ,control
uh Donna stayed up uh read a book for awhile ,control
and I head,control
I couldn't ,control
I had  all_of_a_sudden I was sweating like a stuffed pig ,control
um  didn't seem like my heart was racing ,control
so  and don't think it was any kind of um an attack of any kind ,control
uh but I was sweating ,control
then all_of_a_sudden I pulled all the covers off ,control
and then I was cold ,control
and  and uh so I got up ,control
an,control
and uh w about one o'clock laughs in the morning finally finally uh went back to bed ,control
but in the meantime I was just head,control
and I was sick to my stomach ,control
and it was just a  head,control
but if I ever had one I think that would've been it ,control
uh and head,control
and of_course I went to sleep ,control
but I was scared ,control
because I was  uh I didn't think it was a heart attack or  I was having ,control
uh I just you_know  we just come to the conclusion it was just too much sugar or whatever it was  ,control
but it was so early in the evening ,control
we couldn't figure,control
but  I just couldn't figure out what else it was at ,control
but head,control
I just kept going over in my mind ,control
 oh  what  what if something happens ,control
or  whate I  maybe that was it ,control
and then I just  you_know I just  uh uh just uneasy ,control
 and uh it was bad ,control
it was bad ,control
but anyways  that was it ,control
um have you ever had any experience with people who have had a difficult time communicating ,control
 like talking ,control
you mean communicating ,control
 well uh only  only the experience of  of ,control
a friend of Donna's is  um um uh she's,control
and um so this was awhile ago when we first got here ,control
and so she made friends with her ,control
her name is uh Janine ,control
and she made friends with her ,control
and so she learned to do sign language ,control
be  so  she could communicate with her ,control
but I  of_course I don't ,control
it's too deep for me to learn ,control
so  I didn't learn it ,control
but anyway she did ,control
so  she can communicate ,control
but I would  um I went over there quite a bit to their house and everything ,control
and it was an experience because you hafta ,control
uh she could read lips as long as you talk ges directly to her ,control
lips_smack and so I went over there a_lot_of times because if she had problems with her uh uh computer I would help her out ,control
because I know quite a bit about computers ,control
and then uh if uh she had any problems ,control
like she had problems with her telephone company one time ,control
so   I called the telephone company for her ,control
because it's so hard for her to communicate with anybody ,control
because she hasta go through that TDY thing that you_know that  you have on the telephones ,control
but um that was quite an experience ,control
because uh you  you just  it's just not a normal thing ,control
because you hafta ges for sure ,control
you_know  you're so useta just taking to people ,control
 and you hafta get in the situation where you're always talking points in front of her ,control
 uh and this type of thing ,control
but it  it was a good experience ,control
and um I really enjoyed it ,control
and um you_know uh I guess got a_lot out_of it ,control
because you  you're so thankful then of uh head,control
and  and you don't  have things like that and everything else ,control
but uh anyways that was that ,control
looks to me like a couple uh go are  are uh tied up in a flood  rapids ,control
and uh they're washing them down stream probably ,control
he  they finally hung up on a tree ,control
and um he's got a belt around um ,control
I guess it must have came off of her because he's still got his belt on ,control
anyways  it uh looks like they  they got a belt tied around um  something ,control
and uh looks like uh hopefully they're looking up ,control
because uh hopefully the  uh uh the rescue people are in helicopter above them ,control
and are about to lower a line down ,control
and rescue these two people who are tied up in this situation ,control
this little boy's out uh playing with his uh soccer ball ,control
lips_smack and uh he kicks it  up in the air ,control
and lord behold it goes throu,control
um don't know laughs ,control
hopefully it's his parents window ,control
which would be a_lot better even_though it uh went through a window ,control
but anyways it goes through the window ,control
and  and lands in the living room where this uh man is sitting ,control
uh knocks over a lamp ,control
lips_smack uh the man gets up ,control
and looks out the window to see uh who threw the ball of_course ,control
um and uh hopefully he doesn't get too mad at the little boy that  kicked the ball through the window ,control
his mother  uh the little boy is gonna go  be going to school ,control
and the mother wants the boy to take an umbrella along ,control
because it's sposta be raining that day ,control
but of_course um most of the time the kids think they know it all ,control
and he says ,control
 no  Mom ,control
 I don't wanna take the umbrella ,control
 I'm alright ,control
sure enough on the way  to school it starts raining ,control
he hasta run back home ,control
of_course  by the time he gets home he,control
uh the mother is very  very angry at him of_course ,control
because he didn't  take the umbrella ,control
but all in all in the end the boy is happy now ,control
because he has the umbrella ,control
and he's dry again ,control
and it looks like with a,control
okay ,control
