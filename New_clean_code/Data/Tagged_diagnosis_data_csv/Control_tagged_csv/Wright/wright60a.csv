pretty easy ,control
well  you get the ingredients out ,control
you get the  the bread that you'd wanna use ,control
I would first inhales take a paper plate and uh  put the two uh slices of uh bread on the plate ,control
and then inhales either before or after I'd go get uh uh the jelly and the peanut butter ,control
and if they were already open they'd probably be in the refrigerator ,control
inhales and then I would take two knives because I don't wanna adulterate one or the other ,control
inhales and I would  uh I would probably put the butter on first ,control
and uh  I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly ,control
and inhales I would the  uh put the butter on the one side ,control
probably the right side just because it's  that's where it's at in my mind ,control
inhales and I would put it on evenly ,control
but I would put it on very  over the whole area ,control
not this area because I hate that ,control
an,control
inhales I'd probably use a_little less jelly than the  the peanut butter because I'd rather have more peanut butter ,control
inhales and then I would put the two  uh I would probably take the  uh in the left hand take the inhales one with the jelly and put it over the uh one with the peanut butter ,control
so  the two inhales uh surfaces that have stuff on it uh face each other ,control
and I would put them so the top of the loaf is where the  to you_know the top of the piece is where it has a w symmetrical ,control
inhales and then I would cut it in half probably this way hori uh horizontally ,control
inhales and then I would   know what I'd eat it ,control
I don't know if you wanna know that so c ,control
and at some point I'd  probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife  wouldn't yell at me ,control
looks like there is uh a kitty got up into uh uh the branch of a tree ,control
and uh it looks like the father uh climbed up on the tree with a ladder ,control
and somehow the ladder  fell down ,control
and the father is stuck in the tree ,control
inhales there's a girl up there uh reaching up for uh  probably her cat ,control
and there's a tricycle uh next to her ,control
and there's a ladder there that's inhales quite a ways from the tree ,control
so  I don't understand how it got that far away ,control
but  maybe it tipped over backwards ,control
inhales and then there's a dog probably their dog barking uh up the tree ,control
and you_know why I have no idea what dogs do ,control
inhales and then there's a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree ,control
and then lips_smack evidently somebody called a fire department ,control
and there's a firetruck ,control
and there's a couple fireman inhales carrying a ladder uh towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there ,control
but maybe it's not a good enough one ,control
and that's pretty much it ,control
so  evidently inhales the father uh climbed up the tree to get the cat out ,control
and inhales for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down ,control
and somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the uh fire department ,control
and inhales they're responding ,control
an,control
looks like it's low enough he can just jump down so ,control
the thing was is that uh  I never had a heart attack ,control
and  other_than having a very little uh  chest pain ,control
uh it was kind_of somewhat of a surprise so ,control
inhales I had  uh went and had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician ,control
and inhales he said that was alright ,control
which they don't show anything INV,control
so  now he suggested a stress echo ,control
so  I  inhales I had a stress echo ,control
and I went to it ,control
and  and I failed it ,control
you_know  I was kind_of shocked ,control
is  and I w was gonna do things afterwards ,control
and inhales I just called my wife ,control
and  and uh talked to her ,control
and then I went home ,control
and  lips_smack and then uh they did a uh cardiac catharization ,control
lips_smack and uh  between the first day and the second day uh they gave me nitroglycerine ,control
and then I just  didn't do anything because I didn't wanna have a heart attack INV,control
and I had a cardiac catharization ,control
and I didn't know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was inhales older and past his prime wouldn't have done anything if  if  if ,control
and he wouldn't even put it in a stent ,control
because  m which I wouldn't have used him if I would have known that ,control
inhales make a long story short I had three main,control
one was blocked a hundred percent ,control
 one was blocked ninety eight percent ,control
inhales and one was blocked eighty percent ,control
so  I was very fortunate that I didn't inhales either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that INV,control
and I had surgery ,control
and I had surgery by a  uh  a cardiac surgeon that was considered by uh  the nurses and people in general one of the better ones ,control
I went to Scottsdale_Healthcare_Osborn ,control
and before I went I called and asked them how many inhales uh procedures they did the previous year ,control
and based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance  you had a better success ,control
so  they were even better than inhales at Mayo ,control
th at the time Mayo was at uh  Scottsdale uh Shea ,control
and it was like oh three or four hours there ,control
I  to this day I don't know because what my wife told me inhales and w what she now says is different ,control
so  it d doesn't matter ,control
lips_smack and uh when I got done ,control
inhales uh it's  it's very intrusive ,control
you don't know what the INV,control
inhales and uh they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked laughs really bad ,control
but I was calm ,control
and well   my brother just had it a couple weeks  ago ,control
and his wife said he didn't look that bad ,control
so  I don't know what that means ,control
well  lips_smack when I saw my mob ,control
but she did  ver she recovered very g rapidly ,control
and she's still alive ,control
and that's about fifteen years ago ,control
inhales uh lips_smack and then I just remember that it  eh uh  it took a long time to recover ,control
and then one day I went to the  cardiologist and he said you_know ,control
 go back to work ,control
inhales which  when I went back to work I had problems because it really was too soon ,control
I should have said you_know ,control
 well  I'm not really ready ,control
and uh my wife has always said that uh after that I acted like an old man ,control
I was  I was fifty five at the time ,control
that must have been ten years ago ,control
inhales and uh the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems ,control
inhales and uh I would go from one room to the other to find out  to get something ,control
by the time I got there I forgot  that ,control
inhales and they said that uh that was uh go away in six months ,control
it never did ,control
inhales uh I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long ,control
and inhales at that time they didn't have a filter in there that filters out the  little particles or whatever that causes your problem ,control
inhales and uh I've never really been the same since then ,control
and uh you_know that's the  pretty much the end of the thing  ,control
the story ,control
 n no  no  I had a little chest pain when I was at work when I walked from the  the place I worked into the washroom ,control
and inhales one day it  it was a l very very little right here ,control
and uh just to be on the safe side you_know the other pharmacist said you_know ,control
 oh  you should call your doctor ,control
like I got in right away ,control
 and the e_k_g it was like on a Friday ,control
an,control
the c cardiac INV,control
and inhales Thursday I have the surgery ,control
so  and INV,control
 yeah  well  well  I ,control
 ninety eight and eighty  ou INV,control
but the thing was they did five bypasses ,control
and they took out ,control
both of what they identified as a stroke ,control
and  and they  it was very difficult to communicate with them ,control
uh I had an aunt that had  uh was very old ,control
in the nineties and had Alzheimer's ,control
and  and she didn't even know  INV,control
she was a inhales aunt that was very near and  dear to me ,control
and uh  uh was always very nice ,control
that's probably my favorite aunt so  ,control
and uh sometimes I have problems communicating with my wife ,control
b we both don't hear that well ,control
and  we'd t start talking and walk away ,control
and  and uh a_lot_of people if you pay attention they just s s speak a_lot ,control
like my  I've got a son that is an engineer ,control
and  I think he's just stressed out from work because he's overworked ,control
and he's  they're pushing him into management ,control
and  he  for a young guy that's really pretty sharp ,control
all my kids are pretty sharp ,control
he  he misspeaks INV,control
so ,control
hm,control
 wow  yeah  like in adulthood or child or what ,control
 okay  I'll  g I can INV,control
um I was probably,control
you could figure it out ,control
I was in  like in  in junior high ,control
not  yeah  junior high ,control
that's like seven and eighth grade ,control
 okay ,control
I don't know if that's the right term ,control
and it was like eighth grade ,control
inhales and uh we were moving from one location to another because my dad's inhales uh place of employment uh moved ,control
and uh  we were uh carrying some stuff on a  a big long trailer that he was pulling with his uh nineteen fifty five uh Buick ,control
inhales and it was a rented U_haul ,control
and we were driving down the  two lane highway and uh ,control
probably going about forty forty five ,control
 and all_of_a_sudden inhales something happened ,control
I didn't know what happened at the time ,control
but subsequently I found out that inhales uh one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch inhales ,control
because it was put in upside down ,control
it came aw undone and it fell out ,control
and because of that inhales it  uh the trailer caused the car to go like this ,control
 and uh the car was going like this ,control
and I had a big inhales round mirror that was above the dresser ,control
and I had it in my  in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side ,control
inhales because uh  you_know so it didn't get broken ,control
 and the car whipped around ,control
an,control
and to make a long story short ,control
inhales the trailer caused the car to spin all the way around ,control
and the end of the trailer hit a big tree that was literally that big in diameter ,control
and damaged the trailer ,control
and the tree a little bit ,control
inhales and if he uh woulda ,control
and  and uh  then I remember getting out_of the car with my dad ,control
and looking at the inhales uh trailer and all that ,control
and that was pretty i ,control
and then you_know it wasn't  it didn't take a long time for all this to happen ,control
but that kind_of sticks in my memory ,control
it  you_know that  inhales uh you_know for the m grace of God ,control
or  or uh my dad's ability or something ,control
other_than having a damaged trailer ,control
and I don't know  inhales can't remember if he hadta pay for it or it was covered under insurance or,control
but uh the mirror was not broken ,control
and inhales I don't think m anything or much was damaged ,control
and it was very  but it was li big long trailer ,control
uh a double  tandem you_know ,control
tandem  ,control
two wheels ,control
so  that was  that was  I don't know if that was real scary but it  it certainly left an impression on me so ,control
 well  looks like there's a,control
oh,control
okay ,control
I didn't get what this was to begin with ,control
okay ,control
uh looks like there was a young  girl ,control
or maybe a young woman ,control
I don't know ,control
probably in the teens or maybe oh  I can't tell  really tell the age ,control
inhales looks like that uh she was in a  uh an area where there was uh  rocky or stony or inhales cliff type things ,control
and she evidently fell in the  into the xxx ,control
it looks like xxx on the bot ,control
I can't really see that xxx ,control
it's not that good a picture ,control
and she evidently got  uh fell in ,control
and she ha hanged onto a  uh a dead tree's uh branch out_of the rocks ,control
inhales and looks like there's probably some man ,control
by the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person ,control
uh in a red uh lifejacket ,control
and he's got a belt that inhales I don't know if that's connected to a rope or not ,control
I can't really see that ,control
lips_smack you_know looks like that the ,control
oh  I see what it is ,control
he's got a belt he's gonna pu probably put around her ,control
okay  I didn't see that ,control
similar to his ,control
inhales and it looks like he's just got to the point where he's up by next to her and he's gonna inhales when he gets a chance put the belt around the uh girl and rescue her ,control
uh  probably uh paramedics or police ,control
and  looks like he's in well shape ,control
he's got a  a gigantic bicept ,control
inhales and the girl doesn't look really that  she looks a little  scared ,control
I_mean she looks a_little  shocked out too or something ,control
so  inhales I would assume it had a happy ending ,control
so  I  I don't know about that ,control
well there's   inhales well there's a boy playing with a  I guess that's a soccer ball ,control
when  there little different sections ,control
inhales and he's in a  probably a grassy area with some shrubs behind him ,control
and he's got a baseball cap on ,control
and he  kicks it and it  appears to go through a window ,control
and it breaks the window ,control
inhales it uh  lands inside a house ,control
and it knocks a lamp off a  a table ,control
and there's a man that was evidently sitting in there ,control
and inhales I think it looks like it maybe startled him or  something ,control
inhales and he picked up the ball ,control
and he's looking out the window ,control
and uh doesn't  you_know can't see his expression on his face ,control
but he inhales probably in the  either in the stages of finding out you_know who did it or whatever ,control
and then he's probably gonna react to it one way or the other ,control
 well  looks like there's a mother uh offering to a child ,control
maybe a girl ,control
I don't know ,control
kind_of hard to  no,control
it's probably a boy ,control
inhales unbrella ,control
and he goes out ,control
and walks with his backpack in the rain ,control
and he's starting to get wet ,control
and inhales he,control
so  he comes back ,control
and inhales he's all wet ,control
and his mother seems to not that be happy about it either ,control
and so then uh the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now ,control
and he's you_know using it the proper way ,control
that he's getting most of the rain not go on his upper  upper body ,control
and uh doesn't say if uh  they  he was dried out before that or not ,control
but he doesn't seem to be inhales wet from the picture ,control
so  I no ,control
that's just speculation ,control
