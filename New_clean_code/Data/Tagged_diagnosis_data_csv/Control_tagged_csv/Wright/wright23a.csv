okay  so  a few years ago when I was in school uh I was taking a class where I was partnered up with uh a student from China who had a very difficult  who had difficulties communicating verbally in English ,control
um he  he was hard to understand ,control
but I did my best to communicate with him by um maybe not trying to understand his complete sentences but trying to pick out words out_of what he was saying and try to match that into the context of what was going on around us to piece together what he might be saying ,control
and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on uh stating how I was understanding him so_that at some point if I didn't understand him he would realize that I wasn't understanding him ,control
and afrel after several weeks it just got easier and easier to understand what he was saying ,control
I would  just became accustomed to the accent and the words that he might choose to use ,control
and over time it got easier ,control
okay  so  it was  uh it was night time on Friday night ,control
