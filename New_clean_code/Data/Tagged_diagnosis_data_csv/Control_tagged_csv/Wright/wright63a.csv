okay  it looks like they have problems with their pets ,control
and I have a cat ,control
so  I know that cats climb anywhere ,control
and all_of_a_sudden it's in a high tree ,control
and it doesn't look like the cat is stressed ,control
but the kids are s or  the little girl is stressed ,control
so  Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat ,control
but I don't think he's able to ,control
so  he calls the firemen ,control
and the firemen look like they're going to get the cat down ,control
and I'm just gonna assume that they got the cat down ,control
and the little kid is gonna be so excited ,control
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down ,control
and they live happily ever after laughs ,control
okay  you take the  the loaf of bread ,control
and you open the bag ,control
and take two slices out ,control
you get your peanut butter jar ,control
you unscrew it ,control
and you get your knife ,control
and take out the peanut butter ,control
and put peanut butter on both sides of the bre I mean  on one side ges,control
so_that both ges,control
and then you get your favorite jelly ,control
and you do the same thing ,control
and then you put them together ,control
and serve it ,control
and eat happily ever laughs after ,control
well  I  clears,control
and when I found out I had breast cancer ,control
which runs very prominently in my family ,control
um my husband um said ,control
 we're gonna whip this thing ,control
and so I had a mastectomy ,control
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours ,control
and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said ,control
 we're going off to war again ,control
 and we're gonna beat it ,control
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing ,control
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband ,control
and my husband was b trying to be strong for me ,control
so  we always had a positive attitude ,control
and we  uh we never thought negatively ,control
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors ,control
yes ,control
okay  well  my mother was eighty nine when she had her s breast cancer ,control
and she came through that fine ,control
but then after that  a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes ,control
and so she herself said ,control
 I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab ,control
and she was living by herself at the time ,control
and so she,control
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in  near my sister in Dallas ,control
and so then I went there once a month to visit her ,control
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well ,control
she um she would start sentences ,control
and never be able to finish them ,control
and she would say ,control
 would you ,control
and then she wouldn't be able to  to finish the sentence ,control
so  it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted  us to do ,control
but we didn't really know what to do ,control
so  the only thing my sister and I did was we just um smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf ,control
so  we talked slowly and loudly ,control
and we always had a big smile on our faces ,control
and um we just showed her that we cared ,control
and we would always um read her mail to her ,control
and we knew two favorite people of hers ,control
so  we would always read those uh more than once ,control
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her ,control
okay   um clears_throat when I was working for this man he was the  um he was a member of Young_Presidents_Organization ,control
and it was made up of presidents from around the world ,control
and they had um a  not a seminar but a  um they called it a university ,control
and it was like a week long ,control
and it would always be one would be in the United_States ,control
and the second one of the year would be outside the United_States ,control
and this year it was going to be in San_Francisco ,control
and um it'll be twenty years ago next month ,control
and um my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening ,control
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a_lot of the background work ,control
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working uh week ,control
and so Don stayed here ,control
and my sister from Dallas uh flew in ,control
and that was the week that they had the San_Francisco earthquake ,control
and um so we were at Fisherman's_Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free ,control
and um we were waiting to go uh on the trolley cart back to um Saint_Francis  the Westin_Saint_Francis ,control
and as we're waiting in line the earthquake hit ,control
and um it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that ,control
and so my sister  just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down ,control
and she said ,control
 that was probably a two or three ,control
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didn't know ,control
but that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing ,control
well  the electricity was off so nothing worked ,control
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel ,control
and um in San_Francisco you_know it's pretty hilly ges,control
and so um I_mean it was  it was uh quite a jog back there ,control
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel ,control
so  we sat outside this big uh park area um for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in ,control
and uh the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was ,control
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there ,control
and we wanted to also call our two husbands ,control
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news ,control
she doesn't like to hear uh the bad news ,control
and there's hardly any good news that's told ,control
so  we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know ,control
but my sister said ,control
 mother what are you doing ,control
and she said ,control
 well  I'm watching the news because soandso told me that there was a big earthquake in San_Francisco ,control
so  this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco ,control
so  it was a_lot_of  fear at the beginning ,control
we were on the nineteenth floor ,control
so  we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor ,control
and then walk down with our luggage ,control
so  it was just uh the fear of the unknown ,control
and not knowing if we're gonna be able to fly out because maybe the  the airline canceled the flight or whatever ,control
but both of our flights were fine ,control
and we made it home okay ,control
and our families were okay laughs ,control
okay ,control
first of all it looks like there has been um a weather change ,control
and so whatever the girl was doing at the beginning I would say she was ,control
I can't tell if it's a young girl or if it's a young lady ,control
so  I'm  whatever she was doing I think it's ,control
she was  riding her bicycle ,control
I'm going to say it's a young girl riding a bicycle ,control
and she  the weather came up quickly ,control
and it looks like it is flooding the roadway ,control
and perhaps she was um I'm just gonna say a  on a bicycle ,control
and so it washed her haway ,control
and uh  she's very frightened and concerned and scared and  all other emotions  negative emotions ,control
and this one ,control
it might be a firefighter  or whatever rescuer is coming ,control
uh it looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb ,control
and he is  he's got his lifejacket on ,control
and so he is coming to rescue the little girl ,control
and being that he's a professional rescuer of one way or another ,control
um the family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land ,control
okay ,control
this young boy is practicing soccer ,control
and as happens most of the time or  many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood ,control
um whether it's baseball or  or golf or a soccer ball ,control
it goes in a way that it shouldn't have gone ,control
so  he's kicking this soccer ball ,control
and it accidently crashes through a window ,control
I'm going to say it's a neighbor's window ,control
and all_of_a_sudden it ,control
the neighbor is sitting in a chair ,control
and this ball comes through ,control
and knocks over a lamp ,control
and then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window ,control
and is looking outside the broken window to the young man ,control
and being that it's a neighbor I think that he knows that accidents do happen ,control
and he's not happy what happened ,control
but he's understandable  u understanding that it was just an accident ,control
and is not going to be upset with the boy ,control
but is just going to tell him ,control
 just be careful the next time ,control
well   little boy is  is with his mom ,control
and his mom is  sort_of insisting that he  ta even_though it's not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast ,control
and he should take this umbrella ,control
head,control
they'd rather have the rain probably and play in the rain ,control
but he's insisting that he does not wanna take the umbrella ,control
so  as he's walking ,control
looks like to school because he's got a backpack on ,control
uh it starts raining ,control
it's okay at the very beginning because it's just drizzling ,control
but then all_of_a_sudden it is really coming down ,control
so he's  you can see the puddles on the ground ,control
so  he's trying to cover his head with his hand ,control
and he's turned around to go back home ,control
and he comes in ,control
and he's very sad because he's soaked ,control
and his mother looks at him ,control
and is disappointed that he didn't take the umbrella ,control
but now he realizes that his mother was right ,control
and he should've taken the umbrella ,control
and he goes out using the umbrella ,control
and though it's pouring down rain he's now keeping dry ,control
okay  the story of Cinderella ,control
I've forgotten some of it but anyway ,control
um it's a story of a family that has  mother that has three daughters ,control
two seem to be uh mean sisters to their one sister who is Cinderella ,control
they always have fun ,control
and they dress up ,control
they go places ,control
um she is left  Cinderella is left to do the chores the hard work ,control
feeding the animals cooking cleaning the house ,control
um then they get an invitation to a ball ,control
the prince has invited everybody to come to the ball ,control
and so they're all excited because they're gonna go to the ball ,control
well  Cinderella gets dressed ,control
and her sisters get dressed ,control
and they take some of their things that she was going to wear  for themselves ,control
and so now Cinderella really doesn't wanna go because she doesn't look pretty ,control
and so the other two sisters go to the ball ,control
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother comes ,control
and says ,control
 you're going to the ball ,control
and waves her magic wand ,control
and Cinderella looks beautiful ,control
and so she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball ,control
and she has on beautiful silver slippers ,control
and so all_of_a_sudden she gets to the ball ,control
and uh the prince dances with her ,control
and she says  all_of_a_sudden it's midnight ,control
and if she doesn't get out by midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin ,control
so  she runs away from the prince ,control
and gets into the uh carriage ,control
and somehow she lost her one shoe ,control
the prince finds the shoe ,control
and they try to find the person that this shoe fits ,control
and he has help ,control
other people are helping him ,control
and so finally they  they try to fit the shoe on the two mean sisters ,control
head,control
but then they said ,control
 there was one other person here ,control
and Cinderella  it fit Cinderella ,control
and so the prince takes Cinderella ,control
and lives happily ever after ,control
