text,diagnosis
well  in about I think it was  two thousand and one I became ill with a fairly serious strain of viral something ,control
they couldn't really tell me ,control
but it was highly contagious ,control
I hadta stay out_of work for a week ,control
um kind_of isolated ,control
I was allowed to stay home ,control
I wasn't hospitalized per_se except for the initial um diagnosis in the e_r because I had spiked a hundred and four temperature and was having difficulty seeing ,control
um the one e_r doctor that came and saw me thought I might have meningitis ,control
but then his superior came and said it wasn't meningitis ,control
it was just a really bad viral infection ,control
so  I was laid up in bed ,control
um and what happened throughout each day and evening varied anything from spiking temperature to chills and hot flashes ,control
um there was some vomiting of_course ,control
um a_lot_of nausea ,control
my husband was great ,control
he  um he wasn't my husband at the time ,control
we were living together ,control
but he made chicken soup for me and  and did you_know the clear liquids and  and apple juice and things like that and made sure that I was eating ,control
it was kind_of frightening actually because I didn't know what was actually happening ,control
a viral infection doesn't really describe much ,control
but um I came through it okay ,control
I was really weak ,control
I would say that after that week had passed it took me couple months really to feel like my old self again ,control
um but I was okay laughs obviously ,control
I'm okay ,control
that's it ,control
sure laughs ,control
what I specifically did about it ,control
 oh_my_gosh  I am trying to remember a specific incident ,control
um  holy_moly  I can't think of anything right offhand ,control
I know I have been in those situations before ,control
of_course  I witnessed ,control
it's not always me that solves the problem ,control
let me think  let me think ,control
well  yeah  that has happened ,control
on the phone usually ,control
um just because_of cultural differences too ,control
okay  ,control
um well  in the couple instances that I remember I hadta just keep repeating myself ,control
um I would try to slow down my words ,control
speak clearly ,control
try to find related words to what I was saying if they didn't understand exactly what I was saying ,control
and ask them leading questions to see if they understood what I was um asking of them or trying to explain to them ,control
um and I believe resolution came about ,control
from what I recall it sounds like it ,control
again I can't remember a specific instance with who I spoke to and what we spoke about ,control
but in those cases you_know the couple ,control
I remember you_know  some time ago laughs it worked out okay  I guess ,control
no ,control
oh  yeah laughs ,control
oh  hm  so many to choose from ,control
she says trying to remember ,control
um okay  frightened or scared ,control
um  well  there was a time I was actually afraid for someone else ,control
um my husband and I when we first started dating he was involved in a group um that did medieval reenactment ,control
and part of their um events and um group gatherings involved a  a large gathering where the people could take on personas of warriors ,control
and they would dress up in you_know armor and things like that ,control
and go out and hit each_other with sticks and stuff  you_know ,control
no real swords or anything like that ,control
that's not legal ,control
but um you_know i like I said it was a reenactment ,control
and at one point during um a battle  at this particular battle he was um basically tackled by several members which isn't usual ,control
and when he fell he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor ,control
but they decided to step over him ,control
and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids ,control
and it wrenched ges,control
they hadta call the paramedics um from a nearby um emergency center ,control
we were out on the outskirts of town out on the  the country side of Phoenix  west Phoenix ,control
and so the closest place was several miles away ,control
and they called the ambulance ,control
they came out put the neck brace on ,control
loaded him ,control
he was in a_lot_of pain ,control
I was freaking out ,control
I didn't know what was going on ,control
I heard things like convulsions ,control
I heard neck broken ,control
I heard just  it was craziness ,control
so  they loaded him up on the ambulance ,control
I ran back f to my tent because I was out there camping with him ,control
grabbed my car keys and hopped in the  the car we had taken together ,control
and uh met him in the emergency room ,control
when I got there they had him in the xray taking xrays of his neck ,control
it turns out he did not break his neck which was a great relief ,control
but um he was pretty badly bruised and banged up ,control
he had severe ges,control
I was very grateful that it wasn't worse than it was ,control
but that time in_between you_know what happened and finding out from the doctors was ,control
I  yeah I was off the charts ,control
what do you do with that ,control
you have no idea ,control
so  it was  uh that was really frightening to go through ,control
