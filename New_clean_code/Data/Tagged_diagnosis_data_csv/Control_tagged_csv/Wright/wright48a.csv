today is Johnny's eighth birthday ,control
and all of his friends from school are coming over to sing happy birthday and have a piece of birthday cake with him ,control
a as  when mommy and Johnny stepped out_of the kitchen they walk back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake taken  chunk  there was a big bite taken out_of the cake ,control
and they looked to see that the prints led right to the dog under the couch ,control
mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guests arrive ,control
and Johnny cried ,control
the guests  as the guests walked in they said ,control
 oh_my ,control
 what are we gonna do now ,control
but the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything ,control
so  the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home ,control
in fourth grade I was outside um during recess in New_York ,control
and as you may or may not know they have  um we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city laughs ,control
we don't have a playground ,control
so  they put up the barriers ,control
and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street ,control
so  um I was standing against one of the cars ,control
and a friend of mine ran right into me ,control
and uh my wrist went right around the  um the rear view mirror and broke ,control
so  um they uh called my mom ,control
and my mom came ,control
and I was just crying ,control
and she rushed me to the doctor ,control
uh we took  I think we took the bus because she didn't wanna pay for an ambulance ,control
so  I'm in pain on the bus ,control
I'm crying ,control
I'm trying to keep it still ,control
and um we got to the hospital and they hadta put a cast on me ,control
and that was my first time having a cast ,control
and um got back to school and all my friends signed it ,control
and um so that was cool ,control
and the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside ,control
and so I remember one time my mom used like uh one of the uh straws from the broom to try and itch ,control
and it broke in there ,control
so  then that was even more annoying because I couldn't get to to it ,control
um and that was about all I remember about that ,control
and I ,control
oh  and then I remember using it as a weapon too laughs ,control
if somebody bothered me I'd hit them with it ,control
but then I would feel it too laughs ,control
so ,control
yeah  that was my first experience with a cast laughs ,control
 as far as language barriers or ,control
um I'm sure I have ,control
I can't think of anything off the top of my head though ,control
language yes ,control
sure ,control
well  most recently you_know when we call to pay a phone bill or something um we get somebody in another country ,control
and so a_lot_of times like they can't pronounce our names ,control
so  we'll be like are you  first we hafta figure out if they're calling the right house ,control
and then you_know after they say it a few times then we do understand ,control
um and just to switch really quick ,control
actually when we've called to get help with like computer service or something that's when it becomes a really  it becomes difficult because we're trying to first understand what they're saying and then do what they're saying and trying to figure out if they understand what we're asking what for we need ,control
so  yeah that's a interesting experience ,control
plenty ,control
laughs um  scared ,control
okay ,control
let's see ,control
gosh I can't ,control
mhm ,control
okay ,control
um during my childhood ,control
yes ,control
okay ,control
so  I have one ,control
um I grew up in New_York the first part of my life ,control
and so in New_York it was like you_know you don't trust anybody you don't go with any strangers you_know everybody's bad in New_York ,control
we had the completely different view of California ,control
California was like this fantasy land you_know awesome place to be you can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody ,control
so  when we moved here or  when we moved to California from New_York I would sometimes walk home from the babysitter's or what have you ,control
and one time this um man stopped ,control
and he was like ,control
 do you need a ride ,control
and I was like  it was one of those days where it was  the evening was coming and bats were like flying around ,control
and I was like ,control
 oh_my_gosh ,control
 I'm so scared ,control
 am I going to make it home ,control
 these bats are ,control
so  it was like a godsend when he stopped  you_know ,control
I was like ,control
 oh  okay ,control
 I can get a ride ,control
 I don't hafta deal with these bats ,control
and I'm thinking ,control
 well every  and everybody in  k we're  I'm in California so this person can't possibly do me wrong ,control
so  I get in the car ,control
and I'm driving ,control
and it's like ,control
 how are you and you_know what's your name and where do you live ,control
and um then it  s then it just started getting weird when I said ,control
 make a right ,control
and he said ,control
 well  I'm gonna make a left ,control
and I'm like ,control
 no  go right ,control
and then that's when I was like ,control
 okay  something's wrong here ,control
and um so I just prayed at that point like that he would go right go towards my house ,control
and um he was like ,control
 are you sure you don't want something to drink you_know ,control
I'm like ,control
 no  just  please just go right ,control
and so he turned right ,control
and then I said ,control
 here's my street ,control
 please turn ,control
and um I  um anything  I didn't know what was gonna happen at that point ,control
he pulled up in front of my house ,control
and he was still kind_of rolling ,control
and I just kind_of opened the door and just kind_of jumped out_of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house ,control
and nobody was home ,control
so  then I'm knocking on the door ,control
and the sun's going down ,control
and I'm like ,control
 oh_gosh  what if he's like just still like right there waiting for me ,control
and so when I thought he was gone I ran over to my neighbor's house which is my  you_know my best friend's house at the time and stayed there until I knew my mom was home ,control
