it was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to uh breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become uh sore and aggravated ,control
so  I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out ,control
the best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better ,control

I actually landed on top of my snowmobile on the side of the mountain at about a forty five degree angle towards the top where the road was ,control
and I could see with the flashlight the direction where the road and where I had crashed through the mountain was ,control
