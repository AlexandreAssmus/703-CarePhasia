one sunny day in June a family of rats decided to get all the family together and go for a picnic ,control
they packed the truck with all their toys ,control
and they gathered all the rats ,control
they climbed  some climbed in the front of the cab ,control
some of the younger rats climbed in the back ,control
off they went down the road up a great big hill with flowers and bushes ,control
it was a very bumpy road with lots_of rocks ,control
when they hit one particularly large rock a little girl rat with her baby   with her stuffed animal flew right out_of the back of the truck ,control
the truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls ,control
she lay alongside the road watching the truck drive off in the distance ,control
the rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic ,control
and they all climbed out_of the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys ,control
some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water ,control
some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers ,control
it was a beautiful lake ,control
and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time ,control
grandpa rat played the fiddle while grandma sat next to her ,control
and mother and father rat watched their children play ,control
everybody was having so much fun except for the little rat who had fallen out_of the truck ,control
she sat alongside the trail hugging her stuffed animal  to her and crying ,control
she was so scared and lonely ,control
the woods seemed so big and scary ,control
she looked every which way ,control
and didn't know what to do ,control
the flowers were pretty ,control
and she looked at the red flowers around her ,control
and the yellow flowers ,control
meanwhile back at the lake father called all the little rats to come and have lunch ,control
back in the woods the little rat  the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her ,control
she found that they were very very yummy ,control
and she filled up on juicy red raspberries ,control
meanwhile back at the lake the family started to realize that something was wrong ,control
they were missing the little girl rat ,control
the children sat and waited while the parents searched and called ,control
but she was nowhere to be seen ,control
they looked in the water and along the edges ,control
they looked under rocks and in the grass ,control
they were sad ,control
some of the young rats were even crying ,control
they did not know what had happened to their little sister ,control
they decided that they needed to pack up and head back the way that they had come ,control
nobody was going to be able to eat or have fun until they were all together again ,control
the little rat back along the trail had filled up on berries and was laying down in the grass just looking up at the sky wondering what to do next ,control
the rats in the truck searched and searched as they drove back along the trail the way they had come ,control
the little rat thought she heard something ,control
she thought she heard the rumbling of a truck and her brothers and sisters and mother and father and grandma and grandpa calling her name ,control
she rushed through the grass back towards the road ,control
she ran out into the road just in time to see her father's truck cresting the hill ,control
and they spotted her ,control
and they all waved and were so happy to find her again ,control
but  and they hugged joyfully  did cartwheels and jumped and cried ,control
but the little girl realized that something was wrong ,control
she had lost the stuffed animal that had given her such comfort when she was lost in the woods ,control
she ran back through the woods ,control
and in the grass there she found her bunny laying down her stuffed animal ,control
she hugged her stuffed animal to her ,control
and she was so happy ,control
they all climbed back into the truck again ,control
actually they all decided to set up and have a picnic right there where they had found their little sister ,control
so  they started to spread out the blankets and get the food out once again ,control
but this time they were most certain to have a happy picnic because they were all together ,control
 the same thing ,control
good dog Carl ,control
Carl lived in a family  lived in a house with a family that had a little baby ,control
Carl was a big Rottweiller ,control
and he was  when  when the mother went out shopping she said to Carl ,control
 look after the baby Carl ,control
 I'll be back shortly ,control
Carl was being left to babysit for a baby ,control
and he was just a big happy dog ,control
they waited as they watched the mother get into her car and drive away ,control
Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone ,control
the baby also waited expectantly ,control
when Carl was sure it was s safe he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed out_of the crib and onto Carl's back ,control
Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse ,control
they were going to have such a good time together ,control
they walked down the hall into mother's bedroom ,control
it looked so soft ,control
they jumped up onto the bed ,control
and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch ,control
afterwards they got off the bed and they went over to mom's vanity ,control
there the baby got into mom's powder  perfumed powder ,control
and he dusted Carl's nose ,control
it tickled Carl's nose ,control
but he liked the smell of the powder ,control
and he was having so much fun with baby ,control
they played dressup ,control
Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can  on top of him just like a little purple hat ,control
baby had a hat too ,control
baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff ,control
they looked at themselves to  in the mirror and they smiled ,control
this was so much fun ,control
next Carl took the baby to the laundry chute ,control
uhoh ,control
what do you think is going to happen here ,control
the baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down ,control
and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby ,control
he gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry ,control
Carl jumps down the stairs gets the baby on his back again and climbs back up th  runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck ,control
Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room scattering the newspaper every which way ,control
they walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish ,control
the baby decided that he wanted to go swimming ,control
and so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water ,control
the baby splashed and chased the fish ,control
afterwards Carl decided that he wanted to dance ,control
amazingly Carl knew how to turn on the stereo ,control
and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music ,control
and Carl danced and danced for the baby ,control
and the baby laughed and clapped his hands ,control
afterwards Carl and the baby were both very hungry ,control
so  they wandered into the kitchen ,control
they got into the refrigerator ,control
and what did they find but bread and butter ,control
Carl got a package of whole wheat bread ,control
and he ripped it open ,control
and ate all the bread ,control
meanwhile  the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers and tasting the salty buttery taste ,control
they found grapes ,control
and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth ,control
they made chocolate milk with syrup ,control
what a mess ,control
you can imagine there was syrup and milk all over the floor ,control
and what's in the red jar ,control
oh_my ,control
there was food everywhere ,control
and the baby was a mess ,control
the baby climbed onto Carl's back ,control
and they climbed back up the stairs leaving the mess behind ,control
Carl smart dog that he was started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside ,control
he got a washcloth a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap ,control
and he scrubbed the baby ,control
Carl's mouth was full of soap ,control
and he made bubbles when he breathed which made the baby laugh ,control
afterwards Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry ,control
he brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside ,control
then Carl had work to do ,control
he went back down to the kitchen ,control
finished off the bread ,control
put the wrapper in the trash ,control
licked up the milk ,control
he looked out the window ,control
mom wasn't back yet ,control
he still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away ,control
after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around and fun time he looked out the window and saw mother coming home ,control
the baby was laying in his crib quietly ,control
and Carl laid down next to the baby and waited ,control
mother walked in to see them just as she had left them ,control
she was happy that Carl was such a good babysitter ,control
 good dog  Carl ,control
she said ,control
and rubbed his head while he put his head on her lap ,control

to plant a flower in the garden the first thing that you needta do is dig a hole twice as big as the root or  uh twice as big as the pot ,control
and then you needta mix some compost in with the soil that you just dug out ,control
put the plant back into the hole ,control
and fill around it with the mixture of the dirt and the compost ,control
and then you make a mound in the middle ,control
making sure that the root ball is just  just covered ,control
and then you can make a little moat  make  make a little moat around the uh dirt ball ,control
then you water it ,control
and as the dirt settles down you add more dirt if necessary ,control
and then saturate the soil to make sure that it has gotten all the way through to the water  to the roots and that the soil is settled ,control

two slices of bread a jar of peanut butter a jar of jelly and a knife ,control
you open the two pieces of bread ,control
lay them out next to each_other ,control

and you scoop out however much jelly you want ,control
and spread it with a knife onto one slice of bread ,control

on my last vacation we joined my best friend and her family in their r_v going to the Grand_Canyon ,control
there were seven of us ,control

we loaded into the r_v on a very stormy night here in Phoenix ,control
as we head north towards the Grand_Canyon the rain stopped but that wasn't  but we weren't in the clear ,control
a trucker passing us waved at us indicating that something was wrong ,control
and so we pulled over alongside the road ,control
and found that the vehicle we were towing behind the motorhome had blown a tire and ripped up the whole front side of the truck we were towing ,control
while the children slept in the motorhome the adults got out ,control
and changed the tire ,control
and did the things that we needed to do ,control
and we proceeded on to Flagstaff ,control
we stayed in the Walmart parking lot that night so_that the very next morning we could wake up and get the tire fixed ,control
and proceed with our vacation ,control
the next morning after the tire was fixed we drove up to the Grand_Canyon ,control

and so we packed up without any motorhome ,control
just tents and sleeping bags and trailers  uh trailer and a chainsaw and axes ,control
and lots_of food and cooking supplies for my mother inlaw ,control
and early Saturday morning we drove up to Payson ,control
we  we followed along a dirt road that the ranger had recommended ,control
and we found a nice place to camp with lots_of dead trees around us ,control
after we set up camp we unloaded our a_t_v ,control
and we started dragging huge logs back up the hill to our camp ,control
we cut the logs  we cut the  the long tree stumps into logs and laid them next to the camper where we would load them the next day ,control
but mother inlaw was gonna be sleeping in the camper or the t not the camper but  the trailer so we couldn't load until the next day ,control
my husband and I stayed in a tent on a air mattress ,control

I was riding a quad ,control
I was thirty years old ,control
and we were at Little_Sahara sand dunes in northern Oklahoma ,control
it was nineteen ninety four ,control
right before  Thanks right before Halloween ,control
and my husband and I were out riding ,control
he was on a performance quad that had big shock absorbers ,control
and we were  and I was on a utility quad like a hunting quad that's more made as a workhorse and not for racing ,control
we went over a hill ,control
and sped down the other side of the hill ,control
and at the bottom there were bumps ,control
and my husband's bike just went right over the bumps ,control
but mine hit the bumps and ,control
as my body was coming off of a bump my bike had hit another bump and came back up ,control
and I heard a loud and felt a really loud pop ,control
and  I stopped the bike or the bike stopped itself ,control
and  I realized I was in a_lot_of pain ,control
couldn't move ,control
so  my husband came back ,control
and he took me off the bike ,control
and laid me on the ground ,control
and I remember making sounds ,control
I remember I was embarrassed at the same time that I was in pain because I was making sounds like an animal ,control
it was embarrassing ,control
and uh I told my husband I could not get back on the bike ,control
that I couldn't do it ,control
I couldn't move ,control
and I was in too much pain ,control
and he was annoyed ,control
and he said ,control
 if you don't get back on that bike we're gonna hafta get a ambulance crew out here for you ,control
 do you want that ,control
and I said ,control
 no ,control
 I don't ,control
so  he lifted me back on the bike ,control
and he put both of my hands on the steering wheel or  the um handlebars ,control
and he put my feet on the pedals ,control
and  he drove  he drove ahead of me ,control
and he  he went as quickly as he could back to the car ,control
meanwhile  it took me about an hour to get three miles ,control
and I made it back to the car ,control
and he hadta lift me off ,control
and put me in the seat ,control
it took three hours for us to get home or  to the hospital ,control
and xrays and everything ,control
broken back ,control
um and when my husband called me that night from home and I was in the hospital not having any idea when  you_know what our  what our future was going to be like he told me he was very sad ,control
laughs very sad and very sorry ,control
oh yeah laughs ,control
yes ,control
my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia ,control
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia ,control
so  her first language is Mandarin Chinese ,control
and then her second language is English ,control
and  I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods instead_of really understanding things ,control
and it's taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her even_though she insists she understands ,control
you_know  and the the very next day she'll not have a clue what I had told her ,control
and so I have just learned to um uh watch for cues that she's not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding ,control
and I've hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase in_order_to make sure that she understands ,control
I was in the military ,control
I'd just come to Phoenix from Korea ,control
and I didn't know anybody yet ,control
and so I got a parttime job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard ,control
and I worked middle of the night shift all night shift ,control
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed ,control
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes ,control
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons ,control
we weren't allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon ,control
there's actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for selfdefense or as a weapon ,control
so  on this fifty acre site there was one light pole ,control
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds ,control
so  all around you it's pitch black ,control
and you're just under this light pole ,control
and you can't see beyond the darkness or  beyond the light ,control
and so I would sit there at night ,control
and uh  one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work ,control
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning ,control
and this time it was around three in the morning ,control
and I didn't realize that they were going to be coming that early ,control
and I was s sitting where I shouldn't have been sitting ,control
I was just outside the light so_that I could see ,control
because it's creepy ,control
very creepy all night long ,control
and so you_know by three o'clock in the morning I was already on edge ,control
and all_of_a_sudden ,control
and I hadn't seen anybody approaching ,control
but all_of_a_sudden a man jumped out from behind a close_by Port_a_Potty ,control
he yelled ,control
and he had a rope in his hand ,control
and he was stretching the rope in_between his hands like this ,control
and he yelled ,control
and I screamed ,control
and he laughed ,control
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up ,control
and he continued to laugh ,control
and I cried because it had scared me so badly laughs ,control
laughs as it turns out he was just one of the construction workers that showed up early and maybe got dropped off along the road ,control
yeah laughs ,control
it was ,control
it was monsoon season in Phoenix Arizona ,control
and it had been raining for days and days ,control
and the creeks were flooding ,control
and the  there were roads that were impassable ,control
there were roadblocks up everywhere ,control
but every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads ,control
they don't realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water ,control
and that it's much deeper than they realized ,control
one father had gone across the or  had attempted to cross the road ,control
he thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine ,control
then as they entered the water very quickly the hand,control
and pushed his truck right off the road ,control
he and his daughter were the only ones in the truck ,control
daughter was in her seatbelt ,control
he was able to get out_of his seatbelt ,control
then he climbed to the top of the truck ,control
and over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter ,control
the water swept them off the top of the truck ,control
and as they  as they were swept downstream they caught a tree ,control
and the girl hung on to the tree alone because her father had been swept further down ,control
and he hadta grab another tree down the way ,control
someone watching who had seen everything had called nineoneone ,control
the fire department got there ,control
and they saw the little girl clinging to the tree ,control
one particularly strong handsome young fire fighter  put on his life vest ,control
jumped out into the water ,control
grabbed the tree ,control
put his arms around the little girl ,control
and she clung to him  knowing that her life depended on it ,control
he held her very tightly while he put another belt around her ,control
it was a belt similar to the one he was wearing ,control
and they  they tied themselves together with the belt ,control
and his friends back on shore the other fire fighters pulled him back to the shore with the girl ,control
and when she was safe a different fire fighter went in after the father ,control
and got him safely out ,control
and they gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law ,control
laughs and he got a bill for fifteen hundred dollars for the rescue of him and his daughter ,control
Bobby was out in the yard playing soccer ,control
he was having a great time kicking the ball around practicing all his soccer moves ,control
thinking about how cool he was gonna be in the upcoming soccer tournament ,control
and how he was gonna be the star ,control
he was excited thinking about all the glory that he was going to receive ,control
he gave that soccer ball the biggest kick he could ,control
and there it went  straight for his living room window ,control
smash ,control
broke the living room window ,control
flew into the  and flew into his father's or  knocked over a lap  a lamp  and flew into his father's lap who was sitting just inside taking a nap in his favorite chair ,control
shocked the father stood up ,control
and looked outside the window to see what had happened ,control
nobody was out there ,control
there was no little boy ,control
but he knew ,control
and he waited until the boy came home ,control
the boy had been scared ,control
and hid for hours in the bushes ,control
and when he did come home the father scolded him ,control
and gave him a list of jobs he would hafta do to earn the money to pay for the broken window ,control
sighs it was Monday morning and time for Billy to go to school ,control

so  mom said ,control

Billy smiled and said goodbye to his mom and started walking to school ,control
a little ways away from his house the rain started to fall ,control
within seconds it was coming down like cats and dogs ,control
he turned around and ran as fast as he could through the growing puddles back to his house ,control
when he got to his house he was soaking sopping wet ,control
and his mother just looked at him and shook his head  shook her head ,control
at this point Billy was happy to take the umbrella ,control
and he changed his clothes ,control
got on something dry ,control
and went back to school proudly holding his umbrella ,control
and arriving dry and ready for class ,control
