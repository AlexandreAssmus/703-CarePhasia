apparently a birthday uh uh celebration is planned ,control
and uh there is a cake with four candles on the table ,control
um we see on the right uh two women uh uh one already in  in the room the other entering through the doorway ,control
and each has a child ,control
the women already inside has a little boy ,control
and the women just entering is with a little girl ,control
both of  both children who are entering uh have wrapped presents presumably for the party ,control
um when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it a pretty good size portion of it ,control
and uh there are pieces of cake on the table ,control
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to what we percieve  what we see as a dog sort_of hiding underneath the sofa ,control
and the hostess apparently the women who's giving the party is standing there facing the dog ,control
she has a broom in her hand ,control
she appears to be very angry ,control
and the  uh the birthday boy uh laughs we can't tell what he's doing ,control
he seems to be w ,control
I can't tell weather he's wiping his eyes ,control
his  mou hi his uh mouth is wide open apparently uh to call or do something ,control
and looks as though the woman  the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom ,control
oh my favorite food laughs ,control
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
my way or the common way ,control
laughs well  we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all ,control
but use a good bread ,control
sometimes it's nice to toast it first ,control
uh on the other hand it's not necessary ,control
it's whatever you feel like at the time ,control
well  uh having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading ,control
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first ,control
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it ,control
it works better ,control
spread  uh spread the ,control
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread ,control
well  after that um a little bit of butter ,control
not too much but some ,control
uh tends to help uh make the thing a little bit m more moist than usual ,control
and on top of that goes the jelly ,control
now uh having done so  what a_lot_of people fail to have ever learned is uh you_know regardless of how much uh bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth ,control
well  there's an easy way around that ,control
most people don't know my special secret ,control
my special secret is lettuce ,control
nice uh leaves of iceberg lettuce ,control
just a couple is just right to do it ,control
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had ,control
I got a_lot of them but I can tell you  I'll tell you this one ,control
um when the Korean_War started uh I was twenty one and One_a ,control
and um in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself uh in a  in  ar in a stinky rice paddy uh shooting people uh I arranged or  I  I applied for the Air_force's uh Aviation Cadet program ,control
um and uh I was  I was appointed ,control
I finally got an appointment to an air  air cadet class ,control
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia ,control
and uh in those times ,control
well  I never did uh do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid ,control
uh in the  I was still in the  in the  within the very first  uh I guess  it was just the first phase of  of training ,control
uh I had already d had some flying instruction ,control
and uh I awoke one Saturday morning ,control
uh no  actually it was a Sunday morning ,control
I awoke feeling hungover ,control
I knew the hungover feeling ,control
uh but I had not had  I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then ,control
I was only in my twenties ,control
and uh I thought ,control
 boy_oh_boy this is terrible ,control
so  I kind_of stayed ar you_know just  I hung back all day ,control
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover ,control
well  I knew that I didn't feel well enough to fly ,control
I was not safe ,control
so  I put myself into sick call ,control
well  this was  this was a civilian contract flying school ,control
and they had a f infirmary but only a  you_know it wasn't  it wasn't a hospital ,control
so  I found myself in the infirmary ,control
well  I wasn't feeling too good but I wasn't feeling quite as bad as I had ,control
you_know  little by little it sort_of left ,control
and it got to the point where you_know the doctors would come in they'd looked at me and they'd say ,control
 well  you don't have any jaundice but your liver and your uh s uh spleen are enlarged ,control
 and we know there is something very very wrong going on internally ,control
 we don't know what it is ,control
well  laughs story ,control
uh we even  I  I  I  I felt good enough at or for  after awhile that I  you could even played a little bit of wheelchair football ,control
but then one of the medics came in and he said ,control
 okay ,control
he says ,control
 I'sd ,control
and I said ,control
 no you're not ,control
he said ,control
 yes I am ,control
he says ,control
 don't worry  sir ,control
he says ,control
 I givesd ,control
and I thought ,control
 oh  not another one ,control
well  he did ,control
didn't seem to make very much difference ,control
upshot of it all was that they gave up ,control
they didn't  they couldn't begin to imagine ,control
they had never seen a situation like this with an  with a  uh an uh enlarged and palpable liver palpable spleen and no jaundice ,control
it wasn't anything they had ever seen before ,control
next thing you know I was sitting in the back of a  s of a uh staff car uh being driven from there down to the uh Tyndall Air Force Base in uh Tallahassee Florida ,control
well  they put me in there ,control
they still didn't know ,control
you_know lots_of poking around uh but finally they just said ,control
 okay  you are  you are confined to just bed rest ,control
 don't get out_of bed ,control
 except to go to the bathroom ,control
okay ,control
well  it got pretty boring ,control
and I was feeling pretty good ,control
so  I'd wander around at night ,control
and you_know I'd have the buddies over in the next ward or something like that ,control
we'd have visit ,control
or I'd get the nurses to give me ice_cream or something like that ,control
well  one morning the flight surgeon came around ,control
didn't find me in my bed ,control
he was very disappointed ,control
and when I returned from wandering around visiting my buddies I was feeling pretty good ,control
he said ,control
 if you get ou ,control
he says ,control
 if ever I catch you out_of bed again ,control
he says ,control
 that's court marshal ,control
 that's the story ,control
well  it turned out that there was a new disease that they  nobody knew anything about ,control
the year would have been nineteen fifty one ,control
and the disease is called infectious mononucleosis ,control
you get it from kissing ,control
hm that was that girlfriend I had back in town ,control
back  up there in Moltrey ,control
that's what it was ,control
okay  that was the adventure ,control
however  end of the story ,control
uh one year later  a li little over a year later I found myself in Korea ,control
and I was  uh I  f I  fe I felt the needta go to the uh flight surgeon uh for another slight malady known as crabs ,control
you get them from toilet seats  over there ,control
this is in Korea ,control
lo_and_behold it was the same flight surgeon who I met the year before ,control
and we had a good laugh ,control
that's the story laughs ,control
yes ,control
I think I already have ,control
not at all ,control
I have a hearing problem ,control
and uh you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU uh uh gave a  uh uh uh a workshop over time it was several weeks where we come over and we'd learn all about hearing loss ,control
well  it ended up with me being a regular patient here ,control
and uh what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss ,control
well  uh even now uh I find that many people particularly young women uh they've been taught to talk through their nose real fast ,control
and that's what they do ,control
imit,control
and I hafta say to them ,control
 excuse_me I have a hearing problem ,control
 it's not your problem it's mine ,control
and uh after several times of asking them to repeat what they said I've had  I  I explain that ,control
 I have a hearing problem ,control
 I don't understand what you just said ,control
 now if you would be kind enough please to s speak a_little more slowly and perhaps put some space between your words then I'll not hafta  uh then I'll not hafta ask you continually to repeat yourself ,control
 okay ,control
that's how I handle that ,control
you bet I have ,control
the beginning is uh this occured in  um laughs this occurred in uh Louisiana ,control
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana ,control
and um uh we were then flying ,control
I was a fighter pilot ,control
we were then flying the  sw the uh swept wing version of the Fl eighty four known as the Fl eighty four Fl ,control
uh and we were  um we had been out or  uh on a  you_know a series of missions ,control
uh and we were just returning to the base ,control
well  uh actually I was by myself ,control
I was flying solo not in formation with anybody ,control
it was  it was just a  uh just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane ,control
and also proficiency ,control
just practice ,control
practice this practice that ,control
well  uh in those times we  uh uh we had a  a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at uh three hundred and forty knots air speed ,control
when directly over the air  when we were directly over the end of the runway we'd cut our power back ges,control
and uh uh that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees ,control
after that the airplane is slow enough so_that we would  uh we would have not have touched the throttle ,control
in other words it cut power completely ,control
and just bring it on around ges,control
well  um the  uh th um the  the legs of the  of a  f of the pattern are called the approach ,control
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind ,control
ninety degrees from that is the base ,control
and f f following that is the final ,control
so  it's just frel if  ges,control
well  here I am on the base leg with no power ,control
all the garbage is out ,control
we call it garbage ,control
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear ,control
and all_of_a_sudden I'm about I don't know  three four hundred feet off the ground ,control
no  m more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet ,control
something like that ,control
I'm not really sure ,control
the airplane started to shutter ,control
uh shuttering is the sign of a stall ,control
that means the air  w when an  when an airplane stalls it means it's falling out_of the sky ,control
and I knew immediately people do not survive these  a situation like this ,control
and yet I automatically didn't even  I  I almost didn't have time to think ,control
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway ,control
I didn't want that to happen ,control
well  what did I do ,control
I gave it full power which did not catch in time ,control
I pulled in the  the landing gear ,control
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone ,control
well  with low r_p_m there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended ,control
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down ,control
I overshot the runway ,control
but I wouldn't  I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side ,control
and um laughs the Fl eighty four Fl has a  a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that th the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left hand,control
you can't predict it but it will do that ,control
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe because its a jet ,control
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward ges,control
well  pretty soon there came the ground ,control
in retrospect I can remember very well that the  the horizon was jumping up and down ,control
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction ges,control
it yawed ,control
and as I say uh I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on ,control
well  eventually it did  it did uh come to rest ,control
it had  the  it had yawed to the right so_that at full power the engine was or  the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in  pla which is always in place uh for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up ,control
well  laughs they about panicked ,control
well  at which I followed the proper procedures ,control
uh I cut all power turned everything off ,control
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I  th I  I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing ,control
I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again ,control
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground ,control
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels ,control
uh and it  d i it did fly again ,control
so  did I of_course ,control
but in this  this moment of panic was  it  i it was only a  fla you_know only a quick flash fingers,control
it was  the  the thought was ,control
 I'll do what's  I know what I needta do but people don't  don't walk away from these things ,control
I walked away ,control
it was later determined that um while I was  I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots ,control
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone ,control
and he's  he was  h uh his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating ,control
but he could tell that he was overtaking me ,control
so  obviously it was an air speed problem ,control
from what I see I haven't the foggiest idea of what it  what is really going on ,control
I see a man who appears to be lying  possibly lying on his back ,control
um I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch ,control
uh he is  l over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish ,control
uh so  possibly she's there to help him and doesn't know what to ,control
you_know  I don't know if she even knows what to do ,control
uh I don't know any more than that ,control
I_mean I can tell you what I see which is uh uh uh some kind of a belt uh which he has uh around his left arm ,control
um he appears to be quite mucu muscular ,control
she appears to be uh very concerned ,control
that's as much as I can tell you ,control
laughs a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks ,control
it goes into the air ,control
it encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it ,control
uh a man sitting in a chair l looks like an easy chair um uh is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp ,control
he then stands picks up the soccer ball looks out the window to see ,control
 let's see how did it get here ,control
that's the story ,control
a little boy is ready to go to school ,control
apparently the weather is somewhat threatening ,control
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella ,control
well  he refuses ,control
he is going to be very brave ,control
nothing's gonna stop him ,control
he doesn't need an umbrella ,control
that's for sissies ,control
out he goes into the weather ,control
it's raining ,control
it's raining hard ,control
it's raining so hard that he's stepping in puddles ,control
he's getting soaked ,control
his hair is dripping ,control
he returns home much to the conversation ,control
well  apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella ,control
well  this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disney's that's for sure ,control
Cinderella was a good girl ,control
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters ,control
and um um um th they were pampered spoiled and they were nasty ,control
and Cinderella was called Cinder Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace ,control
she hadta take out the  uh uh take out the cinders and do things like that ,control
so  it was pretty dirty ,control
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom uh decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one ,control
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother uh got an  in got invitations to go ,control
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home ,control
but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared out_of nowhere and said to her ,control
 look  you deserve to go ,control
 we could arrange this but there are conditions ,control
 first of all um w there will be a coach for you pulled by horses ,control
 and um there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers ,control
 and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at  at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be out_of there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin ,control
Cinderella went to the ball ,control
the prince f could not take his eyes of ,control
and she had a wonderful time ,control
but all_of_a_sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve ,control
she knew she hadta get the heck out_of there really fast ,control
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers ,control
but it didn't make any difference ,control
she got out  she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home ,control
well  the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away ,control
but that didn't matter because he wanted her ,control
he was  he was so struck by h what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was ,control
so  he decreed that uh there would  a search would occur over the  over the kingdom until  uh until the  until Cinderella was  until the woman was found ,control
now why was this  why was this such a thing ,control
well  Cinderella had tiny feet ,control
and the glass slipper was so tiny that very few people  very few grownups could fit into it ,control
so  he  he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who  who  whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one ,control
well  lo_and_behold uh uh in his search  his search was successful ,control
they did find  they did find Cinderella as the one who  whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper ,control
and they were married and lived happily ever after ,control
we see here a tree ,control
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs um holding on to it sort_of so to speak an an and barking ,control
in a branch  in  in the  in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of uh rescuing a cat wh who is uh on one of the smaller branches ,control
under  directly underneath of which is a little girl uh who  uh who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down ,control
uh she has a tricycle in front of her ,control
and we see uh uh near the little girl a ladder on the ground uh which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is ,control
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains as I say  remains on the ground ,control
uh that's  um that's what we  s that's what we  ap that's what we see to the left  left side of the trunk of a tree ,control
on the right side is another branch uh which had a few leaves on it ,control
and uh one of  on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing ,control
at the same time we see in the  in the distance directly uh to the right of the truck a firetruck and two  what appear to be two firemen each  each uh carrying an end of a ladder which presumably is going to be  they will use uh to climb the tree  rescue the man laughs and uh probably the cat as_well ,control
