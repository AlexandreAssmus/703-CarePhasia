one afternoon the little girl's cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch ,control
and she was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down ,control
and her father  being the silly man that he is  decided to go up and take care of the cat ,control
try to ca get the cat ,control
so  as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch ,control
and the ladder falls off of the tree ,control
at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and  which scares the cat all the more ,control
and the cat is not gonna come to the father ,control
but the father can't get out_of the tree anyway ,control
so  they hafta call the fire department ,control
who comes and rescues the man out_of the tree ,control
and rescues the cat ,control
the end ,control
there are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
uh one of them is to get out the bread that's already cut ,control
and  uh and put peanut butter on it ,control
uh actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store ,control
and so all you hafta do is just use one ,control
and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into this  into the jar ,control
and you can put it right on the bread ,control
and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
very lazy ,control
very easy ,control
the good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread ,control
cut it in six inch long pieces ,control
slice it longways so_that it's open ,control
it's nice and crunchy on top ,control
it's very soft on the interior ,control
you take your peanut butter ,control
crunchy and   so and regular ,control
you mix those together ,control
you put it on the peanut   you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich ,control
you take the jelly ,control
uh I wouldn't use grape jelly ,control
but uh you can use other kinds of jelly ,control
and I  I like strawberry ,control
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together ,control
I put it on there ,control
and then I take that a sandwich ,control
and I put it in the microwave ,control
and I heat it so_that the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together ,control
I still have crunchy on the top ,control
but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm ,control
and then I eat that ,control
uh four years ago I uh uh had my knees replaced ,control
uh I had them both done at the same time ,control
it was uh scheduled for July the fifth ,control
uh however they uh fouled up on the scheduling so it wasn't done until the next week which is I think  July the eleventh or twelfth ,control
uh we  I went into the hospital uh at uh seven in the morning  six thirty or seven in the morning ,control
uh they prepped me ,control
and I went into the operating room about eight ,control
and uh woke up about eleven eleven fifteen uh with two new knees ,control
uh they told me to go ahead and use the  uh the uh morphine drip for pain ,control
and so that's what I did ,control
I used the morphine drip for pain ,control
and uh uh unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them I have a sensitivity to morphine ,control
and I  uh as I'm using this little button that you push every ten minutes ,control
I  uh I begin to see rats coming out_of of the wall ,control
uh I got real oozy ,control
uh and I passed out ,control
and uh the next thing I remember was the doctor standing over me saying ,control
 Bill Bill Bill ,control
 wake up wake up wake up ,control
and I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again ,control
and uh they took me to the emergency room ,control
and I  hadta stay in the emergency room for a little while or wherever they take you ,control
uh laughs you_know it was not in the recovery ,control
they run me down the hallway ,control
uh uh they uh were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that laughs sighs ,control
so  uh uh the next day I woke up ,control
and I was fine ,control
and uh they got me walking around ,control
and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees ,control
I did have some pain pills but it wasn't morphine ,control
and uh uh my knees  uh oh,control
ten days after I  I had my knees replaced I could walk ,control
do whatever I wanted to do ,control
uh I drove two weeks afterwards ,control
and uh I've had very very little problem with my knees since then ,control
except they don't have a_lot_of strength ,control
uh in getting up out_of this low chair that I'm sitting in right now I'm gonna have a hassle ,control
but uh uh it's  uh uh my knee replacement wa was very successful ,control
I would suggest ta ,control
that's it ,control
in October of nineteen ninety four my wife had a stroke ,control
and uh uh she was uh rushed to the hospital ,control
uh and uh then oh ambulanced ,control
uh I went  I followed her down and  s because I needed my car down there to go home ,control
and uh when we got there she was unable to move her right side and unable ta ,control
uh all she could say was ,control
 Bill ,control
 Bill Bill Bill ,control
 Bill Bill ,control
uh I found out later that she thought she was carrying on a regular conversation with me ,control
and uh she thought she was saying all the words that she should have said ,control
but all  cu all she could say was ,control
 Bill ,control
uh after about a week of that I told her that we were gonna hafta change the word that she knew ,control
so  uh we sit down ,control
and I says ,control
 okay  don't say Bill anymore ,control
 say bye ,control
so  Elaine began to say ,control
 bye ,control
then she'd say ,control
 bye bye  bye bye  bye bye  bye bye ,control
and uh that's what she still kind_of says sometimes when she gets uh flustrated ,control
but normally that's gone now ,control
she doesn't use that anymore ,control
she still has aphasia ,control
she still goes to the speech therapy ,control
she still cannot speak ,control
uh this is in two thousand and nine ,control
so  we've lived with this for uh fifteen years now ,control
and uh uh we get along ,control
uh I kind_of know what she's gonna say ,control
you_know  after you've been together long enough well  you kind_of figure out what the other one's wanting to talk about ,control
and she's very good at using alternate communication skills ,control
uh spelling words ,control
uh uh inflections on the few words that she can say ,control
and uh doing things that uh allow you to figure out what she's trying to say ,control
uh she still has trouble  just saying the most simple words ,control
this morning when we got up why uh we were in the bathroom ,control
and she was trying to tell me I always put a rubberband around the bottom of the toothpaste ,control
and we had a new coo toothpaste  thing ,control
and it needed a rubberband at the bottom of it ,control
because it had  we hadn't started rolling it up yet ,control
and it took her  two minutes ,control
when I get the newspaper in the morning I take a rubberband and put it on the handle of my chair ,control
and so it took her two minutes to tell me to go in and get a rubberband off my chair and put it on the toothpaste ,control
I had a rough time figuring out what she was trying to tell me  this morning to get ,control
you_know  she'd started spelling chair ,control
 chak ,control
and then she'd say ,control
 cheese ,control
and then she'd  you_know everything that had chq in it was the words that she used ,control
she'd never use chair ,control
and once she did get out chair I didn't know what the heck she was talking about ,control
and so uh then we finally understood I  s then she picked up the  the toothpaste ,control
and uh bent it over ,control
and says ,control
 chair ,control
and then I knew that she wanted me to go get a rubberband off the chair ,control
and put it on the toothpaste ,control
so  we still have trouble ,control
uh but uh normally we get along pretty good ,control
clears_throat I did tell her not ta ,control
we're not a depressed family ,control
so  uh we don't get depressed ,control
uh one of the things  she was starting to get depressed saying she was gonna die ,control
and I says ,control
 listen ,control
 you don't know when you're gonna die ,control
 I don't know when I'm gonna die ,control
 so  as long as we're here we just  we'll take  make the best of it ,control
and we've pretty much done that since then ,control
coughs excuse me coughs ,control
huh ,control
nope that's it ,control
cin Cinderella's uh mother died when she was a young girl ,control
and her father remarried to a lady that had two other daughters ,control
oh,control
so  uh they treated Cinderella very badly ,control
they made her clean up the house ,control
they made her do the cooking ,control
they made her do the mopping of the floor and everything ,control
Cinderella uh didn't   didn't have a great life compared to the other daughters ,control
but she got along with it ,control
she was fine with it ,control
oh,control
she knew them ,control
and  and some of the other animals ,control
th some of the birds ,control
she was a happy girl ,control
some of the  the blue birds and the people like that ,control
they really enjoyed her ,control
uh and she enjoyed them ,control
um there was uh an edict from the  uh there was a king and a prince and a  king queen and a prince that was the head of the land ,control
and uh the prince was a_little gay ,control
he didn't uh he  he wasn't uh uh into girls all that much ,control
and so uh uh the king says ,control

 I don't like any of these girls ,control
and he says  the king says ,control

so  uh uh they send out an edict and an invite to all the young girls all over the  all over the  the land ,control
and uh the th those  godmother and the two stepdaughters uh they got the edict ,control
and they're gonna go ,control
and one of them is gonna be  they're sure one of them is gonna be the new  the new uh princess ,control
so  the uh prince comes along ,control
and oh uh Cinderella wants to go ,control

 you can't go ,control
 it's impossible for you to go ,control
 you're too ugly ,control
 you don't have any nice clothes ,control
 uh forget about it ,control

so  uh the princess was or  uh Cinderella was very sad at the time ,control
and she was uh feeling pretty low ,control
she was around the house ,control
and uh poofo out comes her fairy godmother ,control
and not knowing that she even had a fairy godmother ,control
uh she says to the fairy godmother ,control

and the fairy godmother says ,control

she says ,control
 I think I can get you to the   to the uh ball tonight ,control
and Cinderella says ,control
 no ,control
she says ,control
 I'm not gonna be able to to that ,control
she says ,control
 I don't have a dress ,control
 I don't have any way to get there ,control
she says ,control
 it's just gonna be a big drag ,control
and uh the fairy godmother says ,control
 well  I think I can make that happen ,control
so  she takes her magic wand ,control
and she poofso ,control
and Cinderella is in a new dress ,control
and uh Cinderella looks at her ,control
and say ,control
 hey that's pretty good but my hair is a mess ,control
so  the godmother goes poofo ,control
and Cinderella has a great bouffant hairdo laughs ,control
and so uh ci Cinderella says ,control
 well  this is pretty darn good ,control
 I  I think I  yeah  this is gonna be pretty nice ,control
 however  I have no way to get there ,control
well  there was a few little mice sitting over in the corner ,control
and laughs they were watching all of this ,control
and uh the fairy godmother goes over to them ,control
and goes poofo ,control
and turns them into six white horses ,control
and there's still no carriage ,control
uh Cinderella still didn't wanna ride on the back of the horses in this new white dress ,control
so  the godmother says ,control
 well  I can fix that too ,control
so  she goes over to a pumpkin ,control
and she goes poofo and turns a pumpkin into a carriage ,control
Cinderella being the  uh uh the person that uh uh knows a good thing when she sees it jumps into the  carriage ,control
and the godmother says ,control
 now listen Cinderella ,control
 you're gonna have a great time tonight ,control
 there's no problem ,control
 you'll  you'll do really good ,control
 but you gotta be home by midnight ,control
and Cinderella says ,control
 that's kind_of an early curfew I  uh especially on a main party like this tonight ,control
and the godmother says ,control
 I know I know but this  everything changes at midnight ,control
 and I'll hafta start all over again ,control
 you're gonna turn into a  coughs a scrub lady again at midnight if you don't get out_of there ,control
 and then we'd hafta start all over again ,control
 and  and you don't wanna be sitting in the middle of this ball looking like a scrubber lady ,control
so  the princess says ,control
 oh  oh  I understand ,control
I  I know what's going on now ,control
so  she gets to the ball ,control
and uh the prince uh who is not taken by any girls ,control
he simply doesn't like girls ,control
uh they're all there ,control
and uh he's looking around ,control
and  whammo ,control
Cinderella comes in ,control
and she changes his whole train of thought on girls ,control
laughs so  uh uh she  because she's  she is  she's quite striking ,control
and uh so uh he says ,control
 well  maybe I can take this one out for a night ,control
and so he begins to dance with her ,control
and all the other girls are kind_of sitting over there by themselves ,control
and the king he's pretty happy with himself because he thinks he's finally found a girl that the prince may be able to like ,control
so  uh the king he's happy ,control
the queen's happy ,control
the prince is pretty happy too ,control
and Cinderella is ecstatic ,control
but bef before they know it it's eleven fifty nine and forty five seconds ,control
and they're still dancing ,control
and she says ,control
 oh  I gotta get out_of here or I'm gonna turn into a chore woman right in front of the prince ,control
and so uh she says ,control
 Prince I gotta leave and I gotta leave now ,control
and he says ,control
 do you needta go to the bathroom or you needta xxx ,control
 no ,control
she says ,control
 I just gotta leave ,control
 I gotta get out_of of here ,control
and so uh he says ,control
 well  b wait just a minute let me get your name ,control
and she says ,control
 no  it's Cinderella ,control
that's all you need ,control
that's all I can tell ya ,control
and she runs down the stairs ,control
and as she's running down the stairs she loses her  her slipper ,control
which happens to be glass by the way ,control
oh,control
now she's wobbling down the stairs ,control
and she jumps into her magic uh carriage ,control
and begins to ride home ,control
and through sheer luck she makes it out_of the eyes of the prince before the  the uh final gong of twelve ,control
and the  the  the pumpkin does turn back or  the carriage turns back into the pumpkin ,control
the mice turn back into or  the horses turn back into mice ,control
uh Cinderella is back into her char w or  chore woman's dress ,control
her bouffant hairdo is all straggly again ,control
and she walks home about half the way because she did get out_of the sight of the prince ,control
and she walks home ,control
and she gets home ,control
and says ,control
 well  that was a pretty good night ,control
 uh probably won't hear from that guy again because I can kind_of tell maybe he was not all there either ,control
so  uh uh so  the prince he gets up the next morning ,control
he says ,control
 hey ,control
says ,control
 I think I could go for that gal ,control
so  ye and all he has is a glass slipper  slipper ,control
so  he tells all of his people ,control
he says ,control
 listen we gotta find that girl ,control
and so uh they go out ,control
and they begin to look ,control
and they check all around ,control
and they come up to Cinderella's house ,control
and the two  the two stepdaughters are there ,control
and the two stepdaughters uh they come out and they look ,control
and they say ,control
 oh  I know I can get that shoe on ,control
 and if I can get that shoe on bammo I'm gonna be the princess ,control
so  the prince is standing around ,control
and uh he says ,control
 well ,control
he says ,control
 you don't really look like the one I was dancing with last night or  last week but uh here try on the shoe ,control
let's see what it  if it works ,control
and the first one tries it on and it's too big ,control
her foot won't fit into a size ten army shoe ,control
and uh uh the second one comes over ,control
and she tries it ,control
she can't get in it either ,control
and the prince says ,control
 hey is there any other girls around you_know  around the house here ,control
and they say ,control
 nope there isn't anybody ,control
and Cinderella on the other hand is looking from the kitchen where she's scrubbing the floors ,control
and she hears this ,control
and uh the prince says ,control
 wait a minute I just saw somebody in the kitchen ,control
and they said ,control
 oh  that's  that's our stepdaughters ,control
 she doesn't  she  you don't even wanna see her ,control
 she's too ugly ,control
and so he goes in ,control
and she is  she's pretty straggled ,control
her hair's all  all a flutter ,control
she's in a charwoman's dress ,control
and uh he says ,control
 well  I don't know ,control
 she looks a_little familiar ,control
 you_know if she had a good bouffant hairdo and a white dress I'd probably recognize her ,control
so  he tries on  the  slipper on the Cinderella ,control
and it fits fits like a glove ,control
and he says ,control

and she says ,control

and so they get  he  he picks her up ,control
he takes her over to his carriage ,control
and they go back to the castle ,control
