oh_my  looks like a family's having another picnic ,control
boy  they got a_lot_of picnics in this project  don't they ,control
anyways they went out to the country,control
and they're hanging out underneath the tree ,control
and uh looks like the cat ,control
what kind of a name for the cat ,control
let's call this cat Lindsey ,control
Lindsey the cat climbs up the tree ,control
and of_course everyone's worried about the cat ,control
so  even the dog is worried about the cat ,control
he's trying to kit ,control
and Daddy climbs up the tree to get the cat ,control
and then the ladder falls down ,control
sighs so fortunately someone has their cellphone ,control
and they call the fire department ,control
and the fire charten ,control
and gets the cat down from the tree ,control
and the little girl named Molly she's really happy now ,control
and they all go for ice cream and live happily ever after ,control
well  the last time I was hospitalized I was five ,control
so  what I'll do instead is I'll tell you about swine flu ,control
so  about a month ago  oh let's see was  I was out to dinner with friends ,control
and um was kind_of tired ,control
so  anyways I went home about shrugs eleven o'clock ,control
and then Sunday kind_of was all achy and just slept all day  pretty much ,control
I think I was like not sleeping for two hours ,control
but for some reason I just didn't shrugs head,control
you_know  I  w I'm oblivious to these things ,control
like when you're not married you don't have a wife that tells ya ,control
 go to the doctor ,control
so  went to work on Monday,control
and ended up drink  noticed I drank must have  like fifteen cups of tea ,control
and it was like ,control
 yeah you're probably sick ,control
 but yeah you're not ,control
 so  you stayed all day ,control
and then Tuesday I woke up feeling totally crap sighs ,control
in bed all day ,control
stayed home from work ,control
same thing Wednesday ,control
 and then Thursday morning I  f f uh Wednesday actually I called made an appointment for the doctor ,control
and Thursday I canceled the doctor appointment thinking ,control
 we,control
inhales and went to work ,control
and then by Thursday afternoon was sick again ,control
had really bad sore throat Thursday night ,control
inhales went to the doctor Friday ,control
and the doctor sa,control
 yeah  you got swine flu probably ,control
 but since you've had it for a week there's nothing we do about it ,control
 so  just go home and drink liquids and chicken soup and whatever ,control
inhales bad sore throat Friday night ,control
slept all day Saturday ,control
slept all day Sunday ,control
inhales a,control
went to work Monda,control
and then still kind_of felt tired the rest of  the rest of the week ,control
and that shrugs was swine flu ,control
so  it wasn't as traumatic as I thought it would be ,control
but still felt like crap shrugs ,control
frightened or scared ,control
 oh  hand,control
and this is why probably I pass out when I have blood tests ,control
inhales when I was five ,control
and that was actually the second from last time was in the hospital ,control
I was six was the last time I was in the hospital ,control
when I was five I went to the hospital for an eye operation ,control
look in the camera looks,control
inhales anyway  um  thee ,control
who you_know asked the questions ,control
and then she said ,control
 we're gonna poke your finger ,control
 and take a blood test ,control
and  she reached around her neck ges,control
ges,control
and attached to the cross was a needle ,control
and she rubbed it with alcohol ges,control
and jabbed ges,control
and then took ges,control
and I just thought  you_know thinking back ,control
that is the most bizarre thing that can ever happen ,control
I_mean it can turn you off to finger,control
inhales finger,control
so  there's my fear story ,control
since that day I do not do blood tests ,control
I haven't had a blood test since  I think  I was six head,control
 yup my mom ,control
she had um CBGD  I think it is ,control
inhales well  it was progressive ,control
she started out  she said she noticed it when she was like in her mid forties ,control
she was like an office manager secretary and ,control
but you_know whatever hand,control
she just kind_of got on with it ,control
and over  th ta over time she just kind_of talked a little bit slower ,control
and would use you_know shorter sentences ,control
and um course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic ges,control
so  hand,control
 but eventually you_know it was,control
they didn't really diagnosis it for awhile ,control
and then she went to University_of_Michigan where they have this inhales um neurology or aphasia center ,control
some type of where they do a_lot_of research in it ,control
thing is she didn't like the doctor ,control
and she told him to  fuck off hand,control
inhales so  um didn't really get um the whole research thing on it ,control
but over time um  she you_know just got less and less communicative ,control
inhales uh they thought she was having mini strokes for awhile ,control
 a,control
it was actually the evening of her sister's funeral ,control
they went out to dinner ,control
inhales and she passed out ,control
and they rushed her to the hospital ,control
inhales and um  the doctor ,control
well  the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital ,control
inhales after she woke up  that evening she was talking perfectly normal ,control
 I_mean it  it you_know had gone away ges,control
she could full sentences and  as if  if she'd  nothing happened ges,control
like take ges,control
inhales she went to bed that night ,control
she woke up ,control
and then she was back to where she was  before ges it happened ,control
so  noone could figure that one out ,control
but meanwhile the doctor pulled her driver's license because she passed out ,control
and you_know considered a seizure or something ,control
and that really pissed her off ,control
then she took her  my dad hadta take away the keys ,control
she actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up ,control
and we actually kept her car  until she died ,control
she  we couldn't sell her car because you_know ,control
 when you get better Mom you can have your car back ,control
but eventually she ended up losing muscle control ,control
and you_know she was we working with a walker ,control
inhales and then within a year after that she was in a wheelchair ,control
she was in the nursing home for about the last  year and a half ,control
and when she went in the nursing home she could still speak three or four  sentence or  three or four word sentences ,control
and towards the end she could get you_know one or two words out ,control
but the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time ,control
and um then eventually she died shrugs ,control
she just decided she was not gonna eat ,control
and she didn't eat ,control
and the last  that was it ,control
nyup no  it's  it's  you_know kind_of brought the whole family together ,control
I_mean there's funny stories about it ,control
I knew th she had decided not to eat ,control
and you_know like one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge massive breakfast because she useta love to eat ,control
and you_know we hadta tell her ,control
 nope  Jean's decided she's not eating today shrugs ,control
so  I_mean it was all kinds of stories about it ,control
but shrugs  so that's my story about that ,control
lib Cinderella ,control
inhales well  there was this little girl named Cinderella who is like  really cute little girl ,control
an,control
I think she went to the  uh the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years ,control
and so Cinderella inhales hadta go move in with her uh evil stepmother ,control
inhales and  um and her evil stepmother had  two uh other daughters ,control
and the evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but didn't like Cinderella ,control
inhales so   Cinderella and  um you_know they're just  this  this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house ,control
she's gotta clean the floors and  vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff ,control
inhales so  anyways  you_know  the mom and the stepgirls they're kind_of reading the mail ,control
a,control
like the prince is like this totally hot dude ,control
where Cinder ,control
it's like he is like on television all the time ,control
and she knows what he looks like ,control
and is like  really wants to dance with him and stuff ,control
but the evil stepmother says ,control
 no you're not getting a dress ,control
you_know  it's like you_know ,control
 you're a cleaning girl ,control
 and you stay home ,control
 and you_know clean the attic and stuff ,control
 while  me and your stepsisters we're gonna go to the ball ,control
so  shey ,control
and they get  a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelery and new shoes and everything ,control
and they go out to get ready to go to the ball ,control
inhales meanwhile poor Cinderella she's up in the attic ,control
and she's crying while they're all going away ,control
inhales and um  she's kind_of just wishing ,control
 wish I could go to the mall or  to the ball ,control
and all_of_a_sudden um her fairy godmother appears ,control
and uh Brunhilda the fairy godmother inhales says ,control
 what's  what's the deal dyuh Cinderella ,control
 what are you so upset about ,control
and Cinderella says ,control
 I wish I could go to the ball because I really like this prince guy ,control
 and I like to dance ,control
 and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff ,control
 but that evil stepmother of mine won't let me go ,control
inhales so  anyways  there's  the   the   the uh fairy godmother you_know gets out the wand and  touches Cinderella ,control
and all_of_a_sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty gown  ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking ,control
inhales and then they go out in the garden ,control
and they dig up a pumpkin ,control
and she kind_of does the pumpkin ,control
and inhales turns the pumpkin into a carriage ,control
and then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the barn into these really cool horses that pulls the buh carriage ,control
and  because you hafta pull up the castle in a carriage or they won't let you into the ball ,control
 so  anyways inhales they get into the  ksh she gets into the pumpkin ,control
and the fairy godmother even put some like uh air freshener in there so it didn't smell like a pumpkin ,control
inhales and they went to the ball ,control
and they got to the castle ,control
and they were able to sneak in ,control
an,control
and  you_know the fairy  godmo er the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters ,control
they're kind_of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her ,control
and even when they see her they don't even think it's her because she's so pretty ,control
inhales anyways the prince comes in ,control
and inhales  you_know they have the dance ,control
and they're all dancing around ,control
and he inhales uh sees Cinderella kind_of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says ,control
 I don't know who you are ,control
 who you ,control
and she s ,control
 well  I'm Cinderella ,control
inhales and he says ,control
 well  would you like to dance ,control
inhales and she says ,control
 well  I don't  not sure  I'm not sure I know how to dance but I'd love to try ,control
inhales but she doesn't really know that the stepmother  th er the uh fairy godmother  put a spell on the shoes ,control
so  anyone in the shoes can like dance like magic ,control
like and on top of that  the shoes will only fit Cinderella ,control
so  like Cinderella dances really well ,control
inhales and of_course the prince falls in love with her ,control
and you_know they talk schmoozy things ,control
and they're already talking about having kids ,control
and inhales  you_know kind of car should they get ,control
and what's she gonna to when she turns queen and stuff ,control
and inhales they're gonna get married ,control
but  then Cinderella finally remembers that the fairy godmother warned her that all the stuff turns back to what it useta be at midnight ,control
 inhales except for the shoes for some reason but they never told her that ,control
but  the pumpkin turns into a pumpkin ,control
and the horse turns into an ugly horse ,control
and the dress turns into rags at midnight ,control
and the clock starts chiming so they go running away ,control
or she runs the downstairs ,control
and runs home ,control
and she gets like around the corner just in time when all her clothes turn to rags ,control
inhales and the prince is like totally dumbfounded ,control
it's like ,control
 whoa this babe was for me ,control
 and all_of_a_sudden she's gone ,control
inhales so  he's like in a total state of depression ,control
meanwhile  his father's like saying ,control
 you gotta marry one of these other  two ges,control
because you_know she's got lots of money ,control
inhales and the prince says ,control
 no way ,control
 I'm gonna go look for her ,control
so  anyways inhales he finds one  er one of her shoes ,control
 and inhales goes to every house in the village ,control
and makes all the girls try it on ,control
he's a prince so he can make people do things like that  you_know ,control
inhales so  anyways  he finds Cinderella ,control
knocks on the door inhales and ,control
actually  Cinderella doesn't answer the door the sisters do ,control
an,control
 well  we'll try it on ,control
and it turns out like one sister wears like a size fifteen ,control
and the other sister inhales has shoes so big that they hafta be custom made ,control
inhales and then the mom even tr or  the stepmom even tries to try them on ,control
and course her feet have got big corns so she can't try them on ,control
inhales then Cinderella inhales she's like hiding in the back ,control
kind_of quivering while the  you_know this is all going on ,control
and the prince sees her and says ,control
 inhales you look kind_of like her except you look kind_of dumpy today ,control
 looks like your dress is gone ,control
 but why don't you try this on ,control
inhales and she comes out ,control
and the stepmother says ,control
 no  get back there ,control
and the prince says ,control
 no  she's trying it on or you're going to jail  lady ,control
 so  just shut up ,control
inhales so  Cinderella tries the schipper ,control
inhales and then when she turns the slipper on ,control
inhales this is me adlibbing ,control
it's not part of the story ,control
but all_of_a_sudden the dress comes back on ,control
the prince sees her ,control
and they hug and kiss ,control
inhales and they get married in the cathedral in the big city ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
 okay  let's  well  let's see if we can throw some humor into this tragedy here ,control
we had  oh  it looks like we had two people that were going for a drive ,control
and they saw a wash ,control
and they decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it ,control
because they're really cool ,control
and they can do these things ,control
and of_course the four wheel drive got run over ,control
and they uh got washed off the truck and into the flood ,control
and fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck ,control
so  they grab that on ,control
and it ooks ,control
and she is um  holding on to him ,control
and hopefully the police are gonna come and rescue them ,control
or it could be that this guy's actually a fireman trying to rescue her ,control
and she was the one that drove the truck into the wash ,control
can't say for sure but ,control
inhales looks like they're hanging on to the tree ,control
and you_know maybe they're going to make it maybe they're not ,control
but  well let's assume that they do ,control
they do make it ,control
and they   Sheriff Joe arrests them for five thousand dollar fine for doing the stupid driver law ,control
driving through a middle of a wash ,control
but th after that they live happily ever after ,control
okay  it looks like ,control
let's get a name for this stupid looking kid here ,control
Reginald ,control
Reginald decides he's gonna go out to play ,control
so  he goes out in the front garden ,control
and he's playing with his football ,control
soccer's what they call it in America ,control
and he's not very skilled because he's an American ,control
and he's not like British or German or anything ,control
and he kicks it in the window of uh his neighbor ,control
and uh kid's actually pretty ,control
well  a doesn't  s don't see the kid anywhere ,control
looks like the kid ran away ,control
inhales so  looks like the neighbor's really pissed off because the window  it not only came through his window ,control
broke his lamp ,control
and he's looking out the window to seeing if the kid is going to confess up to it or run away ,control
and well we just don't know what happened ,control
whether that happened ,control
inhales let's assume the worst ,control
and let's say that the,control
and stecide ,control
and calls the cop in ,control
let's get Sheriff Joe in this again ,control
and the kid come ,control
Sheriff Doe ,control
turns out the kid's an illegal immigrant and gets deported ,control
life's hard but that's it is ,control
 well  it looks like ,control
oh  let's get a kid for this  name for this stupid looking little kid here ,control
oh  we'll name him after my nephew Eric ,control
looks like Eric is gonna go to school ,control
and his mom of_course is saying ,control
 you know what ,control
 I think it's time that you take the umbrella ,control
 because I'm guessing it's gonna rain out ,control
inhales and he says ,control
 no  Mom  I don't want the umbrella imit,control
anyways  somehow he gets out_of the house ,control
mom forces him to take the umbrella ,control
but then he hides it underneath the  inhales the  uh the car ,control
and he goes off to school ,control
and guess what ,control
of_course mom is right ,control
inhales and it starts raining ,control
and so he kind_of like gets halfway to school ,control
and then he comes running home to mom crying because he's all wet ,control
and mom kind_of gives him a lecture ,control
and doesn't let him have ,control
you_know  she actually reaches into his backpack and takes out the wa brownie she'd given him take for dessert at lunch and says ,control
 no  you can't have any brownies you naughty little kid ,control
inhales and gives him the umbrella ,control
and makes him go back to school ,control
and poor Eric then hasta go to school without any brownies because he didn't listen head,control
