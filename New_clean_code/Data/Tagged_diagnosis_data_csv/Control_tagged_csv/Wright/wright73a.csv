but uh  she did come  with the  with the friend ,control
and lips_smack found out how serious it was and so for ,control
but ges I would make it head,control
but it would take time head,control
inhales so  that's,control
but I'm slowly trying  ges see I forget the date ,control
 because I know it's you_know head,control
I wanna say in the nineties shrugs or something like that ,control
I  I'm taking a guess head,control
but uh you could never forget that ,control
and I could never bend ges,control
the right foot is always gonna be stiff ,control
that's why I gotta wear special shoes looks,control
and uh  the left foot is alright points,control
but uh the scar on my right foot points,control
they took something off my stomach points,control
and you_know grafted  it ges,control
and uh exhales tried to put it  inhales they saved the foot  okay ,control
inhales the  he  the doctor told me later on if it was six weeks sooner they would've hadta amputate it head,control
but because they have discovered ges something head,control
inhales but I wouldn't be able to use that foot head,control
but you'd ha,control
so  that's what they used head,control
and uh to this day I can't head,control
I hafta wear special shoes ,control
inhales you_know I go to a special sh uh shoe place ,control
and I try to get shoes that match ges you_know head,control
 but uh they're little bigger head,control
you_know  the right foot points,control
sniffs and uh shrugs I've been able to hits_walker live with a walker head,control
and that's the way shrugs I'll be living ,control
and uh that's something I could never forget ,control
 but I'm thankful that my daughter exhales  came through head,control
but she remembers the accident points ,control
I remember nothing ges,control
lips_smack and she told me about it ,control
what she found points and wh you_know all this stuff ,control
and uh  so I could never forget that really totally ,control
but uh you_know I'm thankful ,control
I'm thankful to be alive ,control
I never thought I would make it head,control
when I saw  when they told me what was wrong with me I said ,control
 uh  shrugs what am I living for head,control
you_know  sniffs  I mean ,control
 how are they gonna keep me alive ,control
but uh that's  head,control
then they had pins ges,control
inhales and I couldn't walk up the steps ges,control
so  I hadta stay in the  bottom floor ges,control
inhales that's where I stayed ,control
and my daughter fixed up the room and inhales uh brought things for me to eat ,control
but I couldn't head,control
and uh  there was a bathroom there points  fortunately ,control
inhales but uh at that time I  I was using  oh I points,control
I had a cane ,control
lips_smack so  I hadta use a cane very carefully when I did walk ges,control
but it was very painful head,control
but I couldn't walk up steps ges,control
inhales and I hadta just take it ges remove bandages and things like that head,control
inhales but uh came through it alright ,control
and here I am ,control
 thank_you ,control

inhales now ,control
oh alright when my father came after me ,control
when I was a young girl ,control
 he was fixing a  a lamp ges,control
and he says ,control

 what could happen shrugs if I pull the switch down ,control
 looks,control
and I pull ges,control
well  he came down ges,control
and th I ran under  ges we had beds ,control

and he took off his strap touches,control
you_know  and ges,control
ges one of these things ,control
you_know  you hear it ,control

I  I says ,control

so  he went outside ges,control
and he took a cigarette ,control
while he went outside  I came out ges from under the bed ,control
ca ran ges outside somewhere head,control
I was walking up and down the street ges ,control
inhales and then I saw him head,control
and he forgot head,control
 don't you ever finger,control
but he never head,control
just scolded head,control
so  I was frightened that I'd get hit  head,control
and the way he yelled ,control
he usually didn't yell ges,control
when he yelled at me ,control
sniffs and then hearing that imit,control
that was enough  to scare head,control
and it sure scared head,control
inhales to this day I don't like to hear ges,control
because I think ,control
 who's gonna get hit looks laughs ,control
so  that was one   head,control
 yes head,control
inhales I had a problem with a  a person that couldn't speak English ,control
so  at that time I could speak Ukranian head,control
but uh this lady was from that Scandanavian country ,control
and uh uh she was  she wanted something head,control
and I didn't know head,control
and she was no good with her hands ges because that was going all over the place laughs ,control
but uh she tried to talk ,control
inhales and uh she garbled so much ges with her voice ,control
she didn't head,control
inhales so  I'm trying to help her to get her what she wants ,control
and she was in ges,control
she had visited my mother ,control
and my mother could understand her ges ,control
but I couldn't head,control
I was still very young head,control
inhales lips_smack and uh finally  I asked her in Ukranian ,control
do you want water head,control
 and she looked at me as if she didn't ges know what water is  head,control
but she was thirsty head,control
so  I waited for her response ,control
and I looked at her face ,control
and I went to the sink ges,control
and I put it you_know in ges,control
and I brought it to her ges,control
I says ,control
 worst she can do is throw it at me ,control
inhales laughs  so I give her the glass of water and she drank it ges,control
and she thanked me head,control
that ges I could understand ,control
 but there I had a difficult head,control
inhales but trying to help ges somebody ,control
and even if I knew the language ges it didn't head,control
inhales you_know except that I put it together ges very simply ges ,control
 and she head,control
she was alright head,control
 it looks like a   a tree ,control
 is that water all around ,control
 no clue ,control
but he's got a_lot_of gear on points,control
 okay  shrugs I'll start ,control
they were on a boat ,control
I'm taking this as water head,control
 although I didn't know how leva ges ,control
alright they were on  in a boat ,control
and it capsized ,control
they were near to the ges,control
they were near to land ,control
where there was branches ges,control
and this man was all ges prepared for any emer ,control
he has muscles ges,control
inhales so  he's strong ,control
sniffs and he's holding on to this limb that's over ges,control
but they're still ges in the water ,control
the water is ges still circling around them ,control
inhales and there's a woman next to him ,control
inhales girlfriend wife shrugs could be anyone ,control
and inhales he is holding on ,control
you can see his muscles ges are uh  points,control
inhales and points,control
but  the lady  doesn't look like she has any points,control
and there's some kind of  points,control
as if he's going to give her that to put on ,control
to help her to get out_of the water ,control
 and then she's trying to see where she can hold on to him ,control
and he says ,control
 head,control
and that's how they're uh securing themselves ,control
sniffs and then he pulls her slowly points,control
and because he was so strong and points,control
inhales he was able to get out and pull her out ,control
so  the beginning is uh watch the waters ,control
and if you see it bad head,control
inhales and be sure that you're dressed points,control
and if you capsize don't panic ,control
 do you know what that is points_picture that picture ,control
is it water ,control
is it a man that's ,control

because of the equipment points_picture there ,control
but how would it be in the middle of the ocean there or lake ,control

sniffs and uh he gets up very carefully because there's points,control
and he picks up the soccer ball ,control
and he looks outside the g points,control
inhales and he sees his son  sniffs had kicked it in there sniffs ,control
now he hasta determine what is he going to do ,control
first of all he knows he knows he's gonna see if the boy is alright ,control

inhales uh and he's gotta find points,control
inhales and then he's gonna tell the boy not to kick the ball near points,control
to be kicking it points,control
he's teaching him a lesson ,control
but he didn't get excited because accidents like that can happen ,control
inhales so  he just teaches the boy ,control
 next time don't do it ,control
 and I'm glad points,control
 inhales the glass ges ca ,control
 inhales and uh we'll clean ges up here ,control
 and get that all straightened out ,control
