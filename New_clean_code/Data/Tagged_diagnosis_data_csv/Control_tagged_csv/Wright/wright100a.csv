the cat got up in the tree ,control
and she couldn't get him to come back down ,control
so  her dad went out to try and help ,control
got the ladder climbed the tree ,control
then the ladder fell over ,control
so  he's now stuck in the tree with the cat ,control
and the dog is barking ,control
but he can't really climb the tree to help ,control
so  the firemen have showed up with a tall ladder to save the man and the cat ,control
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need um some really good high quality sprouted grain bread ,control
maybe ges,control
so  then you'd take two slices ,control
and you wanna get um a nice high quality peanut butter ,control
preferably just peanuts ,control
maybe a little bit of salt ,control
nice organic ,control
and then you can spread the peanut butter ges,control
and then for your jelly you could actually use a preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself so it's got really pure high quality ingredients ,control
and you would just ges,control
and then you would introduce the two slices to each other hands,control
and you have a sandwich ,control
in elementary school I was rollerblading with my aunt ,control
and she took off down a hill points ,control
and I went behind her points ,control
and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone touches,control
but I didn't really feel it at all ,control
I didn't feel any pain or anything ,control
I was just happy I had like avoided traces,control
but when I looked down and saw all the blood spreads,control
 oh ,control
and then I kicked into like a pain association ,control
so  I hadta go get stitches ,control
and a large man carried me into a wheelchair ,control
and it was awkward ,control
um,control
and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front ,control
and she was  um I think she was pretty spun on something else ,control
and she was just shouting having fights with everybody ,control
so  she came over and um attacked us ,control
and my friend was  she was trying to attack one of my friends ,control
so  we were trying to get in the way and um ges stop her from doing that ,control
and during the whole commotion as we were trying to separate this really upset woman um a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with like just a ges,control
and  um and then he was actually ,control
because my friend then got really pissed off because that was her boyfriend ,control
and she was just kinda screaming ,control
and he was about to knock her out ,control
so  that was a little bit high tension ,control
hadta break that up and call the cops and all that ,control
um I've had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they can't really have a genuine conversation with you because they can't get around their own ,control
just very self oriented kind_of selfish in a way ,control
can't really have a two person conversation because they don't move past a certain point in their mind ,control
they just loop the track and go right back to another place ,control
yeah  I try to just um be patient and um continually try to open those doors of communication ,control
so   it's  it's my mother ,control
so  laughs it's a lifetime process ,control
but maybe in the next twenty years or something laughs we can talk ,control
so  there's a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better ,control
and he still hasn't quite learned ,control
so  as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house ,control
and there's a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened ,control
so  there is a little boy getting ready for school ,control
and his mom comes up and says ,control
 don't you wanna take your umbrella ,control
and he says ,control
 no ,control
he's asserting his independence and making decisions for himself ,control
so  he doesn't wanna take his mother's good advice ,control
he goes out for the day and realizes that it's raining  raining very very hard ,control
there are puddles everywhere ,control
it's really uncomfortable to be that wet ,control
so  he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels a_lot better because now he has some weather protection ,control
so  there is a little girl whose mother has died ,control
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her ,control
so  she's introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters ,control
she's excited ,control
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean ,control
and the stepmother is very cruel ,control
so  all the years as she's raised with them during the beginning few years it's  it's okay ,control
it's not great ,control
and then her father dies ,control
and she's left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters ,control
and they basically make her to be a maid ,control
they're never very kind to her ,control
and she hasta do all the work on the farm ,control
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food ,control
so  there's also in the same area um a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle ,control
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince ,control
so  he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region ,control
so  an invitation for a ball so_that the prince can choose a bride ,control
and they get this invitation at Cinderella's house ,control
the stepmother reads it ,control
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited ,control
they wanna go meet this handsome prince ,control
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess ,control
so  they get ready for the ball ,control
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball ,control
she wants to go dance and have fun ,control
so  she hangs out with all her little animal friends and s is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball ,control
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that she's not allowed to go ,control
she's not going to go ,control
they rip off all of her jewelry ,control
they tear apart her dress ,control
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as_well ,control
so  Cinderella's very sad ,control
she doesn't know what to do ,control
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny ,control
so  she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride creates a beautiful dress for her gives her these delightful glass slippers and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball ,control
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was ,control
so  Cinderella goes and is very excited ,control
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night ,control
and the stepsisters are very jealous ,control
they don't know who this woman even is ,control
and she's having a great time ,control
but then she realizes that this  the clock is about to strike ,control
and so she runs in such a hurry ,control
and the prince goes after her like ,control
 wait reaches,control
 you can't leave ,control
 why are you leaving ,control
and she just says ,control
 I hafta go ,control
and she leaves ,control
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind ,control
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to  the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe ,control
so  Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe ,control
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive ,control
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house ,control
but it doesn't fit the fat foot of the sister ,control
it doesn't fit the fat foot of the other sister ,control
and it sure doesn't fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother ,control
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella ,control
so  they know that she's the one that was at the party ,control
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after ,control
