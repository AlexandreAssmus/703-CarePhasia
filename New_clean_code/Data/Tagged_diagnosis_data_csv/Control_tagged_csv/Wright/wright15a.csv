um little boy was having a birthday ,control
he's either four or five ,control
uh and uh the mom was  left the cake for the birthday party out on the table ,control
and the dog came and ate a piece of it ,control
right as the guests were showing up for the party ,control
the mom was very angry at herself for leaving the cake out ,control
but she was gonna take it out on the dog by hitting him with the broom ,control
and the boy was sad because his cake got eaten and his mom was beating the dog ,control
um first you get the bread out_of the cupboard the peanut butter out_of the cupboard the jelly out_of the refrigerator ,control
uh you open the bag get the bread out ,control
two slices ,control
probably because you're holding them in your hand you now have get a plate to put the bread on ,control
put the bread down ,control
you open the jar of peanut butter ,control
get a knife out_of the drawer ,control
scoop the peanut butter ,control
spread the peanut butter on the bread ,control
um open the jar of jam jelly ,control
lick off the knife ,control
scoop the jelly from the jar ,control
put it on the bread ,control
fold it together ,control
eat ,control
really ,control
um I don't get sick very often ,control
never broke a bone and never been hospitalized really ,control
um the most recent tragic sickness I had ,control
I went to um the freshman camp for engineering students as a staff member ,control
and the cabin that we were in had fleas or bedbugs or something ,control
and I got bit all over and broke out into big rash hives ,control
and uh it was  that was quite traumatic ,control
uh I took three days off of work to stay at home because I didn't actually know that they were bug bites ,control
I thought I had chickenpox ,control
so  I went to a dermatologist and found out that no they were bug bites and very ,control
uh anyway so it was still traumatic ,control
when I did get back to work I found out that everybody who stayed in that cabin had similar experiences but probably not as bad as mine ,control
I just got eaten up ,control
and so it was awful ,control
yeah ,control
um times when I've hadta communicate with people from another country ,control
I went to a seminar once where there was a bunch of Brazilians who didn't speak English very well ,control
so  like all other ignorant Americans I talked louder and slower so that would help ,control
but they just didn't understand the words ,control
so  we usually hadta find someone to intermediate uh because of the language barrier ,control
um or I guess try different words that I guess  I thought they might understand better than the ones that I was using ,control
tell me the story ,control
um well  I was out  we lived uh uh ,control
I was a teenager late teenager ,control
probably  I think actually I was about nineteen eighteen ,control
had already graduated high school ,control
was out with a friend ,control
her father was the uh sheriff's deputy where we lived ,control
and he came to find me because he knew I was with his daughter ,control
and I found out that day that my brother had shot himself ,control
so  that was a little bit uh scary ,control
it was a_little unnerving ,control
um it's hard for me to remember how I felt back then because he ended up living in our  our li ,control
and he is  just has some problems now ,control
but he didn't die ,control
so  the resolve hel helps me not remember as much as when I was as scared or as intense ,control
but I'm sure at that moment that it was very unnerving ,control
it was scary for what might happen ,control
would he die or not ,control
we lived not close to a city and so he hadta be helicopter air evacked ,control
my parents were out_of town ,control
and my youngest brother was the one who found him after it had been quite awhile ,control
so  there was a_lot_of blood loss ,control
I'm sure I was scared ,control
I'm sure it was a tense moment anyway ,control
um in this story it looks like uh ,control
okay ,control
there was a big rainstorm ,control
lasted for many days ,control
there was a_lot_of flooding ,control
family was trying to get out_of their house a  or trying to get to safety ,control
one of the daughters got swept away in the river ,control
and grabbed onto a tree limb where the water was rushing and very violent ,control
it was a scary situation ,control
a nice paramedic or helicopter man as they were out searching for people um found where she was located or was notified where she was located ,control
and so he hadta be lowered below and drag himself across the water so_that he could rescue her ,control
okay ,control
a uh boy is out on a nice day playing soccer kicking a ball around ,control
and uh kicked one a little bit too hard hit a window broke it ,control
man was inside of his house ,control
when the ball hit the window it smashed into a lamp ,control
and picked up the ball and started to head out the door find out who kicked the ball through his window ,control
and uh  filed a home owner's insurance claim to get his window fixed ,control
told the boy to be more careful ,control
a boy like any other was ready to head out the door on his way to school ,control
and his mom said ,control
 hey why don't you take this umbrella with you ,control
and he said ,control
 no  Mom  I'm too cool for an umbrella ,control
 I'm just gonna go ,control
but as he headed out the door the rain started to fall just like his mom said it would ,control
he started to get wet ,control
so  he ran back home ,control
his mom was upset that he didn't listen to her ,control
but boys needta learn and to listen to their moms ,control
so  he changed his clothes and took the umbrella and headed back outside and was okay and dry ,control
uh once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella ,control
and she had happy life with her mother and her father ,control
and her mother died which was sad ,control
she grew up ,control
father decided to get remarried ,control
and he married a woman that had two other daughters as_well Cinderella's stepsisters ,control
and he was a busy man so he was always off politicking leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters ,control
and her stepmother wasn't very nice ,control
and as she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her ,control
and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them ,control
it wasn't a happy life ,control
one day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married ,control
and so the king said ,control
 Prince we're gonna have a ball so_that you can meet some uh ladies to be married ,control
an invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball ,control
and she was happy ,control
and so she was went to get ready for the ball ,control
and Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as_well but that Cinderella couldn't go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done ,control
which was kind_of disheartening because she wouldn't have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear ,control
so  the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people ,control
and she slaved away the day ,control
and so eventually it was time to go to the ball ,control
and Cinderella felt like she hadn't had time to get ready ,control
and the stepsisters and the mother were happy ,control
but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made ,control
and she was excited because then she could go to the ball ,control
so  she ran down the stairs to leave ,control
and the sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart ,control
so  she wasn't able to go in shambles ,control
and  while the stepmother stat ,control
and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince ,control
and uh as she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said uh that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out ,control
so  they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress ,control
and she was all ready to go to the ball ,control
and uh so she headed off ,control
and the prince danced with a few people but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really ,control
he was very infatuated ,control
the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal ,control
and so Cinder Cinderella lost track of time ,control
and it was about to strike midnight ,control
she realized what would happen and so she ran ,control
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers ,control
and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was ,control
she was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear ,control
so  she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper ,control
so  he was distraught ,control
the king and he uh hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit ,control
they worked long and hard uh the prince long and hard to find the person ,control
and when they arrived at Cinderella's house the stepmother locked Cinderella in a room so_that she couldn't try on the slipper because she suspected that Cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen ,control
and the stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper ,control
and it wouldn't fit ,control
and the mice snuck the key past Dragon the cat to open the door to let Cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say ,control
 but wait I can try it on ,control
and luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on ,control
but Cinderella produced the other slipper and said ,control
 well  here's the matching pair ,control
 I was the girl and it does fit ,control
so  they were very happy ,control
and Cinderella married the prince and they lived happily ever after ,control
uh in this picture  it's a  uh cat climbed a tree to try and catch a bird ,control
and the daughter knows that her cat was stuck in the tree so she went and got her dad ,control
the dad got stuck in the tree as_well ,control
and they hadta call the fireman to come and rescue  both probably from the tree ,control
