I  I had a big tumor a big fibroid tumor ,control
they told me not to get pregnant ,control
and uh I was gonna have surgery ,control
and so I was all set to have the surgery and like a week or three days before I went in for my final preop and they just hadta do a precautionary blood test ,control
and they found out I was pregnant ,control
and they were really upset with me ,control
and um I was thirty two years old so um I shoulda known better ,control
but um they told me that I would never be able to carry the baby ,control
I might as_well just eliminate the pregnancy ,control
but I just went ahead and said ,control
 I'll just leave it up to god ,control
and the whole time my doctor's like ,control
 don't get your hopes up ,control
 this baby um probably won't make it ,control
because I'd had like three miscarriages prior because of this tumor ,control
and so they told me never to go through train the  s the  um the breathing training the what's that uh Lamaze because I was gonna if I ever did have the baby it would be csection ,control
well  everything was fine and then she  di I just kept growing and um um nine months went by and the baby was still there ,control
and then I went into labor ,control
and at the last minute the tumor moved right to the side and she came out ,control
and  and so xxx uh she was never sposta have made it ,control
and so she was in_utero with a large fibroid  fibroid tumor ,control
and so uh right after  like a month after she was born I hadta have the surgery to remove it ,control
my wild party girl ,control
um well  like my sister's nanny speaks Spanish ,control
and so sometimes it's hard to you_know because I don't speak Spanish ,control
um I um will  sometimes will hafta like um act things out for her because I don't speak Spanish and her English is not that good ,control
and we'll like use hand signals or point to things ,control
and  sh and she  uh she's very nice and sweet but um somehow we end up like understanding each other ,control
and we just laugh about it ,control
you_know so ,control
okay  when I was  when I was a flight attendant uh at one point I flew on this really old airplane ,control
it was older than me ,control
it was built in the early fifties ,control
it was a Convair five eighty ,control
and we were landing in Aspen ,control
and the weather was at minimums which means we're just barely able to land ,control
um otherwise it got any worse we wouldn't  we'd hafta go back to Denver ,control
but we  I had a full airplane and we were coming into land  gpxmimics plane landing with left hand ,control
and um the pilots decided to go around because they couldn't see the runway ,control
and when they went to go around ,control
ges,control
and you can't see anything where the mountains are ,control
well  we were circling  coming in and they decided to go around and they didn't pull the gear up when they went around ,control
so  they stalled the airplane ,control
and what that feels like is your whole airplane is like shaking and shuttering and going like this ,control
and  and we could see the tops of the trees ,control
and somehow they put it in a nosedive to get the speed up ,control
and then they were able to  barely able to pull it out ,control
and everybody's looking at me ,control
and I'm the flight attendant so I hafta just smile ,control
and um um my crew is  normally they're allowed to make two attempts ,control
and they said ,control
 that's it we're done ,control
 we're going back to Denver ,control
 we're not even ,control
 we're done for the day ,control
and I guess the guys that work on the ramp or the one's waiting to flag us in saw  saw the airplane come in ,control
and they saw what happened ,control
and we almost crashed right over this really um s fancy area called Starwood where all the celebrities live ,control
Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and um Don Johnson they all have their homes up in Starwood ,control
and John Denver at the time ,control
 but we almost  cra they said that we  they saw us like disappear over the mountain and their hearts just went into their throats ,control
they were sure we were gone ,control
they were just waiting for the flames to come up ,control
but I was trying to pass out candy afterwards and  and beer ,control
laughs and I had this basket of candy ,control
and my  I was trying to act like really normal but my  the candy was popping out_of the basket you_know because my hands were like ges ,control
I was like  it was r really strange because it goes really in a slow motion ,control
it gets very slow and you think ,control
 okay  this is what it's like to die ,control
 oh  weird ,control
you_know  everything gets very drawn out ,control
that was my s laughs ,control

and um the grandmother got swept away in the car ,control
and the daughter was like down the river ,control
and the firemen um were back doing one more uh final like check before they totally evacuated ,control
and they see this girl floating down the river ,control
and he reaches out a branch to try to save her ,control
and almost goes in himself but they were both safe ,control
and the grandmother was never found ,control

so  he takes off walking to school ,control
and all a sudden it starts raining ,control
he covers his head and runs back getting all wet ,control
and his mom's unhappy with him because he's gotten wet ,control
she  he didn't listen to her ,control
so  he takes the umbrella then proceeds to school not getting any further soaked ,control
oh  okay ,control

and um he introduces he her to hi  her daughters and the stepmother and the two stepsisters and the cat ,control
and um then the father goes away and the  they make Cinderella do all the chores and all the cleaning and all the dirty work ,control
