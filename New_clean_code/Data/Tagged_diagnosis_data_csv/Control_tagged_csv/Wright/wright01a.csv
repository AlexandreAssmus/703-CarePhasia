and uh lasted about a week ,control
we stayed on the ship ,control
and shopped and ate actually ,control
that was about it ,control
so  then  then we came home ,control
enjoyed it ,control
 moved ,control
I moved but ,control
laughs yeah okay ,control
it was around Christmas time and my  uh I moved back in with my son and uh my daughter and my grandson ,control
and so we were kinda ,control
we moved into a bigger house ,control
and so it was kinda ,control
and then  uh so we had some company over ,control
but it was still  like the house was still a mess ,control
this is a true story ,control
and  uh so  but we enjoy ,control
we open presents and cooked and ate and blessed people that weren't there that have already gone on or you_know  passed on and stuff which we had a few that year ,control
and um just kinda ,control
ges,control
ges,control
said ,control
 we'll do this in a couple days  you_know ,control
so  we just did what we usually do ,control
it was just hectic on_account_of it was a_little scattered ,control
and that was it ,control
not really bad no ,control
I've just had like the flu and stuff like that and um ,control
oh  I brought dib nods ,control
okay nods ,control
throat,control
it was about seven years ago or eight years ago ,control
I don't even remember ,control
but they were playing out in the backyard ,control
and my grandson ,control
we had apartments ges,control
ges,control
okay ,control
but we had ges,control
and he was  the grandson Mike was a toddler ,control
and um we had just bought him one of those ges,control
you_know  the outside pools just to play in you_know like children ,control
and we all were out there ,control
my daughter Stacy  Jason my son  Michael my grandson  and me ,control
we were playing around  you_know ,control
and then things got a_little hectic  I'd say ,control
and anyway  so  we're  we were splashing each_other and everything like that and everything ,control
and  and somehow one of them bumped me ,control
and I fell in the pool ,control
and then my son fell on top of me ,control
but he had caught  what he'd done was like fell on my knee ,control
 so  it  it kind_of like shattered and tore the ligaments ,control
and  you_know  and uh fractured it actually ,control
and all the ligaments and everything ,control
and it was  j th it was so funny because we all fell like that  you_know ,control
we were all laughing ,control
and everybody's laughing ,control
and I'm going ,control
 get off me laughs ,control
 you_know  I'm really in pain ,control
 you_know  I'm really seriously in pain here ,control
 I'm on the bottom of this  you_know laughs ,control
and  um  and they thought I was just trying to get up and just kidding around ,control
and I go  I am started  you_know like saying ,control
 hey  I'm  no  seriously  something's wrong here ,control
you_know ,control
so  finally they got up ,control
and they  and then it just  it was like  like being a big blob in this ges,control
but I couldn't move my knee ,control
I couldn't get up ,control
anyway  so  they all straightened up ,control
and anyway  they helped me get up out_of the pool ,control
and then  they hadta almost carry me into the house ,control
then I hadta go to the emergency room because it was like you_know ,control
but it was just odd because you know how you're playing and laughing ,control
and it was such an odd accident that it was just weird ,control
otherwise than that just childbirth ,control
sure you don't wanna hear about that ,control
I took care um ,control
I have my own house cleaning business ,control
and I've had it for a few years which I've slowed down now ,control
but I useta take care of this older woman not that she was really old ,control
but she had a hard problem with people ,control
and so when I started cleaning her house because my sister worked for them ,control
they owned a restaurant in town ,control
and um she was just having a hard time communicating to anybody ,control
strangers coming in ,control
and she'd been out  she hadn't been out in a long time ,control
you_know  she just was getting old ,control
she was embarrassed ,control
and she didn't like people coming over ,control
and she couldn't get what she wanted to get done ,control
and she had a hard time with people ,control
I guess all her life ,control
but anyway  when I started cleaning her house ,control
and we really developed a very very good relationship and  with her ,control
with her ,control
yeah ,control
I sat and talked to her a_lot ,control
and I told her ,control
 it's okay ,control
you_know  I_mean I  she says she can't communicate with people ,control
you_know  of_course  owning restaurants for years and years and years when she was a_lot younger and her husband was alive which he had emphysema ,control
she was sorta like house  in the house all the time so ,control
but her  her daughter and son took care of the businesses ,control
but they overpowered her ,control
so  through the years she was having problems ,control
she didn't wanna go to the restaurant like she useta and visit the people and oversee ,control
I_mean  she owned them ,control
and I told her ,control
 you_know  you shouldn't be ,control
you_know  she was having a hard time ,control
I says ,control
 you can't be embarrassed about ,control
 because you can't get around as much ,control
 you_know  on a walker you don't want the neighbors to see ya ,control
 I'll roll you around in a wheelchair ,control
and I says ,control
 we can go visit your neighbors ,control
you_know ,control
that's because you got to keep communicating to   to keep your mind active  you_know ,control
and I says ,control
 you're fine with me because we developed this special friendship ,control
 you_know  I'm here twice a_week ,control
you_know  and it's easy to talk to me ,control
 and I'm  I'm cleaning your house ,control
 and  and you_know  we go  we have lunch ,control
 I take you to the doctor ,control
which she didn't like to go because she just still feels awkward ,control
you_know  get  getting old ,control
it's hard to explain ,control
but anyway  and I said ,control
 you needta  maybe we could go down to the restaurant ,control
you_know ,control
 I  you_know I got a car ,control
 I'll drive you ,control
 you get in ,control
we'll go visit the  you_know the girls that worked for you for like fifteen years and the people that you've known and they know you ,control
you_know  just trying to get her to open up and like visit or   you_know ,control
 it's okay if you're out in a wheelchair ,control
 I'll push you around ,control
 you need you  you've lived in this neighborhood for a long time ,control
people don't foresee you as crippled up old lady that  you_know is getting older ,control
so  we discussed those type of problems ,control
and settled them pretty much ,control
she a beautiful woman ,control
that would be my marriage but I ain't ,control
I think an accident in a car  that I was in ,control
my daughter was driving ,control
and um so we were driving down the street ,control
the grandson of_course is the baby ,control
and um we were in the car ,control
and um you could see this guy coming from ,control
we were stopped ,control
and then we pull up but the guy didn't stop ,control
so  you could see him  you_know coming towards you ,control
nothing you can do ,control
nothing ,control
and it's  it's  probably the s third scariest thing I think I've ever experienced because you can't do anything about it ,control
you cannot do anything about it ,control
 hello ,control
 hit me laughs  you_know ,control
anyway and the the car  ges,control
and I was more frightened for the  for my grandson than anything ,control
but that's frightening when you know you can't control ,control
if you cannot control  your situation like that and you know something bad is gonna hap run into you it's very difficult ,control
it's scary ,control
because you know it ges,control
it looks like  it looks like there's a ,control
I was gonna say she looks like a young child ,control
I don't know ,control
not young young but um ,control
she's stuck in the water ,control
it looks like after a flood ,control
she's very stressed ,control
scared half to death no doubt ,control
and um  I'd venture to guess that this would be a rescue person who's hanging on a tree limb trying to get to her ,control
and he's got a  he's got his life uh jacket on and stuff like that ,control
and they're really really struggling in this water that is just like terminal ,control
looks like a flash flood or something like that ,control
he's really trying to get a hold of her there and trying to get her going ,control
I couldn't tell you what the end of it is ,control
he ain't ,control
difficult time there ,control
well  there's a boy playing kickball   soccer outside kicking the ball around ,control
and he's playing and having a good time and all that and everything ,control
and he kicks the ball ,control
and it goes through a window ,control
and he's probably going ,control
 uhoh laughs ,control
 I'm in trouble ,control
and there's  in the home you can see the ball coming through ,control
lands  break the lamp ,control
a gentleman is sitting in a chair ,control
it's coming through there ,control
and he's standing up  of_course looking out the window with the ball in his hand trying to figure out who and where this ball came through ,control
so  I would imagine the ending would be he's gonna go out and the boy's gonna be in trouble ,control
it's a school morning ,control
and um the boy ,control
and he's got his backpack on ,control
his mom's got the umbrella in her hand because she's saying ,control
 it probably will rain ,control
 you needta take this umbrella with you ,control
and the boy is saying ,control
 no no  I'll be fine ,control
 it's not gonna rain ,control
 I'm tough ,control
 I'll be okay ,control
clears,control
so  as he's walking along to school or he  it starts to rain ,control
and he's going ,control
 oh_no ,control
then it's really starting to rain a_lot harder ,control
I_mean  there's even puddles ,control
now he's running back home ,control
and he went in his house ,control
and his mom looks like ,control
 well  see  I told you ,control
 it was gonna rain ,control
 you needed an umbrella ,control
he's standing there looking just drenched and patheticlikenadj ,control
 ugh ,control
I'm not as tough as I thought I was ,control
so  and then he's leaving again with the umbrella ,control
and he's happily walking in the rain now ,control
at_least he isn't getting wet ,control
on to school ,control
okay  this is the story about Cinderella who was kinda ,control
and she had a stepmother and two stepsisters ,control
that she was in this family   this family and everything ,control
but the stepmother treated the stepsisters very good and treated her very bad ,control
I_mean  she hadta clean everything ,control
she hadta do all the work ,control
and she was just treated like  no good ,control
and so anyway  so  that's the way it went all the time ,control
it was continually ,control
there was nothing she could do about it ,control
but she enjoyed the  the animals ,control
you_know  the dog and the cat and the mouse and ,control
she was just very nice  young lady ,control
did what she was sposta do ,control
and then um  there was a ball coming up that they were all invited to the whole family ,control
and  um but the stepmother wouldn't let her go ,control
she said she hadta stay home and clean the fireplace  and do chores and that she could not go ,control
it didn't matter ,control
so  while the  step the stepmother and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go and got all new dresses and jewelry and you_know were getting all ready to go to it she got really sad ,control
she was very sad very very sad ,control
and then  um  so the stepmom and two stepsisters left to go to the ball ,control
and this was a prince's ball ,control
it was actually a king's ball but  I_mean  you_know ,control
and um so she went outside ,control
and I believe she was probably crying ,control
and then the um like fairy godmother came along and was sitting out in the garden and everything ,control
and was talking to her and says ,control
 you_know  do you wanna go ,control
 we'll make it so you can go and everything ,control
 I'll fix everything with my magic wand laughs ,control
anyway  and uh so she ges,control
and she had this beautiful dress that you_know appeared on her and beautiful shoes and ges,control
I can't think of what that thing is ,control
tiara and everything ,control
and then she  they went outside ,control
and they turned the mice and pumpkins into this great big beautiful carriage with horses and with like a pumpkin carriage and everything for her to go and  you_know ,control
so  she got in the carriage ,control
and  uh but the fairy godmother said ,control
 you hafta be back  by twelve midnight ,control
 you_know you really hafta be back ,control
 don't be late ,control
 you hafta be back ,control
she's ,control
 okay I won't ,control
 I won't ,control
she was all excited ,control
and she looked so beautiful and everything ,control
and she was gonna have a good time and everything ,control
and um they went on to the ball at the king's palace and all that ,control
and then she met the prince ,control
and they danced ,control
and they just really really liked each_other very very much ,control
you could tell ,control
so ,control
and everything ,control
so  she was out dancing and talking to him and the stuff like that ,control
and then it rang at twelve midnight ,control
she's ,control
 I gotta go ,control
