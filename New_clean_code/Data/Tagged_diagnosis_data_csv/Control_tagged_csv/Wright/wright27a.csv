and the birthday cake was in the room ,control
and nobody was paying attention ,control
and so the dog ate part of the birthday cake ,control
and tracked it across the floor ,control

and the mom's trying to get him with the b,control
there's a big piece missing out_of the birthday cake ,control
you want me to tell you how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control

hm,control
um what happened ,control
oh I went skiing and I fell laughs ,control
didn't think I had done anything but somehow or other I managed to break a bone in my wrist ,control
and so I hadta go to the hospital ,control
they hadta xray it twice before they figured out where it was ,control
it hurt like cra,control
head,control
happened in Colorado ,control
came back home ,control
hadta put a cast on it ten weeks ,control
atrophy ,control
the most painful thing I've ever had in my life ,control
you can't move your hands laughs afterwards ,control
so  I hadta go through physical therapy but now it's perfectly fine ,control
um well  it's interesting to try to have a conversation with somebody who um English is their second language and their first language is Spanish ,control
and I don't know  I know like almost zero Spanish ,control
and so to try to have a conversation of um any depth or anything you can really just get the basics ,control
so  it's very interesting to try to communicate with a s,control
I think I'm communicating just fine ,control
I think they're not laughs listening ,control
but  laughs do you mean like they couldn't understand what I was saying to them INV,control
um can I tell you how that was ,control
do you mean like what was I feeling ,control
what  how did I experience that ,control
oh_my_gosh  oh  I guess the only time was when I traveled to Mexico ,control
and um uh oh they  they stop you going down there sometimes ,control
and they'll pull you over ,control
and they'll ask you like what do you have in your trunk or things like that ,control
or they'll say something to me ,control
I have no idea what they are saying to me ,control
and then finally they'll find English words ,control
and I'll be  like head,control
and so it's just  it's just  it's  um it's a little scary because you don't know  w you really don't know what they're trying to say ,control
and you could get in trouble if you don't respond the right way ,control
um because of communication like that ,control
 or just when was I frightened or scared ,control
um ,control
you know what ,control
it was the strangest thing ,control
I  I made a right hand turn ges,control
and I thought that I looked but I didn't see the car ,control
and so when I turned once I was turning then I did see the car ,control
and I thought I was going to get hit but I didn't ,control
but it's amazing because my entire body flooded with adrenaline ,control
I felt like I had gotten hit ,control
nothing had happened but it just  it scared me like crazy because I just knew for sure they were going to hit the back of me but they didn't ,control
there was  hm there was a girl that was out hiking with her family ,control
and um all a sudden there was a storm that came up ,control
and uh in Arizona we get a_lot_of flash floods ,control
and unfortunately she got in a part where there's the flash floods ,control

hm there was a little boy that was outside playing uh with his soccer ball ,control
and he was practicing his kicks and kicked it ,control
and it got away from him ,control
and it went through the window of the neighbors house and landed in ,control
and the neighbor was sitting in his easy chair ,control
and he got up and saw the hole in the window ,control
and looked out and saw the little boy ,control
and said ,control

okay ,control
um there was a little boy who was leaving to go to school with his backpack ,control
and his mom told him to take the umbrella ,control
and he said ,control

so  he waves goodbye to his mom and he heads off to school ,control
and sure enough it starts raining a little bit ,control
and then it rains really really hard ,control
and he's drenched ,control
so  he decides he better go back home and get his umbrella so he can maybe stay a little bit dry ,control

and she met Prince_Charming there ,control
and she danced with him ,control
and just had a great time ,control

and um trying it on everybody ,control
and they lock Cinderella up in the tower because the stepmother doesn't want her to try on the slipper in case it fits ,control
she tries to get the  her daughters to cram their feet in it but it doesn't fit ,control
and their little friends get her out_of the tower ,control
she comes down ,control
tries on the slipper ,control
and it fits ,control
and then she marries Prince_Charming and lives happily ever after laughs ,control
um there was a cat that went up the tree and got stuck ,control
