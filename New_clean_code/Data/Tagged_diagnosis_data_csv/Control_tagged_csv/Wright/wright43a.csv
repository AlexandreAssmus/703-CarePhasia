okay  this is  this is a story about a  uh the fact that I'm gonna have a party for my children ,control
and I've  and I've uh de cleaned the house and decorated the house and  and got everything set up ,control
and the people start to arrive ,control
so  and the  as they come in uh I notice that the cake has got a piece out_of it ,control
and lo_and_behold the dog is there underneath ,control
and I'm giving the dog what  what for ,control
and Steven  Steven is  uh my son is  is telling me that there's guests have arrived ,control
but I'm so focused on the dog I could care less because he ruined my setup and ruined my cake ,control
you wanna hear it ,control
well  there's t t t ges,control
but the one I'll tell you is the  uh is uh ,control
I was at church ,control
uh I help at  at church giving out daily mass of Catholic ,control
and I am  I'm a minister plus uh I  I set up the altar and everything for the priest ,control
and on Ash_Wednesday about three years ago I set up and I was giving communion ,control
and uh I held a pat palm,control
and my arm just dropped drops,control
and somebody was there to c fortunately catch it ,control
and uh it turns out that I found out I had AL  ALS ,control
I have ALS here to here points,control
and I'm not able to hold anything in my arm like this holds,control
I have a very difficult time ges,control
so  that's  that's what happened ,control
okay ,control
situ what the situation was hadta do with my wife  my second wife ,control
she's lovely  lo absolutely lovely woman ,control
and we got  we ended up getting a divorce ,control
however  after my divorce I went to a  a thing at  w a seminar at a place called Landmark_Education ,control
and I learned about uh ,control
it was a weekend seminar started on Friday  m Friday morning and went through Sunday night ,control
there was about a hundred and twenty five of us there ,control
there was about fifteen men and a hundred some odd women ,control
mostly  maybe not exactly that but it was that kind of proportion ,control
and I was  I was  uh I'd felt very  uh very k uh kind_of down after my divorce ,control
and I had prayed and this was kind_of a  the Lord leading me to this session ,control
so  I listened ,control
and I listened a_lot ,control
and the conversation dealt with abandonment ,control
and it turns out that in summary I think most women  I think it's fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do ,control
and  and I learned very significant things about the abandonment and how people feel and learned that you hafta forgive an abandonment ,control
uh but I also learned that what you ,control
this was reinforced ,control
I'd been  I was told by a priest back in the seventies uh that uh when your wife speaks to you just listen ,control
and when you  what you remember is one or two things is what's important ,control
don't solve every problem ,control
well  this reinforced that ,control
and uh it's very imp ,control
women have a ,control
that's why if you go back to that story I might've said this ,control
women have a  a need more ,control
men do too but they don't  they don't verbalize it ,control
but women verbalize it a_lot more than ,control
when things build up after a day they have a needta come home and dump ,control
they do ,control
and they need somebody to listen ,control
they don't need any of the dialogue on it or not but they need somebody to listen ,control
so  I learned to  to just sit and listen ,control
and what I remembered from it is to  m then afterwards after partner's finished what you remember one or two things you  you talk about that ,control
and then your partner is  is pleased because then you  that shows that you've listened to them ,control
and that's makes more effective communication ,control
hope you listened ,control
okay  when I was I believe around seven years old maybe it was five or six I mem this  this ,control
what happened in this occurrence has affected my life because I ended up being claustrophobic ,control
and when I was  when I was six or seven I had  the doctor said I hadta have my tonsils out ,control
so  I went to this place ,control
and I forget where ,control
but I remember laying on the  on the table and then doctor coming in with the masks ges,control
and I  and I fought the whole thing ,control
and uh my tonsils came out ,control
everything worked out alright ,control
but I  I've  d came to realization uh that  of that when I tried to do scuba diving and I couldn't do it ,control
I couldn't handle it uh the mask and the underneath ,control
and I've had some experiences where I've had claustrophobic  on it ,control
this  this is a story about a rescue uh uh on a  of uh somebody that fell in a  in a lake or was in a flooded area that uh flooding happened ,control
and the firemen or the rescue crew was going out there to help her ,control
and uh she's or  wi on her face she's very anxious ,control
and uh the rescuer's struggling to  to figure out how to  how to ,control
he's got a strap on there but he's figuring out  trying to figure out how to get a hold of her and pull her out_of the  out_of the uh circumstances save her life ,control
this is  t this is a situation that many people have where  uh that are lived by playgrounds and play areas where either a baseball or something ,control
kid  people are in playing there ,control
in this particular situation they're playing soccer ,control
and the boy kicks the soccer ball ,control
and it obvious  sometimes the ball doesn't go where he wants it to go ,control
and this one f flew into a person's house into his window ,control
uh caught the person by surprise ,control
