uh to make a uh peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter um the jar of jelly a plate a knife bread ,control
and so then you would take with your knife ,control
uh I would put the peanut butter on the bread ,control
and then I would take and  the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter ,control
to put the two slices of bread together ,control
cut it in half on my plate ,control
and go for it ,control
well  I'm very lucky because I'm basically very healthy ,control
I was ill as a young girl ,control
and um so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health ,control
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did ,control
so  going along pretty healthy ,control
you_know  I had uh one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery ,control
no drugs no anything ,control
so  I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains ,control
and they would be like between my waist and my boobs ,control
and they would last like four hours ,control
and they were bad ,control
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position you_know where I could just get some relief ,control
you_know  and you kind_of felt sick to your stomach but it was  pains were terrible ,control
so  this happened a few times and you_know you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out what's wrong ,control
so  you tell them all of this and they think ,control
 hm,control
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but they're not telling you a thing ,control
so  they send me a for a sonogram ,control
well  I've never had one of those ,control
and so I told them at the place I said ,control
 if you find a baby in there and I'm like sixty years old ,control
I said ,control
 we both can make a_lot_of money ,control
so  it kind_of made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me ,control
well  the report comes back later ,control
and so I have a gall bladder problem ,control
so  you_know it's like what do I do about it ,control
and um you_know nothing happens few little simple attacks ,control
but my husband and I are in Tennesee ,control
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks ,control
scared my husband to death because he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane ,control
so  when we get back I go back to the doctor again ,control
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder ,control
and that's the way life goes ,control
yes um the other people uh would be my mother because I do feel like she's maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory ,control
and I want her to be my mother and like she always useta be ,control
so  it's been very hard like in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently ,control
I try not to tell her ,control
 can't you remember ,control
um because I'm now learning that she can't ,control
um so  it's difficult because it's a learning process ,control
it's changes weekly maybe even daily ,control
um that's the main communication problem right now ,control
um I  I've been  I was frightened or scared uh many times w when I was young and growing up ,control
um we lived in a small town like six hundred people ,control
but I did live in the town ,control
uh my  fa I guess I was uh scared maybe because my father uh would go away to work into the big city ,control
and he would leave like on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night ,control
um my father being that he didn't live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family ,control
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and  and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town ,control
then we had uh a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was um loud and um I'm gonna say verbally abusive even_though I didn't realize that at that time ,control
and um so he would scream and yell and uh maybe not som always treat our mother like we thought ,control
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and  and the difference ,control
uh well  here in Arizona we sometimes have flash floods ,control
um we had one and a young lady and her vehicle decided that she could drive off across this wash no problem ,control
guess what ,control
there was a problem ,control
uh the s car stalls ,control
the water comes up to the sides ,control
she's able to get out_of the car and get on the roof ,control
but then she's stranded ,control
the water is just roaring like crazy ,control
um but people on the shore on the banks see her ,control
uh they call rescue people in ,control
um they have all the equipment ,control
they work their way to get out to her ,control
uh they're gonna rescue her with their  their ropes and their belts and their ties ,control
uh they're making sure that they can safely get her attached to them so they can get her to shore ,control
what a learning lesson for the young lady ,control
we have a neighborhood boy Billy who loves to play soccer ,control
um there is no playground nearby so he plays soccer in his front yard ,control
uh he's having a good time one nice day ,control
and oh_my_gosh he kicked the soccer ball further than he  than he ever expected ,control
and it went right into the neighbor's window ,control

he's sitting in this chair ,control
he was relaxing ,control
and all_of_a_sudden a soccer ball comes through his window ,control
well  he goes over got the soccer ball checking outside and he's deciding what should he do ,control
should he take it back to Billy and tell him not to do that again ,control
should he just wait and les let Billy come to the front door ,control
