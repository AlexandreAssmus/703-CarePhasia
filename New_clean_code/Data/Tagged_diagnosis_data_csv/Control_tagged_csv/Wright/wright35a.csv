and she became friends with all the animals in the house except Lucifer ,control
he was a mean old cat ,control
that was the stepmother's cat ,control

and she lived ups,control
and the prince ,control
I think it was Prince_Philip ,control
Prince_Philip's father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife ,control

and she says ,control
 oh  I wanna go ,control

so  she uh makes up a bunch of chores for Cinderella to do ,control
and she says ,control
 wash the floor ,control
and Cinderella says ,control

she says ,control
 well  do it again ,control
and she had her do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball ,control

and when they're done she goes upstairs to the attic and finds a dress a  sui in an old trunk that useta be her mother's ,control
and she shows the mice her beautiful dress ,control
and shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away ,control
and she's very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress ,control
but the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready ,control
so  while she's away the mice um help make the dress pretty ,control
and Jasper and Gus decide to go out and get some more pretty things to add to the dress ,control
and they grab a  a pearl necklace hands,control
and the pearls go flying on the place ,control
and both mice pick up all the pearls ,control
and Lucifer's watching them the cat ,control
and they manage just to get the beads stuck on Jasper's tail and slide under the door ,control

and they get the dress made up real pretty ,control
and they sing a song ,control

and they get this song going ,control
and they get the dress made ,control
and Cinderella comes in the attic ,control
and they surprise her with this beautiful dress ,control
and she's so happy she can go to the ball ,control
so  she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and the  her stepsisters to wait because she can go to the ball now because she has something to wear and she's finished all her chores ,control
and the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks and her beauti beautiful dress ,control
and they see that the decorations are stuff that she ges,control
so  they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back ,control
and they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball ,control
Cinderella goes running to the garden ,control
and she starts crying because she wanted to go to the ball ,control
and this fairy godmother appears and does this bippety_boppety_boo thing whips her up a real pretty white dress ,control
and then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses ,control
and she tells Cinderella go dance with the prince but she hasta be back by midnight or the spell will wear off ,control

and she meets the prince ,control
and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with ,control
and she hears the clock strike midnight ,control
and she hasta go ,control
and the prince is like ,control

the other one's foot s was too big ,control
and as he's leaving Cinderella runs down the stairs and says ,control
 but wait ,control
