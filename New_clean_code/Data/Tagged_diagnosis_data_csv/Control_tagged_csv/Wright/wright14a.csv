okay ,control
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
first you would go to the fridge and get the bread ,control
then ,control
well  then you would take the bread and grab two slices ,control
and you would put peanut butter on both slices because I love extra peanut butter ,control
um then you would put jelly on both those slices ,control
then if you want you could put the banana in it but it's peanut butter and jelly so I wouldn't put banana ,control
and I would just put the two slices together hands,control
put in on a plate ,control
and then begin to eat it ,control
milk might go better but we're good ,control
alright I am ,control
so  the  it is little Johnny's birthday ,control
and he comes home  uh f comes into his house and kind_of is a surprise party ,control
people are arriving ,control
and uh needless to say his birthday is ruined because his birthday cake is half eaten by the dog who is nonetheless sleeping under the couch after a nice fat meal ,control
we all know how that feels ,control
and so he sees that and he gets mad ,control
the mother gets worse  even more mad and wants to go uh you know get the dog out from under the couch and you_know use her broom and bop him on the head and teach him a lesson ,control
and uh eventually they realize well it's alright ,control
it's not the end of the world ,control
uh they love the dog ,control
the dog only meant well ,control
the kid becomes happy ,control
he gets his presents ,control
the little girls and everyone plays ,control
and that's the end of today ,control
nope ,control
well  actually I've never been hospitalized or broke a bone ,control
knock on wood knocks,control
um I really  I wasn't the kind of person to really ever get hurt ,control
um I mean bumps and bruises but nothing too serious ,control
the only one time ,control
well  I could name two mainly ,control
but the  the  the most recent kind_of hurt was uh my senior year of high school uh no  my junior year of high school playing football ,control
I was during practice ,control
yeah ,control
I  um we were doing a drill and uh I had the ball ,control
and the other guy hadta tackle me ,control
and I was kind_of sposta let him tackle me ,control
so  I go and I let him tackle me ,control
and as he tackles me he you_know throws me to the ground ,control
and I land ,control
points,control
and I end up just landing on the ground on my shoulder points,control
and it like kind_of cracks ,control
I go ,control
 a,control
terrible terrible pain ,control
um and uh you_know I  I go off to the side ,control
and uh the coach checks me out and says ,control
 yeah  you_know you needta get checked out ,control
that  then I end up  I end up you_know that  the next day  or maybe that  I think it was that day ,control
I  uh I go to the hospital just to have them look at it ,control
and I_mean I don't know if I  I consider hospitalized overnight ,control
but I  I wasn't overnight ,control
just go in and look at it ,control
um  they say ,control
 well  you're ,control
why do I think this is ,control
I'm sorry ,control
I skipped a part ,control
I go to my sports doctor first ,control
he  um he looks at it ,control
points,control
um if I got this right the separation  the difference between a separation and a dislocation is the distance ges,control
ges,control
anything less is a dislocation ,control
and mine was at seven points,control
so  seven centimeters separated ,control
points,control
um so  yeah  he tells me that ,control
uh sends me to the  says ,control
 go to the hospital just to you_know have them uh get you uh the  the correct equipment points,control
and uh they put me in a sling ,control
I'm you_know and ,control
I_mean it didn't  didn't really  like I didn't  it wasn't really too painful ,control
it just hurt when I landed on it ,control
um and I_mean uh I was out f of football for like uh  all uh ,control
I think I was only out_of football for like two weeks because I didn't  really didn't  I really wanted to push myself and I didn't wanna miss that much ,control
so  I was out_of football for like two weeks ,control
came back ,control
and that was about it ,control
you_know ,control
yes  my brother ,control
okay ,control
well  the person I have had trouble communicating or has had trouble communicating that I know of uh that first comes to mind would be my brother ,control
even_though I've worked with many autistic kids ,control
I useta do a_lot_of volunteer work um at camps with autistic kids and manic depressive all those different disorders ,control
um I probably know my brother best ,control
and my brother uh I diagnose it as just a social problem ,control
but when he was younger he  he just  you_know he couldn't really say what he wanted or tell you or  or you_know kind_of socially get along with my  me and my friends or anything of the sort ,control
and um you_know just take for example one time he wanted to uh you_know play on the trampoline with us ,control
and we weren't sure what he was wanting and he was just jumping on the trampoline ,control
jumps jumps on and jumps into the middle of our game and you_know kind_of frustrates everybody ,control
and you_know I see that and  and after awhile ,control
this has happened before ,control
I  I understand what he's trying to tell me ,control
and I read that he just wants to hang out with us and have fun ,control
so  you_know I tell him ,control
 alright well why don't you do this ,control
and I have him do something else on the side and you_know then jump in and join us ,control
and you_know we kind_of end up beating the hell out_of him on the trampoline ,control
and he still laughs even_though we beat him up ,control
and it ends up turning into a_lot_of fun ,control
and  and you_know he's happy ,control
and  and eventually he learned to communicate better ,control
there have been times when I  you_know I've told him you_know ,control
 say what you want talk to me tell me ,control
and I'll tell you you_know ,control
 Dave don't come out with us or Dave come out with us you_know Dave do this tell us ,control
and um he has learned to communicate a_lot better ,control
and that's it ,control
oh I could tell you ,control
okay  I'm ready ,control
so  this was actually my sophomore year in college ,control
I'm with a bunch of my buddies ,control
my best friend Tal was with me ,control
we go to this party ,control
uh at this party um a friend of mine is playing beer pong ,control
his name's Harry ,control
he's a crazy crazy kid ,control
he has like  I think he's a manic depressive and bipolar ,control
he's crazy ,control
he's insane ,control
like he'll go off the walls ,control
so  um he's playing uh beer pong at this party in the back yard ,control
and there's ges,control
and um he  he wins ,control
he wins the game ,control
or he  I think he  he either wins the game or scores a point ,control
and he goes ,control
 yeah ,control
and he rips off his shirt ges,control
and another guy standing kind_of next to Tal and I in the middle of the table is like kind_of like ,control
 what the heck is that ,control
you_know  he kind_of says a curse word like you_know ,control
 what the fl are you doing ,control
and everything else ,control
and  and Harry's like ,control
 what are you talking about you_know ,control
and  and then Tal my friend  best friend is standing next to me and he turns to the kid ,control
and like he  I don't remember what he said too much but he was kind_of like trying to put him in his place telling him you_know ,control
 you better  better watch yourself ,control
 you better shut up or something ,control
and um uh the kid starts to get in his face ,control
and the kid's much bigger than Tal ,control
he's about the same size as me ,control
and he gets in his face ,control
and you_know I  uh he's  you_know they're starting to argue ,control
it's getting heated ,control
and all the while when things start to get bad like that or when things get scary or when I get scared the number  the thing that I always do is I get very quiet and I  uh I don't mean to do it but I kind_of get like  I heighten my senses ,control
I feel everything heighten ,control
and I just listen and look and feel and try to take in as much as I can ,control
and I get ready ,control
and make a long story short uh the kid gets in his face ,control
and I simply  my f friend Tal's ges,control
ges,control
ges,control
um uh I put my head kind_of closer to his near his shoulder ,control
and I just sit there looking at the guy and standing next to Tal ,control
and I  I'm scared because I don't like fighting ,control
I don't ever wanna see fighting ,control
I don't wanna see a punch thrown ,control
I don't wanna see ,control
even we  uh you_know in my mind I'm  you_know we could have had  we had a_lot more people at the party that we knew ,control
he didn't ,control
we  I_mean it  really we knew that it could have been bad for him ,control
but I still didn't wanna see anyone get hurt ,control
so  I'm getting scared ,control
and you_know I just stand there calmly and quietly and don't lose my cool even_though I'm nervous and um looking at the kid and just waiting for him to  to take a swing at Tal because then Tal knows and I know that we're gonna go buck wild on him ,control
and I'm not  it's not like I'm a big guy or a bad guy it's just  uh it's just that's how I feel ,control
I'm getting ready to jump in to fight ,control
and you_know they eventually go back and forth ,control
and um everyone says stuff ,control
and eventually you_know I  I don't know if  I think Tal says it ,control
Tal's like ,control
 dude  seriously  you better get out_of here ,control
you better stop because you  you're way outnumbered right now ,control
you  you have nobody with you ,control
w we could really ,control
and  and the guy's like ,control
 no ,control
but eventually it just quiets down ,control
I still stood my ground next to Tal and made sure he was safe ,control
and the guy eventually leaves ,control
everything calms down ,control
and it  it ends ,control
and that's it ,control
huh ,control
uh  this  well it's  you can interpret a bunch of different ways ,control
okay ,control
sounds good ,control
um so  a big  uh a big  um let's say a big uh hurricane hits fills up all the water and just wipes out you_know kind_of like uh the one in New_Orleans or something ,control
I don't know ,control
or the tsunami ,control
that's what I meant ,control
tsunami ,control
all the waters are filled ,control
uh make a long story short houses trees everything's going down through the  through the water ,control
and it just kind_of just looks like rivers now ,control
um a girl falls  is kind_of  not falls but  you_know because of all the  she's  just all the winds and everything she's stuck in the water ,control
she gets stuck in the water and she's going downstream and everything's going ,control
sorry ,control
everything's going so fast ,control
um  oh wait ,control
I'm not telling this as a story ,control
uh a girl ,control
sorry ,control
um a girl gets  uh falls in  uh gets pulled into the water by the tsunami ,control
and she's going downstream ,control
and the girl's you_know feeling hopeless and doesn't know if she's going to make it ,control
she's really scared ,control
and um out_of nowhere one of the uh rescue teams that came in to fight the tsunami uh come in and they  they see the girl ,control
and a guy jumps out_of the helicopter with uh you_know a life preserver and uh belts and  and you_know all equipped and ready to save her and fly  goes downstream ,control
and she's stuck on a branch ,control
and he  he uh you_know ges,control
and uh the helicopter comes and you_know ges,control
and she's safe ,control
and that's it ,control
okay ,control
yeah ,control
okay  so  a kid is playing soccer ball ,control
