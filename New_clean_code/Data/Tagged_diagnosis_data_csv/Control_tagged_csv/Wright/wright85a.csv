depending on the requirements of the eater you may cut off the crusts  or not ,control
you butter the bread in my opinion ,control
then you put on peanut butter ,control
and then you put on the jam ,control
and uh then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top hand,control
and ges cut it in any way you so desire ,control

we have a man stranded in a tree ,control
because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat ,control
because a little girl was crying because a cat was up in the tree ,control
and uh lips_smack after the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down ,control
a dog came along and is barking up the tree ,control
and the firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man ,control
and I'm assuming everything ends up okay ,control
the end ,control
well  the most recent episode is a broken bone ,control
but it was  head,control
I uh  had been having pai,control
the more I walked the more it hurt ,control
but I really just kind_of ignored it ,control
I was more concerned about my right foot with the toe nail looking like it was lifting off the bed ,control
and I didn't quite know what to do about this ,control
so  I made a appointment with the foot doctor ,control
but my foot doctor is in Waukegan  lips_smack Illinois ,control
and uh let's see ,control
how did that work ,control
 sighs oh_boy ,control
we came  we came directly from  we had been on a  c a cruise ,control
and we had visited our children in  in Orlando ,control
and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan  so I could see the foot doctor ,control
 lips_smack a,control
but anyway when I finally got to the foot doctor uh she just explained that the,control
so  she just ges,control
took half a ges,control
that was done ,control
and then I casually mentioned laughs that my left foot was hurting ,control
an,control
an,control
and that led to xrays ,control
which showed there was a small broken bone ,control
eh which led to my having to wear a boot for a month ,control
and then come back  for more xrays ,control
so,control
then I turned arou,control
more xrays ,control
and the stupid thing is not healed yet which is  usual for me ,control
because this whole scenario happened once before ,control
and uh she says ,control
 another month with the boot ,control
 lips_smack an,control
and I forgot to do it ,control
no  I did it yesterday ,control
and uh  lips_smack she also told me that when I came  ba when I would be coming back th the end of this month she would not be there because her husband was  taking a job somewhere else ,control
and of_course she's following him ,control
lips_smack and nice thing about the visit is k I really like that foot doctor as a person ,control
and she's pregnant ,control
and she's gonna have her second child ,control
and I thought that was real nice ,control
but anyway I said ,control
 well  since you're not gonna be here in a month I will get a foot doctor in Arizona ,control
so  that's where I am now ,control
I'm waiting for this stupid foot to heal ,control
the end ,control
oh_my ,control
let's see ,control
right ,control
first I hafta think frightened or scared ,control
lips_smack  ges,control
lips_smack um  we had  uh in the bathroom was a crawl not a crawl space  was a  a  ges  laughs a cubicle ,control
I don't know how to describe it ,control
ges you had your linen closet ,control
ges and then underneath the linen  linen closet was an open area ,control
eh which had a uh ges uh area inside of it to get to the plumbing i in the bathtub ,control
and we used that open area for uh a dirty clothes,control
except there head,control
and for a reason I don't remember  lips_smack the children  told me that there was a big animal  looking out_of this  ges area ,control
so,control
 well  hand,control
but nevertheless I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn't get out ,control
and then we  we went outside ,control
and we saw,control
I'm not sure,control
with its hand,control
looking out at us from the uh  ges air vents I guess you call those  that are in the uh  ges foundation of the house ,control
lips_smack and that really scared me ,control
I thought ,control
 if that thing gets in the house eh or gets out it could bite the kids ,control
 and it might be rab rabid ,control
um so  I called the  animal shelter  I think it was ,control
lips_smack laughs and they told me that they  everybody was on lunch ,control
lips_smack and so they wouldn't be there for an hour ,control
which,control
because if someone gets bit I will sue the city ,control
lips_smack so,control
and uh the uh men uh were not happy to see this,control
because he really looked hand,control
and they ges took off the vent ,control
and somehow they caught him ,control
lips_smack and then they discovered  I believe this is   they discovered  a nest of baby opossums ,control
which all looked very cute ,control
when they're babies they're  ges all kinds of babies look cute ,control
so  anyway they took the opossum and babies away ,control
and the story ended happily ever after laughs ,control
okay ,control
well  my mother had a stroke ,control
and uh but thank the good lord that he,control
uh so  I was able  you_know we were able to communicate with no problem ,control
but I remember one time again uh living in my own home in  in Waukegan ,control
um  my neighbor who  who was going to be my husband ,control
but of_course hand,control
uh he  w he rents out a uh I call it a garage ,control
it was,control
so  anyway  he rents out the garage and there's uh uh Spanish speaking couple there ,control
points,control
lips_smack lips_smack and the lady comes over to my house  and somehow communicated to me that she had locked herself out_of her house ,control
lips_smack an,control
lips_smack so,control
and I don't  I c didn't have any children that would ges,control
and I don't even remember if the kids were home ,control
but then I took her head,control
and spoke Spanish ,control
lips_smack and so then we found out for sure what the problem wa,control
and I volunteered to take the lady to work ,control
and that wouldn't  wasn't feasible ,control
because she hadta have her i i_d ,control
which was ges locked in the house ,control
so  then we went down the street further laughs uh where I knew a ges,control
and laughs we got this  uh asked this child to help ,control
but of_course he answered the door very cautiously ,control
and told us that he couldn't come out_of the house ,control
because he's not allowed to come out_of the house when mom and dad aren't home ,control
 hand,control
 well  when mom gets home laughs come and see us ,control
so  wasn't too long mom came home ,control
he comes up the street ,control
he climbs in her ges,control
and end of story again laughs ,control
 hm  lips_smack well I'm ready ,control
uh this  uh  this looks like a  a  uh a picture of a flood ,control
lips_smack uh and of a  girl I would say rather than a young woman uh kind_of trapped in the  in the uh flood ,control
and a fireman or some kind  other kind of rescue personnel is tr going to try to rescue her ,control
he's hanging on for dear life to a limb ,control
and he's got what looks like a belt over an arm ,control
perhaps to put around the uh lips_smack girl to rescue her ,control
 and this looks like it could be an actual picture of a real happening ,control
lips_smack the end ,control
 okay ,control
I'm ready ,control
lips_smack uh we have a boy playing outside with what looks like a soccer ball ,control
and he kicks the soccer ball ,control
which goes  through a window of_course breaking the window ,control
knocks over a lamp ,control
uh which startles a man who is sitting in a chair ,control
and the man gets u,control
an,control
and he's looking out through the broken window ,control
and that's the end of this story ,control
oh ,control
laughs okay ,control
lips_smack we have a child  a mother holding an umbrella and a child who I would guess is going to school ,control
because it looks like he's got a backpack on ,control
and he's telling her ,control
 hand,control
 hand,control
 hand,control
and mom's not too happy about this ,control
but she lets him go ,control
and he waves hand,control
and he goes outside ,control
and of_course it starts raining ,control
lips_smack and uh he's running back home through the puddles ,control
and getting all wet points,control
and he's holding his head ,control
and he goes in the house ,control
and mother's not happy ,control
lips_smack because he's standing there dripping ,control
uh and then the next picture shows him back outside with an umbrella ,control
and he has miracasly ,control
the end ,control
lips_smack well of_course I know the Cinderella story ,control
um w we start out with uh Cinderella's father remarrying uh to a  woman who uh turns out to be oh a mean stepmother ,control
and she has two daughters who she dotes on ,control
and they also are mean ,control
and um lips_smack a father goes off on a business trip or something or other ,control
and he,control
he doesn't return ,control
so  Cinderella is stuck with Stepmother and two mean stepsisters ,control
and she waits on the stepsisters ,control
and no matter what she does it isn't right ,control
and um lips_smack she looks  Cinderella can look out her window and see the castle where the prince  and I assume the king and queen live ,control
and um  lips_smack  the,control
because he's getting up in age ,control
and he hasn't married ,control
and they're telling him head,control
so  they,control
lips_smack and uh invitations are sent to every  every house ,control
and uh Stepmother and Stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that they're going to go to ,control
and Cinderella uh gets a  a lovely dress out_of a trunk ,control
and the uh stepsisters get all dressed ,control
and uh Cinderella's helping them with everything ,control
at_least in this book she gets a dress out_of the trunk ,control
but head,control
but anyway she helps ths the girls  the ladies get dressed ,control
and um lips_smack she of_course is planning on going ,control
but Stepmother and Stepsister say ,control
 no way ,control
 you cannot go ,control
an,control
and Cinderella is in tears,control
and uh she's sitting by the fireplace and um the cinders and so forth ,control
and Fairy_Godmother comes along and tells us  asks Cinderella if she would like to go to the ball ,control
and of_course Cinderella says ,control
 yes ,control
but she hasn't got any way to go ,control
and  and uh she s was told to stay home ,control
but Fairy_Godmother does her magic ges,control
and um lips_smack Cinderella has another ges,control
and uh the fairy godmother turn,control
and mice into horses ,control
I think it's mice into horses ,control
and ges somebody turns into I guess whatcha would call  a coachman ,control
and they ges,control
and uh she's the belle of the ball ,control
lips_smack and the prince is taken with her ,control
and they're dancing and so forth ,control
and then all_of_a_sudden it's almost midnight ,control
which is when the fairy godmother told Cinderella she hadta be back home ,control
becau,control
and the coach would ges disappear ,control
and all that kind of thing ,control
so  she goes ges,control
and as she's running away she drops a glass slipper ,control
lips_smack and she gets home ,control
and then the uh  prince and his footmen are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits ,control
and uh the wicked ,control
well  I'm not sure if they were wicked ,control
but they sure were mean ,control
 uh stepsisters tried to jam their foot in the glass slipper ,control
and of_course it didn't uh fit ,control
and uh s,control
and he tries the slipper on her ,control
and it fits ,control
and they get married ,control
and they ges live happily ever after ,control
