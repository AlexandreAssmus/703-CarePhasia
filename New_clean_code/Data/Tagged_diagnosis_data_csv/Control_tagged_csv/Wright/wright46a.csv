today is Timmy's birthday ,control
a very large party has been planned ,control
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy ,control
and good friends were invited over ,control
well   somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after  of the cake after climbing up onto the table ,control
mom sees this and is very very upset ,control
very frustrated ,control
and grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch ,control
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy ,control
to see this cake having much much less than it's sposta have laughs ,control
first you hands,control
lightly toast them ,control
bring the peanut butter and jelly to the table ges,control
apply jelly to one side ges,control
and peanut butter ges,control
and then bringing them together so_that the jelly and the peanut butter meet ,control
put them together hands,control
and eat it laughs ,control
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the p_x ,control
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck  was kept up ,control
and there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time ,control
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible ,control
but  this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck ,control
and as I left  laughs by kicking my left leg up and over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed of the truck ,control
I was lightly tupped ,control
because I had only been moved about a  an inch and a half ,control
sighs if I had had this awareness it would've been much easier for me to push away uh from the truck and sustain less injury than I had ,control
as that my left leg was kicked up and about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries I've ever u had ,control
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest ,control
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate ,control
then falling down further the back of the bed ,control
then the bumper ,control
and  in my attention anyhow almost laughs eons later sighs after I had thought that the last of the contusions were  sighs occurring the same spot sighs on the under side of my left calf hit the  uh the  gar the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle ,control
the bed of the  v of the vehicle itself just hand,control
and coming down underneath ges,control
well  this hit in the same spot one two three four ,control
and uh I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries ,control
fr at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle ,control
and their uh discretion chose to take me to the hospital ,control
and they're my drill sergeants so I let them do that um instead of saying it's just a sprained ankle ,control
and finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop ,control
well  t I immediately went into shock ,control
and being in basic training uh there is much suggestion to do as one is told ,control
and a myriad  f uh manner of forms laughs directly and indirectly ,control
so  uh my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and uh uh damage that I had just gone through ,control
sighs I actually hadta walk the next morning to uh the clinic on a very very swollen calf ,control
so  swollen in_fact that I was unable to take the b_d_u's which are the uh battle dress uniform ,control
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants uh from being able to be lifted up ges,control
my calf was so swollen ,control
uh unfortunately that was the major holiday of that um laughs uh whole fort ,control
combination of its anniversary and Fourth_of_July ,control
so  the crew at the clinic on that Saturday ,control
which then being a Saturday busses never ran uh so I hadta walk about two and a half miles on that condition ,control
did a very cursory and um less than effective look at my injury ,control
and described me as uh rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches ,control
the next  and without  and ges,control
the next day uh because it was a holiday and uh through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given k_p duty ,control
and uh the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing k_p because everyone else had been working ,control
uh and I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself ,control
I was in shock continually this entire time ,control
so  I never volunteered for any of the k_p duties ,control
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and uh sprained almost knee ,control
well  regardless to say as I got back on Monday the uh staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physician's assistant ,control
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and uh started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms ,control
and uh pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies ,control
and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic ,control
yes head,control
actually  I,control
for the last uh year I've been a life coach for a developmentally disabled man where I live ,control
and his developmental disablement has come about because of uh a actual large set of circumstance ,control
um traumatic uh psychological and physiological experiences have pretty much left him with the mental state  a mental emotional state of a very high strung five year old ,control
and uh various communication  miscues ,control
and the lack of my um focus to make sure ges,control
and to  uh to better his activities has created a  a very large ges,control
and uh at this moment I have hadta disconnect from being a life coach for this individual ,control
in the past reiterations and nonreactive acceptance of whatever form of communication this individual has relayed ,control
and then full discourse a about the perspectives and the  the missing pieces of the  uh the sides of the total experiences happening ,control
repeatedly and calmly uh delivered to this gentleman has helped ,control
though current situations and my own revealing of larger circumstance has led me to necessitively ,control
yes heads,control
sighs the only  only thing that's coming up to my mind right now was a trip to Hoover_Dam when I was young ,control
and I had uh at that time my  sist my youngest sister ,control
she was about four and a half ,control
well there was this  uh this very  lar we went on a tour in Hoover_Dam ,control
and  and saw all  all the insides ges,control
well  when we got back up as I  as I looked out across the bridge and saw the very very deep hole ges,control
when the water gets too high ges,control
I got an immediate uh sensation of fear ,control
prolly ,control
um and I immediately saw my sister ,control
and I just felt horrible of  about potential of her being drug down ges,control
and then spit out the side ,control
because this thing  this thing is about a  a good hundred yards wide and very very very deep ,control
and it j just gave me this ominous sense of  of lack and  and grief ,control
 there was much much rain ,control
so  much more than ever before that a flood occurred ,control
and began sweeping away houses and people ,control
a young girl was trapped in this flood ,control
and she caught on to part of a tree ,control
and held on for dear life ,control
rescue workers came ,control
and one man with a lifejacket and silver harnesses was dropped  from a helicopter  into the flood reaching the girl ,control
 m but then helped her to put the harness on ,control
and be brought back away from the flood itself  to safety INV,control
a young boy was outside practicing soccer ,control
unfortunately he made a very large mistake and kicked the ball too hard ,control
the ball flew into the neighbor's yard ,control
breaking the window ,control
knocking over a lamp ,control
and very very much scaring the man sitting inside watching the television ,control
the man grabs the soccer ball ,control
goes to the window ,control
and looks out to see the little boy is gone laughs ,control
a young boy is on his way to  to school ,control
and his mother offers him an umbrella which he refuses ,control
she is clearly troubled that he has refused but lets him go ,control
as he walks out oh down the road  it starts to rain ,control
he realizes his mistake covers his head and runs back to the house ,control
mother sees him and tells him ,control
 hm,control
and gives him the umbrella ,control
which then he uses to walk to school staying  after he has been dried   dry ,control
young Cinderella's father meets a woman and marries her ,control
Cinderella's stepmother and stepchildren  step stepsisters uh after years of time eventually  after stef the  the father of Cinderella dies turn Cinderella into their servant and treat her very unfairly ,control
Cinderella becomes friends with the animals of the castle that she lives at ,control
horse mice and birds ,control
and protects them from the mean cat of her stepmother ,control
then the prince no  then Cinderella looks out across the  the kingdom ,control
and wishes that she could be living in a very very better place ,control
living in that castle happy and free from the  the torment of her stepsisters and stepmother ,control
the king is furious in the castle with his son the prince ,control
very very worried that the prince is never going to marry ,control
and is never going to give him heirs and grandchildren ,control
the king decides that the prince must marry ,control
and sets a ball for the prince to choose his wife amongst the women of the kingdom ,control
this is sent out to all of the kingdom's eligible women as a message inviting them ,control
Cinderella finds out from the stepmother and stepsisters who are very very conniving and greedy ,control
manipulatively um planning to take the prince's hand for themselves ,control
Cinderella finds a stash of her mother's clothing ,control
and through the help of her friends the mice the birds  the mice and the birds builds a beautiful dress ,control
for she had been told by her stepmother that she would be allowed to go to the ball if she had a dress that fit and was good enough ,control
unfortunately a oz ,control
they fly into a rage ,control
and destroy Cinderella's dress taking back those parts that once were theirs while the stepmother looks on ,control
without bothering to stop them at all ,control
Cinderella is distraught with grief ,control
and as the stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball she runs out to the garden ,control
and pours out her heart to the universe which calls forth her fairy godmother ,control
which then comes and gives her a wish ,control
granting that pumpkin in the garden be turned into a carriage ,control
that the mice be turned into horses ,control
and the horse be turned into a carriage man himself ,control
and giving her an amazing outfit ,control
a beautiful dress and glass slippers to wear ,control
she goes to the ball and m ultimately becomes the most attractive and uh magnetic woman there for the prince ,control
and they dance and become good friends very quickly ,control
there is one condition though ,control
she must leave the ball before midnight ,control
that is when the fairy godmother's magic wears off ,control
having a very wonderful conversation with the prince that lasts quite a long time though it feels like it happens very quickly ,control
she sees and hears at the same time that midnight is occurring ,control
and sh,control
and is something else than a magnificent woman of elegance ,control
as she runs down the stairs and is chased by the king's servant one of her glass slippers  frees itself from her foot and is left on the steps ,control
managing to escape just in time before being seen uh transforming back into the way that she was ,control
Cinderella enjoys the time with her friends ,control
and is glad for the experience that she had ,control
unable to accept any other woman besides the one that he danced with and uncovered at the ball the prince refuses anyone else's hands in marriage ,control
