 head,control
 I  I don't know why I'm not getting help head,control
 I'm  head,control
inhales and um I just remember head,control
lips_smack inhales and what had happened was  the internal bleeding was sitting on my chest points,control
and it was compressing my lungs points,control
inhales so  I couldn't breathe points,control
inhales and I was very scared head,control

lips_smack yes head,control
 head,control
 head,control
lips_smack inhales my mother had a stroke five years ago ,control
inhales and with her stroke she,control
and so her communication is very very um different laughs than it ever was before ,control
inhales um and so  she will say ,control
inhales most of the time we can fill in the blanks for her head,control
inhales and figure out what she's saying head,control
but there are many many times where she will start talking head,control
inhales and we have no idea what she's saying head,control
inhales and it's very frustrating for us head,control
which leads me to believe head,control
inhales um but we've tried really hard to inhales figure out what she's trying to say head,control
I don't know if we have it right half the time head,control
shrugs but she's fairly agreeable laughs  to what we say so ,control
 lips_smack inhales okay  this looks like two young people that decided to go on some kind of a raft trip ,control
inhales and um they were equipped with  life preservers ,control
although I don't see one on the girl ,control
inhales um and it has overturned in rapids ,control
and the young man was able to catch a tree inhales and hold on ,control
but it looks like the young woman  has not been able to grab on to anything ,control
other_than him hopefully ,control
inhales and it is a very scary situation ,control
 um inhales the ending is ,control
inhales she grabbed his leg ,control
lips_smack inhales and he held on to her   she held on to him head,control
and help was called ,control
and they were saved ,control
 lips_smack inhales okay a young boy is outside playing soccer ,control
kicking the ball around ,control
practicing for making  hi uh for his tryouts for his team ,control
inhales um unfortunately the ball gets kicked through a window ,control
where a man is sitting ,control
it knocks over a lamp head,control
inhales and  completely surprises this man head,control
and scares him ,control
inhales he jumps up with the ball ,control
inhales h his first instinct is to look out the window to see who kicked the ball ,control
inhales um he,control
the young boy apologizes ,control
inhales the man takes him back to his home ,control
and they make a resolution for the young boy to pay for the window that needs to be fixed ,control
and the lamp probably ,control
 lips_smack inhales well little Danny is going off to school ,control
an,control
 I think you're going to need your,control
inhales so  she offers him the umbrella ,control
and Danny says ,control
 Mom  lips_smack I don't need this umbrella head,control
 it's a beautiful day outside ,control
inhales so  he starts out on his way to school with his backpack on ,control
and  it starts to drip drop ,control
inhales um fairly s,control
the sky opens up ,control
and it is pouring ,control
at which point little Danny turns around ,control
and goes home ,control
inhales he walks back in the door totally dripping wet ,control
inhales mom is looking at him saying ,control
 see I told you so ,control
inhales and Danny picks up the umbrella ,control
goes back out the door ,control
and goes to school ,control
lips_smack okay ,control
inhales there was a nice young man who,control
um was very sad ,control
had a little girl that was just as precious as can be head,control
inhales and he kne,control
so,control
lips_smack um with two daughters ,control
and they decided to marry head,control
inhales so  now little Cinderella his daughter head,control
inhales they grow up in the house together ,control
but they are very very different children head,control
the two stepsisters are very vain ,control
inhales um very selfish ,control
inhales a,control
instead of them helping out head,control
inhales and the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen head,control
inhales so  Cinderella because she works so hard has no friends head,control
and  except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house ,control
inhales and they befriend her ,control
inhales she sees the,control
and ha often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle ,control
inhales as a princess ,control
inhales clears_throat meanwhile in that castle there's a prince ,control
and the prince's father is very frustrated ,control
because his so,control
inhales and the king is definitely ready for his son to get married ,control
inhales so  he decides to host a ball ,control
inhales an,control
inhales and so he sends out invitations ,control
and when Cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations ,control
inhales the girls are very very excited ,control
because now they can see themselves married to,control
 lips_smack inhales and Cinderella also shares in this dream ,control
inhales however   Cinderella's stepmother says ,control
 oh  no  head,control
 because you have head,control
inhales and forces Cinderella to do even more chores ,control
inhales because she knows in her heart inhales that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters head,control
and does not want that competition for her daughters ,control
lips_smack inhales so,control
and Cinderella goes through all her chores ,control
but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also ,control
inhales so  they help her with the chores ,control
inhales but then she realizes that she cannot head,control
inhales and so  in head,control
inhales her,control
 I will help you  Cinderella ,control
so  she  um lips_smack makes a beautiful dress appear ,control
inhales with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball head,control
inhales that is made out_of a pumpkin ,control
inhales and the mice she maves ,control
and makes into fine horses head,control
inhales that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball ,control
inhales so  in the meantime ,control
just before Cinderella takes off for the ball though she says ,control
 remember ,control
 head,control
 and after midnight head,control
 inhales and your little  fr the horses will turn back into your little friends again head,control
 so  make sure you're out_of there by midnight ,control
inhales so  Cinderella goes to the ball ,control
and nobody recognizes her head,control
because she's dressed beautifully ,control
she's clean ,control
she smells good ,control
inhales and the prince is so taken with her ,control
he cannot believe his luck ,control
that he has found this beautiful young woman ,control
inhales and falls in love with her instantly ,control
love at first sight ,control
inhales um but  as they're tak taking one of their last dances ,control
inhales she hears the gong from the clock tower ,control
inhales and knows that it is midnight ,control
and she knows head,control
inhales but he doesn't want her to leave ,control
and he holds her back ,control
and she says ,control
 no  I must go ,control
inhales and she runs out_of his arms ,control
runs down the stairs ,control
inhales trips just a little bit before she gets into her coach ,control
inhales as she trips she leaves behind one of the glass slippers ,control
that the fairy godmother had k put on her feet ,control
inhales but she has no head,control
so  she continues ,control
and  just as the fairy godmother promised ,control
at midnight the coach turned back head,control
and the horses were her little mouse friends again ,control
inhales and her gown is gone ,control
and she's back into the rags ,control
that she usually is in ,control
lips_smack inhales well the prince is heartbroken ,control
he cannot believe head,control
and he's lost her ,control
inhales he doesn't even really know her name ,control
lips_smack inhales so  he decides  that um he's got to find her ,control
he runs after her ,control
inhales and lo_and_behold he finds the glass slipper ,control
inhales so  he decides to go door to door to find out who's foot will fit into the glass slipper ,control
inhales and when he finds her he'll know that that's the woman that he was dancing with ,control
and the woman of his dreams ,control
lips_smack inhales so  they go from place to place  place to place ,control
he's very tired ,control
he knocks on the stepmother's door ,control
inhales and she pushes her step dau or  her daughters into the forefront ,control
inhales and both of these girls try to cram their huge gigantic feet into this tiny delicate slipper ,control
inhales they will not fit  at all ,control
and he says to her ,control
 do you have any other daughters ,control
 is there anyone else that this might fit ,control
and of_course she says ,control
 no ,control
inhales but um Cinderella comes from shrugs somewhere appears and says ,control
 could I try on the slipper ,control
inhales her foot slides very easily into the slipper ,control
the prince has found his princess ,control
inhales and they marry ,control
and live happily ever after ,control
