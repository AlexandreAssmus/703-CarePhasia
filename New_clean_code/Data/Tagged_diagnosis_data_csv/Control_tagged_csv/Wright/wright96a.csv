the cat ran up in the tree and the little girl couldn't get him down ,control
so  she called for her dad ,control

okay ,control
um this was about two years ago ,control
and I was having uh pain in my left hip ,control
points,control
and I'd had a car accident earlier that year ,control
so  I thought maybe it was related to that ,control
uh but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an xray ,control
and they found out that um the bone  the joint was actually dying because I had what was called uh avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didn't join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off ,control
so,control
so  um we set up the appointment ,control
um or the  the specialist set up the appointment uh you_know with the hospital for the date of surgery ,control
and I went into the hospital ,control
and um shrugs shakes,control
I've never really been sick or anything in my life ,control
so  um they put me under ,control
and I actually kind_of woke up before they were completely finished ,control
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldn't feel anything from the waist down ,control
but they were finishing up ,control
and I was like looking around ,control
and the doctor was kinda surprised ,control
he was like ,control
 oh  just be calm ,control
 we're almost done ,control
um and uh so then after that they wheeled me into the r recovery room where you_know I kinda came more out_of the anesthetic ,control
and then I spent two days in the hospital uh before they were  uh before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home ,control
um and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work ,control
um and then it was ges a year before they said I was completely healed ,control
but um yeah that was the  the only time I've ever really been in the hospital ,control
no  it was really kind_of strange because I  you_know I trusted the doctors ,control
and I thought I w would be afraid you_know especially when they were putting me under ,control
um but I really wasn't frightened or  or scared ,control
oh yeah definitely ,control
sure laughs ,control
alright this was uh gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager ,control
and uh my family uh we lived in Anchorage and we'd always  every weekend we would go down to the Kenai_Peninsula to either the Kenai_River or the Russian_River to go salmon fishing because the salmon would run ,control
and so um I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught ,control
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite ,control
and I was wearing ges,control
everybody wears waders ,control
so  anyway I was ges,control
and I'm walking along ,control
and I hear something ges,control
and I look over to my right ,control
and I see a little baby moose ges ,control
and I'm like ,control
 oh  how cute a baby moose ,control
well  I hear something ges,control
and I look over and it's the mother moose ,control
and it freaked me out ,control
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby ,control
and I had this huge thing of fish ges,control
and I was like   s I  I didn't wanna drop the fish because I thought that would make noise ,control
so  I was trying to like tiptoe as fast as I could through that area ,control
and I was able to get past that ,control
I don't know how I was able to get through there ,control
I don't know how the  m the mother moose didn't hear me because they have good hearing ,control
they don't see very well ,control
but apparently ges,control
I don't know ,control
but yeah  I was like scared for laughs my life there for a little bit until I got past that area and back to camp ,control
they're huge ,control
and they look so goofy and ,control
but they can be really dangerous ,control
yeah  actually my grandmother uh on my dad's side um you_know as she got older um ,control
she'd had uh a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks um in her life ,control
but as she got older her memory started to go ,control
and it was  uh I think she ,control
I don't know if it was Alzheimer's that she had or dementia or what ,control
but we would go to see her you_know from time to time ,control
and you_know sometimes she would be really th you_know with it ,control
she could remember lots of things ,control
and other times you would kind_of hafta tell her who you  who you were and talk really slowly ,control
and you_know she would keep repeating twirls,control
and she'd be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother ,control
and so ,control
 no ,control
you hafta say ,control
 no Grandma it's Rich ,control
and she's ,control
 oh  Richie ,control
and so then you_know she would remember who I was for awhile ,control
and then she'd kinda fade out again ,control
so  it was difficult to communicate ,control
it was kind_of hard emotionally too you_know because I remember her from when she was younger ,control
and she was like my favorite grandmother ,control
and she was really a_lot_of fun ,control
and then to see her in that situation where she's just kind_of a shadow of her former self was  was upsetting ,control
so ,control
um well  I would hold her hand you_know and just be  you_know modulate my tone of voice ,control
um you_know  just repeat it if  if she couldn't understand ,control
um you_know  just be there for her really ,control
sometimes she couldn't understand ,control
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didn't ,control
you_know  you would talk to her and she may not understand ,control
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm ges,control
okay ,control
Joey had just joined the soccer team and he was very excited ,control
so  he was on his way home uh with the soccer ball kicking it around as he went trying to make sure that he would be ready for the big soccer match next weekend ,control
unfortunately he got a_little too enthusiastic with his kicks ,control
and the soccer ball went through a window in his neighborhood ,control
Mister_Moss was sitting calmly in his chair watching tv when all of a sudden the soccer ball came crashing through his window in the living room and hit a lamp and knocked it over ,control
he jumped out_of the chair grabbed the soccer ball and looked out the window ,control
but he couldn't see anybody because Joey had hidden in the bushes ,control
and he was perplexed as to who had done this and what he was going to do about it ,control
the end  whispering laughs ,control
okay ,control
one day a little boy was getting ready to go to school ,control
and his mother said that he had better take a rain  shakes,control
the little boy said ,control
 it never rains when they say it's going to rain so I don't need the umbrella ,control

well  he'd barely gotten out_of the  out_of the house and down the street when all_of_a_sudden it didn't just start raining ,control
it started pouring ,control
so  he ran back to the house as fast as he could totally annoyed at himself for not taking the umbrella ,control
he got inside the house where his mother was also not very happy with him because he was soaking wet ,control
and she was afraid he was gonna catch a cold ,control
he  fi he took the umbrella this time and then walked  o and went back outside and headed on to school where he made it safely and dry ,control

um once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella ,control
and unfortunately her father passed away ,control
and she was sent to live with um her stepmother and stepsisters um who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful ,control
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun ,control
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm ,control

because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that uh somebody was  would be uh able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king ,control
so  couriers went across the land and delivered the uh message or delivered invitations to all the eligible uh bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom ,control
and the  t the stepsisters were very excited ,control
and Cinderella was excited too ,control
but then they laughed at her saying ,control
 you can't go to the ball ,control
 you don't have a dress ,control
 you're just a scrub girl ,control
and Cinderella was very sad about that ,control
but her friends the animals um made a dress for her so  so she could go to the ball ,control
um unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her ,control
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball ,control
so  they ripped the dress up ,control
and Cinderella was sent down to the  to the cellar ,control
um and she cried ,control
and then all_of_a_sudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying ,control
and she told her story to the fairy godmother ,control
and the fairy godmother waved her wand ,control
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with  with glass slippers ,control
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin ,control
and it turned into a beautiful carriage ,control

uh she met the prince ,control
and they danced the night away ,control
but the  Cin but the uh fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight ,control

but uh he couldn't catch up with her ,control
she  Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden slip or  one of her glass slippers on the stairs ,control
uh she made it to the carriage and got home just in time ,control
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin ,control
and the mice turned or  the horses turned back into mice ,control
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because he was  his heart belonged to her now ,control
so  he sent couriers across the land again with the  g the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper ,control
and then he would know who  who was the beautiful woman at the ball ,control
so  when the courier got to uh Cinderella's house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting uh to try the slippers on ,control
but unfortunately they  the slippers didn't fit either one of them ,control
and Cinderella came out_of the cellar and sat down ,control
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at  at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle ,control
