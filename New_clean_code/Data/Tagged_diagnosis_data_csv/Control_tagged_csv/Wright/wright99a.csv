okay ,control
first you get some bread out_of the pantry ,control
and then you go to the refrigerator ,control
and you get a jar of jelly ,control
uh and then you hafta ges,control
and you ges,control
you open up twists,control
you open up twists,control
and then you open up the bag of bread ,control
you take two slices of the bread out ,control
and you get a butter knife from the drawer ,control
and you take out ges,control
and you smear it ges,control
and then you take that same knife and use it to ges,control
and spread that ges,control
and then you claps,control
hadta think about that ,control
I was like ,control
 wow how ,control
so  little Sally was playing with her cat out in the front yard of the house ,control
she was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them ,control
the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree ,control
and little Sally was worried about points,control
so  she went and found a ladder ,control
she was gonna put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said ,control
 oh_no  no  don't worry about it ,control
 points,control
at which point the dog came back and scared the man ,control
and he ran up into the tree ,control
little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree ,control
so  she hadta call the  pfoli the firemen so_that they could come and rescue everybody ,control
I will tell you about having my tonsils out laughs at the  at uh uh points,control
uh I had had strep throat five times in one year ,control
and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to hafta come out ,control
which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult ,control
and I still had them at all ,control
so  uh my sister came into town to uh stay with me traces,control
and I hadta go to Scottsdale ,control
um I think I went to Scottsdale_Samaritan to have it done ,control
but it  they did it like on a day surgery ,control
um but what I remember about it most is al it hurt ,control
but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning ,control
but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight ,control
so  by the time I got in there I was like a little bit dehydrated ,control
so  they couldn't find a vein touches,control
and they hadta stick me like six times in_order_to touches,control
and that was very very unpleasant laughs ,control
um they  they finally got it in ges,control
they had The_Wall on for the music ,control
and I was like ,control
 oh  that's gonna be great ,control
 you're gonna gimme drugs ,control
 and I'm listening to Pink_Floyd ,control
 so  this is gonna be a good day ,control
uh so  did that um laid down on the gurney ,control
they gave me ges,control
and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery ,control
uh ges,control
it was painful ,control
I felt I wanted to cry ,control
in_fact  I did cry just because it was so unpleasant ,control
and it hurt so bad ,control
um they were trying to give me like some water to help kind_of ges,control
and I couldn't swallow it ,control
so  it was coming back out_of my nose ,control
it was just  it was a mess ,control
it was horrible ,control
um but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out ,control
but it was like arms,control
um and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out ,control
so  I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to  to feel better ,control
the only thing I could eat were popsicles ,control
um you_know  people were like ,control
 oh  you always get ice cream ,control
 you get ice cream ,control
but I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have ice cream ,control
so  that made it that much worse ,control
um I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt  it was burning my throat ,control
um and it was probably  it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that ,control
um and I've had people ask me you_know ,control
 if you hadta do it all over again ,control
I was like ,control
 scoffs I'd have just  I'd just continue to have strep throat ,control
that's what I would continue to do ,control
I would not have had them out at my age points,control
so  laughs ,control
mhm ,control
yes ,control
uh,control
and they were  actually I spent a_lot_of time in Iraq and Afghanistan ,control
and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you ,control
so  it's  it's collectively a scary situation all the time because you're in a country and kind_of a situation where not everybody likes you ,control
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just don't want you there ,control
so  when we would hafta go ges,control
um any time you're on the road you're essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks ,control
so  you're constantly having to watch and look around points,control
um one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you don't stop on the road ,control
you just  you always keep going ges,control
ges,control
you always keep going keep going keep going ,control
and  we were part of a convoy ,control
it was like a ges,control
but I guess points,control
or he didn't get the memo that you don't stop because it makes you a target ,control
and he decided to stop for some cows ges,control
so  he decided to stop ,control
and we all lost our xxx ges,control
I_mean we were like ,control
 what are you doing ,control
but you don't wanna get out because that also makes you a target ,control
so  everybody's ges,control
 get back in the vehicles ,control
 get back in the vehicles ,control
and you're having to yell it ,control
so  it was a little bit of a  of a crazy situation ,control
um the whole thing probably lasted  maybe two minutes ,control
maybe two minutes ,control
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to  to everything ,control
so  yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation ,control
yes ,control
um  th this person  they have dɪfɪkəlpɪu ,control
I_mean they have the ability to talk ,control
they are  um  don't have the skill base in talking with adults though ,control
um it's a friend of mine who teaches at a ges,control
so  she spends a_lot_of time around ges,control
so  when it comes time to ges,control
um  more it's being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time ges,control
um I think there's probably some selfesteem issues that go with that ,control
so  she's not out ,control
she's not socializing ,control
and then when she does go it's like puffs,control
it's like ges,control
or if there's something that's bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like you_know ,control
 do you wanna talk ,control
 do you wanna talk ,control
 do you wanna talk ,control
and you don't ever say anything ,control
so  um  eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as that's just part of that person's behavior ,control
um and that's how they're  they're choosing not to communicate by ges,control
 okay ,control
so  little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer ,control
he had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him ,control
but his dad said ,control
 no I'm very busy ,control
 I hafta watch tv ,control
so  little Billy was kicking the ball around by himself ,control
and then the ball went too far ,control
and it went points,control
and it smashed points,control
little Billy's dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said ,control
 guess I should have gone out there and played with him ,control
and now I have dysfunctional family stories ,control
so  laughs ,control
 okay ,control
one morning little Billy was getting ready to go to school ,control
his mom said ,control
 little Billy before you leave make sure you take an umbrella ,control
and little Billy said ,control
 Mom  I live in Arizona ,control
 it never rains here ,control
 I certainly won't need an umbrella ,control
and mom said ,control
 okay  suit yourself ,control
so  little Billy started walking to school ,control
he got about halfway to school when it started to  he started to feel raindrops on his head ,control
and he said ,control
 hm,control
but the longer it went on the harder it rained ,control
so  he ran all the way home ,control
and he said ,control
 you know what  Mom ,control
 you were right ,control
 I should have taken an umbrella ,control
so  she gave him the umbrella ,control
and little Billy continued to walk in  s walk to school ,control
and he thought to himself ,control
 boy Arizona weather  changes from minute to minute  kinda ,control
so  laughs ,control
okay ,control
so  Cinderella was living with her father ,control
her mother had died a long time ago ,control
and her father had decided ,control
 it's time that you had a mother ,control
 and you need some brothers and sisters ,control
so  he went out ges,control
and he found a woman who he thought he could like ,control
and he married her and brought her and her two s daughters ges,control
 here you go ,control
 here's your family ,control
 uh you now have a new mother ,control
 and you have new sisters to go along with it ,control
well  what the father didn't know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet ,control
and they treated Cinderella horribly ,control
they made her do all the cooking ,control
they made her do all the cleaning while he was off ges,control
that's why he wasn't around ,control
that's why he didn't know what was going on ,control
so  uh  the ,control
Cinderella i is having to do all the housework ,control
and she's taking care of everything ,control
and the evil sis stepsisters are just you_know bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do ,control
so  Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were uh there ges,control
and she would talk to them ,control
and they would talk to her because they had that special communication ,control
um then one day from where Cinderella was at she  when she would talking with the animals she could see like arms,control
and off in the distance ges,control
and she always thought ,control
 wow it would be so neat if I could live in a castle ,control
 that would just be amazing ,control
 but I'm Cinderella and that won't ever happen because I hafta make sure that I ges,control
meanwhile  ges,control
and people in the town are ges,control
so  he's a little bit worried about it ,control
so  he says ,control
 okay here's what we'll do ,control
 we will put this whole proclamation thing out ,control
 and we will get ges,control
 and we'll let the prince pick one ,control
 you_know  with all the women spreads,control
 so  we'll bring them all here ,control
so  they send out a message to ges,control
they say ,control
 okay  we're having this big birthday party for the prince ,control
 bring your single daughters ges,control
 and because he is going to be picking a wife ,control
and the evil stepmother gets this message ,control
and she says ,control
 well  this is great ,control
 I'm going to put my daughters because then we can get out_of this hovel and move back in ges,control
and we'll be all rich and famous ,control
and Cinderella thinks ,control
 wow that would be kinda cool ,control
 um maybe I could get into this because I'm pretty good at you_know sewing and everything ,control
 and I've actually made a dress ,control
 so  you_know  I should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters ,control
so  she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room ,control
and the ges,control
 wow she looks a_lot points better than we do ,control
 so  we can't let that happen ,control
so  they rip up ges,control
and then they take her ,control
and they like ges,control
and then they take off ges,control
and Cinderella is really sad ,control
and she's like ,control
 oh_no  this is really a bummer ,control
and while she's upset she finds this book ges,control
and while flipping through the book she sees a reference to a fairy godmother ,control
so  she reads the reference and all_of_a_sudden poofo opens,control
and she says ,control
 well  Cinderella I'm here to help you out uh because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things ,control
 I'm gonna grant you some wishes ,control
 and we're gonna get you to ges,control
and so Cinderella says ,control
 okay  well  what are  how do we make this happen ,control
she said ,control
 well  first we need the  a way to get you there ,control
so  she takes Cinderella's little animal friends ,control
and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her ges,control
she turns the mice into coachmen ,control
and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into uh a big carriage ges,control
so  she does all of this ,control
and then she says ,control
 bingo ges,control
 the catch is  is that you gotta be back by midnight ,control
and Cinderella says ,control
 midnight shrugs that's cool ,control
 I can live with that ,control
so  she goes over to uh the coach ,control
and they get in there and they take her up ,control
and she's escorted into the big ball party ,control
and everybody is looking going ,control
 wow who's that amazing looking girl over there ,control
 we've never seen her before ,control
 but she must be new ,control
so  she comes in ,control
and the stepsisters see her ,control
and they're like ,control
 she looks familiar but we can't quite place her ,control
 but something's just not right ,control
so  the prince sees her and says ,control
 wow you're a pretty good looking girl ,control
 let's go dance ,control
 let's talk ,control
so  they're dancing ,control
and they're talking ,control
they're having a great time ,control
and he's like ,control
 wow this is amazing ,control
 I think I found the woman of my dreams ,control
when she happens to look at the clock and says ,control
 oh  I got to go and imit,control
and while she's running off to get back into uh the coach she loses a shoe ,control
so  she drops ges,control
but she ges,control
and at midnight bingo opens,control
and everything goes back to normal ,control
but she still has the other glass slipper ,control
so  she says ,control
 oh  this is a nice souvenir ,control
so  she holds on to that ,control
and then uh the next day the prince is like ,control
 well  I gotta find this girl because this is the woman of my dreams ,control
 so  I have this shoe ,control
 it'll fit whoever was wearing it ,control
 so  I'll just go around to all ges,control
 and I will try and put this shoe on them ,control
 and whoever fits is gonna be  is the one  is the woman I'm looking for ,control
so  he goes from house to house to house ,control
and some people's feet are too big ,control
and some people's feet are too small ,control
and some people just they don't have feet at all so they don't even get to wear it ,control
and he finally comes to the evil stepsisters' and the stepmother's house ,control
and he's trying to ges,control
and they're like ges,control
so  they just don't fit ,control
in the meantime Cinderella has been trapped back laughs ,control
 she's st laughs  she's stuck in a room because laughs the stepmother doesn't want her to be seen by the prince ,control
not because she thinks it's her or anything ,control
ges,control
so  laughs  so the mice realize ,control
 hey we got to get Cinderella out because this is her really chance to  to excel and shine ,control
so  they smuggle the key in ,control
and she unlocks the door ,control
and she comes out ,control
and she's like ,control
 hey  I think you found my shoe ,control
and he went ,control
 well  let me see your foot ,control
so  he puts it on ges,control
and lo_and_behold the shoe fits ,control
and he's like ,control
 this is the woman of my dreams ,control
and the evil stepmother's like ,control
 you  no no no waves finger,control
and he's like ,control
