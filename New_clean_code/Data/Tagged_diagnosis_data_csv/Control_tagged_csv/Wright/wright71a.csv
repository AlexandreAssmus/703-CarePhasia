she inhales was in her car ,control
and it was swep ,control
but she was fortunate t enough to escape ,control
inhales and a um exhales lips_smack fireman or a policeman had been inhales aware of the situations ,control
and either was called or was lucky to be there with a vest on ,control
inhales and he used an overhanging limb to reach out to her ,control
and um exhales lips_smack inhales his hands aren't around her ,control
but she's hanging tight to his muscled arm ,control
and I think he will bring her ashore ,control
 laughs  lips_smack the boy is out practicing his soccer kicks ,control

holds the ball ,control
and looks out the window ,control

inhales and she came down ,control
and was starting to work on making this dress,control
inhales and the step daughters looked at her and they said ,control
 well  you're not going ,control
