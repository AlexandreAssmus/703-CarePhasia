mom had planned a birthday party ,control
it was gonna be the fourth birthday party for her  s her youngest boy ,control
she had set out a  m the most beautiful cake ,control
well  the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake ,control
so  he got himself a big mouthful ,control
and got his paws into it too ,control
and ran and hid underneath the sofa so_that the mom couldn't get at him with the broom ,control
the little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined ,control
and his mom was trying to hit his dog ,control
um in the meantime the guest started showing up at the door  uh carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on ,control
you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking uh two pieces of bread ,control
you  on one side you spread the peanut butter ,control
and on the other side you spread the jelly ,control
and then you put the two together ,control
oh_my sighs uh in about nineteen eighty four  eighty five ,control
it's been a long time ,control
um I had my four points,control
um I had  as a precaution I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so_that I wouldn't get an infection ,control
um because when I was seven years old I had rheumatic fever ,control
you_know  and they always told me ,control
 well  your immune system isn't gonna be near as strong so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery  including oral surgery ,control
so  I did that ,control
and tha that evening I  early evening my throat swelled up ,control
uh don't know if it was from the penicillin or what but um I ended up back at the dentist's office ,control
and they ended up having to take uh some epinephrine ,control
they gave me shots of epinephrine ,control
I think two of them ,control
and they also took s a syringe points,control
uh shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called ang uh ,control
they called it then angioneurotic edema uh but it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called uh hereditary angioedema ,control
um the difference between ges,control
hereditary angioedema cannot ,control
it hasta be  the only thing that  i until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that uh during an episode was the epinephrine ,control
uh during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up ,control
just out_of the clear blue ,control
uh I went to urgent care ,control
um in urgent care they started an i_v on me ,control
and the doctor ,control
I don't know if she was a doctor or a p_a ,control
um anyway she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline ges,control
an and anybody that's head,control
it goes intermuscular ,control
um because it takes  within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty beats a minute ,control
uh in my case I think I went over two hundred ,control
um and I remember my  th it felt like points,control
you_know  at the base of my skull ,control
um j just from so much pressure ,control
and I'd head,control
I've been knocked out once you_know playing football but I never passed out ,control
um and I knew I was gonna pass out ,control
and I told the doctor that ,control
and she said ,control
 okay lay back ,control
so  I  s I looked at her and said ,control
 I can't I can't ,control
 I don't dare ,control
so  she put her hands behind me ges,control
and at that point I don't know what was going on externally but internally I was  fishing with my grandfather ,control
and he was  it was at a favorite fishing place that I  that I had uh when I was growing up ,control
and he was walking up the  r the stream bank wanting ta ,control
and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him ,control
and I said ,control
 I wanna go ,control
 I wanna go ,control
 h no it's not your time to go fishing with me ,control
 go home ,control
so  I woke up and later was told that um ,control
I  I can recall actually  I don't  I don't know if this is something you want on tape or not but ,control
I  I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was like looking at myself and looking at the doctor and you_know watching what they were doing ,control
and it was like ,control
 jeez  what are you doing to me ,control
and then it hit me that ,control
 oh  yeah  they're doing it to me laughs ,control
uh  my wife hasta fill in the details you_know of other stuff that happened ,control
but apparently they brought in the crash cart ,control
and I guess you_know zapped me at_least once ,control
uh I did come back ,control
uh overall I was out for seven minutes ,control
uh not breathing for seven minutes ,control
and to this day have had little if any uh effects you_know  aftereffects from that ,control
you_know  they  they say seven minutes your brain is dead ,control
well  I have no idea why but it didn't affect me ,control
not  I'm sure sometimes it effects me you_know in some of my memory but that could be aging too laughs so ,control
that is very vivid to me ,control
the  sighs probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee uh who was actually hired for me ,control
he came in as  uh I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe uh and needed an assistant ,control
the assistant was brought in ,control
and  when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kind_of looked at each other and said ,control
 what did he just say ,control
uh he's Filipino ,control
uh he's  he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog ,control
um I don't know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently ,control
uh there's a_lot_of people that wouldn't give him the chance ,control
and you_know I actually was doing some interpreting for him beca you_know at one time or another because I understood what he was saying ,control
uh and  that was  to me it was probably the most difficult uh one that I hadta deal with ,control
uh not because I didn't understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him ,control
um but I also spent some time in Mexico ,control
and there's people down there that speak no English ,control
so  I've you_know hadta adapt ,control
and I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish ,control
enough to get by ,control
uh things like uh uh uh ,control
 gustans,control
uh or uh ,control
 dondes,control
you_know  the important stuff you_know laughs ,control
uh the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico ,control
and we were  at the time we'd been discussing this ,control
and we were just standing in line at the movie theater ,control
and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico ,control
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see ,control
you_know  to go to the  the island of Cozumel and you_know travel around there a little bit ,control
because there's some ruins there and it's a really nice place ,control
well  the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there uh apparently was an ex marine or something ,control
he was just perfectly built ,control
um and he had  they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab they'd gotten near the port ,control
I think they were doing uh one of the Princess_Cruises or something ,control
so  they'd come into port and had been  spent the day there ,control
and then they hadta get back to the ship ,control
so  they hired a cab ,control
well  the cab starts going the other direction ,control
and he kept telling him ,control
 no  no  no  no you're going the wrong way ,control
 the port's over here ,control
you_know ,control
 you needta go back this way ,control
and he wouldn't stop ,control
and he kept saying ,control
 not to worry ,control
 I know short cut ,control
 it's okay ,control
and he said he finally ended up uh convincing the guy that he better stop ,control
um and he and his wife just jumped out_of the vehicle as it was moving ,control
and people in the neighborhood that they were  that they had jumped out_of into uh started screaming about  you_know at  yelling for the federaless,control
uh so  here we are ,control
maybe a month away  not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this ,control
we get there to Cozumel ,control
and soon as you get off the ferry uh there's all these cab drivers there ,control
and  wanting to you_know take you around the city  or around the island ,control
so  this one kin you_know kind_of  I don't know  it was kind_of like hey pick me raise,control
and  and so we went over to him ,control
and he says that oh yeah he'd be glad to take us ,control
and he says ,control
 uh I'll even give you a tour of the whole island ,control
you_know ,control
 you can spend however long you want with me today ,control
says uh you_know and he told us how much ,control
and I can't even remember the amount ,control
we get in the vehicle and ,control
you_know  we made the contract ,control
we got in the vehicle ,control
and right off the bat he takes off into the middle of town ,control
 don't worry ,control
 it's okay ,control
 I just hafta stop and let the owner of the cab know where we're going ,control
so  here I am with my wife and my sister inlaw ,control
the three of us ,control
and we're sitting there ,control
the sister inlaw is just in La_la_land like ,control
 hey  this is just great ,control
 you_know  this is fantastic ,control
 we paid this much money which was nothing for a cab for all day ,control
 and we're gonna go see this you_know  this island ,control
and this guy goes in  into it's basically a bar ,control
and my wife and I are going ,control
 oh_my_god ,control
this is it ,control
 we're gonna   we're either gonna be abducted or we're gonna be killed right here ,control
well  come to find out the guy was just going in to tell the cab  the owner of the cab because apparently they owned it  uh it was coownership ,control
so  he went in to tell the other guy that ,control
 hey don't worry about using the cab because I'm using it for the day ,control
and he was a very good tour guide ,control
very good to us all day ,control
uh but it was  i like I said it  w it was scary there for quite awhile ,control
well  it was the great flood of uh nineteen eighty ,control
and people were doing such foolish things ,control
but in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people ,control
putting their lives on the line ,control
we have a firefighter that jumped in the water n to save a little girl who was about to drown ,control
and he held onto her until other help could get there to help get her out_ofthe  the water  the swirling water ,control
surely she would have died if he hadn't been there to help her out ,control
well  Danny was out playing soccer in the front yard ,control
and he'd been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well ,control
um so  he gave it a boot one time ,control
and he actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it ,control
and it went over an and uh hit the window of the  the house nearby ,control
and broke the window ,control
and fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair ,control
the father of the house ,control
when they  when he approached  when it fell on his lap he was startled ,control
and got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from ,control
but of_course the little boy had run away ,control
well  it was a cloudy day ,control
and mother had watched  the uh or  heard the news  the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day ,control
so  when I was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella ,control
and I said ,control
 oh  mom  it's not gonna rain today ,control
 I have my backpack ,control
 if anything happens I can hold it over my head ,control
 and I won't get as wet ,control
 so  I'm not gonna take the umbrella ,control
 I'll be fine ,control
I no sooner got down the road then wouldn't you know lo_and_behold it started to rain ,control
the rain turned into a torrent ,control
and I was actually getting very soak  soaked  from head to toe ,control
my backpack was wet ,control
my shoes were even wet ,control
I got back to my  to the house ,control
and my mom looked at me and didn't say a word ,control
but she knew ,control
after changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack I headed out again on my way to school ,control
this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain ,control
the story of Cinderella ,control
once upon a time in a land far far away ,control
there was a young girl whose parents had died ,control
she had an aunt but her aunt was a very bitter person ,control
so  she and the children  her children  her daughters were living in the house ,control
but Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid ,control
she hadta keep the house cleaned up no matter what ,control
as she grew older she grew more and more beautiful ,control
but even as beautiful as she was she was still just the housemaid ,control
the other girls grew up ,control
they weren't near as beautiful as she was ,control
in the meantime the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married ,control
and to do that he wanted ta ,control
he sent out invitations to all the  w the influential people within the land that they would  could attend the ball ,control
Cinderella's mother ,control
and had decided to send her two daughters ,control
Cinderella said ,control
 well  can I also go ,control
and they  and her mother said ,control
 no you can't ,control
 you're to stay here and keep this place clean ,control
so  while she was doing that she was  became a little bit disconcerted ,control
and her  a all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball ,control
because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her ,control
and she asked what she really wanted ,control
and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball ,control
so  her fairy godmother waved her wand ,control
a and gave her s a the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear ,control
to take her off to the ball she hadta have a coach ,control
so  she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin ,control
she turned the pumpkin into the coach ,control
and the mice who were friends of and playmates of Cinderella were there to draw the coach ,control
and the cat was there to  to guide the coach ,control
they get to the ball ,control
and Cinderella meets the prince ,control
she has a dance with the prince ,control
and the prince doesn't wanna see anyone else ,control
he is enjoying himself so much ,control
but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight you will become the same Cinderella that you were before ,control
no matter where you are you needta be  you needta come home ,control
so  as this clock was striking mid the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince ,control
on her way out she lost her slipper  one of her glass slippers ,control
she got to her coach ,control
and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin ,control
and turned  and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat ,control
she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again ,control
as it turned ,control
the prince was so excited about this pretty young women that he wanted to meet her ,control
he had kept the  the glass slipper ,control
and knew that he hadta see her again ,control
so  he sent out a decree to look for the young woman whose  who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper ,control
that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her ,control
all of their  all of the women  the young women decided to go and try the slipper but none of them could make it fit ,control
including her sisters ,control
so  eventually she was able to go and see the prince ,control
and try on the slipper ,control
and the prince announced that he  this was the woman that he would marry ,control
and they all lived happily ever after ,control
well  at the very beginning there was uh a bird that was hopping around in the yard ,control
and  little girl's cat started chasing after the bird ,control
well  somewhere along the line a little  the commotion was recognized by the neighbor's dog ,control
and the neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree ,control
the bird was in the tree ,control
the cat was in the tree ,control
the little girl called for her father ,control
and he came over with a ladder ,control
and got up in the tree to try and get the cat down ,control
well  the ladder fell so now he was trapped in the tree ,control
and the little girl was hoping the cat would come down ,control
the neighbor seeing all this had called the fire department and  who showed up with another ladder to try and help the man and the cat down off the tree ,control
and they all lived happily ever after ,control
