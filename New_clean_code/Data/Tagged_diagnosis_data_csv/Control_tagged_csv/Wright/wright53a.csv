not knowing quite what to do about it ,control
I went to different people ,control

and people useta ring the doorbell when they come in ,control

you_know  when they were talking to me I  I couldn't  I could hear uh like tone and volume but I could not hear the distinction ,control
so  I  you_know  I kept thinking ,control

what's r laughs ,control
so  um that was the beginning of you_know finding out that I had a hearing loss ,control
and uh now I have hearing aids ,control
