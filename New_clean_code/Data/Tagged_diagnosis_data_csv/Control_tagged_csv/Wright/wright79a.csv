demoting you constantly ,control

um  and a girl ,control
in uh what appears to be a creek or a river ,control
um s especially fast moving water ,control
uh the gentleman I say gentleman because he's all muscular and looks like he's got a moustache ,control
is hanging from a tree branch ,control
which is either coming up  out_of the water ,control
or going into the water ,control
it looks as though it's coming out_of the water ,control
s,control
to keep herself from floating down the stream or river ,control
whatever ,control
uh he has a   a leather belt which he  pi I presume he's gonna put around her ,control
and uh maybe a helicopter or a  uh another set of rescue people  will pull her in from the precarious area she's a located at now ,control
looks like everything's gonna turn out  okay head,control
that is probably of the end of the story ,control
 alright ,control
now ,control
the beginning of the story is a picture of a boy  kicking a volleyball ,control
he seems to be having a good time ,control
but negligent in the fact that he doesn't know where he's kicking it ,control
now he's kicked it into the window  of a home ,control
and  by some reason he's kicked it through the window ,control
the ball has knocked the lamp off the table ,control
a f,control
there's  also there's stuff laying on the floor ,control
 uh the man now gets up ,control
looks out the window which  yeah he's closer so the window would it  uh the hole will look open more ,control
he's got the ball in his hand looking out I guess  who to blame or seeing where it came from ,control

uh,control
because it's raining outside ,control
and he'll need it ,control
the kid uh  as most kids are  says ,control

because uh now there's water all over the ground where he's walking ,control
sighs  looks like his head's getting wet and everything else ,control
so  finally he hasta go in and face mother ,control
admit that he's wrong ,control
