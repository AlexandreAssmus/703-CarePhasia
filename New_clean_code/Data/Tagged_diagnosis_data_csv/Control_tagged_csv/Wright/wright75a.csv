the cat's stuck in the tree ,control
the dad tried to get the cat out_of the tree ,control
but he  h doesn't look like he was successful ,control
and his ladder fell down ,control
and the little girl's standing under the cat crying ,control
and the dog's barking at the man up the tree ,control
and the firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder ,control
um and there's also a bird in the tree ,control
well  you take two slices of bread ,control
and you put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other one ,control
and you put them together ,control
and that makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control
well  not on camera but I've already told you that five years ago I had cancer ,control
I had surgery ,control
I had radiation ,control
I had chemotherapy which lasted well into three months ,control
uh all my hair fell out ,control
it grew back in ,control
my eyelashes didn't ,control
but head,control
uh w actually my eyelashes came back ,control
shows,control
uh  I lost thirty pounds ,control
and that was not from being sick ,control
uh because I was head,control
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo ,control
I  I lost it because something in the chemotherapy  gave ges me a very bad taste in my mouth ,control
it tasted like I was chewing on pennies ,control
you ges ever p when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth and felt that ges taste ,control
that's what everything tasted like to me no matter what it was ,control
and so food just didn't really have much of an appeal ,control
but I'm diabetic so I hadta eat ,control
but I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check ,control
so  I lost thirty pounds which was not b a bad thing ,control
I wish I coulda kept it off ,control
unfortunately as I  once we got the  the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation ,control
uh it took about two and a half years ,control
but I gained all the weight back ,control
and uh I go in  two weeks back to my oncologist for my five year checkup ,control
and at that time if all sims ,control
so  that's  that's head,control
uh yes head,control
um well  let's see ,control
um when it came to  m to me probably the most frightening thing I ever had was when somebody w uh somebody p a Peeping_Tom was standing at my window ,control
and I just happened to look up and stared him right in the eye ,control
scared me to death ,control
but on a even deeper level the thing that scared me the most I think ,control
I lived in Japan ,control
and my daughters were one and two ,control
and I had them  my husband was in the field and I had them both in high chairs ,control
and I was making hot chocolate for them ,control
and it was the kind where you put ges,control
and then you pour the hot water ,control
 y and my oldest girl was not in a high chair ,control
she was at the table ,control
and uh I had the powder in both k in the cups ,control
and I went ges,control
and as I did she was so anxious she decided to get up at the table as ges,control
and her fingers hit the  cu ges,control
and flipped the cup ges,control
and scared me to death ,control
what scared me was she didn't cry ,control
uh she  fortun it was winter and she had ges,control
and uh I hurried up and got that off of her ,control
and  got in my car ,control
and you couldn't call nineoneone then ,control
it's  this is fifty years ago ,control
uh so  I got in my car to take her to the dispensary which was a good ways away ,control
and uh I had my neighbor  I gave the baby hands,control
and ges,control
and started points to the  dis the dispensary ,control
and uh as I went through the hand,control
and honked the horn like crazy ,control
and he came over ,control
and I told him what had happened ,control
and he said ,control
 move over ,control
and he got hand,control
and the guy points in the jeep  in the MP jeep led the way points with his siren on ,control
the other MP drove my car ,control
and we went over to the base  to the  the  to the dispensary ,control
and they took her ges right in ,control
and while I was sitting there she shrugs passed out I thought ,control
and the doctor said to me ,control
 talk to her ,control
 keep talking to her ,control
and so I kept talking ,control
 Marianne  it's Mommy ,control
 Marianne  talk to me  Marianne ,control
and I'd watch eyelashes,control
head,control
the next day he told me that her heart has had ges stopped ,control
that she had gone into shock ,control
and that it was only ges,control
but it scared me ,control
s I_mean I wasn't even aware of how bad it was ,control
he didn't wanna tell me ,control
I said to him the next day when I took her back to him ,control
I said ,control
 why didn't you tell me what was happening ,control
he said ,control
 because I didn't need two patients ,control
 I only needed one ,control
 uh and you were the only one ,control
 it was  ye your points voice was the only thing that was gonna bring her back ,control
so  that's probably head,control
 yes ,control
I worked as a speech therapist I told you this uh in  El Paso Texas at the  cerebral palsy clinic there ,control
uh and a_lot of the people that I worked with had ,control
they were children for the most part ,control
uh and I loved working with kids ,control
so  that was  it was fun for me ,control
but they had ges all different kinds of problems ,control
 uh  some of them were ah ,control
we didn't know at the time ,control
the diagnosis wasn't thrown around like it is now because this was fifty years ago ,control
and uh uh d uh some of them were autistic ,control
the one little girl had had spinal meningitis ,control
and had  was now blind ,control
and had a hard time hearing ,control
and couldn't  head,control
she was nine ,control
but  she  they ges hadta start all over with her like she was a baby  to teach her hand,control
and they said eventually she was gonna be okay ,control
and I only worked with her for a year or so ,control
I don't know but I did speech therapy with her ,control
uh th the one patient that they sent me to see uh ,control
I_mean I had no business doing any of this ,control
I had no background ,control
uh but they head,control
and uh the one patient was a woman who had had a stroke ,control
and had aphasia ,control
and ges,control
and she was talking about her cake ,control
but ges,control
and uh I don't think I accomplished a thing with her ,control
I  I really don't ,control
um but that was before they placed so much value on early work with stroke people ,control
and I head,control
um  other_than that uh I had  uh a daughter ,control
I have a daughter who is  has a genetic  she's missing part of a chromosome ,control
and didn't talk at all til she was about two and a half ,control
never head,control
and then started off very slowly ,control
and now n I can't shut her up ,control
uh she's fifty  five ,control
and has the mental ,control
well  it's uh ,control
she would test probably at about ten years old ,control
she reads ,control
uh she's a sports fanatic ,control
but it  it was a long time coming and working with her trying ges,control
uh  to express herself in any way really  was difficult ,control
uh other_than that  I don't think so ,control
it's a picture of two people stuck in a flood ,control
 and he's hanging on for dear life to a ,control
 a tree limb ,control
but he also seems to be wearing a lifevest ,control
so  maybe he  is a paramedic or fireman or something ,control
I see nothing like that on her ,control
so  I guess he's in there to rescue her ,control
uh  yeah  I think that's about all I can tell you ,control
I wouldn't wanna be either one of them thank_you ,control
 hm ,control
okay ,control
the little boy is kicking a soccer ball around ,control
and it goes through somebody's window ,control
into a room where it knocks a lamp down ,control
and there's a man sitting ,control
and he gets up and looks out  takes the ball and looks out the window ,control
I don't really see there's an end to that story ,control
he winds up with the ball ,control
but I'm sure it didn't end there ,control
 that's about the best I can tell you on that one ,control
mkay ,control
 okay ,control
little boy's going out the door with his backpack ,control
apparently he's going to school or something ,control
and mother wants him to take an umbrella ,control
and he tells her ,control
 uh hand,control
 it's not gonna rain ,control
he doesn't want an umbrella ,control
and he goes out ,control
and pretty soon it's raining ,control
and he goes running home through the puddles with his hands trying to keep the water off his head ,control
and she's standing there waiting for him because she knew he'd be back  or drown one or the other ,control
and he goes off again with an umbrella ,control
a man has a daughter ,control
and apparently is a widower ,control
and marries a woman who has two daughters ,control
and  but he must travel ges a_lot because he's never around in the rest of the story ,control
um n n the stepmother doesn't like the  the stepdaughter ,control
and turns her into a maid for her two daughters and for herself ,control
and she's the one that hasta clean and wait on them ,control
and  and uh  she's uh very good with the anima,control
and  and they're her friends because she really has no other friends ,control
and the  meanwhile at the castle the king decides he's going to throw a ball for the prince because the prince should get married ,control
and he's not showing any signs of being interested in anybody ,control
so  they put out the word that there's gonna be a ball ,control
and they send out invitations ,control
and the stepmother gets the invitation and sets to making ready her two daughters ,control
and Cinderella uh who uh they don't even consider as part of the family wh goes into the trunks of things that pro probably shrugs were her mother's ,control
and makes herself a dress ,control
which they totally destroy and tell her she's going nowhere ,control
and  and she cries ,control
and she's all upset ,control
and her fairy godmother comes ,control
and dresses her in this beautiful ges dress ,control
and turns her mice into footmen ,control
and her horses into the ges horses for this beautiful carriage ,control
and sends her off to the ball ,control
but tells her that she hasta be home before midnight ,control
so  she goes to the ball ,control
and of_course the prince falls in love at first sight ,control
and she's all he's interested in ,control
while stepmama and stepdaughters are  just don't know what to do with themselves ,control
and at five to twelve all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes she better get home ,control
so  she goes tearing out ,control
and as she runs away loses one of her sl glass slippers ,control
and goes home and everything ges,control
the coach the everything the beautiful dress ,control
and all she has left is the other glass slipper ,control
so  the prince is beside himself ,control
he decides he hasta find her ,control
so  he sends this  w one of his people out to find her with the slipper ,control
and they  everybody in the ges realm hasta try this slipper on ,control
and of_course it doesn't fit anybody because obvious  she  sh she had very tiny feet ,control
and finally they find her ,control
she tries the slipper on ,control
and the prince  marries her ,control
and they live happily ever after ,control
