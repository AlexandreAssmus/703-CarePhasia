it's a beautiful day in the country ,control
and the mouse family ,control
looks like they have about nine children ,control
 are all going into the forest to look for a place to have a picnic ,control
they all pile into  a red truck ,control
we think it's dad's but it could be Grandpa's ,control
and up they go up a hill ,control
and then they go across another fairy area ,control
and oh it's green and it's beautiful ,control
but all_of_a_sudden the truck hits a boulder in the road ,control
and the little mouse falls off the back of the truck which has no tailgate ,control
and in the little mouse's arms are his  his little pet mouse ,control
well  there he is flat on his back in the trail all alone with his little toy ,control
and all he sees the re truck and the rest of his family disappearing into the distance ,control
and he doesn't know what to make of this ,control
now we follow the family in their red truck ,control
they found a beautiful spot ,control
so  they all get out_of the truck carrying their picnic things and their toys their baseball bats and  all sorts of toys cameras everything they have with him ,control
now we have them in a perfectly beautiful glen by a small lake that actually has a pier ,control
some of them are swimming ,control
one is on the pier getting ready to  thinking about diving not  not too sure ,control
two other of the children are dancing in the grass ,control
another one is picking flowers ,control
another one is carrying the thermos ,control
and bigger ones are carrying the picnic basket ,control
and mom is shaking up the tablecloth ,control
and dad has his banjo ,control
and grandpa's getting ready to take a walk ,control
everybody's getting ready for a wonderful time ,control
beautiful beautiful lake in the beautiful forest ,control
next we see them playing baseball ,control
the older folks relaxed playing the banjo and just sitting and watching the younger ones play ,control
and one little one has  laughs a rubber tire ,control
he doesn't know quite what to do with that ,control
and then we go back and we see the little one all by himself in the middle of the road ,control
little tears running down his cheeks clutching his pet ,control
xxx pet mouse ,control
he gets up ,control
he looks around ,control
he doesn't know what to do ,control
he's all alone and everything around him is very tall ,control
the grasses and the bushes ,control
oh there are berries on the bushes ,control
maybe he could eat some of the berries ,control
now we go back to the rest of the family ,control
they're photographing each other ,control
they're frisking about in the lake ,control
they're sailing a boat ,control
they have a beautiful picnic spread out with watermelon and salad and sandwiches and cheese ,control
well  they are mice you_know ,control
then we go back to the little guy ,control
he reaches up and he finds that he can reach the berries ,control
so  he pulls them down ,control
sets his little  his little friend down on the ground ,control
and he starts eating the berries ,control
suddenly we go back to the picnic and there seems to be something amiss ,control
there are only eight  little mice when there should be nine ,control
and mom is kind_of rubbing her hands together ,control
and dad is shading his eyes looking off into the distance ,control
and Grandma and Grandpa are looking every which way ,control
noone knows what to do ,control
and they're not eating their picnic ,control
they're just all sitting  the little children are all sitting with their hands folded looking very worried ,control
where is their little brother hm,control
well  one of them is  one of the m brothers the bigger ones sits on the edge of the pier and is calling and calling his little brother ,control
the little mouse who was sailing the boat brings the boat in and starts to cry ,control
the other little mouse is crying ,control
a bush with flowers on ,control
ev all the children seem to be  they're all looking but they can't find ,control
they're looking behind rocks ,control
they're looking among the tall grass ,control
they can't find him ,control
but they know he's missing finally ,control
so  they pack up everything ,control
the baseball bat the banjo the picnic basket ,control
and they all load up in the little red truck ,control
now we go back and we see the little missing  little missing boy mouse laying on his back with his hands on his tummy ,control
maybe he ate too many berries ,control
we don't know though ,control
so  the truck comes back and everybody is looking ,control
they're looking out the windows ,control
they're looking over the back of the truck ,control
they're looking every which way ,control
they are looking for their little brother ,control
little brother stands up ,control
he thinks he hears something ,control
he looks and looks but he's in  he's in the tall grass and he can't see anything ,control
gasps suddenly he finds his way back to the road ,control
and he sees his family ,control
and they are all cheering ,control
and there's a hat thrown in the air ,control
and all of his little brothers and sisters are s screaming with happiness ,control
and mom and dad are just big eyed ,control
they can't believe they found their little one ,control
then they all get together in the middle of the road and everybody hugs little brother ,control
he is so happy ,control
and then he looks around ,control
something's missing ,control
he looks he goes back in the grass ,control
he looks and he looks and he finds his little pet little pink mouse ,control
gives him a hug ,control
and the family is united ,control
everybody is back together ,control
so  they have a picnic right there ,control
they don't go back to the lake ,control
they're just too happy ,control
they just stay where they are ,control
and all nine mice children and the little pet have a wonderful wonderful picnic ,control
this is a story about a little baby and an amazing dog named Carl ,control
the first picture shows us with mom ,control
and she's getting ready to go shopping ,control
the little baby is in the crib covered up ,control
and Carl is on the floor guarding ,control
and mother says ,control
 now you look  be sure you look after the baby Carl ,control
so  when mom leaves Carl immediately goes to the window and looks out to see if there's anything out there that could be a problem ,control
and also to make sure she's gone ,control
then Carl goes over to the crib and stands up right next to it so the little boy can climb over the crib and right onto Carl's back ,control
now we're having some fun ,control
the little boy rides C Carl ,control
and they go into mom's and daddy's bedroom ,control
and they both ,control
well  really it's Carl who jumps up on the bed but baby goes with him ,control
and so Carl stands watch while the baby bounces up and down on the bed ,control
then we see the baby on mommy's dressing table ,control
and the baby has a powder puff ,control
and the baby gets powder in Carl's nose ,control
in the next picture we see  laughs the  laughs the baby with a fancy hat ,control
it's  um it's a handkerchief with a powder puff on top ,control
but Carl is wearing beads around his head between his eyes ,control
and he also  actually he has one ear sticking up ,control
and he has the powder box lid on his head ,control
they're very proud of themselves ,control
they both look gorgeous ,control
gasps the next picture shows the little boy ,control
he has found his way to the laundry chute ,control
now he is up on the second floor and the laundry chute is down on the basement so Carl's a little bit nervous ,control
Carl is looking over the door to the laundry chute ,control
he's not sure what's gonna happen ,control
the little boy disappears ,control
Carl races down two flights of stairs ,control
he's into the basement and there's our little boy safe and sound sitting on the soft pile of clothes waiting to be laundered ,control
now we see the little boy on Carl's back up  back up stairs ,control
and we go into the living room ,control
oh_my_goodness ,control
he sits down and there are papers  flying all over the place ,control
he's gotten into the newspaper ,control
not the little boy Carl ,control
now we have Carl getting up with the little boy on his back going to look at the fish in the fish tank ,control
I don't hafta tell you what happens next ,control
next thing we see the little boy is in the fish tank ,control
and Carl with his paws up on the side leans over and grabs the little boy by his shirt the back of his shirt and pulls him out ,control
well  safe again ,control
now we have him all dried off ,control
and Carl goes into the room with the stereo ,control
and he starts playing ,control
turns it on chooses some music and he starts dancing ,control
so  Carl is dancing in the middle of the room with his hind legs ,control
and the little boy is just thrilled ,control
he sees this and he just giggles and laughs ,control
and he can't quite dance yet but he really loves to watch the dog dance ,control
uhoh we've gone to the kitchen ,control
Carl has managed to open the refrigerator door ,control
and the little boy is really interested ,control
next picture we see a loaf of bread on the floor and yes Carl has opened it ,control
we see an empty butter ,control
and the little boy has a stick of butter that he is squeezing with great joy ,control
then Carl comes up with a bunch of grapes which he holds up so the little boy can take them and eat them one at a time ,control
then we have Carl ,control
he gets the Hershey syrup which has two holes already punched in the top so you can pour it ,control
holds the can in his mouth and pours the syrup into a little cup ,control
then Carl goes and gets the milk ,control
opens the milk container ,control
pours it with  in on top of the Hershey syrup ,control
and now we have chocolate milk ,control
now we go to the cookie jar and Carl takes the lid off ,control
the little boy knows exactly what to do ,control
that little right hand goes in that cookie jar so fast ,control
and out it comes ,control
now we have a real pile in the middle of the kitchen floor ,control
we have a Hershey's syrup can we have an open cookie jar we have um milk or with  what looks like cream not milk ,control
open on the floor we have pieces of bread tha we have a stick of butter and we have something that looks like it might be jam in a big puddle in the middle of the floor ,control
of_course  the little baby has chocolate all over him ,control
and he has strawberry jam on his knees ,control
and he's just a picture ,control
so  the next picture he's back up ,control
dirty little boy ,control
back up on Carl's back ,control
they're going upstairs ,control
they go into the bathroom ,control
Carl turns on the water in the tub ,control
takes the baby by the back of his shirt ,control
puts him in the tub ,control
gets a soap and a washcloth ,control
lathers it up ,control
washes baby ,control
laughs he gets some soap in his mouth Carl does ,control
and he starts blowing bubbles ,control
oh the little baby thinks that's just  that's just really funny ,control
so  then Carl gets the blow dryer out ,control
he dries the baby who thinks this is fun ,control
he just looks at that he just loves it ,control
and then the next picture we have the baby being boosted over the side of the crib by Carl ,control
now baby's back in his crib ,control
Carl starts to clean up ,control
okay  he picks up the sandwich bread and the pieces of bread in the sandwich wrapper ,control
he licks up the milk that's spilled on the floor ,control
and he goes to the window to see if anybody's coming back yet ,control
no he's still got time ,control
he goes into mom and dad's bedroom ,control
he straightens up the bed ,control
he puts the powder puff back in the powder box ,control
and he's looking out the front door ,control
here comes mom ,control
oh  mom comes in and there's her boy back in his crib all covered up ,control
and there's Carl guarding the little boy on the floor where he was when Momma left ,control
and so  mommy says ,control
 good dog  Carl ,control
and Carl cuddles up and puts his big head in Momma's lap ,control
and she pets him and gives him love ,control
and that's the story of Carl and the little boy and mommy ,control
first we go to Lowes ,control
and we decide what kind of flower we're gonna buy ,control
so  we decide to get pansies ,control
and we want a six pack because they're already started and easy to plant ,control
each one has its own little square of soil ,control
so  we go home and we say ,control
 where are we gonna put them ,control
so  we're gonna put them around the birdbath ,control
so  we dig little holes around the birdbath evenly ges,control
and when we have ges,control
and ges,control
ges,control
then after we ges,control
or the  beneath the pansy he her roots and her root ball I'll call it ,control
ges,control
ges,control
now pat ges,control
pat it down so_that the pansy stands up ,control
I'm talking like that book  laughs ges,control
stands up big and tall laughs ,control
and ges,control
and after that's done we water gently ,control
and then they're planted ,control
and happy ,control
well  first you need bread ,control
and you need peanut butter ,control
and you need jelly ,control
and you need a knife ,control
so  I would take two slices of bread ,control
and I'd put them on the bread board ,control
and on one side I would spread peanut butter ges,control
and on the side I would spread jelly ges,control
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place ,control
so  then ges,control
ges,control
ges,control
ges,control
and I serve her ,control
I'm going back to my kids ,control
my daughter's fifty three ,control
and her sister  her younger sister's already retired ,control
well  I am seventy four almost seventy five ,control
what we gonna do now ,control
yeah  I can  I can tell you what I did ,control
I went into the hospital the day after Christmas to have major surgery  laughs ,control
but getting ready for that is  is uh much more of a story ,control
because uh uh my daughter and her husband came from Florida um two days before Christmas ,control
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife ,control
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan ,control
and there were seven of us for Christmas ,control
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldn't let me drink wine because  but I snuck some in ,control
then five o'clock the day after Christmas um we went to the hospital ,control
and the rest wasn't that much fun ,control
um the rest of it ,control
the  the reason my daughter was there was to take me  look  aft look after me because she's a registered nurse ,control
and so she was there for about a total of seven days ,control
and then the cousins stayed on ,control
but that's what I did over the Christmas holiday laughs ,control
and I don't plan to do that ever again ,control
no ,control
it was a new experience however ,control
last weekend ,control
oh  last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida ,control
and they're arriving tomorrow evening ,control
so  I moved the car out_of the garage ,control
and I got my ges,control
and I ges,control
and I took my chamois and some pail of water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing ,control
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday ,control
Sunday I vacuumed the living room ,control
moved all the furniture ,control
put ges,control
I've found if you ges,control
so  I did that to ges,control
then having  sss laughs having vacuumed forwards ges,control
because you_know if I don't have everything looking just right they'll think ,control
 mm things are getting ahead of her ,control
 time to put her in the home ,control
you_know  ges,control
so  then I discovered the spots in the rug ,control
so  now I go out and I do the spot rug thing ,control
upstairs made sure everything was ready in the  in the uh guest room ,control
generally I didn't have a whole lot of fun ,control
laughs you_know ,control
oh and I  I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing uh the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason they're coming ,control
so  all in all I worked the entire weekend ,control
and I'm tired laughs ,control
oh_my_gosh what  when did I have my last vacation ,control
it was probably in ,control
well  you_know when you're retired it's hard to tell when you're on a vacation  laughs ,control
but I did go to Florida ,control
I think it was in June ,control
it was a sad time because ,control
yeah ,control
and you_know it's a sad time but I did have fun ,control
the reason it's sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years ,control
they were litter mates ,control
and one became very ill and hadta be put down ,control
and um I think it was  well February or March ,control
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down ,control
so  those were  those were not fun ,control
those were not fun ,control
but had  I did have fun in  in Florida ,control
because we always do ,control
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx ,control
and we go out to dinner ,control
and we have wonderful gourmet meals ,control
we just kind_of play family ,control
because we don't see each other that often ,control
but we do things ,control
we  we go to the Everglades ,control
we take an airboat ride ,control
and uh  and that kind of stuff ,control
and they have  they once had two dogs and three cats ,control
they're down to two dogs and one cat now ,control
so  that  laughs that keeps me happy ,control
but pretty much that's it ,control
okay ,control
we'll  we'll set the scene first ,control
we're in a lovely little rural location here ,control
um the banks of a very tranquil lake ,control
and we have a sailboat in the lake ,control
and we have  actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite ,control
a boy  little boy playing with a kite ,control
so  it's  it's windy ,control
it's windy enough to keep the flag fluffering ,control
now we have a cozy little house on the shore ,control
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade ,control
and the car is parked in front of the garage ,control
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach ,control
now the beach is very very narrow ,control
but it's wide enough that the little girl out there can play and sh she's making a sandcastle ,control
and it also has a pier ,control
that's where the sailboat comes when it's tired ,control
and looks like dad's on the edge of the pier ,control
or maybe it's Grandpa ,control
we can't tell from here ,control
but he's fishing and he's caught a fish ,control
now the boy who's flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog ,control
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass ,control
shoes beside them radio playing dad reading a book ,control
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine ,control
and then they have a picnic basket between them ,control
so  all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home ,control
now here we have a rural scene ,control
we have just a two lane highway ,control
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees ,control
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front ,control
and the man has a map in his hand ,control
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree ,control
well  it's clear ,control
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is ,control
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story ,control
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the car's headed ,control
off they go ,control
we see them receding into the distance ,control
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole ,control
and suddenly there's the car back in front of the farmer ,control
it looks like they just went around in a circle ,control
who knew ,control
we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boy's birthday party ,control
and the little boy looks to be about six ,control
and uh what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table ,control
we have the front door open ,control
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in ,control
obviously they're guests ,control
and they're carrying presents ,control
each one accompanied by the mother ,control
and they all stop and they look at the cake ,control
well  there's a big chunk taken out_of the cake ,control
and one of the candles ,control
looks like the little boy's fifth birthday according to the candle count ,control
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints ,control
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug ,control
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa ,control
and there's a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa ,control
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom ,control
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this ,control
the little boy is crying ,control
doesn't look like we had much fun at this birthday party because it leaves it right there ,control
but there she is ,control
everybody's unhappy ,control
but I'm gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down ,control
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out that was  that the dog chewed on ,control
and the little boy stopped crying ,control
and everybody came in and they had a wonderful party ,control
don't you wish real life was like that ,control
I counted the candles ,control
I cheated ,control
laughs well I have dogs and kids ,control
we have a little household setting here ,control
we're in the living room ,control
and husband and wife ,control
husband's sitting in the chair trying to read his newspaper clearly angry mouth wide open ,control
and what we assume is his wife is standing in front of him pointing at him in a very menacing way ,control
in the next picture we see husband with paper up  ges,control
and the wife heading for the door with her coat on and a suitcase ,control
she has had it ,control
looks as though as soon as she goes out the door the door closes husband was sad ,control
possibly remorseful ,control
thinking of the things he should have said ,control
thinking of the things he should not have said ,control
and all that kind of stuff ,control
what's he going to do ,control
he doesn't know ,control
it shouldn't have gone this far ,control
door opens ,control
he looks over his shoulder ,control
it's his wife ,control
she's back ,control
he can't believe it ,control
she forgave him for whatever it was he did which he doesn't really know it was ,control
so  they embrace ,control
and they're both very happy ,control
and in the middle of the embrace the husband looks out the open door ,control
and he sees the family car throat,control
okay ,control
set the scene here ,control
here we have what  what appears to be an emergency ,control
and how do we know this ,control
because we have a fire truck on the street and  f that goes by this large tree ,control
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder ,control
hm ,control
so  we look at the tree ,control
and we have a dog barking up the tree ,control
barko barko barko what's he  what is he barking at ,control
well  there's a little bird up there but I don't  th he's not barking at the bird ,control
gasps we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree ,control
well  what ,control
wait a second ,control
what is he doing up there ,control
so  we look a_little further and we see a kitty_cat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man ,control
and beneath the kitty_cat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying ,control
 go kitty jump ,control
 come kitty come down ,control
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder ,control
now this  this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree ,control
can't get down ,control
dad went up after the kitty_cat ,control
got stuck up there ,control
the dog is yelping ,control
he's barking ,control
and someone called the firemen ,control
and then they're coming to rescue first the father and then the kitty_cat ,control
and it's a happy ending because the little girl gets her kitty cat back ,control
I better pay attention ,control
that is an easy one because it's fairly recent ,control
the the  s the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes ,control
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition ,control
and I remember hearing a woman's voice saying ,control
 oo she's a bleeder ,control
and then I went head,control
and that's the only thing I remember from the recovery room ,control
I reme ,control
is this what you want ,control
memories ,control
okay  and then I remember being ges,control
and uh I remember having a  ges,control
I can't remember what it was exactly because I never knew ,control
but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it ,control
and they said ,control
 you could push this button whenever you have a_lot_of pain ,control
 uh you can't push it  any less than six minutes apart ,control
 if you try it won't do anything ,control
 so  you're alright ,control
 don't worry about it ,control
so  whenever I fel felt that I couldn't stand it I would push that button ,control
then I remember seeing my daughter's face ,control
I remember seeing her and her husband ,control
and I head,control
I remember bits and pieces of uh nurses coming and catheters being inserted and ,control
but again hands,control
I never saw ges,control
just bits of it ,control
and I remember getting out_of bed the first day and being hands,control
and I remember the second day ges,control
w I'd had a hip replacement ,control
around the  the ges,control
and uh ges,control
and uh  each day I remember seeing my daughter and her husband at some time ,control
but not communicating with them or anything ,control
and when I left my daughter asked me several s questions ,control
sh being a nurse ,control
and I said ,control
 do you know I remember one day you came twice ,control
she said ,control
 we came twice every day ,control
see ,control
so  that's  that shows how much I was out ,control
I remember another thing ,control
sitting  sitting up straight in the hospital watching ges,control
and uh fingers,control
and the nurse came in later and she  s ,control
I could hear her ges,control
she was saying ,control
 boy she fell asleep sitting up ,control
and I thought ,control
 I'm not asleep ,control
 I'm just imit,control
laughs you_know ,control
and that  that's pretty much it ,control
and I  I remember the  the uh therapy afterwards and  and you_know pain and the  and the medication of the Vicodin ,control
and I remember saying things that didn't make sense ,control
and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to hand,control
and um I remember asking him ,control
I had just taken Vicodin ,control
and I remember asking him ,control
 now who are you ,control
and I knew very well who he was ,control
and he would answer very slowly ,control
and I thought ,control
 oh  he's  ha he's he's   he's trying to you_know ges,control
and I'd say ,control
 why am I asking these stupid questions laughs ,control
and I was  wri and I said ,control
 ges,control
I could hear myself saying ,control
 now let me write this down ,control
and so in due course about three hours later these men showed up ,control
and I was back fingers,control
and I said ,control
 hi ,control
and they  they had come in ,control
and we  s we talked a bit ,control
and I had a my ges,control
I was walking around ,control
and finally I said to him ,control
 did your dispatcher say anything to you about the telephone conversation he had with me before he sent you out this morning ,control
you_know  he said  he said ,control
 yeah ,control
laughs I said ,control
 what'd he say ,control
he said ,control
 well  I don't know what you're gonna find when you get to eighteen sixty East Crystal Way ,control
laughs so  I told him I said ,control
 when you get back please tell him I was on drugs ,control
 tell him I was thoroughly drugged ,control
 I had just taken a pain pill ,control
 and it was three hours ago ,control
 and this is the difference between me right after it kicks in ,control
so  that's what I remember from  from that ,control
is that any help ,control
okay ,control
the first uh problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese ,control
so  um it was frustrating ,control
uh I hadta put children in school ,control
I hadta take them shopping to get their uniforms ,control
I hadta take a taxi and tell him where I wanted to go and how to get home and ,control
so  how did I deal with it ,control
I studied Japanese ,control
uh every morning five days a week until I got so I could do it ,control
happened again when I went to Korea ,control
it happened again when I went to Guatemala ,control
so  and and  and Brazil ,control
where they did not speak English ,control
uh spoke English in Jamaica and they spoke in English in Malaysia at that time ,control
but uh the only time that I've really had what ges,control
and I hafta communicate immediately and then study at the same time ,control
and I find I do it by reading body language reading facial expressions ,control
um and a_lot of this moving hands and  to describe what I want ,control
and then as  as the language picks up on ges,control
that's pretty much my experience with that ,control
okay ,control
I was on a boat  a ship I should say ,control
and the USS President line it was President Wilson ,control
and we were sailing from I think it was  Los Angeles to Tokyo ,control
and I had my  my husband and my two youngsters were there ,control
uh they were probably third and fourth grade ,control
and we came in  we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up ,control
so  uh the captain you_know notified us ,control
 there's a  m m ges,control
well  what happened was ges,control
and the ges,control
and our little ship was in the vortex ,control
I was frightened ,control
I was  uh my children one of them was thrown out_of uh her bunk and you_know ges,control
and  and I  we strapped them in something ,control
I can't remember exactly because I was miserable ,control
I was s seasick ,control
and I was on the uh promenade deck ,control
and they had ges,control
so  because the promenade you're sposta be able to see but they had these ges,control
and I was strapped in a deck chair that was ges,control
and I was sitting in this chair sick as I could be watching the waves come up over me  gpxraises arms above head ,control
and then I would hear crashing ges,control
and one wave would go up real high ,control
the ship would creak ,control
it would go imit,control
I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life ,control
they had um ropes uh for people you_know if you hadta go to the bathroom or something you couldn't walk so you would do this to try and find your way ,control
they had bed spreads ges,control
so  that was it ,control
and you_know we survived ,control
the boat didn't go down but it  uh I don't think it ever sailed again because it was already thirty years old and it was ready to be ,control
which wasn't very helpful laughs being  being on it ,control
but we survived ,control
but I've never been as frightened before or after ,control
also I had two little kids there with me ,control
so  that was scary ,control
bet that's a new one for you laughs ,control
this one is puzzling to me ,control
it's clearly a rescue operation ,control
and it clearly is in water because the man who appears to be rescuing the young lady is wearing a buoyancy vest ,control
what I can't make out is whether  she ,control
ahhah ,control
it looks like she  she got caught in a flood possibly ,control
and she has grabbed a branch that has stuck out into the raging waters ,control
that's what it is I bet you ,control
and she's clinging to this branch for dear life ,control
and he is trying to get her and bring her to shore ,control
did I make it up good laughs ,control
boy that was tough though ,control
I couldn't figure out what was going on there for a minute ,control
okay  we have a series of four drawings here ,control
the first one shows a youngster about eight or nine having a wonderful time kicking what looks to be a volleyball ,control
his aim is good ,control
goes right through the neighbor's window ,control
we don't know whether it's his window or whether it's a neighbor's window ,control
but as luck would have it it breaks the window goes through knocks a lamp over probably breaks the lamp ,control
yes it does ,control
and uh there's a gentleman sitting in the chair right next to the lamp ,control
now we don't know whether this is this boy's father or whether it's a neighbor ,control
but the gentleman stands up ,control
and he picks up the volleyball ,control
and stands looking out through the hole in his window ,control
and we are looking  we are left trying to decide whether he is going to throw the ball back at the little boy or whether he's going t ,control
he's not sure exactly what he's gonna do yet ,control
but he's gonna do something ,control
but we don't really know ,control
the title of this little scenario is Mother Knows Best ,control
in the first picture we have little boy setting  setting off for school ,control
he's ready to go and mom pulls out an umbrella ,control
 nah I don't want an umbrella ,control
 I don't need an umbrella ,control
okay ,control
she says ,control
 alright ,control
so  she keeps the umbrella and he heads off ,control
 it's not raining ,control
he says goodbye xxx ,control
okay ,control
he starts off to school ,control
and little drip drip drip starts ,control
just a little bit of rain ,control
and then it's more than a drip drip ,control
we have a little downpour ,control
so  hm,control
so  puts his hands over his head turns around races back home ,control
there he is with his mom ,control
she's looking down with that I told you so look that mothers have ,control
and he's standing there soaking wet ,control
next picture he's smiling going back to school and he has his umbrella ,control
once upon a time a long time ago there was a clears_throat beautiful little girl whose mother died ,control
so  her father married giving her a stepmother ,control
and the new stepmother had two daughters ,control
well  the two daughters were not anywhere near as fair as Cinderella ,control
and the stepmom did not treat Cinderella very well ,control
she did not treat her like she did her own daughters ,control
she made her do all the laundry ,control
she made them do all the housework ,control
she made  she made her wait on her stepsisters with her xxx ,control
and it looks to me like she slept out in the barn with the horses ,control
but she liked horses and she liked the dogs and she liked all the animals ,control
so  they liked her so she didn't care ,control
well  one day she was looking out the window at the castle ,control
she could see ges,control
and word came that the king was very angry with his son prince because he was not in any hurry to get married  to take a queen ,control
so  the king says ,control
 alright enough of your fooling around ,control
he sent out an ,control
well  it wasn't an edict it was more of a letter ,control
 to everyone in the kingdom saying that there would be a ball ,control
and his son would meet all of the eligible young ladies in the kingdom ,control
and there would be a way that one would be chosen from this ball ,control
gasps Cinderella thought ,control
 wouldn't that be wonderful ,control
 wouldn't that be wonderful ,control
so  she ges,control
and she made a beautiful  well very beautiful dress ,control
wasn't fancy really but she was such a  such a pretty girl it looked beautiful on her ,control
so  she thought she could go to the ball because she was certainly one of the members of the of the kingdom ,control
two stepsisters came in ,control
 no way are you going bitch ,control
so  they ripped off her gold necklace ges,control
 go back into the scullery ,control
so  she went back into the scullery ,control
and there sitting on a big trunk was someone who looked very much like a fairy godmother ,control
she had a ges,control
she took the story and she says ,control
 yes you shall go to the ball ,control
 you shall be beautiful ,control
 you shall have footmen ,control
 see these little points mice ,control
 they're gonna be your footmen ,control
 see that points pumpkin ,control
 it's gonna be your carriage ,control
 you  b see this dress ,control
boomo ges,control
beautiful slippers ,control
she was just beautiful ,control
she couldn't believe this was happening ,control
she didn't really know it was but she was all ready to go ,control
and she got into the carriage ,control
and she had gorgeous horses ,control
and the mice were now footmen ,control
and they ges,control
when they helped her down ges,control
the prince took one look at her and he thought ,control
 who are points these dogs ,control
he didn't say that ,control
he  he thought it ,control
so  he's dancing with her ges,control
and they're dancing around the ballroom ,control
and then comes time for her pumpkin to  her pumpkin and her mice to reappear ,control
it's midnight ,control
and she was told finger,control
 you've got til midnight ,control
she sees the clock ,control
she races out_of the ballroom ,control
and the prince says ,control
 where are you going ,control
he starts following her ,control
and she races down the stairs and jumps in the  into her coach and they race home ,control
and then there she is in her regular clothes sitting on a pumpkin ges,control
but as she was running down the stairs she lost one of her glass slippers ,control
gasps the prince saw it ,control
and he said ,control
 this is the slipper from the most beautiful woman in the kingdom and I am going to find her ,control
and so that began  the search ,control
they went to every house in the kingdom ,control
every young woman in the kingdom ,control
and noone could fit their big fat foot into that pretty little glass slipper ,control
went to Cinderella's home where Cinderella was nowhere to be seen ,control
two ugly stepsisters they tried to push it and they shove it ,control
they could head,control
and so the question was ,control
 isn't there another young lady ,control
 no  no  no  no  no ,control
well  finally head,control
no ges,control
he was gonna put it on ,control
so  ges,control
and it fit like a slipper ,control
he was so happy he'd found the girl of his dreams ,control
and if you can see what happened ,control
the next few pictures show us them ges,control
no more pumpkins ,control
and as they say they lived happily ever after ,control
