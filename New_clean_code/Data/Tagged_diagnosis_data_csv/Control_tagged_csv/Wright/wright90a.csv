 but you don't have anything to wear ,control
so  the little animals made her a dress ,control
they made it look beautiful ,control
they sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball ,control
lips_smack sighs so uh when it was time to leave she came down ,control
and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be ,control
and they said ,control

and he falls in love with her ,control
the stroke of midnight which is when the fairlry ,control
uh she hears it striking ,control
and starts running down the steps ,control
she loses one of her shoes but can't go back because she doesn't want the prince to know that she's just poor little  poor little girl ,control
and she doesn't want him to see her in rags ,control
she gets home ,control
and her little mice ges  friends aren't horses anymore ,control
but she does get to keep the shoe ,control
well  the prince is devastated ,control
he's got to find her ,control
so  he gives his uh I don't know what you call them points right hand man the shoe ges,control
and has hi him try it on every fair maiden in the land ,control
