lips_smack  well  at our house we take the bread out_of the freezer laughs inhales ,control
and toast the bread ,control
and then um put about  a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter ,control
the chunky kind ,control
on  the peanut butter  sandwich lips_smack ,control
on one side ,control
then on the other side ges,control
 and smooth it clear across hand,control
inhales and then we smack hand,control
the two pieces of bread ,control
cut it in half ,control
and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts ,control
but if we're gonna eat it we eat it with the crust ,control
 that's about how to make a peanut butter sandwich ,control
 the dog and the cat were fighting ,control
 and the cat climbed up the tree ,control
 and the do,control
inhales and the little girl happened upon the scene ,control
and realized  that the cat was in the tree and she's f gonna need her dad ,control
so  she got her dad ,control
 and her dad got the ladder ,control
and they were trying to get  the cat out_of the tree ,control
 but the ladder fell down ,control
 but just in the nick of time  the firemen who were called by the neighbors  came ,control
 and helped th get the cat and the dad out_of the tree ,control
lips_smack  ,control
inhales well  yes I remember being hospitalized ,control
the most recent  one was  in New_York_City ,control
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt_Hospital ,control
inhales and um my right lung had filled up with  fluid ,control
and um so they kept me ,control
inhales sighs  I realized how important it is to have someone with you  when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked ,control
the towels were like sandpaper ,control
you were lucky to have a towel  if you were to take a bath or a shower ,control
 uh they didn't come ,control
so  I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel ,control
inhales um I have veins that are very difficult to get blood ,control
so  I'd always say kiddingly to the people ,control
 are ya really good at this ,control
 and one man named Joe_L told me ,control
laughs head,control
he'd  he'd shay ,control
 I've head,control
inhales after about twenty pokes in my hand I said ,control
 could you find someone else  to draw blood because we're not getting it done here ,control
and um lips_smack  it was really all I ha could do to get better so I could get out_of the place ,control
because  it's too bad  that the staff is so overworked ,control
and probably underpaid ,control
and that facilities  um are having trouble today  uh getting the help that they need ,control
I could also tell laughs you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night ,control
of_course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things ,control
 and she couldn't find the bathroom ,control
so  laughs she just used whatever facilities she could find ,control
inhales and when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved  they just said ,control
 well  you'll probably hafta go on with a cancer patient that's dying ,control
so   I was so unaccustomed  to hospitals ,control
and I'm probably unaccustomed to  the treatment  there because  I'm going back to Iowa thinking ,control
and um I was sort_of on my own to try to figure out  how to get help and how to get out_of there ,control
 so  that was my experience ,control
that's probably the worst experience I've ever had in a hospital ,control
inhales because everything else is always been won  done very well ,control
 it was crazy ,control
if you know Roosevelt Hospital ,control
 and it just felt  I did  I did learn though ,control
when I was at Roosevelt_Hospital I was watching Jeopardy on television ,control
and they ask ,control
 um who was the first Supreme_Court justice ,control
 and I looked out the window ,control
 and I saw the school at Fordham_University ,control
and the first Supreme_Court justice was named for  the one that is named in that school as the law school ,control
 lips_smack exhales ,control
 lips_smack I'm not sure if I was frightened or scared  in this situation ,control
but  I was frightened for my daughter ,control
in September of  ninet uh September two thousand six ,control
on the nineteenth day ,control
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom ,control
that her husband had threatened to kill her ,control
 and within  twenty hours  I was in Rome_Italy ,control
 and  my husband and I decided that one of us should go  to help her ,control
and to help her  with her husband ,control
 and  I arrived hoping that I could do something  to get them counseling  whatever ,control
within  twenty four hours  he had called  the police  of Rome ,control
I was alone with him in the house ,control
and I had  exhales no help ,control
but I didn't know how to get ahold of my daughter ,control
sniffs and the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail ,control
sniffs and  I immediately thought ,control
 lips_smack wonder if I can take my pillow ,control
 or should I take my Sudoku game ,control
 because if I hafta sit in that police  with the police in jail  what am I going to do ,control
so   I sort_of  you_know ,control
inhales and then I started trying to call my daughter's friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan ,control
 and I kept dialing finger,control
sniffs because I think when you're nervous  you dial the wrong thing ,control
I finally got ahold of my daughter ,control
 and  she  came ,control
and we called the carabinieris,control
and the carabinieris,control
 and I'm not sure if I was afraid ,control
inhales I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail ,control
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth  to make it happen head,control
and I  since then  we were trailed ,control
our phone was tapped ,control
the computer was  sniffs oh the computer was compromised ,control
we  we wrote to each other  sitting on the sofa ,control
hand,control
inhales and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time ,control
and  I'm not sure if I was really afraid ,control
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening ,control
but that was probably  the most  resourceful that I ever hadta be  to protect my daughter and grandson ,control
lips_smack so   I'm not sure I share that with everyone ,control
but if you wanna know when I was really  drawn to action head,control
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating ,control
lips_smack head,control
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it ,control
 inhales I think it's not so much communicating it as it is understanding ,control
inhales because when I was in Italy  trying to communicate with people  I used my hands ,control
I used any kind of framework I could think of ,control
 uh another language ,control
 lips_smack uh to communicate with anybody ,control
so  um I learned street Italian ,control
 lips_smack I um became pretty cl clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me ,control
 and I learned the words that I needed to use ,control
but I think  communication is so vital ,control
 and when you don't know the language of someone else  it's  hard to communicate ,control
 do you want us to be creative with it ,control
do whatever ,control
inhales well this could easily have happened in Iowa ,control
 the Des_Moines_River  was rising  in  um  nineteen ninety three ,control
and also in  two thousand eight ,control
and people were warned not to be near the river ,control
but people do that ,control
and the water has an undertow ges,control
and it can  catch ges,control
that could have happened in this picture ,control
and police and fire and safety people  go to great lengths  to help those people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time ,control
laughs a,control
and maybe he was playing soccer with his friends ,control
 and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it ,control
it went through the window ,control
 and the man  was not so happy about it ,control
because he was sitting there ,control
and it knocked over his lamp ,control
and then  I'm not sure what he's doing in the last picture ,control
 but he's looking at the window ,control
the man is looking at the window ,control
and it looks like he's holding something ,control
but maybe he's making a telephone call ,control
I don't know ,control
laughs inhales well typically  little boys and umbrellas don't really wanna head,control
because the little boy would be much rather   be much happier if he doesn't head,control
but his mother says ,control
 you gotta take an umbrella ,control
and  at the last minute  he said ,control
 head,control
and he runs outside ,control
and he's in the rain ,control
and he's not so happy ,control
and he goes back home ,control
and he says to mom ,control
 I guess head,control
and then he takes the umbrella and leaves ,control
once upon a time ,control
inhales there was a woman with two ugly  girls ,control
and a father with a beautiful  daughter ,control
 and they got married the  the man and the woman ,control
so  the families were united ges,control
 and the wicked stepmother  with her two daughters  made the little girl ,control
who was the father's daughter ,control
do the cooking and cleaning ,control
and by the way her name was Cinderella ,control
 lips_smack and she worked and she scrubbed ,control
and she had so many things to do all day long ,control
while the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do ,control
but one night  there was  a special party that the prince was giving ,control
because you see these girls have grown up ,control
and they were teenagers and they were older ,control
and the prince was looking for a princess ,control
lips_smack well  the two ugly stepsisters  they were getting dresses ,control
and they were gonna get to go  to the party ,control
lips_smack but the poor little stepdasister ,control
so  off ges,control
and two mice came and said to  Cinderella ,control
 we're gonna make it so you can go too ,control
lips_smack and Cinderella  they did their magic ,control
and Cinderella got a beautiful dress ,control
and she got a carriage ,control
and she took off ges,control
and she danced with the prince all night long ,control
but as the  the mice had told her ,control
 at the stroke of midnight  you hafta be home ,control
so   at the stroke of midnight she realized gasps she hadta leave ,control
so  she ran ges,control
 and she ran away ,control
 and she left her shoe ,control
 and  the prince found her shoe ,control
 and then  she got back home ,control
 and they went  tha and the wicked sis stepsisters came back ,control
 lips_smack then the prince was looking  for the owner of the shoe ,control
so  he went out all across ges,control
and trying on the shoe ,control
inhales and they came to Cinderella's house ,control
 and at Cinderella's house  the wicked stepsisters were f ges,control
inhales and they tried and tried to wear the shoe ,control
but Cinderella wasn't given the chance until at the last they saw Cinderella ,control
and the shoe fit perfectly ,control
and Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after ,control
