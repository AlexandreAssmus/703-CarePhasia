oh okay ,control,0.0,1
um I guess the  one of the earliest memories that I have is,control,50.0,7
it was a wonderful experience because uh I was living in a small,control,61.53846153846154,4
and there wasn't the opportunity to partake in any sort of,control,33.33333333333333,4
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports ,control,54.54545454545454,3
um they had rowing ,control,50.0,1
and they also had arts and handicrafts  music theater which I,control,25.0,3
um and so  that gave us the opportunity to have a really full,control,35.714285714285715,0
and also what I really laughs enjoyed was the fact that they,control,50.0,2
uh we could eat we if we wanted ,control,62.5,2
if we didn't feel like eating we didn't hafta eat ,control,50.0,4
there was never anybody saying that you_know you weren't allowed,control,45.45454545454545,4
so  that was  I was in uh my glory because I would have,control,66.66666666666666,3
and that was enough for me ,control,66.66666666666666,3
um also um we uh resided in these cabins uh in the woods ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and every morning the uh counselors would take us swimming before,control,45.45454545454545,2
and it was always really  really chilly in the morning ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and so  this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks,control,35.714285714285715,0
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water ,control,22.22222222222222,3
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
I can't remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to,control,64.70588235294117,7
but it was always freezing cold ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake laughs ,control,45.45454545454545,4
used to attach themselves to your leg ,control,42.85714285714285,4
of_course suck on your blood ,control,40.0,3
and that the only way that you could get them off is  was if,control,66.66666666666666,4
and then you could pull them off your  your leg ,control,54.54545454545454,4
um and then we'd all go back  get dressed and then go and have,control,12.5,2
and um in the evenings of_course you_know we useta sit around the,control,41.66666666666667,4
everybody used to sing songs and tell stories  ghost stories and,control,8.333333333333332,4
and then um you_know that would be the end of the day ,control,50.0,4
and it was just  it was glorious ,control,50.0,2
I just  I loved camp ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um and arts and crafts was really good ,control,12.5,2
we  they always had lots_of materials and uh somebody who had,control,33.33333333333333,0
and there's painting and things that we useta create with um wood,control,30.76923076923077,4
and then I_mean I think I was only there for a week ,control,41.66666666666667,4
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity ,control,63.63636363636363,3
because the days were just so  so  so full ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and then at the end of the week you_know they'd bring in the school,control,53.333333333333336,5
uh I was living in Montreal at the time ,control,55.55555555555556,3
 go back to Montreal ,control,20.0,3
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it,control,57.14285714285714,4
and I made such good  good friends and people that I really,control,23.07692307692308,2
and um once home I kept in contact with a_lot_of the people that,control,38.46153846153847,5
a_lot_of the  the girls that I met at the camp ,control,54.54545454545454,5
so  that was kind_of nice ,control,50.0,0
and then I went to you_know every year I'd go back to that same,control,46.66666666666666,5
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back ,control,50.0,5
and so you would meet the same people over  and  over and,control,35.714285714285715,4
so  it was  it was nice xxx ,control,55.55555555555556,3
every year it's you_know looking forward to seeing FirstnameE or,control,36.36363636363637,3
and um yeah those were  those were some really really really,control,41.66666666666667,3

mhm ,control,0.0,0
laughs well  uh today  laughs today I'm here ,control,18.181818181818183,2
uh no  usually I've  uh I retired as_of last year ,control,30.76923076923077,0
um so  at the moment I'm involved in uh renovating our house ,control,50.0,4
we haven't done anything to the house in the last twenty five years,control,50.0,4
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by,control,53.84615384615385,3
and being elderly she wasn't able to do any of the housework or,control,42.85714285714285,6
so  uh it was pretty run down when I bought it ,control,58.333333333333336,2
and she musta been a real cat lover because uh there were stray,control,30.76923076923077,2
inside the house the  the carpets just reeked of cat urine ,control,41.66666666666667,5
the walls were crumbling ,control,50.0,2
the plaster was cracked ,control,50.0,2
there was water damage everywhere ,control,20.0,2
I guess she'd left the windows open ,control,50.0,3
and the rain had come in ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck ,control,37.5,2
so  anyways  we did a little bit of renovations ,control,36.36363636363637,3
but we haven't done much since then ,control,37.5,2
and that was twenty five years ago ,control,28.57142857142857,4
so  anyways  we hired somebody to you_know put together some,control,41.66666666666667,3
and  um and hired a contractor ,control,14.285714285714285,0
and at the moment what's happening is that the contractor and the,control,61.53846153846154,3
um so  they're arguing about everything ,control,62.5,2
the  the  the  the guy who designed the space you_know,control,46.15384615384615,0
 that's the way it hasta be ,control,50.0,4
the contractor says  is arguing that it can't work that way,control,46.15384615384615,4
 if you're gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support,control,46.66666666666666,4
and all this kind_of stuff ,control,40.0,1
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera ,control,14.285714285714285,1
so  I've been dealing a_lot with that on a daily basis at_least,control,57.14285714285714,3
um so many issues ,control,0.0,2
so many details ,control,0.0,2
um you_know and I can't really afford a designer ,control,30.0,2
but I know I should because I'm not very good at it laughs ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh but anyways  so  just trying to figure out you_know,control,16.666666666666664,2
