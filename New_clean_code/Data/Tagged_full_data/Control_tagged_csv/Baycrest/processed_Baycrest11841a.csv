I think I was maybe about eight or  between eight and ten ,control,30.76923076923077,4
something like that ,control,100.0,2
and we went down to this local creek ,control,50.0,3
we lived in a small village ,control,50.0,3
and it was about a mile down to the creek ,control,60.0,4
and it was springtime ,control,50.0,1
and we were cautioned not to go down because it was  you_know,control,46.15384615384615,3
not a river ,control,33.33333333333333,1
it was a creek ,control,75.0,2
well  anyhow we  boys will be boys ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and we defied laughs all odds ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and we went down ,control,25.0,1
and we always had like hammers and nails that we bore from our,control,38.46153846153847,3
so  uh we went down ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and we uh found some logs and some odd boards ,control,30.0,3
and we put together a raft ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and we went rafting ,control,25.0,1
and the water was a very free flowing ,control,37.5,3
and it was fantastic ,control,50.0,1
but of_course we hit one point ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and there was a ice floe ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the raft went sideways ,control,20.0,2
and we all went into the water ,control,57.14285714285714,3
so  uh you_know and at that time we wore rubber boots ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but they were no help because the water was more like uh waist,control,53.84615384615385,3
and uh we got soaked from the waist down ,control,44.44444444444444,3
water went in the boots ,control,40.0,3
and  and then we finally made it to shore thank_goodness ,control,18.181818181818183,0
otherwise it coulda been more serious ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but laughs we still had our socks on ,control,37.5,3
and we were wet ,control,50.0,1
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in,control,50.0,3
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and it was like slosh_slosh_slish_slosho you_know ,control,50.0,2
and it was getting colder because when you're wet like that ,control,66.66666666666666,4

but because the temperature was dropping our sort_of uh jeans or,control,36.36363636363637,3
they were starting to freeze ,control,40.0,2
so  it was like walking  laughs walking along like a robot ,control,53.84615384615385,7
but uh we made it home ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh everything was fine ,control,40.0,1
but it was sad in_that we got reprimanded ,control,62.5,2
but we were happy when we were doing the  uh you_know the,control,53.84615384615385,3
so  we had a good time ,control,42.85714285714285,2

they were not too fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she,control,46.15384615384615,3
and she was made to do all the work ,control,44.44444444444444,3
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person ,control,25.0,3

and she would talk to the birds ,control,57.14285714285714,3

she was overworked ,control,66.66666666666666,1
she'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the,control,57.14285714285714,6

but as it turned out she was not ,control,62.5,2
so  the stepmother denied her that ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the,control,50.0,4
they were invited to a ball ,control,66.66666666666666,3
the prince was having a ball ,control,50.0,2

she was so delighted with the dress ,control,57.14285714285714,4
meanwhile the stepmother and the t two sisters were uh prancing,control,27.27272727272727,3
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her,control,27.27272727272727,4
I believe that they may have been responsible throat,control,66.66666666666666,3
she cried ,control,50.0,1

into a magnificent coach for Cinderella ,control,50.0,3
