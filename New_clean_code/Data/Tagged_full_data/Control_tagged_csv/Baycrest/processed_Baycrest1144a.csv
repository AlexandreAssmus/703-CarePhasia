okay ,control,0.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
well  um one of the big  one of the very important things,control,28.57142857142857,0
that was like very positive experience ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and I was a teenager at the time ,control,62.5,3
and um it was a significant change ,control,42.85714285714285,2
it was quite a drastic change ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and  um but it was uh interesting in the sense that it was,control,50.0,4
it was just a big  a big change and a big transition ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and uh it was you_know with all these expectations and  and,control,41.66666666666667,3
learning  you_know getting used to a whole new culture ,control,30.0,4
not language because I spoke English uh where I came from ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and  um but just getting used to whole new culture and um,control,7.6923076923076925,0
like s like you_know we spoke differently from how we s,control,45.45454545454545,3
and  um and so  just getting used to everyone and the culture,control,28.57142857142857,0
it wasn't  well  one of the  one of the things uh,control,40.0,6
we drive on the  we drove on the left in the other  in,control,60.0,6
it's former British_Guyana ,control,50.0,2
and um you_know just getting used to consumerism ,control,25.0,2
that was one of the big shock you_know ,control,50.0,4
we didn't  we didn't spend money there like we  we did here,control,43.75,0
like my parents certainly didn't spend money and buy clothing and,control,25.0,2
and there was just money that was  money that's so,control,41.66666666666667,5
right ,control,0.0,0
it is just a dispensable commodity ,control,50.0,2
and I guess it's just like everything else today ,control,50.0,4
especially in the last fifteen twenty years you_know ,control,25.0,4
it's like everything has become dispensable ,control,71.42857142857143,2
you_know it's like you buy a shirt ,control,62.5,3
you wear it a few times ,control,50.0,2
and then you can go get another one because it's so inexpensive now,control,42.85714285714285,3
and  um but there's a premium on education ,control,30.0,3
and that's where I invested my time ,control,62.5,3
and um I spent many years in education while  while working,control,33.33333333333333,2
I just did it because I felt I could do it ,control,63.63636363636363,3
and it was immensely challenging ,control,40.0,1
but I struggled through it ,control,60.0,2
and I was very successful ,control,40.0,2
a typical day  a workday ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I'll describe a typical workday ,control,50.0,2
I'm up at five a_m ,control,66.66666666666666,3
I'm just  I just got useta getting up really early ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and I would um have a cup of coffee ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I would uh brush my teeth and shave and shower ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and then I would put on my sweatpants and tshirt ,control,40.0,2
and if it's the wintertime I'd get on my jacket and uh winter,control,53.333333333333336,6
and I would go around the block for a walk a couple  two,control,50.0,4
espe especially when it's colder you kind_of INV,control,44.44444444444444,2
and so  by the time I'm  I've done I would go out  go out,control,47.368421052631575,4
by then I'm sweating ,control,60.0,2
um so  that gives  gives my  my  it revs up my whole,control,43.75,3
and that's  that's great because it just jumpstarts my whole,control,53.84615384615385,4
and then um I'll just undress and cool down and um then get,control,21.428571428571427,3
and I don't typically have a morning breakfast ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it's just something I got used to ,control,62.5,4
and it works really well for me ,control,42.85714285714285,2
I  I don't consume dairy products because I'm lactose intolerant,control,46.15384615384615,3
and um so  I'll walk to work ,control,22.22222222222222,2
it's about a twelve minute walk  twelve to fifteen minute walk,control,23.07692307692308,4
and then when I get there and I  um I'll have another half,control,40.0,3
well  maybe almost a full cup but with brown sugar again ,control,16.666666666666664,0
and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative,control,50.0,4
and you check your email and other  voicemail and all these,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  administration consumes a_lot_of time ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and by then it's eight o'clock ,control,42.85714285714285,2
then I'm ready to get into my work like for another half an hour,control,60.0,6
I'm ready to get into my  you_know the chargeable work,control,41.66666666666667,5
but it's the auditing or accounting or tax work ,control,30.0,4
whatever is  whatever I have on my desk or whatever is ,control,66.66666666666666,4
and so  that will take up  consume most of my morning ,control,38.46153846153847,4
I tend not to eat or snack in the  during the day ,control,38.46153846153847,5
I  um I'm  I'm a little bit disciplined with that ,control,57.14285714285714,0
because I used to ,control,50.0,1
and I useta be very um ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and it didn't work well for me ,control,50.0,2
I was very overweight at one time ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and I  it didn't work well for me ,control,50.0,0
so  I  and  and then I sit down all day ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and so  that's  uh that became a problem because I was,control,50.0,0
so  I really hadta uh get rid of the weight ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and it changed  it made a huge change ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  I'm actually a pure pure vegan now ,control,40.0,2
and for the last three years ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well  a total of five years now but mostly so the last three years,control,20.0,0
and um so  lunchtime will come around ,control,12.5,2
and I take my lunch ,control,40.0,2
so  I  I make my own lunch ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and  um and so  I'll have lunch between eleven thirty and,control,21.428571428571427,4
uh I actually go out for a walk ,control,50.0,3
I always get up and go for a walk  get some fresh air and come,control,31.25,4
not a long walk but a short walk ,control,25.0,2
and then I'll have lunch ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and by twelve thirty  between twelve thirty or one o'clock,control,18.181818181818183,5
but in the middle of the day again you might have some,control,58.333333333333336,5
you gotta check your emails or voicemails  deal with any other,control,30.76923076923077,5
and  um and then around one o'clock then I really get back,control,7.6923076923076925,2
and you_know so  one to  one to three ,control,30.0,0
so  I give it a solid two hours one to three ,control,41.66666666666667,2
and then I take a break at three o'clock to three fifteen ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I did get some water or  or go downstairs and go for a walk,control,31.25,5
and um any other issues that come up again  the same  the,control,35.714285714285715,0
administrative  administrative stuff goes on all the time,control,33.33333333333333,3
and then between three fifteen to five o'clock I xxx the chargeable,control,25.0,2
and then I try to get out_of there right after five o'clock ,control,16.666666666666664,4
so  I'd pack up at five o'clock and um you_know do the routine,control,40.0,3
it depends ,control,50.0,1
it could be personal stuff ,control,60.0,2
it could be client related matters ,control,50.0,3
and um then I try to get outta there right at five o'clock or,control,14.285714285714285,4
and I make sure I'm there at that time every day ,control,50.0,5
tell me the story ,control,50.0,2
okay so  he's kicking a soccer ball ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh the soccer ball broke the window ,control,25.0,2
and the soccer ball went through the glass pane  broke the glass,control,30.76923076923077,4
and he's gotten up  the fellow who was sitting at the ,control,61.53846153846154,4
it looks like it entered in someone's house through the broken,control,58.333333333333336,5
and he's now gotten up ,control,50.0,1
and he's picked up the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and he's looking out to see who did that ,control,50.0,3
so  starting at one ,control,40.0,0
okay so  the mother is giving her child the umbrella because it,control,53.84615384615385,2
and so  he's ,control,40.0,2
okay so  he didn't  he just said goodbye ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and he did not take the umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but then when he went out it started to rain ,control,40.0,2
so  he  I guess he regretted not taking the umbrella ,control,41.66666666666667,4
so  he became wet ,control,40.0,1
he went  he walked through the rain ,control,50.0,4
and he became wet ,control,25.0,1
and he went back home ,control,20.0,2
and looks like he went back home ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and he got the umbrella after all ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and this story is ,control,50.0,2
alright  it looks like the pet  the child's pet is up in the tree,control,41.17647058823529,5
and the father is trying to get the pet ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and it looks like he's stuck in the tree now as_well ,control,50.0,4
and the dog is barking up the tree ,control,50.0,2
but they call the fire department ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and so  the fire  the ambulance  the fire guys are,control,30.76923076923077,4
and they're gonna go rescue the pet and maybe the father ,control,30.76923076923077,4
stepsisters ,control,0.0,0

I don't  I'm not sure who the girl and the  what the,control,56.25,0
and this is  this is the  the  the wicked  the,control,57.14285714285714,5
and this is Cinderella ,control,50.0,1
they  she was more like the housemaid or the house servant ,control,50.0,4
and  um and these were her friends ,control,37.5,2
the birds were her friends ,control,60.0,2
so  she'd confide  confide in the birds  I think ,control,46.15384615384615,3
she  she would seek comfort in the  in the  in  in,control,60.0,4
and um yeah so  they  they sort of just  they  she,control,26.666666666666668,2
and so the  the  the three stepsisters they  they just,control,38.46153846153847,0
