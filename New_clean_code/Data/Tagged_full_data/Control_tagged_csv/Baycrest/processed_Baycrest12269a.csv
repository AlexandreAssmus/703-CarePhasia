and all the uh young ladies were invited to come to the ball ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and uh uh Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated ,control,12.5,1
she basically hadta do all the work that the other sisters didn't,control,46.15384615384615,4
so  she was um never uh ,control,42.85714285714285,1
so  sh she was always being giving job  giving job ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  uh she kept just getting more and more jobs to do ,control,15.384615384615383,4

the  um so  the  t the day of the  the day of the,control,52.94117647058824,0
and uh she never had any time to work  to  to,control,23.07692307692308,4
so  um the ,control,25.0,0
yeah meanwhile the other uh two uh stepsisters were  uh,control,18.181818181818183,2
and so  um they were all prepared to go to the ball ,control,30.76923076923077,5
and then um uh the  on the day of  I believe uh,control,35.714285714285715,6
and uh so  the  the birds and the mice and all the  all,control,37.5,0
and they were stealing  I remember they were stealing like,control,54.54545454545454,3
and she was discovered  that was discovered ,control,50.0,2
and the moth s uh stepmother basically gave her more jobs to,control,25.0,3
and somewhere in the story there's  uh a fairy godmother,control,33.33333333333333,4
yeah so  this is her still doing all of these jobs ,control,50.0,5
and um yeah so  she's all s s sad and unhappy that she is,control,37.5,2
um and then um her y fairy godmother appears and um waved,control,8.333333333333332,2
and basically um the  um some  something gets turned,control,36.36363636363637,3
and I think the mice turn into s horse  uh either uh,control,23.07692307692308,4
and so   then  then she creates uh uh a nice uh gown,control,14.285714285714285,4
and um uh off she goes to the ball ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but she hasta be back by midnight because the spell ends at,control,41.66666666666667,3
and so  the sisters of_course they see Cinderella there in their,control,33.33333333333333,3
and they're wondering how she  and the  step and the,control,46.15384615384615,2
anyway midnight approaches ,control,0.0,1

and she remembers that she's gotta uh leave by then ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and so ,control,0.0,1
oh yeah ,control,0.0,1
in the meantime ,control,66.66666666666666,2
uh I think that's the prince ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and that's his father ,control,60.0,2
um and anyway he  he  he  dan he only wants to dance,control,26.666666666666668,0
and um anyway when  as  as  as midnight approaches uh,control,30.76923076923077,5
and so  she in her running out she loses her s glass slipper and,control,40.0,4
um but she's of_course still missing her one slipper ,control,30.0,2
so  the next day the  pr the prince wants to find out ,control,35.714285714285715,2
