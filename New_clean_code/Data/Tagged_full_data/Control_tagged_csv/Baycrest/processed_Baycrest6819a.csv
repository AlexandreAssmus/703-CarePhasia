sighs and uh I don't know  by hook or by crook  I got this,control,35.294117647058826,6
so  it was a big bunch of stuff I got in the mail ,control,57.14285714285714,5
and  uh well  I was super happy of_course ,control,20.0,3
so  I went to my headmaster and told him that ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and he was super happy ,control,40.0,2
and he just immediately told all the teachers  which we were only,control,46.15384615384615,3
and everyone except one were happy for me ,control,62.5,3
and the other one just said ,control,16.666666666666664,2

I don't know ,control,50.0,1
I didn't do anything  right ,control,42.85714285714285,2

it was at Trafalgar_Square you_know ,control,60.0,2
