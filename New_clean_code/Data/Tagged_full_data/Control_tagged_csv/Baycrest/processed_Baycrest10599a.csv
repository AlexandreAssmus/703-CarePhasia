sounds like a ten minute interview ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk,control,33.33333333333333,3
um it was important to me to get into law school ,control,45.45454545454545,4
that was something that happened that was very important ,control,66.66666666666666,4
I have no idea why I was accepted because I don't think I met any,control,62.5,3
thirty two ,control,0.0,1
I was thirty two when I started ,control,57.14285714285714,2
so  I guess I was thirty one when I applied ,control,54.54545454545454,0
and in my year the median age was twenty two ,control,40.0,3
so  I was one of the oldest in the class  had nothing in common,control,56.25,6
I_mean they still remembered high_school ,control,20.0,1
who thought about high_school ,control,50.0,2
and they all knew each_other from high_school ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and they were there because they didn't get into medical school or,control,46.15384615384615,4
and I was just flummoxed ,control,40.0,1
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came,control,53.84615384615385,5
they were just there because ,control,60.0,2
well  I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the,control,60.0,5
and I was there because I just really cared ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and so  I really didn't fit in um really ,control,18.181818181818183,2
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real,control,60.0,7
up until then I was friendly with people but I didn't understand,control,46.15384615384615,3
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study,control,46.15384615384615,4
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what,control,50.0,2
like they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious ,control,40.0,4
why would anybody say the obvious ,control,66.66666666666666,2
so  people said the obvious ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they were rewarded ,control,50.0,1
so  those were the people sought after to be in the study groups ,control,50.0,6
not me ,control,50.0,1
so  I did almost everything alone for the entire year ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she,control,40.0,7
so  I said ,control,50.0,1
 thanks but no thanks ,control,20.0,2
 don't bother ,control,25.0,1
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didn't,control,38.46153846153847,4
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it ,control,54.54545454545454,5
so  that was me laughs ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  I was part of that group for some classes ,control,63.63636363636363,4
at the end of the year i in the subway station I met someone who,control,66.66666666666666,5
um but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy,control,38.46153846153847,5
and she was in the other group ,control,57.14285714285714,3
so  I never saw her ,control,50.0,1
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I,control,38.46153846153847,3
and that was good ,control,50.0,1
like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one,control,35.714285714285715,4
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the,control,58.333333333333336,6
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 please  when you write your exams don't think that your mark is,control,46.66666666666666,3
and I thought ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 wow it is so amazing to hear something like that ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged,control,58.333333333333336,5
it was in law school that I learned that competentq was a,control,66.66666666666666,3
 oh he's a competent lawyer ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and that the positive term was brightq ,control,42.85714285714285,2
if you weren't bright you were nobody ,control,75.0,2
so  um because he wasn't bright the students didn't respect him,control,42.85714285714285,2
and I th made the mistake of saying to someone ,control,50.0,5
 you_know yeah h okay but he's decent ,control,22.22222222222222,0
 like he's a decent person ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 he has a heart ,control,40.0,2
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 a heart ,control,33.33333333333333,0
 I didn't come to Oz where this one doesn't have a brain and this,control,47.05882352941176,5
 I came to law school ,control,33.33333333333333,3
didn't talk to her again ,control,50.0,2
U_of_T ,control,0.0,0
U_of_T was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada ,control,33.33333333333333,6
I don't know why ,control,60.0,1
and I also didn't understand that law schools had their own kind of,control,28.57142857142857,3
but I didn't  I didn't know that ,control,50.0,0
I didn't even get it until after I left ,control,60.0,2
so  really it wasn't the right school for me ,control,54.54545454545454,3
I really should have gone to York ,control,57.14285714285714,2
but when I came to Toronto people were saying ,control,44.44444444444444,4
 oh U_of_T ,control,0.0,0
 it's the best school ,control,50.0,2
 and why would you wanna be way out at York ,control,45.45454545454545,0
 you're in Toronto ,control,60.0,2
 you wanna be downtown ,control,40.0,2
so  I thought ,control,50.0,1
 okay I wanna be downtown ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  I was downtown ,control,60.0,1
boy kicks the ball ,control,25.0,2
flies into a glass window  breaks the window and falls into the,control,38.46153846153847,5
it knocks over the lamp ,control,60.0,3
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see,control,38.46153846153847,5
it looks like he's got his gun in the pock pocket ,control,58.333333333333336,4
okay  the mother tells the child to take an umbrella ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and the child doesn't want one ,control,28.57142857142857,2
oh the  uh but in this  st in the second one the,control,42.85714285714285,0
well  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh I see ,control,7.6923076923076925,1
so  the mother offers the child the umbrella ,control,44.44444444444444,2
the child refuses ,control,33.33333333333333,2
the child says ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 goodbye ,control,0.0,0
goes outside ,control,0.0,1
it's raining ,control,66.66666666666666,1

and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother who's not,control,35.714285714285715,5
well  w what's happening is that um firefighters are rushing,control,50.0,4
but it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was,control,50.0,5
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat ,control,40.0,3
and then he got stuck ,control,20.0,1
and then the firemen are coming to save the man ,control,30.0,3
maybe the cat was chasing the bird ,control,42.85714285714285,2
no  I think the dog was chasing the cat ,control,50.0,0
am I allowed to make it a xxx ,control,50.0,3
the bane of feminists everywhere  Cinderella's story about a,control,36.36363636363637,0
and I don't think we find out how she got to that situation but,control,53.333333333333336,5
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a,control,40.0,2
she always  she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking,control,46.15384615384615,0
and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes ,control,27.27272727272727,5
and she wasn't given the best food to eat ,control,30.0,3
and anyway she was just treated horribly ,control,28.57142857142857,1
one day uh the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an,control,27.27272727272727,3
Cinderella  thinking she's a member of the family thinks she can,control,53.84615384615385,6
but she can't ,control,50.0,1
so  she h has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get,control,23.07692307692308,4
and then they go ,control,25.0,1
after they leave she's very disappointed because she really wanted,control,54.54545454545454,2
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her,control,27.27272727272727,3
so  she gives her a beautiful dress to wear  lovely new shoes and,control,26.666666666666668,4
and the only rule is be back by twelve ,control,44.44444444444444,2
so  Cinderella went to the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
she had a wonderful time ,control,40.0,2
nobody knew who she was ,control,80.0,2
everybody was saying ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 oh who's that woman ,control,50.0,0
 who's that woman ,control,60.0,0
the prince danced with her the whole evening ,control,50.0,2
she had a lovely time ,control,40.0,2
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta,control,41.66666666666667,2
so  she ran out ,control,60.0,1
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper,control,57.14285714285714,4
um following that  the prince found the missing slipper ,control,30.0,2
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper ,control,41.66666666666667,6
so  he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's,control,42.85714285714285,4
it didn't fit anybody ,control,60.0,1
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly,control,46.15384615384615,5
and he tried it on their feet ,control,57.14285714285714,3
it didn't fit any of them ,control,71.42857142857143,3
and he saw Cinderella and said ,control,16.666666666666664,1
 why don't you try it ,control,57.14285714285714,1
or possibly she said ,control,25.0,1
 why don't I try it ,control,57.14285714285714,1
and he tried it on ,control,60.0,1
and it fit ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after,control,64.28571428571429,5
and she of  co of_course  being swept off her feet  agreed,control,35.714285714285715,5
that she'd just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and,control,28.57142857142857,3
but the book doesn't take you that far ,control,44.44444444444444,2
