okay  I was running to my class at the university  to my finance,control,53.333333333333336,0
next thing I knew I woke up  looked at my wristwatch ,control,41.66666666666667,4
it was still on ,control,50.0,1
shockproof by the way ,control,50.0,3
it said eight twenty ,control,25.0,2
and the clock on the wall said five to nine ,control,40.0,4
so  I assumed something had happened ,control,57.14285714285714,2
yes  something had happened ,control,40.0,1
I had two broken legs ,control,20.0,2
and I was in the hospital emergency ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh I remained there for three and a half months and was able to,control,28.57142857142857,5
and walking down the hall I lost my balance on my crutches ,control,50.0,6
and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh and then they took me back to bed with a wheelchair ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and I got into bed ,control,40.0,2
and the nurse came in ,control,40.0,2
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 am I going to the operating room ,control,50.0,3
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 yes ,control,0.0,0
and I went to the operating room was put in a body cast from under,control,53.333333333333336,6
and I had to remain in that for another eight weeks ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and I finally got out_of bed and learned to walk again of_course ,control,16.666666666666664,4
because you can't walk when you're in bed for that long ,control,69.23076923076923,4
I came out_of the hospital ,control,60.0,3
my accident was October twelfth ,control,40.0,2
came outta the hospital March twenty ninth ,control,14.285714285714285,3
and that night I went to university to write a test ,control,36.36363636363637,3
so  um and then I hafta really learn to walk because I was,control,35.714285714285715,0
and I learned to walk ,control,20.0,2
and now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami_Beach all,control,42.85714285714285,4
and while in the hospital they would bring ambulatory patients to,control,54.54545454545454,3
disregarding that except_for going for xrays I was in this room at,control,66.66666666666666,5
but I took the approach that there's nothing  when you ,control,58.333333333333336,3
move on ,control,50.0,1
and make the best of the situation ,control,42.85714285714285,4
so  the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy ,control,50.0,4
yeah ,control,0.0,0
well  you know there's nothing ,control,42.85714285714285,2
I'm not  not to say ,control,28.57142857142857,2

I have pain in my leg ,control,50.0,4
but that's not gonna  it's gonna be there ,control,38.46153846153847,3
so  I can't ruin my life with it INV,control,54.54545454545454,2
I get up in the morning before seven  go to the corner  get the,control,50.0,4
the articles are short ,control,50.0,2
but it tells you just as much as a major newspaper ,control,36.36363636363637,4
uh throat,control,0.0,1
and we have little talk ,control,20.0,2
and the superintendent comes ,control,25.0,2
and a couple of other residents come ,control,28.57142857142857,4
and we talk for a little while ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and then I go upstairs ,control,20.0,1
and I do ,control,33.33333333333333,1
after I re flip through the paper I do the Sudoku and the,control,69.23076923076923,3
and I usually get the whole puzzle ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and uh then I will go and check the stock market on the internet,control,35.714285714285715,4
and depending on the day I usually meet somebody either for lunch,control,41.66666666666667,4
but it depends on the day ,control,50.0,3
and I belong to an investment club ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  I kind_of look if there's anything I think they should know,control,57.14285714285714,5
since I'm the accountant in the group that I should be explaining,control,76.92307692307693,4
and uh then if I went out for lunch I will have dinner at home ,control,46.66666666666666,3
