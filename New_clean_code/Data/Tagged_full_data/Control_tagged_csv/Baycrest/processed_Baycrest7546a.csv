and I thought generally speaking I did  I did pretty well ,control,25.0,3
but uh I got a sort_of mediocre to not so great mark in  uh,control,26.666666666666668,5
and my uh mother in particular was kind_of upset with that ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and I thought that was kind_of unfair ,control,42.85714285714285,2
uh right now basically I uh tutor privately a bunch of students,control,25.0,3
normally that  that takes place in the  the evenings and,control,41.66666666666667,4
so  I do tend to sleep in ,control,50.0,2
uh usually I have breakfast around ten or ten thirty ,control,20.0,3
um I might read for a while and go the library just to email,control,35.714285714285715,3
and uh then I have like what's essentially my evening meal,control,33.33333333333333,4
and then I have maybe uh one or two uh lessons with students ,control,15.384615384615383,3

and in the same tree uh there was this man who uh climbed up it,control,46.66666666666666,4
and someone  probably the girl  brought a ladder ,control,30.0,3
but uh for whatever reason it didn't reach either cat or the man,control,35.714285714285715,3
