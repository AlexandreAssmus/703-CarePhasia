haven't had that many ,control,20.0,2
but um when I was I guess  around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader ,control,50.0,4
and I was in practice ,control,60.0,2
and I was doing ,control,50.0,1
which I can't believe I did ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 but headstands and head  back flips ,control,0.0,0
and doing a flip I fell ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I tripped ,control,50.0,1
and I came down ,control,50.0,1
and I broke my arm ,control,40.0,2
so  I remember that instance ,control,50.0,2
I remember it quite clearly being driven ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh it was a CYO thing ,control,50.0,2
so  I remember being driven in  in the car by the priest and the  my  my other friends around me and going to the hospital and  um and having my arm taken care of and having surgery ,control,40.47619047619048,6
so  ,control,50.0,0
I was in a cast ,control,80.0,3
you hafta remember it was a long time ago ,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  I was in a cast ,control,71.42857142857143,3
and I was in a cast for a long time ,control,60.0,3
I do remember my father making me s um slings that were um  the holidays ,control,43.75,6
so  because it went through many holidays ,control,37.5,0
and  um and then once it was  uh you_know once it uh m ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I went back to being a cheerleader again ,control,50.0,5
um it's a_little misshapen ,control,40.0,1
but it's fine ,control,50.0,1
so  I no longer do back flips to say the least laughs ,control,30.76923076923077,0
well  my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight ,control,25.0,4
well  the problems were that he  could not communicate ,control,45.45454545454545,3
right after his stroke he really had no language at all ,control,36.36363636363637,3
so  the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and  um and has continued at this clinic ,control,40.909090909090914,4
um and this is almost four years later since his stroke ,control,36.36363636363637,4
so  I've seen the development of the speech patterns emerging ,control,50.0,5
and um what I have seen is him  is him recapture language ,control,53.84615384615385,3
I I think very similar to what I see in a child ,control,58.333333333333336,6
so   in moving in  in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see ,control,39.130434782608695,11
okay ,control,0.0,0
well  I guess the thing that always uh st stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and  and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident ,control,38.63636363636363,6
and  and I remember asking the question ,control,25.0,0
 is he alive ,control,50.0,1
and it was such a strange question ,control,57.14285714285714,2
but uh I needed an answer to it ,control,50.0,3
and they said on the other  on the  su the other side of the phone um they didn't know ,control,45.45454545454545,6
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and  and getting out there ,control,6.25,6
and I remember hearing the sirens as I was  as I was approaching ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and when I got there um you_know he had already been in a  st he had already been out ,control,50.0,4
um he didn't know who I was ,control,62.5,2
and he didn't know who anyone was ,control,62.5,2
but luckily and  um but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him ,control,38.88888888888889,3
so  they knew that he wasn't drunk ,control,55.55555555555556,2
they knew that he wasn't impaired in any other way ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and he knew enough to know that he was  he had a stroke ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and  I remember he was the one who said to me ,control,58.333333333333336,5
 get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible ,control,40.0,3
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to ,control,50.0,3
and I remember this police officer ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him um when Anthony was on the force ,control,52.38095238095239,7
so  he came in as a  as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant ,control,58.82352941176471,5
and so you_know I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you_know in that it was very much like a  um like a movie or you_know ,control,43.58974358974359,10
but and I remember getting down into the  in into the brain attack center ,control,46.66666666666666,5
and um everybody was doing what they needed to do ,control,40.0,3
and it was all this kind_of prescribed dance that went on ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and um you_know getting him there and  and getting him that shot and  and that starting ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and  and  you_know  and then from there it was just the recovery ,control,26.666666666666668,3
it was the day in day out routine ,control,62.5,3
but um I do remember that ,control,50.0,1
that stays with me ,control,75.0,2
yeah  it does absolutely ,control,20.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
well  a boy is outside ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he's playing  looks like soccer ,control,37.5,3
so  he's kicking the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and lo_and_behold it goes  into the neighbor's or his own um window and crashes through that window ,control,31.57894736842105,5
and there's the  f the man who's sitting and either watching t_v or talking or having a conversation ,control,28.57142857142857,5
and the soccer ball comes through the window hits the lamp ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and um the gentleman inside is really quite surprised ,control,22.22222222222222,2
he then um has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man ,control,41.17647058823529,5
and the mother is saying to him ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 take this umbrella because I think it's going to rain ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and he's saying ,control,50.0,1
 no no no I don't need that umbrella ,control,30.0,2
 I'm leaving ,control,50.0,1
so  she's got the umbrella in hand ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and he's out the door ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and then gasp lo_and_behold the rain starts ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and he is caught in the rain ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and he is really wet ,control,40.0,2
and he makes his way home ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and his mother is looking at him saying um h h ,control,36.36363636363637,3
 I told you so ,control,40.0,1
 and let's get the umbrella ,control,28.57142857142857,0
 and then you can go back out ,control,25.0,2
well  it's a series of circumstances ,control,50.0,3
and  the little girl's cat is in the tree ,control,36.36363636363637,3
she was  looks like she was riding her bike ,control,60.0,4
and she was  s um she saw her cat up in the tree ,control,50.0,5
she could have called her dad ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and her dad said ,control,25.0,2
 okay I'm going to help you and go get the cat ,control,30.76923076923077,5
and took the ladder ,control,25.0,2
and it doesn't seem like the ladder is quite as  l as uh high as what he needed to ,control,47.61904761904761,8
so  anyway the ,control,50.0,0
no  I'm sorry ,control,60.0,2
then it looks like he used the ladder ,control,50.0,3
and the ladder has fallen ,control,40.0,2
and he is stuck in the tree ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and  the dog is barking  because they are all up in the tree ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and the firemen hafta come and rescue ,control,14.285714285714285,2
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house ,control,58.333333333333336,3
and there was um a stepmother ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the stepmother had two  daughters ,control,14.285714285714285,2
the father dies ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the daughters  um the stepmother um has a sense of favoritism towards her children  her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they  so to speak ,control,31.428571428571427,6
so  um Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and  and all of that ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and then the  um the  s the stepsisters um  grow meaner and meaner as the time goes ,control,25.0,3
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more  jealous of Cinderella ,control,15.384615384615383,5
um and then comes the  um the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the  um for there to be a dance ,control,39.285714285714285,5
and everybody is all  um is all you_know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the  the perfect outfit ,control,45.83333333333333,5
and  and Cinderella um is not going to go to the ball ,control,23.07692307692308,4
and she is at home ,control,60.0,2
and  and  um and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot ,control,15.384615384615383,3
so they find  I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the  in a   in a hope chest or I guess  what I would call now a hope chest ,control,44.11764705882353,6
and um so that becomes ,control,20.0,1
I don't  n wait a minute ,control,37.5,0
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing ,control,54.54545454545454,4
um so  the sisters go to the ball ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and  and s poor Cinderella is home with her mice ,control,27.27272727272727,4
and  and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe ,control,25.0,3
so  the fairy p godmother creates the  um the carriage to take her in ,control,37.5,0
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect ,control,40.0,3
and  and her fairy godmothers then help her um to go to the ball ,control,26.666666666666668,4
so  when  when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there ,control,56.25,4
and uh everyone is just gasp ,control,33.33333333333333,2
takes her breath away  and she takes their breath away ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and she meets the prince ,control,40.0,2
um and they dance ,control,25.0,1
and they have a wonderful time ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um but what happens is the clock strikes twelve ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and she needs to be home ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and um she is running out the door ,control,50.0,2
and her slipper is  her shoe is left behind ,control,40.0,3
so  she goes home ,control,40.0,1
the sisters and whatnot they all go home ,control,37.5,2
and  and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper ,control,43.75,5
and he combs through the village ,control,50.0,3
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and it doesn't work ,control,40.0,1
and then lo_and_behold he finds Cinderella ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and the f shoe fits ,control,20.0,2
they get married ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and they live happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
the end the end ,control,50.0,2
and way too many girls are looking for Prince_charming ,control,22.22222222222222,3
but that's a whole other issue yes ,control,37.5,2

first  well I would get the bread out_of the ,control,40.0,3
for me I keep my bread in the freezer ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  I would take it out_of the freezer and let it defrost ,control,53.84615384615385,3
um my peanut butter stays in a cabinet ,control,37.5,3
my jelly is in the refrigerator ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  the bread comes out first ,control,42.85714285714285,2
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first ,control,40.0,3
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter ,control,41.66666666666667,5
put the other slice of bread on ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and slice it in a triangle motion ,control,42.85714285714285,3
