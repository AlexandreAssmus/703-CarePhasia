oh gee ,control,0.0,1
hm actually I fainted  once ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and that's a terrible feeling ,control,50.0,2
and I guess  you_know I guess we could compare that to a  a stroke in the sense that it's a sudden onset ,control,56.00000000000001,1
and uh you do have a  a short window if it's the same as a stroke ,control,55.55555555555556,5
there  in my case there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong ,control,50.0,4
and you do have time to  to be cognizant of being in big trouble ,control,46.66666666666666,7
in_fact  I remember one time I  I uh  I fainted ,control,30.76923076923077,4
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and that was  I was really afraid of  of the fact that I was in a hard tile room ,control,57.14285714285714,10
and um my daughter was downstairs ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight ,control,30.0,3
and I  just in a panic I said ,control,44.44444444444444,5
 Dolly call nineoneone ,control,0.0,1
so  I knew I was in trouble ,control,62.5,3
and I  I  then I  I was able to just slowly go down myself ,control,41.17647058823529,4
and then I went out_of the picture ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and uh the paramedics did take me to the hospital ,control,50.0,3
and I had food poisoning ,control,20.0,2
and uh when I got ,control,40.0,1
th now that was really frightening as you_know they  they're racing me through the uh the e_r ,control,57.89473684210527,5
they're asking me you_know all sorts of information ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and  and the pocketbook disappears ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and then you_know testing and monitors and all that ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and they said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 you_know your potassium level is in the basement ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  it was really a ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and you_know you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either you_know in the hospital or even dying ,control,30.434782608695656,7
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to uh those sort_of sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly ,control,39.130434782608695,6
so  it was truly an emergency situation ,control,50.0,2
so  and my daughter as young as she was you_know I credit Natalie with you_know the fact that it wasn't worse ,control,47.82608695652174,5
that she  she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed nineoneone ,control,43.75,0
yeah  so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice  I think ,control,33.33333333333333,1
right ,control,0.0,0
and that's probably as scary li just like that ,control,50.0,3
yeah  yeah ,control,0.0,1
I was in the hospital for the night ,control,75.0,3
and uh they gave me a liquid potassium ,control,37.5,2
and then uh in i_vs ,control,20.0,1
and then um I left the hospital with uh ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well  before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions you_know to  to call ,control,38.095238095238095,0
but it was liquid potassium and i_vs for uh many hours ,control,27.27272727272727,4
and they were monitoring me and you_know taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that ,control,29.411764705882355,4
so  but you_know I was out you_know by the next morning ,control,41.66666666666667,0
but still ,control,0.0,1
I felt really weak and tired ,control,16.666666666666664,2
I_mean you needed to recover ,control,20.0,2
the  the  the rest of that day was really kind_of not on the map you_know ,control,47.05882352941176,0
but I_mean I  I just felt really really tired ,control,20.0,4
and j wiped out maybe is better ,control,28.57142857142857,2
tired  tired doesn't capture it ,control,28.57142857142857,2
laughs you_know it was scary ,control,40.0,2
you_know  when you see these stories right ,control,37.5,0
you  you hear them ,control,60.0,2
somebody died ,control,50.0,1
like how do they die ,control,60.0,1
right  right ,control,0.0,0
it can be serious ,control,75.0,1
and I had been doing a good deed that day ,control,50.0,2
I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium ,control,66.66666666666666,3
at the time  and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation ,control,55.00000000000001,10
and I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium working um an event ,control,45.45454545454545,4
it was family day ,control,50.0,2
and they had  uh I had some chicken ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and that's  that's what did me in laughs ,control,63.63636363636363,4
trying to do a good thing  right laughs ,control,11.11111111111111,4
they almost killed me laughs ,control,40.0,2
yes ,control,0.0,0
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it ,control,57.14285714285714,4
um a very dear friend of mine was  was  had cancer and was dying ,control,31.25,3
uh you_know  she was at that you_know close point ,control,40.0,3
and uh she  I guess it was uh the liver starting to shut down ,control,40.0,4
you_know  the  again the organs the  the kidney and liver especially the liver ,control,31.25,0
and she was incoherent ,control,50.0,1
and she was s speaking to me ,control,71.42857142857143,2
this was a very strange experience ,control,50.0,3
she was speaking to me ,control,80.0,2
um but I couldn't understand a single word that she said ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and it was just gibberish ,control,40.0,1
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way ,control,50.0,4
and she would  it would be frustrating for her that I  wasn't understanding what she said ,control,63.1578947368421,4
and it sounded like words too ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but it wasn't ,control,50.0,1
and um I spoke with the  uh the uh nurse who was caring for her ,control,50.0,5
she was at home ,control,75.0,2
and uh I was told that th when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen ,control,47.368421052631575,5
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of you_know the medical sequence of events ,control,43.75,5
but  but that  that's very frustrating to be ,control,36.36363636363637,0
and I could see the frustration on her face ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and then uh I feel badly ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and I feel frustrated too because I  I really wanna understand and  and can't ,control,29.411764705882355,4
well  you could only have simple communications at that point sort_of like point to things ,control,31.25,3
and then I would  um I would  I would tell her at di different ilver intervals ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 I cannot understand what you're saying ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and she would feel t even worse ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was  saying words ,control,42.85714285714285,4
I  w I realized that pretty  pretty quickly ,control,30.0,0
she  she thought she was you_know saying things ,control,44.44444444444444,2
so   I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or um  just  pretend sometimes I even understood ,control,26.666666666666668,11
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever ,control,69.23076923076923,6
you_know  then she would  it would be pretty clear I'm not coming with the water ,control,50.0,4
but that  that  that's very frightening ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and  and it's frustrating for everyone ,control,50.0,0
you're imprisoned in your own body in a way aren't you ,control,61.53846153846154,4
yeah  that hasta be a hell ,control,28.57142857142857,2
hm ,control,0.0,0
something important ,control,50.0,1
uh  I guess a_lot_of important things sort_of happened you_know ,control,10.0,4
um be hard to uh ,control,20.0,3
I think  I think um  in a sense I made my own important things ,control,37.5,5
um for instance um uh I grew up uh in a family ,control,41.66666666666667,3
uh I was one of five children ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and now I don't want this to sound you_know politically incorrect but laughs my father was uh Italian of Italian descent ,control,27.27272727272727,7
and he had this mind set that girls just don't go to college ,control,35.714285714285715,4
and unfortunately four of us were girls ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  he didn't  that wasn't a ,control,60.0,0
he wasn't pleased with that either I don't think laughs ,control,50.0,3
and I was the third one ,control,50.0,2
can you imagine ,control,66.66666666666666,1
in a row ,control,66.66666666666666,2
no boys yet ,control,33.33333333333333,1
mm so  anyhow  laughs it was made very clear that uh college was not on the map ,control,36.84210526315789,5
uh and his  his  his idea was that um ,control,45.45454545454545,3
 I've been supporting you all these years ,control,66.66666666666666,2
 and now  you owe me ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 you_know you hafta go to work  and contribute to the household ,control,23.07692307692308,4
so  this was a builtin thing ,control,57.14285714285714,2
at the time I wasn't realizing how grave it was ,control,63.63636363636363,5
in_fact  there was something that felt almost exciting about it ,control,45.45454545454545,5
that I'll be going to work soon you_know laughs ,control,40.0,2
and the good news was that I was also an honor student ,control,50.0,3
and I got to high_school at twelve ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete laughs ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and now I was going to work laughs ,control,25.0,2
so  my guidance counselor at the school was  she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student ,control,56.66666666666666,4
she actually wanted to call him ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I was very calm about the whole thing ,control,44.44444444444444,4
I said ,control,50.0,1
 there's really no point ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 you_know it's  y you're not going to get anywhere ,control,30.76923076923077,1
this is the state of things ,control,66.66666666666666,3
it's the state of the art at the Lastname household ,control,63.63636363636363,4
and that's that ,control,75.0,1
so  anyway um she then uh decided to take me under her wing and um knew someone down on Wall_Street and  uh who worked at a personnel department at what was then the Irving_Trust_Company which no longer exists ,control,37.5,11
and they took great pride in that  that company ,control,40.0,3
th they  they were at one Wall_Street ,control,50.0,3
and they considered themselves at the top of Wall_Street ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and this was verbalized ,control,50.0,1
so  anyway laughing um she called her friend ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh I'll never forget her ,control,42.85714285714285,1
her name was Firstname_Lastname who I went to see ,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  I  I put a suit on uh went shopping and bought myself you_know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview ,control,37.03703703703704,6
and I think I was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her ,control,56.25,5
and so she hired me ,control,40.0,1
and I ended up in a subbasement ,control,57.14285714285714,3
not just a basement ,control,25.0,1
it was a subbasement ,control,75.0,2
I think I was lower than the vaults ,control,62.5,5
in a secretarial pool where else laughs ,control,42.85714285714285,4
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool ,control,61.53846153846154,4
I did ,control,50.0,1
and good  good on me ,control,33.33333333333333,0
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to ,control,66.66666666666666,3
even_though I had an academic um uh course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study ,control,42.10526315789473,6
and I  and I  I took typing and stenography ,control,27.27272727272727,3
I thought this might help me ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and maybe my job won't be so random ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I have at_least a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up you_know laughs ,control,38.88888888888889,4
so  I end up in a secretarial pool ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and um they  banks are notoriously very frugal ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and uh back then the things were even worse ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization ,control,50.0,3
and um I  I  I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved ,control,41.37931034482759,5
so  if somebody you_know in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches you_know where I was ,control,53.125,7
so  I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in ,control,42.85714285714285,3
it was sort_of like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at  being at any orphanage where a call comes in ,control,54.16666666666666,8
and they pick you laughs ,control,40.0,2
so  they  a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust uh department on the twelfth floor ,control,47.82608695652174,0
he was a  a  a senior vice president of the bank ,control,53.84615384615385,6
uh his secretary was unexpectedly out ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh they needed a fillin ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  they selected me ,control,60.0,2
and up I went laughs ,control,20.0,1
and I walked in ,control,50.0,1
and you could hear a pin drop in this place ,control,50.0,4
I could tell it was going to be ,control,62.5,3
I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of you_know lightheartedness ,control,46.66666666666666,6
you  you_know it  it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water ,control,55.55555555555556,0
and you should genuflect you_know before you  to sit down at your desk laughs ,control,46.66666666666666,5
so  there I am ,control,60.0,2
and uh it turned out that his secretary ,control,50.0,2
I'll fast forward a_little ,control,40.0,1
so  here I was ,control,60.0,2
you_know  my skills were good ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I'm answering the phone ,control,60.0,2
I'm taking shorthand letters ,control,40.0,2
uh things are getting  things are humming along laughs ,control,30.0,3
everything is great ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and um it turns out that she  the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back ,control,50.0,4
uh she was pregnant and uh was having some uh difficulties some complications so the  the absence was going to be long term ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and they hired me ,control,50.0,1
so now  uh and I had a raise right away ,control,18.181818181818183,2
I thought this work life is a cinch ,control,50.0,3
I'm here for a week and I got a raise laughs ,control,50.0,3
I got out_of the subbasement you_know ,control,50.0,3
I'm in the light of day ,control,71.42857142857143,4
things were  you_know like things were moving along so quickly that I  I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall_Street laughs you_know ,control,34.48275862068966,9
it was the trajectory I was on ,control,85.71428571428571,3
so  one day I was there  I was there for about three months I guess ,control,41.17647058823529,5
and I was out uh to lunch still trying to you_know explore the area ,control,28.57142857142857,4
uh it's a very exciting place you_know ,control,37.5,3
Wall_Street ,control,0.0,0
and I found the New_York Stock_Exchange ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I  you_know I was cum sort_of like a pseudo tourist ,control,41.66666666666667,0
so  I was walking up Broadway one day ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and I encounter the Marine_Midland_Bank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving ,control,37.5,7
it just  you_know  it was a great place light and airy modern ,control,28.57142857142857,0
I went in ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was ,control,45.45454545454545,3
so  I was directed there ,control,50.0,1
I sat down filled out uh an application ,control,50.0,3
and um I was drunk with power by then you_know because I had gotten the raise ,control,50.0,3
things were moving so quickly ,control,20.0,2
so  I filled out the application ,control,57.14285714285714,2
the interview with the personnel uh manager went very well ,control,30.0,4
she told me about three different types of positions I could have ,control,50.0,3
and uh visited all three of them ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and I could pick whichever one I wanted ,control,50.0,3
so  I picked the one in the international department ,control,50.0,4
that sounded really interesting to me ,control,50.0,3
and was working for an executive there ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and um it was just a wonderful environment ,control,37.5,2
and I was in the Latin_American division ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and  Chile ,control,10.0,4
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when uh there was the coup_d'etat in Chile when Salvador_Allende was ,control,59.09090909090909,7
and we had lots of money ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh we  we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin_American area ,control,38.095238095238095,6
so  those were  those were some pretty exciting times ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and I then I was there for a few years ,control,50.0,3
and uh my direct boss who was the  he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office ,control,50.0,5
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor ,control,33.33333333333333,8
so  of_course you_know how romance always wins out ,control,33.33333333333333,0
I had a boyfriend ,control,50.0,2
I didn't wanna move to Paris ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and many people probably would have said Paris you_know ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and like it would have been ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I look back ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didn't work out either ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but that's okay ,control,50.0,1
so  I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a_little more fast moving and exciting ,control,44.44444444444444,6
I  I figured ts this is a good you_know juncture to get out_of banking ,control,46.66666666666666,4
it seemed very staid no matter where you were ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  I  I  I got a  an agent ,control,50.0,2
I had you_know kind_of felt my way around you_know how things work down on the street by then ,control,38.88888888888889,5
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms ,control,40.0,4
so  to fast forward ,control,20.0,0
hope that wasn't too long a story ,control,37.5,3
laughs then I  I  I  I had my daughter ,control,41.66666666666667,3
I was a stay_at_home mom ,control,60.0,2
and the college thing was always on my mind ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  I applied to Montclair_State ,control,50.0,2
and  and I was accepted ,control,33.33333333333333,2
uh I came in at the time was a second career program ,control,50.0,3
and uh the important thing was that I did it ,control,50.0,2
I got my degree ,control,50.0,2
and I graduated summa_cum_laude ,control,25.0,1
and I had marvelous experiences ,control,20.0,2
and plus I was a day student ,control,42.85714285714285,2
um and that was another thing for me ,control,62.5,3
I realized that I could still kind_of live the life I might have ,control,53.84615384615385,4
when I mention a day student it's because I was a young  uh always among young mainstream students ,control,50.0,5
and I thought ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 gee  maybe I'll be sort_of ostracized from main society here ,control,30.76923076923077,3
but I wasn't ,control,50.0,1
and they liked me ,control,50.0,1
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience ,control,60.0,3
so  I got the degree anyway ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and here I am ,control,50.0,1
yeah ,control,0.0,0
you're welcome ,control,66.66666666666666,1

disastro ,control,0.0,0
the boy is outside having fun you_know kicking around the soccer ball ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and crash ,control,0.0,1
it goes right through the window ,control,50.0,3
looks like his father ,control,50.0,3
knocks the lamp over too I see ,control,42.85714285714285,3
the father was happen  happened to be sitting in the chair ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and uh he gets up ,control,40.0,1
and uh he's got the ball in his hand ,control,50.0,3
he looks out the window ,control,60.0,2
and um seems like the boy is going to have um a bad evening ,control,28.57142857142857,4
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that ,control,55.55555555555556,4
funny he was just sitting there ,control,33.33333333333333,1
you don't even see a newspaper or something you_know ,control,40.0,2
he was just sitting there like waiting for disaster to strike laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,4
well  we have what looks to be a mother and her child ,control,38.46153846153847,5
it's funny ,control,66.66666666666666,1
my first impression is a girl  a little girl ,control,40.0,3
but in other pictures I don't know ,control,37.5,3
I think it's a little boy ,control,57.14285714285714,3
maybe it's sposta be ger generic ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella ,control,36.36363636363637,3
child says no ,control,33.33333333333333,1
you_know  that  that whole idea is rejected ,control,33.33333333333333,2
mother offers the umbrella again ,control,20.0,2
 no bye ,control,0.0,0
uhoh  outside started to rain ,control,0.0,3
now it's pouring ,control,50.0,1
child comes in soaked ,control,0.0,1
the mother is standing there with that you_know I_told_you_soqadj attitude and  and kind_of annoyed  I guess ,control,27.77777777777778,4
but that's what mothers do you_know ,control,42.85714285714285,2
y y you wanna protect your child ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and the child  they don't like the idea ,control,40.0,2
they think you're mean and difficult ,control,42.85714285714285,3
you just don't want your child to fall down and skin their knee ,control,35.714285714285715,4
you don't want them to get wet ,control,37.5,2
you don't want anything to happen to this child ,control,50.0,4
I know that's how I was laughs ,control,75.0,3
and so now it's another rainy day ,control,37.5,2
or later  maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella ,control,37.5,4
learned a lesson ,control,33.33333333333333,2
listen to the mother ,control,50.0,3
and you_know so maybe a lesson learned for the future ,control,30.0,3
that maybe mommy you_know isn't that bad after all ,control,20.0,2
trying to protect me ,control,25.0,2
well  we have a cat uh emergency here ,control,22.22222222222222,2
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like ,control,60.0,3
and I guess the  father or maybe some  well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder ,control,28.57142857142857,4
got up in the tree ,control,60.0,3
he's stuck up there too now ,control,28.57142857142857,2
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to  get the cat ,control,35.0,4
and now I see the fire department is on the scene ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and they're going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after ,control,35.294117647058826,3
well  for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a  being a maid working for this family ,control,50.0,7
and it was a mother and her two uh daughters ,control,40.0,3
they were  just very shrill and very unattractive young women ,control,18.181818181818183,5
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and uh just  just very nice ,control,7.142857142857142,3
these two were  were very spoiled and  and didn't have any appreciation for anything ,control,41.17647058823529,4
I_mean  Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard you_know animals loved her ,control,23.07692307692308,4
the horse the  whoever was out there ,control,50.0,4
mice even laughs you_know ,control,0.0,1
she was a delight ,control,75.0,2
anyway  um there's a  a  an  an announcement comes to the uh unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their  their  their mcmansion I guess  where they live ,control,41.66666666666667,6
they weren't in a castle ,control,66.66666666666666,3
uh they got an invitation to  to a ball ,control,50.0,3
the prince was going to give a ball ,control,37.5,3
and Cinderella useta  she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and so when news came of this ball uh she was also silently very excited about it ,control,41.17647058823529,4
but the two girls you_know of_course they were going ,control,33.33333333333333,3
they had an invitation ,control,50.0,2
uh and somehow  I forget some of the details in between ,control,50.0,4
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up you_know helping working some magic ,control,35.714285714285715,6
and Cinderella does go to the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh like a pumpkin that  that  that  what was  that gets turned into a  a  a carriage and with horses ,control,53.84615384615385,7
and she's got a beautiful gown on ,control,50.0,2
and she just looks  really just beautiful ,control,12.5,2
and she  uh the prince of_course you_know um sees her right away ,control,23.07692307692308,3
and uh you_know one of those across the crowded room ,control,40.0,6
and they danced all night ,control,40.0,2
and it was very romantic ,control,40.0,2
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the  that  or whoever or that  they were ,control,50.0,8
was that the stepsisters or was that another story laughs ,control,60.0,4
the wicked stepsisters  I don't know ,control,37.5,2
anyhow um those horrible faces like grimaces laughs ,control,25.0,3
so  anyway  the  the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight ,control,41.17647058823529,4
and you see the  the  the clock is  is striking twelve ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and she's saying goodbye to the prince ,control,50.0,3
and of_course he doesn't wanna let her to leave ,control,30.0,3
and she's late ,control,50.0,1
she's running down this  you_know a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe ,control,43.75,3
one of her glass slippers ,control,40.0,3
and uh the uh butler or whoever  majordomo from the  the palace was sent around you_know to the town to find who fits into the shoe ,control,39.285714285714285,5
and uh Cinderella gets locked up ,control,33.33333333333333,1
you_know  the mother the  that horrible mother thought that you_know they'd cram the shoe on one of her daughters' feet laughs ,control,40.0,7
and I remember their feet were ugly too laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and uh the mice end up getting ,control,28.57142857142857,2
oh she was locked in this room you_know ,control,50.0,3
they didn't want her on the scene ,control,62.5,3
and um the mice brought her the key ,control,37.5,2
she got out and um tried on the shoe ,control,44.44444444444444,4
of_course  it fit perfectly ,control,20.0,2
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after ,control,30.0,3
one hopes ,control,50.0,1
and I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at the wedding those  those  horrible people laughs ,control,44.44444444444444,5
okay ,control,0.0,0
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here ,control,27.27272727272727,4
otherwise it's an open face ,control,50.0,2
they don't call it a sandwich right laughs ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  be nice ,control,25.0,1
we'll  we're pretend we have two pieces of bread ,control,50.0,0
and uh I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread ,control,50.0,9
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread ,control,53.333333333333336,7
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both ,control,58.333333333333336,2
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly ,control,40.0,4
and just gently spread that on ,control,33.33333333333333,1
close it up maybe cut it in half ,control,50.0,3
because I love sæmɪdʒɪzu ,control,50.0,1
but I don't like a bite of the crust first ,control,45.45454545454545,4
on a peanut butter it's ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  that's why I ,control,66.66666666666666,2
yeah  and I like to cut it like on the diagonal ,control,41.66666666666667,0
hasta be a particular way  you_know ,control,28.57142857142857,2
