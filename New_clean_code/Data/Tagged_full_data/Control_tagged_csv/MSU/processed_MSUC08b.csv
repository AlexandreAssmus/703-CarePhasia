 the  sighs the most  the most memorable event was ,control,33.33333333333333,3
it  but I think I did tell you about it ,control,63.63636363636363,3
the  the yeah ,control,50.0,0
it was about the  the possible scare ,control,62.5,3
it was just a lump in  in my breast ,control,60.0,4
and that  w I'm  I'm pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of  of our son to think about ,control,56.25,10
and I didn't think because of my age or the  the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything um more than precaution to do the  um the procedure ,control,47.22222222222222,10
click but as close as I came was uh you_know the  the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and  g and caring ,control,26.923076923076923,6
and I  I felt supported the whole  the whole time ,control,41.66666666666667,3
just that um I  I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasn't sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so  um the uh dressings and bandage were so tight ,control,50.0,7
but I just remember thinking um the  s the they'll be  I'll do whatever I hafta do on it ,control,52.17391304347826,5
and whatever's next I'll find out about and take care of ,control,53.84615384615385,3
so  it's a moving progression ,control,57.14285714285714,2
I don't usually write the end of a story um if it's something like that ,control,64.70588235294117,4
if you tell me I'll say ,control,71.42857142857143,2
 oh  we'll go through it step by step ,control,45.45454545454545,3
 and we'll get there ,control,33.33333333333333,1
it was like that ,control,100.0,2
so  I'm fortunate that it hasn't been anything worse than that ,control,71.42857142857143,6
just  f I can only remember being busy because with  uh with uh a toddler ,control,41.17647058823529,6
he was a year old then ,control,50.0,3
and  uh and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another ,control,25.0,0
it was nothing short of click uh show up for a doctor's appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done ,control,41.66666666666667,7
so  I didn't think about ,control,57.14285714285714,1
uh I knew I had  it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright ,control,55.55555555555556,4
so  it wasn't much to do except you_know just take care of  of the healing part uh and cooperate ,control,31.818181818181817,6
but uh I was sure everything was going to be alright ,control,45.45454545454545,4
something important ,control,50.0,1
well I think   I think oddly enough uh fi of  of meeting and  and continuing a  a life with Joe ,control,29.166666666666668,1
it was um I'm sure the most important th thing that ever happened ,control,50.0,3
um the most memorable day was the day our son was born ,control,41.66666666666667,4
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how  how interesting that all was ,control,47.368421052631575,8
we were students at Montclair_State ,control,60.0,3
and in those days  freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and  in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus ,control,25.71428571428571,8
we hadta sing the  the alma_mater ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but w the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at  s at Life_Hall ,control,43.75,4
and he noticed the sign and said something about ,control,44.44444444444444,2
I think I had  part of it was covered ,control,50.0,4
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 are you a  a speech major ,control,50.0,3
I said ,control,50.0,1
 no English ,control,33.33333333333333,0
and I  I un unveiled the  the words English ,control,36.36363636363637,2
but he was a senior ,control,60.0,2
and I was a freshman ,control,60.0,2
and so I got to meet one of the  you_know the upperclassmen got his signature ,control,31.25,5
and then later um we just had  it was an easy conversation ,control,30.76923076923077,3
we just  we talked a_little ,control,33.33333333333333,2
he  laughs he continued um when I  whenever I saw him to say hi ,control,43.75,5
and I  uh people would tell me ,control,37.5,2
 he's a BMOC ,control,60.0,2
you_know  he's a  he was a  a vice president of student government ,control,50.0,5
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh_my_goodness ,control,0.0,1
but the more we hadta talk about ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I was a student leader in my high school ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and I thought when he  when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee laughs ,control,47.61904761904761,6
but it turned out that he we  he was interested ,control,63.63636363636363,4
so  our first date I think  was the ,control,50.0,3
it was something like the Kingston_Trio or something like that ,control,80.0,6
some folk group ,control,33.33333333333333,1
it was really nice ,control,50.0,2
they were on campus laughs ,control,60.0,3
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come clears,control,30.0,2
that was one of his duties ,control,66.66666666666666,4
but when I just s think of how all that unfolded just uh ,control,53.84615384615385,4
I knew I  I was gonna finish school ,control,40.0,3
and so we  we paced ourselves I guess  you_know to  to be logical about things ,control,38.88888888888889,5
get to know each other no surprises uh along the way ,control,36.36363636363637,4
because you have time with a person and you  you see them in all the seasons and all ,control,57.89473684210527,5
but I think when it finally came to  to getting married um I don't think there was a formal uh ,control,45.45454545454545,5
we  we  people ask us but this was f not even a formal proposal ,control,37.5,0
I think everyone around us assumed we would m marry ,control,70.0,4
click so  we did ,control,40.0,2
laughs and so I  I wasn't engaged ,control,33.33333333333333,3
you_know  I w we  I was pinned ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and someone said to me the next day ,control,50.0,2
 you_know you're  you're engaged to be engaged ,control,45.45454545454545,4
I said ,control,50.0,1
 no  I'm not ,control,50.0,3
and they said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  that's what that means ,control,50.0,2
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  I thought it meant sort_of going steady college style ,control,16.666666666666664,4
they said ,control,50.0,1
 no  you're engaged to be engaged ,control,44.44444444444444,3
I said ,control,50.0,1
 well  we have some time to go before ,control,20.0,3
I said ,control,50.0,1
 it means what it means to the individual couple too ,control,45.45454545454545,4
so  I tried to assert myself ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but I guess they might have been right ,control,62.5,2
but I don't  I don't care ,control,44.44444444444444,0
it didn't mean anything ,control,60.0,1
but that it  when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross I_mean that's  that's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married ,control,39.47368421052632,5
and all that happened at once ,control,50.0,3
it all converged ,control,66.66666666666666,2
it's alright that we've done this before ,control,77.77777777777779,2
okay laughs same story ,control,0.0,2
now um uh was it little Ned ,control,28.57142857142857,1
no  this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself ,control,50.0,5
and the trajectory is off ,control,40.0,2
it goes right through a window ,control,50.0,3
and we hear the crash ,control,40.0,2
and um the lamp has gone over ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and  and I'm assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody who's startled that this uh intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture ,control,47.22222222222222,8
and he says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard ,control,38.46153846153847,4
okay laughs ,control,0.0,1
it's still raining ,control,50.0,1
okay  in the first picture it's about to rain ,control,36.36363636363637,3
mom is telling little sweetie ,control,20.0,2
 take your umbrella with you because I think it's going to rain today ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and the little  little Sammy this time says ,control,22.22222222222222,3
 no no no no no I don't need it I'm a big kid ,control,37.5,1
and as he says goodbye his mom is just g offering it one more time ,control,33.33333333333333,4
he says ,control,50.0,1
 so_long ,control,0.0,0
see you later ,control,33.33333333333333,1
but as he steps out the door wouldn't you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and as he's  getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says ,control,31.25,4
 oh  drat ,control,0.0,2
and when he back  gets back home and looks at mom I think she's restraining the ,control,38.88888888888889,4
 I told you ,control,50.0,1
and he's looking a bit sheepish little Sammy ,control,33.33333333333333,4
but he's out in  in the last frame clears,control,45.45454545454545,4
but he's still going in the opposite direction here ,control,40.0,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
we're in a time warp you_know ,control,57.14285714285714,4
you guys have not moved forward from last  last week laughs ,control,25.0,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
groundhog day clears,control,0.0,2
no  this is cat up in a tree day ,control,60.0,3
click oh_my_goodness my_goodness ,control,0.0,1
uh this is little sweet Sue ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb ,control,45.45454545454545,7
the ladder that he must have taken to  to get to  um to the cat has fallen ,control,52.63157894736842,5
so  he's stranded ,control,60.0,1
and little Fido is barking and saying ,control,14.285714285714285,2
 what the heck are you doing up there ,control,44.44444444444444,2
but thankfully the  the firemen are on their way ,control,50.0,3
kindly neighbors must have called and said ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 help help help ,control,0.0,2
and so they're rushing along with the ladder ,control,44.44444444444444,3
they will rescue him shortly ,control,60.0,1
and uh I think they'll get dad down before they get the cat down ,control,53.333333333333336,4
I think that's the priority ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world ,control,50.0,5
it's all going to work out just fine ,control,44.44444444444444,3
alright  I think last time it was a combination as_well ,control,36.36363636363637,3
what  uh once upon a time there was a  a family uh where the  f there was a widow ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to uh a woman he had met ,control,53.333333333333336,7
but the woman had two daughters of her own ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after uh the woman and her daughter the  became the stepmother and the stepsisters and a joined the  f the um household of Cinderella and her dad ,control,38.46153846153847,3
I'm assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again ,control,61.11111111111112,6
and she must deal with the family  her new family ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and they're not very kind ,control,33.33333333333333,2
there's  uh they're um mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother ,control,42.85714285714285,6
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of  Cinderella at every option ,control,35.714285714285715,4
and so she did the serv uh chores and she was treated badly ,control,30.76923076923077,3
um simultaneously there is another father and a s and a  sib and a offspring a prince this time ,control,35.0,4
and the father is a king ,control,50.0,2
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and I assume that it's time for him to be married ,control,58.333333333333336,3
and so the prince  uh a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful  maidens who are available ,control,41.935483870967744,7
an invitation goes out to Cinderella's  stepmother  to the household ,control,38.46153846153847,5
and everyone is smiling ,control,50.0,1
and Cinderella I guess  assumes that she might be able to go ,control,38.46153846153847,5
but this is not going to happen ,control,28.57142857142857,2
um this  the  the book ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and I don't know what's going on with that little book yet ,control,50.0,4
but she I  maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house ,control,47.368421052631575,6
the little animals or  uh begin to help out ,control,20.0,2
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as  sh as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready ,control,39.39393939393939,7
and Cinderella uh now knows that with the help of her f godmother she will get to go ,control,38.88888888888889,6
there is a little admonition from  after she's dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably ,control,50.0,10
 be sure you're home by midnight ,control,37.5,5
and then it switches to the  ba to the ball ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and I  and the prince sees and falls in love with um at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty ,control,41.37931034482759,9
when he could see all that ,control,83.33333333333334,2
so  they dance and dance ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase ,control,41.66666666666667,5
I guess the the  the right hand man  the  the first secretary  first VP of the king is running after her to say ,control,40.74074074074074,6
 w wait a second ,control,20.0,2
 wait a second ,control,25.0,2
but she runs back to the  to  to home ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and uh then comes the search for who matches the slipper ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and it's he in your little booklet  the uh first vice president then who comes to the door ,control,45.0,5
and there's a funny little picture of somebody tripping laughs and a cushion ,control,35.714285714285715,6
but I don't remember any of that from my stories or my film memory ,control,53.333333333333336,4
but uh apparently there uh the key  there was a key there that still doesn't mean anything much to me ,control,36.36363636363637,4
they must have let him in ,control,83.33333333333334,1
um the  the match m is made when she tries on the slipper ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and so I  I suppose the  the fella ,control,40.0,0
 xxx we've got our girl ,control,42.85714285714285,2
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and I don't know why I thought it was th direct ,control,50.0,4
but he could afford to hire help to do that so  so the help took care of it ,control,36.84210526315789,4
anyway um uh it's a happy ending ,control,37.5,2
they  uh they get back together again ,control,25.0,0
and I'm sure it's um the prince and his sweet Cinderella and hap life is f happy from then on happily ever after ,control,36.0,7
 oh_my_goodness ,control,0.0,1
did you try it with the little wall ,control,62.5,3
and did we say there's only one piece of bread and we want  we think we want two ,control,35.0,4
we can do it either way ,control,66.66666666666666,2
we'll do a half one this time ,control,50.0,2
we'll use the  just the one piece of bread but we're going to make it the same way ,control,42.85714285714285,3
we're gonna lay all the ingredients out first because I'm analretentive ,control,57.14285714285714,3
we get everything out ,control,75.0,1
the knife  butter knife ,control,20.0,2
we open up the peanut butter first ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and we spread a  s a thinnish layer in the middle because we're gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges ,control,48.38709677419355,8
all four edges will have a slightly raised click um perimeter ,control,27.27272727272727,4
we're going to put ry red raspberry jelly ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh s open that cap up ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesn't cross over the walls so it doesn't hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your  your hand as you're enjoying ,control,47.5,8
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich ,control,33.33333333333333,4
if you like you can fold it over which was the way a_lot_of people in my neighborhood did it ,control,63.1578947368421,7
click but I think that's it ,control,57.14285714285714,2
that's how we'll do it ,control,85.71428571428571,2
