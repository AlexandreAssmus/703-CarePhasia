um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and my doctor had told me that I could just  do normal activities and nothing would happen ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and unfortunately um it did rupture ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and it burst ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and it was February ,control,50.0,1
and it was an ice storm ,control,50.0,2
and it was the middle of the night ,control,62.5,4
and it was very treacherous getting there ,control,28.57142857142857,3
but I  we did ,control,40.0,2
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic um operation ,control,50.0,3
and they couldn't do it that way so it was a fullon operation ,control,50.0,3
and I remember it was  I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time ,control,42.10526315789473,6
and eventually I just got back to my own  my old self ,control,30.76923076923077,4
um I don't remember too much about what I did to get better ,control,42.85714285714285,4
I do remember though that th I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk ,control,40.0,5
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown ,control,39.130434782608695,6
and it required crossing a very busy street ,control,25.0,4
and there was no traffic light ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I remember them being able to cross very easily ,control,30.0,5
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in  in either direction to inch my way through ,control,40.909090909090914,6
um but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to  to move ,control,32.142857142857146,6
and now I don't even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but gest,control,40.0,5
yes ,control,0.0,0
okay  thank_you ,control,0.0,1
yes my first experience was um back in the late nineteen nineties ,control,33.33333333333333,4
um I worked with uh a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges ,control,29.629629629629623,12
and the  the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they  had been ,control,44.0,6
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse ,control,50.0,8
so  that was my first experience was  t was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually uh substituted for words that could  that could not be understood ,control,40.625,7
and  um and the  the kids were great ,control,30.0,3
and they were  you_know they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do they would just start to cry ,control,47.82608695652174,5
and uh you'd hafta  you'd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just like I don't wanna do this ,control,43.58974358974359,8
and um now of_course fast forward to here um this has been an amazing experience working with both children and  and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate ,control,34.375,11
and what they're doing you_know to  to make themselves better ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and I'm  I've taken cues from the people w f with whom I'm working um what not to do and  and what to do ,control,41.37931034482759,6
and  and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps ,control,18.75,6
so ges,control,0.0,1
yes I'd like  it's something I love talking about ,control,58.333333333333336,1
um my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park clears,control,29.166666666666668,4
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year ,control,25.0,3
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in  in the south and then the midwest and ,control,41.66666666666667,6
and um even_though we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had ,control,44.0,4
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something ,control,61.53846153846154,2
and we were also very sad that it was finished ,control,50.0,2
uh but every time they build a new ball park w we'll be going ,control,40.0,4
so  um and  and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our Christmas cards  our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling ,control,48.64864864864865,6
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with um with the  the trip itself ,control,52.94117647058824,4
and the first one um it said ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home ,control,46.66666666666666,4
which  which was mine ,control,80.0,0

and um it  in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen ,control,50.0,0
we saw cities we never would have seen ,control,50.0,3
and we interfaced with people that we never would have you_know communicated with because they're very different when you leave the New_York area ,control,54.16666666666666,5

and he's kicking the ball in the air ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction ,control,36.36363636363637,3

and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down ,control,52.94117647058824,5

unfortunately the ladder falls ,control,25.0,2
he can't get down ,control,60.0,1
there's a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really can't get down ,control,55.55555555555556,7

and even_though they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family ,control,50.0,5

and she is kept down at heel even_though they are  wealthy and uh  snobby ,control,43.75,4
and an invitation comes to a ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3

and she's all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say ,control,35.714285714285715,5
 you're not going ,control,40.0,1
and they destroy the dress ,control,40.0,2
and she's devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball ,control,53.84615384615385,5
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears ,control,16.666666666666664,2

I really could ,control,66.66666666666666,1
um and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken ,control,56.00000000000001,4
and everything will turn back to the way it is ,control,60.0,5

and even_though the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it they eventually find that it fits Cinderella ,control,36.84210526315789,3
and they live happily every after ,control,33.33333333333333,2

I would find a knife ,control,60.0,2
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread ,control,42.10526315789473,6
and since there is only one piece of bread I would just  I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich ,control,41.66666666666667,4
