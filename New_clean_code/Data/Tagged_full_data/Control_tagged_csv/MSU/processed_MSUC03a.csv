hm  you mean in terms of how I felt or what happened ,control,46.15384615384615,6
uh I was  I was thrown off of a horse once which was was quite traumatic ,control,64.70588235294117,5
and uh the horse reared up and seemingly simultaneously kicked back ,control,18.181818181818183,2
and I was thrown in the air and tumbled uh pretty much head over heels in front of the horse ,control,40.0,9
and I was out with a group of horses uh riding along a beach ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and the  the rest of them were behind me and just went galloping over me ,control,56.25,4
and um it  it was  that was really scary ,control,45.45454545454545,0
I  I love horses ,control,40.0,2
I love all animals ,control,50.0,2
but I never went uh horseback riding again ,control,12.5,2
it was serious and I ended up with a serious back injury ,control,50.0,4
it didn't manifest right away which I found out in my travels through the uh osteopathic world that they oftentimes don't ,control,47.82608695652174,4
sometimes years can go by before you realize that there's been a disc injury or anything like that which is why most people don't connect it with an accident ,control,54.83870967741935,9
sometimes you_know great  a great deal of time could go by  years ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and suddenly they aren't saying ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  I remember I fell off that horse five years ago ,control,30.76923076923077,4
you_know  they're thinking what happened to me yesterday or last week laughs so ,control,33.33333333333333,4
but that was traumatic ,control,50.0,1
 noone trampled me but it  it ,control,37.5,2
yeah  and the  the terror of watching them you_know running over me laughs ,control,40.0,8
it was pretty bad ,control,50.0,2
yeah  yeah  no  it was very scary ,control,30.0,2
my back ,control,50.0,1
oh  yeah ,control,0.0,0
um when it first went out so to speak I uh um ended up seeing an orthopedic  surgeon ,control,31.57894736842105,3
uh didn't want surgery ,control,20.0,1
totally against it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
was lucky enough to find an osteopath who um ,control,33.33333333333333,4
he's not a chiropractor but they do manipulations ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and I've met people who have had surgery ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I'm doing way better than them ,control,50.0,3
I've had um about three rounds of physical therapy ,control,30.0,4
and I also um began doing weight work to strengthen my upper body ,control,15.384615384615383,4
there was a time where I could you_know be taking a gallon of milk or a half gallon of milk out_of the dairy case ,control,45.83333333333333,7
and it would go right to my fifth lumbar ,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  now my  my biceps and shoulders have been strengthened with regular weight work ,control,37.5,3
so  there are things you can do you_know ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I'm doing better than  many people ,control,33.33333333333333,3
the disc d was cracked ,control,40.0,2
so  uh but surgery never seems to be a solution ,control,27.27272727272727,0
 no ,control,0.0,0
 no ,control,0.0,0
I understand how to lift and bend ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and I just strengthened myself ,control,40.0,1
mhm ,control,0.0,0
not really ,control,0.0,1
I_mean from time to time in our day to day you'll encounter people um but never you_know a  for a sustained period of time or did I ever work with any person like that ,control,47.22222222222222,5
oh yes ,control,0.0,1
no  it usually goes pretty well ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 a combination of um demonstrating and signs you_know showing them something and what little what few words I do know ,control,38.095238095238095,5
well  um maybe more than a few words in some languages ,control,33.33333333333333,0
and they tend to know a little bit of English ,control,30.0,4
um I remember I was  I was in Frankfurt once by myself and I ended up going to uh a pub ,control,54.54545454545454,4
I don't think they called them that in Germany laughs ,control,54.54545454545454,3
but anyway uh I had a wonderful time talking to people ,control,27.27272727272727,4
I don't speak German ,control,40.0,1
and a_lot_of Germans do have some you_know language recognition in terms of English ,control,30.76923076923077,4
but I tend to get along  okay ,control,25.0,3
there are way  other ways than words to communicate ,control,20.0,4
and it's fun ,control,50.0,1
um when my daughter was born laughs ,control,42.85714285714285,3
favorite day of my life well the worst and the best ,control,36.36363636363637,3
um I had  I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell ,control,35.714285714285715,5
and it was just  it had no  like you_know that old song what a difference a day makes laughs ,control,38.095238095238095,4
I_mean laughs from the pregnancy which was just wonderful ,control,44.44444444444444,5
I ate everything I wanted ,control,60.0,3
I felt terrific ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I was working full time ,control,40.0,2
uh my freezer looked like an Oreida convention ,control,37.5,3
I could eat my  you_know my crinkle cuts my shoe strings with pasta ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I could do anything ,control,75.0,1
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say ,control,53.333333333333336,6
laughs my  my  my obstetrician you_know during the  the buildup to this would say you'll be sorry laughs ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and I said you_know I cannot imagine regretting this ,control,40.0,3
you_know  I'm eating  I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the  the  the  the ,control,45.0,6
it's two pieces of pound cake you_know with the Hagen_Dazs in  in the middle ,control,50.0,5
so  then I get to the hospital ,control,50.0,3
and um it was really nasty laughs ,control,28.57142857142857,3
it was really  it was probably the worst experience I ever had ,control,46.15384615384615,4
um I was told that if I had um um automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward laughs ,control,45.83333333333333,5
that's what I was told laughs ,control,71.42857142857143,2
and um I did  um it did spark um revenge in me that I actually carried out ,control,44.44444444444444,4
you_know  um my  my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook ,control,42.10526315789473,6
he said ,control,50.0,1
 well  we're just going to break your water ,control,27.27272727272727,3
 it'll move things along ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I said ,control,50.0,1
 no laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,0
 don't ,control,33.33333333333333,0
 step back laughs ,control,0.0,2
 step back ,control,0.0,1
 just leave me alone ,control,20.0,1
 I can do this myself you_know ,control,57.14285714285714,1
and then um he kept saying ,control,16.666666666666664,1
 relax ,control,0.0,1
 I don't understand while you're not relaxed ,control,50.0,2
and this is psychological I'm sure ,control,57.14285714285714,2
every time he said relax I became even more infuriated ,control,30.0,5
you_know  this is the effect it had on me ,control,60.0,3
and he wasn't listening when I said stop saying that ,control,45.45454545454545,3
when you tell some one to stop doing X you expect them to stop doing that ,control,37.5,4
so  anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful ,control,30.0,4
she was born smiling right away recognized my voice ,control,33.33333333333333,3
it was just the  n the most special experience of my whole life ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and um so now I went for my first postpartum checkup ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and I'm sitting on the table ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and he you_know does the finger pricks and  to get some blood out ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and he turns around ,control,50.0,1
and he puts the little tube in the machine ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and then he turns it on ,control,50.0,1
and the machine is whirring ,control,40.0,2
and I s quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock ,control,50.0,4
it happened really fast ,control,25.0,2
and I threw him on to the table ,control,62.5,3
and then I jumped on top of him put my knee in his groin ,control,50.0,4
and I was r ,control,50.0,1
his glasses were askew ,control,50.0,2
and he  hi his tie was crooked ,control,37.5,0
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 relax ,control,0.0,1
 relax ,control,0.0,1
 I don't understand why you're not relaxed ,control,50.0,2
 what's the matter you_know laughs ,control,42.85714285714285,4
it was such a calamity ,control,80.0,2
and  laughs although you_know it was all in good fun because later on you_know he ,control,37.5,4
and his wife useta work in his office ,control,37.5,4
and they had a nurse too ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives laughs ,control,45.83333333333333,5
 it's really selfish on I  on our part ,control,54.54545454545454,3
laughs  so that was it ,control,66.66666666666666,2
that's it Keli ,control,75.0,1
that was a big big experience you_know Pee_Wee's big adventure laughs ,control,25.0,4
well  it seems there's a boy out playing ,control,40.0,3
kicks the soccer ball ,control,25.0,2
unfortunately it goes right into the window breaks it ,control,44.44444444444444,3
I'm gonna guess that's his father sitting there ,control,45.45454545454545,5
now he gets the ball ,control,40.0,2
and he's looking at the  surveying the damage and his son  I guess ,control,43.75,4
and um it doesn't  doesn't look like it's going to end too  too well laughs ,control,30.0,3
might be a problem ,control,75.0,2
okay  well  here's this little child I guess  leaving for school ,control,26.666666666666668,3
mother saying ,control,0.0,1
 take your umbrella ,control,25.0,2
child says ,control,0.0,1
 no no I don't need an umbrella ,control,33.33333333333333,2
very optimistic ,control,0.0,1
I do the same thing ,control,40.0,2
now it's raining ,control,50.0,1
and now it's pouring ,control,40.0,1
and then the child comes home you_know obviously soaking wet ,control,10.0,2
the mother is kind_of in her I_told_you_soqadj mode ,control,50.0,4
and the little  the little boy I guess it is  he learned a lesson ,control,43.75,3
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella ,control,54.54545454545454,4
life is learning from one's mistakes laughs ,control,37.5,4
listen to your mother ,control,50.0,3
well  the cat's up in the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,0
they get stuck in trees  I guess ,control,50.0,3
I've  I've heard stories like that ,control,66.66666666666666,4
I guess it's the  um the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like she's ready to catch the cat ,control,40.625,11
the little dog of_course wants the cat down for different reasons ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and then the fire department shows up ,control,28.57142857142857,2
which  they're good like that ,control,71.42857142857143,3
they got the ladder ,control,50.0,2
and all is well ,control,50.0,1
so  Cinderella is sent to live with this  uh with a family ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and she is basically a  uh a maid ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and um they  there are the two  um stepsis the two ,control,30.76923076923077,3
I think it's the wicked stepsisters  if I recall ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and they were  they were rather homely laughs ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and uh Cinderella of_course was very pretty ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and she's very you_know sweet and helpful ,control,25.0,3
and these two are kind_of spoiled and you_know not very pleasant ,control,18.181818181818183,3
and there's going to be uh uh a ball ,control,30.0,3
and I  I believe invitations go out ,control,25.0,2
and the two sisters are going to  um uh they're going to go to the ball ,control,38.88888888888889,5
and Cinderella is not invited ,control,20.0,1
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and Cinderella ends up with uh ,control,33.33333333333333,1
well  it's all magical you_know right ,control,37.5,1
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and by dint of you_know luck and good favor from the uh fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball ,control,35.0,6
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight ,control,57.14285714285714,5
so  she's dancing with the prince having a wonderful time ,control,50.0,3
the other two sisters I  I forgot where ,control,44.44444444444444,3
they just kind_of melted into the background ,control,42.85714285714285,3
they weren't very popular laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I could have told you that from the beginning you_know ,control,70.0,3
but anyhow um Cinderella finds out what time it is ,control,40.0,3
and she needs to leave you_know uh to get into the  the  the carriage to go back before midnight ,control,28.57142857142857,7
and she  um her slipper fill ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and the prince finds it ,control,40.0,2
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that you_know he wants to find this  uh this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper ,control,40.0,10
uh I remember the details now from my own picture book ,control,36.36363636363637,4
put it on ,control,66.66666666666666,1
when  when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet ,control,43.75,5
and the slipper was like even half  not even half the size of her foot ,control,37.5,5
so  anyway they locked Cinderella up ,control,42.85714285714285,0
I think nobody wanted them to find her ,control,50.0,3
and the mice helped ,control,25.0,2
they brought the key ,control,50.0,2
and the mice  she  you_know the animals loved her ,control,36.36363636363637,0
they were her friends ,control,75.0,2
and of_course it all ends happily ever after ,control,37.5,2
she does  it does  it is discovered that the slipper fits her ,control,50.0,4
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince ,control,40.0,4
just the way we all live ,control,50.0,2
it's exactly what my experience has been laughs ,control,66.66666666666666,3
it's the same thing ,control,60.0,2
it's like they  it's like they met me ,control,81.81818181818183,3
and they  reali you_know they  they  it was the  s you_know really it was like they knew me ,control,50.0,2
it's so uncanny ,control,50.0,2
alright  well  first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture ,control,42.10526315789473,0
um now when I make a sandwich ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and it's not just with peanut butter and jelly ,control,30.0,3
I  I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up you_know ,control,45.45454545454545,4
it's got to be just right ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter ,control,40.0,0
again two slices of bread is nice but for this we'll put the peanut butter on first uh with a knife ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around ,control,52.63157894736842,4
and it  it just works better than with the knife ,control,45.45454545454545,0
and that's it ,control,75.0,1
you_know  in this case you could cut it in half fold it in half get another piece ,control,50.0,3
you_know  if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle you_know like that ,control,52.0,3
and that's it ,control,75.0,1
I like a good sæmɪdʒu ,control,40.0,2
