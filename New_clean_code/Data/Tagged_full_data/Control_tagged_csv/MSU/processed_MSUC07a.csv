um I remember uh hurting my back about five or six years ago ,control,15.384615384615383,5
and I really didn't do anything to hurt my back ,control,36.36363636363637,4
I just kind_of moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and it was weeks of uh going to the doctor going  finally just having physical therapy to  to fix it ,control,31.818181818181817,6
but it all worked out ,control,60.0,2
yeah ,control,0.0,0
it was a_lot_of exercises ,control,50.0,1
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and um they had me lift weights and do uh different exercises stretching  mostly stretching my back ,control,22.22222222222222,5
and they used some kind of electronic uh like  stimulation therapy ,control,33.33333333333333,4

you_know  I've know people who have had strokes and ,control,36.36363636363637,3
uh I think a_lot_of it was sort_of just waiting them out ,control,45.45454545454545,3
sometimes they just couldn't get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign  uh sort_of a sign language where they kind_of point to what they're looking for or what they need ,control,43.90243902439025,7
uh that was mostly ,control,50.0,1
 kinda what did it ,control,40.0,2
I guess I'll tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace ,control,61.53846153846154,5
um it was a long  haul ,control,42.85714285714285,3
it was a_lot  you_know a_lot_of discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it ,control,40.0,4
and we  probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and uh w at one point I would be kind_of more wanting to do it ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and Eileen would be busy ,control,60.0,1
her parents were ill ,control,50.0,2
and we were trying to take care of them ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and then it would swap ,control,40.0,1
I was busy at work ,control,60.0,3
and she was more interested in talking about it ,control,55.55555555555556,5
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind_of we were on the same page at the same time ,control,39.130434782608695,4
and um we made this decision kin to  to  that we should look  possibly look at foster care ,control,38.095238095238095,6
and we looked into it closely ,control,50.0,2
and it just wasn't going to work right for us ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and then we decided to  to adopt ,control,12.5,2
and um we  identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family ,control,29.411764705882355,5
and we um looked into all of her medical records and things ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and um then we traveled to China ,control,28.57142857142857,2
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that ,control,38.88888888888889,10
and then we  mov then we went to China ,control,30.0,2
and actually the adoption occurred there in China ,control,25.0,2
uh and we have an older daughter who came with us also ,control,41.66666666666667,4

the girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and the cat ran up the tree ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she went in to get her father to help her ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air ,control,37.03703703703704,6
and uh the  while  once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too ,control,47.05882352941176,4
so  they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out_of the tree ,control,36.36363636363637,8

and her mother died ,control,25.0,2
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own ,control,46.66666666666666,7
and the new mother the stepmother didn't really care for Cinderella that much ,control,35.714285714285715,3
she was more concerned about her two daughters ,control,50.0,4
and then as they grew up the  the  she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her ,control,41.37931034482759,5
and uh one day there was a  an invitation to a  uh a big ball to meet the prince because the prince was looking for a wife ,control,41.37931034482759,9
and uh his father was having a big party  a big ball to  so he could meet all the eligible women in the  in the  kingdom ,control,46.66666666666666,6
so  she wanted to go to the  the ball ,control,45.45454545454545,4
but she was too busy ,control,40.0,2
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for  everybody else uh because they all hadta have their clothes made  cleaned and ready to go ,control,40.0,7
so  she  in  she started to get everybody's  everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball ,control,33.33333333333333,7
and in the meantime her friends the  the  mi the mice put  sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball ,control,50.0,5
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh but the sisters found out ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they tore up her dress ,control,50.0,2
and she was  uh she thought she'd never get to the ball ,control,50.0,5
uh and then she met her  s her fairy godmother ,control,27.27272727272727,3
she went out in the yard and was crying ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and the fairy godmother came ,control,20.0,2
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the  the mice into horseses ,control,38.88888888888889,3
but told her that she needed to be home by  mid leave by twelve o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point ,control,44.82758620689656,7
so  she went off to the ball ,control,62.5,3
and she met the prince ,control,40.0,2
and they fell in love ,control,40.0,2
and all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight ,control,22.22222222222222,3
so  she uh hadta run out ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she ran down the steps of the  the castle ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and left the prince ,control,25.0,2
and she lost her shoe on the way ,control,50.0,3
so  the prince thought he would never see his  this girl again ,control,42.85714285714285,4
