 click the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast  my right breast ,control,54.16666666666666,8
and  our son Joseph had just been born uh a year ago  a year before the  di the diagnosis or the concern anyway ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and so uh I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him ,control,45.83333333333333,6
but there was surgery required ,control,20.0,2
and there was a waiting period ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on  not on me so_that I could get back to um taking care of him ,control,42.85714285714285,4
as it turned out everything was fine ,control,71.42857142857143,2
the lump was removed ,control,50.0,2
it was benign ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and everything was alright ,control,50.0,1
so  but it was a scare for awhile ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and uh important that I kept the priorities that I thought was  were important ,control,46.66666666666666,5
there was very little recovery ,control,20.0,3
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasn't too sure whether they had removed the breast or not laughs when I first woke up from um the anesthesia ,control,43.333333333333336,7
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright ,control,47.82608695652174,7
and I was so busy ,control,40.0,2
I don't recall anything special laughs other_than  a dressing and uh  keeping up with whatever medications  o whatever they told me to do ,control,40.74074074074074,6
but I  di nothing was  in was bothering me after it was o over ,control,56.25,3
yeah ,control,0.0,0
mhm ,control,0.0,0
um I useta teach English as a second language ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation  exercises that we did ,control,42.10526315789473,5
I always uh tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew ,control,35.714285714285715,5
but uh yeah there's difficulty when someone is not fluent in  uh in your language ,control,41.17647058823529,4
um click sigh sometimes with elderly ,control,16.666666666666664,2
click I um took care of my mom and my dad uh as they were really in advanced years ,control,42.10526315789473,5
l nineties ,control,0.0,1
and uh sometimes my father would go back to Italian ,control,30.0,3
um it was a place of comfort I think  especially as he was uh maybe dying ,control,47.05882352941176,3
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow ,control,20.0,4
all I  real but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking ,control,39.130434782608695,7
but click it was uh memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another ,control,47.05882352941176,6
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too ,control,16.666666666666664,5
but I was very interested in where he was going with  uh with the Italian at the end ,control,57.89473684210527,5
 with my mom she was more  more grounded ,control,40.0,3
sometime it was hearing  it was her hearing problem ,control,50.0,2
was a_lot_of shouting laughs going on ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  it's  sometimes for me it's that ,control,72.72727272727273,2
it's like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive ,control,21.052631578947366,7

uh he didn't know that at the time but that's what marriage reveals over time laughs ,control,50.0,4
she had t two  s two daughters ,control,25.0,3
and so his stepdaughters um were part of the household that  clicks Cinderella and her father had enjoyed ,control,36.84210526315789,8
clicks but things changed once they all arrived together ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude ,control,50.0,5
um the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her  in every way ,control,42.85714285714285,3
she performed servile  tasks ,control,20.0,2
um clicks at one point an invitation comes to a ball ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and uh they're considering uh happily going ,control,25.0,2
Cinderella's face is lighting up ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but she doesn't realize uh what's going on ,control,50.0,2
the ball was held because the  uh the King decided that his son  it was time for the son to marry ,control,47.82608695652174,5
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of  the town ,control,50.0,7
well  Cinderella would love to go ,control,14.285714285714285,3
and uh it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and  uh the stepmother and the  s and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves ,control,41.66666666666667,6
so  they prepared  uh had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy ,control,38.88888888888889,6
but sh she was  there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family ,control,47.368421052631575,8

fairy godmother helps her ,control,25.0,2
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too ,control,30.0,3
and as  um as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball um I'm going to just remember that she uh dances with the handsome prince ,control,46.66666666666666,7
and at  s as she runs back  um tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair ,control,31.818181818181817,4
I didn't see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though ,control,50.0,5
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight ,control,20.0,3
but she hadta get out_of there by midnight ,control,25.0,2

lay the bread down ,control,50.0,2
get a nice  butter knife ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and I begin with  spreading a  s a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the  e the well around all four sides so_that when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesn't actually go over the side ,control,41.50943396226416,11
it just stays within the  the borders ,control,50.0,3
click um click I useta like mine folded over laughs ,control,40.0,4
