oh that's right ,control,50.0,1
I  uh injury  I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant ,control,32.0,3
I was going to a store to get some  an ice cream ,control,46.15384615384615,3
I was really hungry ,control,50.0,2
I had just worked really hard that morning ,control,37.5,2
and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying ,control,61.53846153846154,3
 if they sell cheeseburgers I'm getting one ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and immediately a big uh ball popped out_of my wrist ,control,20.0,3
and I couldn't move my fingers ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and it was  uh it was  it was interesting mainly in my  c my  um in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything ,control,50.0,7
but of_course I couldn't work either ,control,28.57142857142857,1
um but it presented a challenge ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I learned how to do things lefthanded ,control,28.57142857142857,3
I hadta write lefthanded ,control,25.0,2
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars ,control,21.428571428571427,4
and that was in  um I think it was in May ,control,58.333333333333336,4
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in Columbia_Presbyterian with him with the cast on ,control,56.00000000000001,4
we have these pictures ,control,50.0,2
and I remember he had like a little um kind_of like a scrape on the back of his head or just  not  not a  like a bloody thing but a  w a  kind_of like a wornout spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast ,control,46.15384615384615,11
um I don't actually remember doing physical therapy ,control,22.22222222222222,3
once I had the cast off I think I was fine ,control,63.63636363636363,2
and I regained all the strength in my wrist ,control,55.55555555555556,3
I think six weeks ,control,25.0,2
yes it was my dominant hand ,control,50.0,2
yes I do ,control,33.33333333333333,1
you_know  my cousin Ann um she's seventy one now ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six ,control,50.0,3
and so she's lefthanded ,control,40.0,1
and so she lost the use of her right side ,control,40.0,4
her hand is all mangled and her foot also ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and her communication skills are very limited ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she  it's aphasia is what I think she has ,control,63.63636363636363,0
and uh she's gotten progressively better over the years ,control,40.0,3
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again ,control,33.33333333333333,4
she useta always say ,control,25.0,2
 zoom zoom zoom zoom ,control,0.0,3
and uh I always thought because she was in a car  she was sitting in a  p her parked car when she had the stroke ,control,51.85185185185185,5
and um she doesn't say that anymore ,control,37.5,1
but a_lot of the people where she lives that's her nickname Zoom_zoom because she useta say that a_lot ,control,52.63157894736842,5
but she's very challenging to communicate with ,control,37.5,3
um and I'll go see her and spend and hour or so ,control,23.07692307692308,4
and we have lunch ,control,25.0,1
and um things and we try to communicate as well  as best as we can with asking her simple questions ,control,28.57142857142857,1
and she communicates in sort_of a roundabout way ,control,37.5,2
she has three children ,control,25.0,2
and when she wants to talk about them she aw can't always get their names but she'll say one two or three ,control,37.5,4
and that's how we know because sometimes she brings a_lot_of numbers in ,control,53.84615384615385,2
so  when she tries to tell you she's in pain she'll t take her good hand ,control,52.63157894736842,6
and she'll say ,control,50.0,1
 one two three four five uf pain ,control,0.0,0
 I don't know ,control,40.0,1
 I don't know ,control,40.0,1
like that ,control,100.0,1
she  somehow it's amazing how she communicates ,control,55.55555555555556,0
I give her a_lot_of credit ,control,40.0,2
yeah ,control,0.0,0
okay  um I would like to tell you the story um about my grandfather ,control,40.0,5
because he was the  one of the most important people in my life when I was a child ,control,63.1578947368421,6
and I was  g it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten ,control,60.0,5
it was in July ,control,75.0,2
and um it was just a normal day ,control,37.5,2
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street ,control,53.84615384615385,5
and it was back in the day when there was a_lot_of freedom ,control,58.333333333333336,5
you  you went out the door and came in for lunch ,control,50.0,3
and then you went out the door ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and there really weren't very many parameters ,control,25.0,3
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had ,control,30.0,4
and um came home to find out that he had had a ,control,41.66666666666667,3
he  th they didn't use the word stroke but that's what he had ,control,50.0,0
um that he hadta go to the hospital from work ,control,50.0,3
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies ,control,34.61538461538461,6
and then the next morning I remember waking up ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like ,control,57.14285714285714,6
I have that feeling of what it felt like um to find out that you know he wasn't coming home and just as a child an innocent child um kind_of coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing ,control,39.58333333333333,14
having that be my first experience with death ,control,50.0,3
and um you_know I had  my four sisters were there and my cousin who um is in the nursing home ,control,38.095238095238095,6
she was around because she  she kind_of lived with us for awhile ,control,61.53846153846154,3
and it was just  she actually  I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard ,control,47.368421052631575,5
everyone went to the  all the adults went to the funeral at night ,control,57.14285714285714,4
I just remembered that ,control,50.0,1
and I was hysterical crying ,control,40.0,2
I was so so sad ,control,40.0,2
and she didn't know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me ,control,37.5,3
and it worked ,control,33.33333333333333,1
she wasn't being mean ,control,60.0,1
but I was beyond being consoled at that point ,control,66.66666666666666,5
and I  I felt very alone in my um grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather ,control,48.27586206896552,7
but anyway that  that  that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future ,control,52.17391304347826,9
and I remember a time when um I was in sixth grade ,control,50.0,5
and we were having a sleepover in my friend's back yard ,control,41.66666666666667,5
happened to be with a  w a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to leu leukemia a  g the other girl who lost her grandmother ,control,43.24324324324324,10
and I had lost my grandfather ,control,50.0,2
and we  it was like they  they could make a movie about the bond ,control,62.5,0
we were all in the tent ,control,83.33333333333334,3
and  and we were just talking ,control,28.57142857142857,2
I re can see us all sitting there ,control,50.0,2
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life ,control,50.0,7
and we put it out there ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and we all just  just let it out ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this ,control,43.75,4
and it's t a good thing ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  that's why I think this story is  is m so important to me was because it's something that affected my life you_know as I grew up ,control,64.51612903225806,6
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that um I didn't know about angels then ,control,43.75,3
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe ,control,44.44444444444444,7
and he can uh sort_of watch over me if you will ,control,63.63636363636363,2
yeah uh one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball kicking the ball ,control,25.0,5
and inadvertently it went through the window uh of his  his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper ,control,45.45454545454545,9
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp ,control,35.714285714285715,4
and he stood up and looked out the window ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window ,control,62.5,5
he um kind_of shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing ,control,38.88888888888889,5
and he was going to go speak to his son about that ,control,50.0,5
okay  well  i Johnny was on his way to school ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said ,control,38.46153846153847,3
 Johnny take your umbrella ,control,20.0,2
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 nope mom ,control,0.0,1
 I don't think it's going to rain today so I  I don't wanna take it ,control,45.0,5
so  off he went without his umbrella ,control,62.5,3
and sure enough it started to rain ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and it  it started to rain harder ,control,25.0,2
and he got wet ,control,25.0,1
so  he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said ,control,26.666666666666668,4
 you were right mom ,control,40.0,2
 I needed my umbrella ,control,40.0,2
then he took his umbrella and went off ,control,37.5,2
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of uh taking her advice next time ,control,37.5,6
it's always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though ,control,53.84615384615385,5
 okay um Sally and her dad were uh walking around the park one day ,control,26.666666666666668,3
Sally was riding her tricycle ,control,40.0,2
and um as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree ,control,50.0,4
and her dad  um she urged her dad to help the cat ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and um so uh he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree ,control,30.76923076923077,4
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over ,control,50.0,3
and um some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the uh fire department ,control,38.88888888888889,3
and sure enough the fire department came to uh help retrieve the dad from the tree  and the cat ,control,25.0,6
and at the end of the day every one was fine ,control,54.54545454545454,5
sighs once upon a time  in a land far away there was a uh little girl named Cinderella ,control,31.57894736842105,4
and she was brought to the home of a  a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her ,control,50.0,6
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters ,control,45.45454545454545,4
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the  the mom  her stepmom ,control,47.61904761904761,5
and they actually put her to work ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose ,control,45.45454545454545,6
um but Cinderella  was happy nonetheless ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends the mice and the  birds and such ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and um she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride ,control,46.42857142857143,9
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom ,control,54.54545454545454,6
and in her heart she thought ,control,50.0,3
 oh  I would just love to go to that ball ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and uh she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of_course she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella ,control,46.15384615384615,5
and uh but the stepsisters were going to go ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball ,control,31.25,7
and uh Cinderella was sad ,control,20.0,1
she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said ,control,42.85714285714285,6
 we'll help you Cinderella ,control,50.0,1
and they brought out some ribbon and some  some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and um she had the dress ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but she had no way of getting to the ball ,control,50.0,6
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared ,control,63.63636363636363,3
and it was her fairy godmother ,control,50.0,2
and her  fair my ,control,40.0,2
 don't cry my child ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 I know you wanna go to the ball ,control,44.44444444444444,4
 and  and I can help you ,control,37.5,1
 just fetch me a pumpkin ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 and I'll turn it into a coach ,control,55.55555555555556,3
 and your mice friends will be the coachmen ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the  the coachmen ,control,38.88888888888889,5
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world ,control,46.66666666666666,7
and when she got there she w approached the ball and looked down the stairs ,control,40.0,4
and there everyone was dancing ,control,40.0,1
and they saw her come in ,control,33.33333333333333,2
they turned and looked at her ,control,50.0,3
and sh the prince  looked ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and he thought she was the most am amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen ,control,43.75,4
he invited her to dance ,control,40.0,2
and they just had a nice connection ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she um engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and um suddenly the time had gone by ,control,25.0,2
and it was midnight ,control,50.0,1
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight ,control,56.25,3
so  quick she ran from the castle ,control,37.5,3
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and she found her way home ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and um clears,control,0.0,1
so  he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to uh find them ,control,46.66666666666666,3
and everyone tried on the slipper ,control,50.0,3
and when he came to the house of the  where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper ,control,44.44444444444444,9
and uh it didn't quite work ,control,28.57142857142857,1
but the  Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and the mice gave her the key ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she got out ,control,50.0,1
she came down ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and she said she'd like to try on the slipper ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and with that she tried on the slipper ,control,62.5,3
and her fairy god ,control,25.0,2
but as it was they  she tried on the slipper ,control,63.63636363636363,3
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted ,control,70.0,3
and they got married ,control,50.0,1
and they lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters laughs and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness ,control,52.38095238095239,8
yes  well  if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of glutenfree bread from the freezer ,control,39.285714285714285,4
put them on a paper towel on the counter ,control,55.55555555555556,5
I'd get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon ,control,43.75,3
and I'd open up the peanut butter ,control,50.0,2
and I'd  scoop out  some peanut butter spread it on the bread ,control,46.66666666666666,0
close the jar ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I'd use the spoon to get the jelly out_of the jar ,control,50.0,4
I'd put it on the other slice of bread ,control,60.0,4
clear,control,0.0,0
put the jar  the lid back on the jar ,control,40.0,4
I'd put the peanut butter and jelly back ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I'd put the lid ,control,60.0,2
and I probably would not cut it in half ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and I would take it to a table ,control,62.5,3
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,30.0,3
