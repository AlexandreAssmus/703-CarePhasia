yeah well the big one is my cancer uh Hodgkin's disease ,control,25.0,4
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven ,control,36.36363636363637,4
I had symptoms before then but didn't connect the dots ,control,36.36363636363637,3
I had night sweats ,control,25.0,2
I was tired and yuh just didn't think much of it ,control,41.66666666666667,4
but then I noticed that I was losing weight ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and that's what caused me to seek a doctor ,control,50.0,4
so  I went to ,control,60.0,1
I hadn't been to a doctor in years ,control,66.66666666666666,3
uh so  I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses ,control,40.0,4
she's now both  uh our physician for both of us ,control,66.66666666666666,5
she did uk an office exam and uh was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something uh the lymph nodes turned out ,control,43.333333333333336,6
so  I went for a sonogram ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan ,control,37.5,5
that led to the need for a biopsy ,control,62.5,5
so  b at that  by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong ,control,52.94117647058824,4
uh the decision was gonna be is it ,control,55.55555555555556,2
it  it was lymphoma ,control,60.0,0
but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non_Hodgkin's lymphoma ,control,23.07692307692308,4
so  I went to Mountainside hospital ih in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasn't enough  uh th not enough tissue was obtained ,control,37.03703703703704,7
so  I hadta go into the city  into New_York to Sloan for uh a more complete biopsy ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and that clinched it ,control,50.0,1
uh it was Hodgkin's lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two ,control,52.63157894736842,5
uh Hodgkins's is much more treatable at a higher success rate ,control,25.0,3
so  I started chemo ,control,40.0,1
and uh after the first session I developed a rash ,control,40.0,3
and we d weren't quite sure what was going on ,control,45.45454545454545,3
one of the nurses ,control,50.0,3
the  the oncologist wasn't sure ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment wuh for the  for the Hodgkin's ,control,47.05882352941176,6
but one of his nurses said ,control,33.33333333333333,4
 this is an allergic reaction ,control,50.0,2
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol ,control,50.0,4
I think I mentioned this last time ,control,42.85714285714285,3
um which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney ,control,25.0,5
it's actually a drug for gout ,control,57.14285714285714,3
but it has a protective effect uh for kidney  function ,control,27.27272727272727,5
that landed me in the hospital with  with what's called Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is treated like a burn ,control,60.0,5
it  ips people with Stevens_Johnson are often sent to burn units ,control,25.0,0
my mouth was inflamed ,control,50.0,2
I  I  it was just awful ,control,50.0,2
I couldn't drink water ,control,40.0,1
it  j it burned ,control,40.0,0
that of_course suspended chemo ,control,25.0,2
I  w we w worked through the laughs Stevens_Johnson ,control,40.0,0
I was looking forward to chemo ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it was  it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation ,control,56.25,6
uh so  um and I ended up having really a mild case ih ih from what I can gather ,control,35.0,0
but still I  I couldn't take solid food for  for t uh two weeks or so nor water ,control,23.809523809523807,3
it was  it was  the only thing that really worked was  was um uh iced tea ,control,42.10526315789473,4
um so  I got through the Stevens_Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months ,control,27.77777777777778,5
it ended  last May ,control,20.0,2
um had my Pet scan at that time which was clear ,control,45.45454545454545,3
oncologist waited another six months ,control,20.0,2
had another Pet scan ,control,25.0,2
that was clear ,control,66.66666666666666,1
uh and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed ,control,40.0,5
I don't know if you know about ports ,control,55.55555555555556,3
uh so  that sorta  that sorta clinched the  uh the idea that I'm you_know home free ,control,40.0,0
you_know  I hafta be monitored every six months ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um and chemo ih wasn't  it wasn't all that bad ,control,23.07692307692308,3
I_mean  Firstname got me through it if  as I said last week ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I ub broke down ,control,50.0,1
um she was just super uh in getting me through all of this ,control,61.53846153846154,6
and the chemo wasn't bad ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I  I really wasn't nauseous ,control,42.85714285714285,2
um my appetite started to come back ,control,14.285714285714285,2
in_fact  we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo ,control,57.14285714285714,4
we'd send out for lunch ,control,66.66666666666666,2
um so  the  it was  t it was tired ,control,50.0,0
I'd  I would get tired ,control,57.14285714285714,2
um but I had chemo every two weeks ,control,37.5,2
and uh my hair came back ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and  that's where I am now ,control,62.5,2
uh not all that much ,control,20.0,1
um clears,control,0.0,1
I'm a  I'm a very bad uh eater when it comes to nutrition ,control,56.25,5
uh fish ,control,0.0,1
um but it  it  it wasn't all that much t to do ,control,26.666666666666668,0
the  the chemo was the  the primary source of  of treatment of_course ,control,46.66666666666666,0
uh the oncologist um was very responsive ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and he  you_know he  he gave uh me antinausea medication ,control,33.33333333333333,0
but I didn't  I took it once during the whole treatment time ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and  and even then it wasn't because I was starting to  to vomit ,control,37.5,3
I just felt a bit queasy ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um a_lot_of rest ,control,0.0,1
I slept a_lot um and had tender loving care from Firstname ,control,18.181818181818183,4
so  um ih ip it  I didn't do a_lot different you_know ,control,28.57142857142857,3
um  so  I  I really can't go beyond that ,control,46.15384615384615,3
it was the chemotherapy and the rest ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh you_know  um that was pretty much it ,control,33.33333333333333,0
well  I guess one of the most important things ,control,30.0,5
I think  I think last week I mentioned my son's birth so I  I won't go through that again ,control,43.47826086956522,5
um another milestone was  was getting a job at Montclair_State ,control,45.45454545454545,3
uh I  I had  uh d I was a speech clinician um doing work as a  as a  s a speech language pathologist ,control,37.03703703703704,7
but I missed um interacting with students ,control,28.57142857142857,3
uh I had  and  and  and I  I had some experience in doing that because I  my undergraduate degree was in history ,control,40.74074074074074,4
and I actually did student teach uh at a high school uh ih ih in history and had planned to do that ,control,27.27272727272727,4
uh but then things  things sort_of changed obviously ,control,0.0,2
um but I  d I  I missed that kind of interaction ,control,38.46153846153847,3
I worked mostly with children uh when I was a speech clinician ,control,50.0,3
and uh mur Firstname was teaching English at the high_school level ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and she would come b back home with stories about you_know working with students and discussions they had in class ,control,35.0,10
and I was sorta jealous um of that ,control,50.0,3
and so when I was invited to  um to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance ,control,42.10526315789473,6
that  that changed everything ,control,60.0,0
um click and I was warned that  from  from ih friends  ug uh uh colleagues that I was taking a big d risk in  in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure ,control,41.02564102564102,6
that they were  guh I was gonna be taken advantage of ,control,53.84615384615385,3
uh I don't know where they got the idea ,control,50.0,3
um uh but that I would  you_know I  w I would work for xl number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldn't get tenure ,control,41.935483870967744,0
um but I wanted to be in the classroom so much ,control,36.36363636363637,4
um and it was more that than doing research actually ,control,40.0,4
it was actually teaching that drew me to it ,control,66.66666666666666,3
uh that I said ,control,50.0,1
 uh the heck with it ,control,50.0,0
 et you_know  I'm gonna do it ,control,30.0,4
and so I  I did ,control,33.33333333333333,0
and it  it changed everything ,control,50.0,0
and that was a very very positive uh event you_know ,control,30.0,3
and I spent forty five years after that laughs being here ,control,36.36363636363637,3
yeah ,control,0.0,0
so  yeah ,control,0.0,0
yeah laughs ,control,0.0,1
well no lucky for you ,control,40.0,2
okay  a young boy is kicking a soccer ball ,control,30.0,2
he's out uh I guess  in the backyard ,control,50.0,3
but as he's  k uh when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbor's house or maybe his own house um and lands on the lap of a  of a man sitting in a chair uh who then gets up holds the ball in his hand and looks out the  the hole in the window ,control,47.61904761904761,15
um and that's where it ends ,control,57.14285714285714,2
so  we don't know if he's gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what ,control,54.16666666666666,5
but he's just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened ,control,50.0,4
this is a story about not listening to your mom uh especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella ,control,40.0,6
mother is suggesting that he  he do that ,control,55.55555555555556,2
that he's  i there's  r it's going to rain ,control,50.0,3
and he's  f he's rejecting the whole thing ,control,45.45454545454545,3
um says goodbye ,control,0.0,1
and mother's a bit dismayed because he's not taking the umbrella ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and sure enough once he's outside it starts to rain uh hard enough that he f hasta run back to the house ,control,39.130434782608695,7
he's not very happy ,control,40.0,2
um he's soaking wet ,control,40.0,1
mother is looking at him almost saying ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 see I told you show ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and next we see he's out back in the rain but with the umbrella ,control,46.66666666666666,5
well  it seems as though uh this y young girl's father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat who's up on a limb ,control,41.37931034482759,10
uh he himself though ends up being stuck ,control,50.0,2
his facial expression indicates that he  he's having difficulty ib ih moving one way or the other ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and uh ih being of no help the dog is uh barking making a racket ,control,40.0,6
and s someone evidently called the fire department ,control,37.5,2
and there are  two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and they're going to try to get him down ,control,40.0,3
his ladder  uh father's ladder um is on the ground uh I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him ,control,41.66666666666667,4
so  the fire  f fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope ,control,33.33333333333333,0
story of a young girl whose uh ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I guess she's uh a uh teenager ,control,50.0,3
whose mother dies and father remarries ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and she's introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters ,control,50.0,5
and um they immediately take advantage of Cinderella ,control,25.0,2
uh z s she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and uh hasta at at attend to their needs and the needs of the household ,control,36.0,7
and evidently father ha was of no help in mediating uh any of this ,control,50.0,7
so  the girl ends up uh uh being in a household but  but being rather a member of the household being a  uh a servant as I said ,control,48.38709677419355,7
one day uh a ball is announced ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she  s she lives in uh I guess  a principality uh headed by d you_know royalty ,control,33.33333333333333,0
and one day a ball is announced ,control,28.57142857142857,2
if I recall correctly it's because the prince uh is in need of finding a wife ,control,58.82352941176471,7
his father z s tells him that it's time for him to marry ,control,50.0,3
so  a ball is uh organized ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and all of the eligible young ladies uh in the principality are invited to attend ,control,40.0,6
um and the three stepsisters and  and uh their  muh their mother um go  plan to go ,control,20.0,4
and they get their gowns ready ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too ,control,37.5,2
but it turns out that she's not gonna be allowed to go ,control,42.85714285714285,4
uh she of_course is very sad about that ,control,50.0,3
enter her fairy godmother ,control,25.0,2
um th th they g  they go off to the ball  the  the  the  the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball ,control,46.42857142857143,5
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella ,control,30.0,3
 you're gonna go too ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 and we're gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen ,control,42.85714285714285,0
um and I guess the mice too become horses ,control,22.22222222222222,3
I'm not sure which animals become the horses maybe the mice ,control,41.66666666666667,4
um she's outfitted  Cinderella's outfitted with a gown uh and a pair of ih ih gol uh glass slippers ,control,31.818181818181817,6
why glass ,control,50.0,1
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
um but she's told she hasta get home by  t by midnight ,control,35.714285714285715,4
because at the stroke of twelve everything's gonna turn back to what t it was ,control,58.82352941176471,6
the coach will become the pumpkin ,control,50.0,2
the coachmen will become the mice ,control,50.0,2
ih she'll lose her beautiful clothing ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  she goes to the ball promises to  to leave by twelve ,control,42.85714285714285,4
uh but she's having a great time ,control,37.5,2
and the prince is very much drawn to her ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and uh she's still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time um and gets  gets back home uh in time ,control,26.923076923076923,6
but as she's running out one of her slipper  uh g slippers comes off ,control,43.75,5
and the prince picks it up ,control,50.0,2
and it turns out that uh uh  she's the one that he wants ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady uh into the  s into the glass slipper ,control,51.51515151515152,11
so  um a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess  with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper ,control,42.85714285714285,9
and the  the  s the stepsisters of_course try ,control,30.0,4
and they don't fit ,control,40.0,1
and they try to f push their feet into that slipper ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and it doesn't work ,control,40.0,1
and they're very upset ,control,40.0,2
and lo_and_behold Cinderella's foot fits perfectly ,control,0.0,3
it was her slipper ,control,75.0,2
and they're very very surprised shocked and upset ,control,22.22222222222222,3
uh but  she's the one ,control,42.85714285714285,2
the prince is delighted ,control,50.0,2
and they end up being married and live happily ever after ,control,36.36363636363637,3
well as I said before I'm not very good at nutrition ,control,50.0,3
so  I would not use what looks like whole wheat bread ,control,41.66666666666667,4
I would use American white bread um two slices ,control,22.22222222222222,3
on one slice I would spread the peanut butter ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the other slice I would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich ,control,33.33333333333333,5
