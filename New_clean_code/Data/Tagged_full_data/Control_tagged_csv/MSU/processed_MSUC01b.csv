and I was in the gymnasium ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and we were practicing ,control,50.0,1
and I did a back flip ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I came down on my arm ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and I remember hearing it crack ,control,33.33333333333333,3
it was CYO so it was  it was not uh uh like in a public school ,control,52.94117647058824,1
and um I remember the  some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest ,control,52.63157894736842,10
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital ,control,52.38095238095239,5
and I remember that um I was in the hospital for almost a week ,control,57.14285714285714,5
I'd never really been sick and have since really been sick ,control,50.0,2
but  um  so  I  I remember being in a cast for quite a long time ,control,47.368421052631575,4
and  and  um and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long ,control,34.78260869565217,6
I had a Christmas sling and a  and whatnot ,control,30.0,3
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling ,control,45.45454545454545,7
but um  I can now tell the weather ,control,33.33333333333333,2
oh  well  I was  I was fourteen years old ,control,33.33333333333333,4
your body just gets better ,control,20.0,2
I  f I  there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that ,control,50.0,6
it was um going back  I never went back to the squad ,control,38.46153846153847,5
I tried to do twirling ,control,20.0,2

so ,control,0.0,0
besides my husband ,control,66.66666666666666,2
well  after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him um  and realizing that  he needed time for processing and  and sort_of  understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them ,control,39.130434782608695,0
so  that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability ,control,58.333333333333336,0
so  he  he was able to do that ,control,50.0,3
so  after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sort_of s a little bit of self teaching and  and um and giving him time to find his words and  and thinking of the process as as  as a child learns speech again ,control,36.36363636363637,0
so  I tried to educate myself on  uh on how children learn language ,control,40.0,4
and then from that um he sort_of followed that same process but only speeding it up ,control,37.5,2
so  he had the foundation there so shrugs ,control,44.44444444444444,2
um but mostly just giving him time ,control,14.285714285714285,1
happy sad ,control,0.0,1

uh um in the summers we would go to the beach ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins ,control,50.0,2
and we were always close ,control,40.0,1
and we went to a place in um Long_Branch ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and it was this sort_of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families would  would get into a room  would get a room ,control,44.44444444444444,6
and then you would get a parcel of a  of a kitchen ,control,53.84615384615385,6
and  and you_know when you think about it now ,control,40.0,0
but  um and so we would go ,control,25.0,1
and my folks never had much money ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and  and um so they would sort_of save up for this week ,control,38.46153846153847,0
and  and we would go to the  and we  we would all stay in this one room ,control,45.0,5
and I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother ,control,38.46153846153847,6
and  um and we would just  we would go to the beach ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and we would just have a great time ,control,37.5,2
and I  so I remember um going to the pool ,control,36.36363636363637,0
they would have salt water pool ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I remember it being really cold ,control,50.0,3
so  you would jump in in the morning ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and you_know you would just spend your whole day there ,control,30.0,2
and you would be spent by the end of the day ,control,63.63636363636363,5
and  and I still remember the smells and the sights of it so ,control,35.714285714285715,0
you_know  and I remember the  um the routines ,control,30.0,0
being Catholic on a  on a Saturday ,control,62.5,4
there was a place called Rutt's_Hut which I think is still around ,control,41.66666666666667,4
um but it was this little um over the boardwalk over the beach kind of place ,control,50.0,6
and it was um ,control,50.0,1
and on Friday nights my  my mother and my aunt and m and  they'd wake us all up to go to r Rutt's_Hup ,control,38.46153846153847,6
and that would be like our  our treat ,control,66.66666666666666,4
we were probably like all in our pajamas ,control,50.0,3
and  and  but w we would all get out there ,control,25.0,2
and  and so it became a  a  sort_of a ritual that we all did together ,control,38.88888888888889,4
but uh I remember just playing on the beach and th you_know th ,control,30.76923076923077,4
so  it was just a good time ,control,50.0,2
yeah it was ,control,66.66666666666666,1
it was a_lot_of fun ,control,50.0,1
and with those cousins we're still close and still share a_lot_of things  so ,control,26.666666666666668,3
a boy is outside ,control,50.0,2
and he's playing a game of soccer ,control,50.0,3
so  he's out for the afternoon and playing with um ,control,50.0,3
I don't see any friends so I think he's just playing sort_of a kick the ball ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and he's in his  in his neighborhood ,control,66.66666666666666,5
and uh lo_and_behold the ball finds its way into a window of a  either his own family or  um or a neighbor next door ,control,30.76923076923077,6
and um there is a gentleman that's sitting um maybe watching tv ,control,30.76923076923077,4
I don't see a newspaper so he's watching some tv ,control,58.333333333333336,3
and um the window ,control,25.0,1
he gets up to see who it is ,control,62.5,3
and you kind_of wonder did the boy run away or is the boy still there ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I guess the mother heard the weather report because she had an umbrella in hand as the  as the little boy is walking out the door ,control,51.85185185185185,6
but he I guess  took a look outside and said ,control,27.27272727272727,3
 no you_know I don't see any  w I don't see any rain so I don't wanna take a  an umbrella ,control,46.15384615384615,2
so  he says goodbye to his mom ,control,50.0,3
and um he's walking out the door ,control,50.0,3
and then maybe he gets a couple steps ,control,25.0,3
and here comes the rain ,control,20.0,2
and he's like ,control,50.0,1
 uhoh I better get back home and um see if I can get that umbrella ,control,31.25,4
so  he gets in the door ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and his mother is looking at him and saying ,control,44.44444444444444,2
 I told you it was going to rain ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  let me give you the umbrella ,control,50.0,3
and then you can walk to school ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and you'll be dry ,control,60.0,1
 a girl is riding her bike ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  she's  she's out on her bike ,control,63.63636363636363,5
and she's going through the neighborhood and um all_of_a_sudden looks up and sees her cat in the tree ,control,42.10526315789473,3
and calls to her dad and asks her dad to come on  come over and help her get the cat ,control,28.57142857142857,6
and the father brings over his ladder and puts it against the tree and starts to go for the cat and the ladder falls ,control,37.5,6
and so now he's stuck in the tree ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the dog is barking trying to  get everybody's attention I guess ,control,35.714285714285715,4
or he's barking at the dog ,control,57.14285714285714,3
or he's really barking at the cat probably ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and um  the girl has  the father takes out his cell phone ,control,28.57142857142857,4
we'll put it in that situation now ,control,62.5,3
calls the firemen ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and um he calls the fire  uh the fire people from his town ,control,35.714285714285715,4

and the bird will uh still sing their ,control,37.5,2
and the dog will stop barking ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well  the story opens with um Cinderella's dad um coming home with his new wife and their two children  and  and her two daughters ,control,21.428571428571427,6
and what we find out later on is that the father has died ,control,53.84615384615385,3
and this woman now becomes her stepmother ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and as they grow then um Cinderella becomes more of the servant to the  m to the stepmother and to the two girls ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and um a letter comes to them or  an announcement comes to the family ,control,40.0,4
and there is a  there's going to be a ball ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and the ball is going to be held at the castle ,control,45.45454545454545,4

and she um is then able to  um to go to the ball ,control,28.57142857142857,5
and the ball is set for a reason ,control,50.0,3
and the reason is  is that the prince is to find a wife ,control,50.0,5
and she's given instructions that she needs to be home by twelve midnight ,control,42.85714285714285,6
and  um and the  the fairy godmother provides her with this beautiful dress and these wonderful glass slippers and  and a whole coach of  of  pumpkins that turn to  to a coach and  um and with horsemen etcetera ,control,31.11111111111111,11
