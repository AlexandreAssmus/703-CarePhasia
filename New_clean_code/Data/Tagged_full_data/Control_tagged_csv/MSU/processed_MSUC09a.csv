well  I recently had Hodgkin's disease ,control,12.5,3
uh was diagnosed  I guess  about three months after I retired ,control,30.76923076923077,4
I spent uh s several months in chemotherapy ,control,37.5,3
uh but pri prior to that  before the chemotherapy started I had uh an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks ,control,39.285714285714285,5
that was  was a Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no  no burning to my skin ,control,60.86956521739131,7
it was all a result of the allergic reaction ,control,66.66666666666666,4
and that stopped the chemo ,control,40.0,2
I had one round of chemo ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and then the allergic reaction took place to the  medica not the chemo medication but to uh a medication that's designed to protect uh kidney function ,control,28.57142857142857,7
so  I was in the hospital for three weeks ,control,60.0,3
that resolved ,control,50.0,1
I started chemo again ,control,25.0,1
and uh I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since ,control,42.85714285714285,4
so  my hair came back ,control,33.33333333333333,2
my weight came back ,control,25.0,2
and I hafta watch it now because it's  it's laughs back more than it has been ,control,63.1578947368421,3
um but it was  it's been uh quite a year and a half or so ,control,47.05882352941176,4
well  I had married my wife about forty eight years ago ,control,25.0,4
and it was cries ,control,50.0,1
sorry guys ,control,0.0,1
pretty much her  her doing clearsthroat plus my oncologist of_course ,control,27.27272727272727,3
um so  it was  you_know it  ih I had chemo every two weeks ,control,43.75,4
and the oncologist was just great ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and  uh and Firstname was quite a support ,control,33.33333333333333,2
cries sorry ,control,0.0,1
and I  d d I didn't do much else because it was you_know the chemo and  and uh eating as best as I could and uh uh resting as  as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasn't too hard ,control,40.0,7
um click so that was it you_know following doctor's orders as they say  and my wife's orders ,control,30.0,5
so ,control,0.0,0
a story ,control,50.0,1
well  this being Saint_Joseph's day in the Roman_Catholic calendar and since my son's name is Joseph as_well_as my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday ,control,47.05882352941176,4
that  uh I do know the day of the week uh in December December ninth ,control,43.75,4
uh and uh it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that  that we found out that uh we were pregnant  that my wife was pregnant ,control,52.77777777777778,8
uh he's our only child ,control,50.0,2
um so  his  his  the announcement of the fact that he was  that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess  are happy memories prompted by  as I said  today because of  of  the uh of Saint_Joseph's day ,control,47.05882352941176,0
about the  da about Saint_Joseph's day ,control,37.5,5
it's a  it's a feast day in  in the  uh in the Roman_Catholic calendar that comes just after Saint_Patrick's day which I think  overshadows  overshadows it ,control,47.05882352941176,10
and it's  um as the Irish celebrate Saint_Patrick's I think Saint_Joseph's day is mostly celebrated by the Italian_Americans and by Italians ,control,36.0,5
and there's a special pastry that is consumed ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and it's called a Zeppole or the  the donut of Saint_Joseph ,control,46.15384615384615,5

um but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didn't allow fathers in the waiting ,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  even_though we prepared  we prepared for uh the day of birth going to childbirth classes  Lamaze classes ,control,28.57142857142857,5
when it  when ,control,75.0,0
pun intended ,control,0.0,1
when push came to shove I couldn't go into the waiting ,control,41.66666666666667,3
uh so  I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days ,control,31.25,6
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery ,control,75.0,3
and  and I  we did use some of the coaching ,control,50.0,4
so it  and  and she did m uh employ some of the um uh techniques that were taught to her ,control,50.0,6
um so  yeah  so  that was  that was the day of his birth ,control,47.05882352941176,6

and she's brought by her father to live with uh I  I think  a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age ,control,44.82758620689656,9
uh father meant well ,control,0.0,2
but uh the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought uh and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully ,control,31.57894736842105,4
uh she became uh their maid essentially and uh hadta clean the house uh take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella uh do the cooking do the washing while they uh enjoyed life and uh uh did what they wanted to do to  to please themselves ,control,30.612244897959183,6
one day the prince ,control,25.0,2
they  they lived in a  in a principality ,control,60.0,0
the prince uh whose father wanted him to marry uh was uh asked to or  was told that there would be a ball held at which uh many of the or  all of the single women in the principality would  would be invited ,control,50.0,11
and the idea would be that he would  the prince would eventually uh pick one of them to be his wife ,control,54.54545454545454,5
the three  Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball ,control,27.27272727272727,0
the mother  their mother's very excited ,control,25.0,0
and of_course Cinderella is excluded ,control,20.0,2
she cannot go to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh and so she's left at home alone while the uh stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball ,control,38.095238095238095,4
click she's visited by her fairy godmother uh who uh grants her uh her wish of attending the ball ,control,45.0,9
because Cinderella says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 how am I gonna get there ,control,37.5,2
 what am I gonna wear ,control,42.85714285714285,2
uh so  the guh fairy godmother uh makes a very nice gown for her out_of magic uh takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach ,control,29.629629629629623,5
mice become the horses ,control,25.0,2
uh I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too ,control,36.36363636363637,5
I forget  which animal becomes the coachman ,control,37.5,3
they take her to the ball ,control,66.66666666666666,3
um she's not really recognized by her stepsisters and  and the stepmother ,control,35.714285714285715,4
click uh but they  the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight ,control,47.05882352941176,4
otherwise  or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was ,control,53.84615384615385,4
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera ,control,37.5,2
so  she promises to return at midnight ,control,37.5,3
but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight ,control,50.0,4
so  she panics ,control,50.0,1
rightly so ,control,0.0,1
runs uh gets back in the coach and is taken home ,control,27.27272727272727,4
but one of her slippers  glass slippers that was part of what the uh fairy godmother made for her is left behind ,control,43.47826086956522,10
and the prince uh at  at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and uh wanted to  to know who she was ,control,39.130434782608695,4
because she was going to be the one ,control,62.5,3
uh and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind ,control,43.75,4
so  he uh has all of the young ladies in the  munici uh in the principality uh try the slipper on ,control,52.17391304347826,7
uh it  their  it's brought to each of their houses ,control,61.53846153846154,0
and the  of_course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one uh he was looking for the one who was at the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,9
and sure enough um it is Cinderella's foot that fits uh the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and  but to her great delight ,control,30.303030303030305,8
and um the prince marries her ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they live happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well  I would take um two pieces of bread ,control,30.0,3
on one of them I would uh take a knife and spread the peanut butter ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and on the other  piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together ,control,45.16129032258064,5
and I'd have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,30.0,3
