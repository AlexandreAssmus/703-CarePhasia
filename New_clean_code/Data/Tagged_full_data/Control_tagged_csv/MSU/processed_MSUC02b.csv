um but I worked  I worked every day ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I didn't miss any work ,control,50.0,2
still came to work ,control,0.0,2
um it was therapeutic to come to work uh just to  because if I was home I would go nuts thinking about stuff ,control,45.83333333333333,4
so  it was good to be busy and come to work ,control,33.33333333333333,4

but it's uh it was a long haul at the time ,control,58.333333333333336,5
sleep a_lot ,control,0.0,1
I slept a_lot whenever I was tired and  which would happen randomly ,control,46.15384615384615,4
um not at work ,control,25.0,1
I didn't  I didn't sleep at work though you_know laughs ,control,46.15384615384615,0
but I felt like it  I know ,control,50.0,2
but I  um like I'd  I'd come home from work and just take a nap before I even had dinner with my husband ,control,40.74074074074074,5
like we'd  we'd take a nap ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and then  uh and then got up and had dinner and took another nap and then went to bed ,control,15.0,6
but uh I slept a_lot ,control,20.0,1
um that's about all I remember as far as the uh ,control,58.333333333333336,5
it  w I guess it was a way of uh dealing with it too ,control,53.333333333333336,6
like you_know at the time I  I was  if I slept I didn't hafta think about things ,control,50.0,4
so  it was uh ,control,60.0,1
but uh my husband was real great ,control,28.57142857142857,2
he took good care of me ,control,50.0,3
and my daughter ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and  and um I don't know what I would have done without them ,control,53.333333333333336,3
they were  they were good ,control,66.66666666666666,2
yeah  have good support you have  it makes you better real fast you_know ,control,26.666666666666668,4
uh well  I have  I have an eight eighteen month old grandson who's just learning how to speak ,control,28.57142857142857,5
and uh um but yet I understand what he wants you_know by  by you_know like the different sounds mean different things even though they're not English ,control,35.714285714285715,3
uh you kinda know what he's talking about ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and uh uh otherwise uh ,control,0.0,1
well  I do have a  my  my  my  um my stepdaughter's inlaws uh speak Spanish ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and uh the  the  the  uh her mother inlaw does speak a little English but not much at all ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and the  f her father inlaw doesn't speak any English so ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and I don't speak any Spanish so ,control,37.5,2
but we do  we do have a conversation ,control,44.44444444444444,3
it's kind_of funny ,control,50.0,2
I don't know if we're talking about the same thing ,control,58.333333333333336,4
but we  you_know we both seem to think we are ,control,45.45454545454545,0
but  uh and we  uh like he passes me the things when I need it at the table  you_know ,control,45.45454545454545,5
like if there's salt and pepper like uh ,control,22.22222222222222,2
so  I  d we  you_know you do  you find sign language ,control,33.33333333333333,5
but you make your own sign language I guess  if you  you_know if you don't know sign language ,control,38.095238095238095,2
which but you you_know you  there's ways of indicating what you need or wants  m,control,38.88888888888889,6
I guess they know ,control,50.0,2
that uh but that's I guess that's the only  I  my mom had a stroke in two thousand and nine uh but didn't recover from it ,control,45.16129032258064,8
she  uh she  she passed away from it ,control,50.0,0
so that was  you_know so that was  I only had three days of dealing with uh her  her speaking ,control,45.45454545454545,1
but uh and it was  it was repetitive ,control,44.44444444444444,2
like she was like stuttering speaking at that point ,control,55.55555555555556,6
everything was uh ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 I  I need  need  need  need ,control,18.181818181818183,4
you_know  it was like that kind of talk ,control,55.55555555555556,4
it was hard for her ,control,80.0,2
but  um but then I really didn't  I didn't have that long a  long a time t t to really develop any kind of a language with her ,control,36.36363636363637,6
about something that happened ,control,75.0,3

and the little girl it was her cat ,control,50.0,2
and  she's  she wants her cat to get down from the tree ,control,46.66666666666666,5

and so she can't go to the ball in that dress ,control,50.0,3
and off the  sis the  the stepsisters go to the ball ,control,46.15384615384615,6
and the fairy godmother comes and helps Cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up ,control,29.166666666666668,7
and she looked just  gorgeous ,control,16.666666666666664,2

and she loses one of her glass slippers ,control,37.5,4
and the prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this s glass slipper ,control,35.0,5

okay ,control,0.0,0
uh to make a sandwich if I'm gonna make a whole sandwich I would use two pieces of bread ,control,38.095238095238095,5
and smear the peanut butter on one half and the jelly on the other half of bread ,control,35.294117647058826,5
and then put them together ,control,20.0,1
and cut it in half or fours whatever way you like it ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and eat it ,control,33.33333333333333,1
