inhales and then we smack hand,control,16.666666666666664,0

and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts ,control,53.84615384615385,3
but if we're gonna eat it we eat it with the crust ,control,57.14285714285714,3
 that's about how to make a peanut butter sandwich ,control,45.45454545454545,5
 the dog and the cat were fighting ,control,37.5,3
 and the cat climbed up the tree ,control,37.5,3
 and the do,control,25.0,0
inhales and the little girl happened upon the scene ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and realized  that the cat was in the tree and she's f gonna need her dad ,control,42.10526315789473,4
so  she got her dad ,control,50.0,2
 and her dad got the ladder ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and they were trying to get  the cat out_of the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,5
 but the ladder fell down ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 but just in the nick of time  the firemen who were called by the neighbors  came ,control,42.10526315789473,6
 and helped th get the cat and the dad out_of the tree ,control,23.07692307692308,4
lips_smack  ,control,0.0,1
inhales well  yes I remember being hospitalized ,control,25.0,2
the most recent  one was  in New_York_City ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt_Hospital ,control,57.14285714285714,2
inhales and um my right lung had filled up with  fluid ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and um so they kept me ,control,33.33333333333333,1
inhales sighs  I realized how important it is to have someone with you  when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked ,control,53.84615384615385,6
the towels were like sandpaper ,control,60.0,2
you were lucky to have a towel  if you were to take a bath or a shower ,control,44.44444444444444,5
 uh they didn't come ,control,33.33333333333333,1
so  I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel ,control,50.0,4
inhales um I have veins that are very difficult to get blood ,control,33.33333333333333,6
so  I'd always say kiddingly to the people ,control,50.0,3
 are ya really good at this ,control,57.14285714285714,3
 and one man named Joe_L told me ,control,12.5,3
laughs head,control,0.0,1
he'd  he'd shay ,control,66.66666666666666,0
 I've head,control,50.0,1
inhales after about twenty pokes in my hand I said ,control,50.0,6
 could you find someone else  to draw blood because we're not getting it done here ,control,38.88888888888889,3
and um lips_smack  it was really all I ha could do to get better so I could get out_of the place ,control,40.909090909090914,3
because  it's too bad  that the staff is so overworked ,control,46.15384615384615,3
and probably underpaid ,control,0.0,1
and that facilities  um are having trouble today  uh getting the help that they need ,control,29.411764705882355,4
I could also tell laughs you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night ,control,58.82352941176471,8
of_course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things ,control,42.85714285714285,4
 and she couldn't find the bathroom ,control,37.5,0
so  laughs she just used whatever facilities she could find ,control,36.36363636363637,3
inhales and when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved  they just said ,control,50.0,7
 well  you'll probably hafta go on with a cancer patient that's dying ,control,43.75,4
so   I was so unaccustomed  to hospitals ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I'm probably unaccustomed to  the treatment  there because  I'm going back to Iowa thinking ,control,40.0,5
and um I was sort_of on my own to try to figure out  how to get help and how to get out_of there ,control,29.166666666666668,5
 so  that was my experience ,control,42.85714285714285,0
that's probably the worst experience I've ever had in a hospital ,control,53.84615384615385,5
inhales because everything else is always been won  done very well ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 it was crazy ,control,50.0,1
if you know Roosevelt Hospital ,control,40.0,2
 and it just felt  I did  I did learn though ,control,38.46153846153847,4
when I was at Roosevelt_Hospital I was watching Jeopardy on television ,control,63.63636363636363,3
and they ask ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 um who was the first Supreme_Court justice ,control,37.5,0
 and I looked out the window ,control,42.85714285714285,0
 and I saw the school at Fordham_University ,control,37.5,0
and the first Supreme_Court justice was named for  the one that is named in that school as the law school ,control,47.61904761904761,5
 lips_smack exhales ,control,0.0,1
 lips_smack I'm not sure if I was frightened or scared  in this situation ,control,43.75,7
but  I was frightened for my daughter ,control,50.0,4
in September of  ninet uh September two thousand six ,control,20.0,4
on the nineteenth day ,control,50.0,2
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom ,control,54.54545454545454,5
that her husband had threatened to kill her ,control,50.0,2
 and within  twenty hours  I was in Rome_Italy ,control,36.36363636363637,3
 and  my husband and I decided that one of us should go  to help her ,control,38.88888888888889,4
and to help her  with her husband ,control,37.5,3
 and  I arrived hoping that I could do something  to get them counseling  whatever ,control,38.88888888888889,5
within  twenty four hours  he had called  the police  of Rome ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I was alone with him in the house ,control,75.0,3
and I had  exhales no help ,control,28.57142857142857,2
but I didn't know how to get ahold of my daughter ,control,50.0,5
sniffs and the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail ,control,44.44444444444444,4
sniffs and  I immediately thought ,control,16.666666666666664,2
 lips_smack wonder if I can take my pillow ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 or should I take my Sudoku game ,control,37.5,2
 because if I hafta sit in that police  with the police in jail  what am I going to do ,control,50.0,0
so   I sort_of  you_know ,control,16.666666666666664,3
inhales and then I started trying to call my daughter's friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan ,control,38.095238095238095,0
 and I kept dialing finger,control,16.666666666666664,0
sniffs because I think when you're nervous  you dial the wrong thing ,control,50.0,4
I finally got ahold of my daughter ,control,57.14285714285714,4
 and  she  came ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and we called the carabinieris,control,40.0,2
and the carabinieris,control,33.33333333333333,1
 and I'm not sure if I was afraid ,control,50.0,0
inhales I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail ,control,50.0,6
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth  to make it happen head,control,41.17647058823529,7
and I  since then  we were trailed ,control,44.44444444444444,2
our phone was tapped ,control,50.0,2
the computer was  sniffs oh the computer was compromised ,control,40.0,2
we  we wrote to each other  sitting on the sofa ,control,50.0,4
hand,control,0.0,0
inhales and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time ,control,37.5,6
and  I'm not sure if I was really afraid ,control,45.45454545454545,4
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening ,control,66.66666666666666,3
but that was probably  the most  resourceful that I ever hadta be  to protect my daughter and grandson ,control,28.57142857142857,5
lips_smack so   I'm not sure I share that with everyone ,control,58.333333333333336,4
but if you wanna know when I was really  drawn to action head,control,42.85714285714285,0
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating ,control,46.15384615384615,6
lips_smack head,control,0.0,1
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it ,control,61.53846153846154,4
 inhales I think it's not so much communicating it as it is understanding ,control,46.66666666666666,1
inhales because when I was in Italy  trying to communicate with people  I used my hands ,control,44.44444444444444,4
I used any kind of framework I could think of ,control,60.0,3
 uh another language ,control,25.0,0
 lips_smack uh to communicate with anybody ,control,28.57142857142857,3
so  um I learned street Italian ,control,14.285714285714285,2
 lips_smack I um became pretty cl clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me ,control,33.33333333333333,5
 and I learned the words that I needed to use ,control,36.36363636363637,0
but I think  communication is so vital ,control,25.0,3
 and when you don't know the language of someone else  it's  hard to communicate ,control,42.10526315789473,5
 do you want us to be creative with it ,control,60.0,4
do whatever ,control,50.0,1
inhales well this could easily have happened in Iowa ,control,44.44444444444444,2
 the Des_Moines_River  was rising  in  um  nineteen ninety three ,control,21.428571428571427,3
and also in  two thousand eight ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and people were warned not to be near the river ,control,40.0,4
but people do that ,control,25.0,1
and the water has an undertow ges,control,28.57142857142857,2
and it can  catch ges,control,33.33333333333333,0
that could have happened in this picture ,control,71.42857142857143,3
and police and fire and safety people  go to great lengths  to help those people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time ,control,29.629629629629623,6
laughs a,control,50.0,1
and maybe he was playing soccer with his friends ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it ,control,43.75,0
it went through the window ,control,60.0,3
 and the man  was not so happy about it ,control,36.36363636363637,3
because he was sitting there ,control,60.0,1
and it knocked over his lamp ,control,50.0,3
and then  I'm not sure what he's doing in the last picture ,control,46.66666666666666,5
 but he's looking at the window ,control,50.0,0
the man is looking at the window ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and it looks like he's holding something ,control,62.5,2
but maybe he's making a telephone call ,control,37.5,2
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
laughs inhales well typically  little boys and umbrellas don't really wanna head,control,7.142857142857142,5
because the little boy would be much rather   be much happier if he doesn't head,control,47.05882352941176,4
but his mother says ,control,25.0,2
 you gotta take an umbrella ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and  at the last minute  he said ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 head,control,0.0,1
and he runs outside ,control,25.0,1
and he's in the rain ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and he's not so happy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he goes back home ,control,20.0,2
and he says to mom ,control,40.0,2
 I guess head,control,25.0,1
and then he takes the umbrella and leaves ,control,25.0,2
once upon a time ,control,50.0,3
inhales there was a woman with two ugly  girls ,control,30.0,4
and a father with a beautiful  daughter ,control,37.5,3
 and they got married the  the man and the woman ,control,41.66666666666667,4
so  the families were united ges,control,42.85714285714285,2
 and the wicked stepmother  with her two daughters  made the little girl ,control,26.666666666666668,5
who was the father's daughter ,control,50.0,3
do the cooking and cleaning ,control,20.0,2
and by the way her name was Cinderella ,control,50.0,3
 lips_smack and she worked and she scrubbed ,control,25.0,1
and she had so many things to do all day long ,control,18.181818181818183,3
while the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do ,control,30.76923076923077,4
but one night  there was  a special party that the prince was giving ,control,33.33333333333333,4
because you see these girls have grown up ,control,62.5,3
and they were teenagers and they were older ,control,50.0,2
and the prince was looking for a princess ,control,50.0,3
lips_smack well  the two ugly stepsisters  they were getting dresses ,control,25.0,3
and they were gonna get to go  to the party ,control,33.33333333333333,5
lips_smack but the poor little stepdasister ,control,16.666666666666664,2
so  off ges,control,50.0,0
and two mice came and said to  Cinderella ,control,11.11111111111111,3

lips_smack and Cinderella  they did their magic ,control,25.0,2
and Cinderella got a beautiful dress ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and she got a carriage ,control,40.0,2
and she took off ges,control,40.0,1
and she danced with the prince all night long ,control,44.44444444444444,3
but as the  the mice had told her ,control,55.55555555555556,3
 at the stroke of midnight  you hafta be home ,control,36.36363636363637,5
so   at the stroke of midnight she realized gasps she hadta leave ,control,38.46153846153847,4
so  she ran ges,control,40.0,1
 and she ran away ,control,20.0,0
 and she left her shoe ,control,33.33333333333333,0
 and  the prince found her shoe ,control,25.0,2
 and then  she got back home ,control,12.5,0
 and they went  tha and the wicked sis stepsisters came back ,control,15.384615384615383,0
 lips_smack then the prince was looking  for the owner of the shoe ,control,42.85714285714285,5
