I understood how frustrated he was ,control,66.66666666666666,3

and basically I tried to get him to raise his voice a little ,control,30.76923076923077,4
and blame me ges,control,25.0,1
and since my husband has Parkinson's I am using all those lessons laughs ,control,42.85714285714285,4
the closest I can think of is being scared in retrospect ,control,63.63636363636363,3
I probably  was  maybe five  at the most ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and my parents my aunt and uncle ,control,28.57142857142857,2
the same aunt laughs from a previous story ,control,37.5,3
