so  the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home ,control,37.5,3
in fourth grade I was outside um during recess in New_York ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and as you may or may not know they have  um we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city laughs ,control,44.44444444444444,4
we don't have a playground ,control,50.0,2
so  they put up the barriers ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street ,control,53.333333333333336,2
so  um I was standing against one of the cars ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and a friend of mine ran right into me ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and uh my wrist went right around the  um the rear view mirror and broke ,control,25.0,5
so  um they uh called my mom ,control,25.0,2
and my mom came ,control,25.0,2
and I was just crying ,control,40.0,1
and she rushed me to the doctor ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh we took  I think we took the bus because she didn't wanna pay for an ambulance ,control,47.368421052631575,7
so  I'm in pain on the bus ,control,66.66666666666666,5
I'm crying ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I'm trying to keep it still ,control,42.85714285714285,2

and um got back to school and all my friends signed it ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and um so that was cool ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and so I remember one time my mom used like uh one of the uh straws from the broom to try and itch ,control,26.08695652173913,9
and it broke in there ,control,20.0,2
so  then that was even more annoying because I couldn't get to to it ,control,50.0,3
um and that was about all I remember about that ,control,70.0,5
and I ,control,50.0,1
oh  and then I remember using it as a weapon too laughs ,control,30.76923076923077,6
if somebody bothered me I'd hit them with it ,control,80.0,2
but then I would feel it too laughs ,control,37.5,2
so ,control,0.0,0
yeah  that was my first experience with a cast laughs ,control,45.45454545454545,0

well  most recently you_know when we call to pay a phone bill or something um we get somebody in another country ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and so a_lot_of times like they can't pronounce our names ,control,36.36363636363637,2
so  we'll be like are you  first we hafta figure out if they're calling the right house ,control,61.90476190476191,5
and then you_know after they say it a few times then we do understand ,control,42.85714285714285,4
um and just to switch really quick ,control,0.0,2
actually when we've called to get help with like computer service or something that's when it becomes a really  it becomes difficult because we're trying to first understand what they're saying and then do what they're saying and trying to figure out if they understand what we're asking what for we need ,control,49.15254237288136,10
so  yeah that's a interesting experience ,control,37.5,2

we had the completely different view of California ,control,37.5,3
California was like this fantasy land you_know awesome place to be you can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody ,control,47.368421052631575,4
so  when we moved here or  when we moved to California from New_York I would sometimes walk home from the babysitter's or what have you ,control,46.42857142857143,4
and one time this um man stopped ,control,14.285714285714285,2

and then that's when I was like ,control,62.5,2

and um so I just prayed at that point like that he would go right go towards my house ,control,47.368421052631575,5
and um he was like ,control,40.0,1
 are you sure you don't want something to drink you_know ,control,41.66666666666667,5

 please turn ,control,0.0,1
and um I  um anything  I didn't know what was gonna happen at that point ,control,42.10526315789473,5
he pulled up in front of my house ,control,62.5,5
and he was still kind_of rolling ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I just kind_of opened the door and just kind_of jumped out_of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house ,control,42.42424242424242,7
and nobody was home ,control,50.0,1
so  then I'm knocking on the door ,control,55.55555555555556,3

the little boy ran away because he was scared ,control,44.44444444444444,2
the little boy is ready to go to school ,control,33.33333333333333,4

they would make her clean wash all the dishes clean the floors wash their clothes um scrub the floors do everything that they didn't wanna do and treat her badly ,control,41.935483870967744,5
then they got an invitation to go to the ball ,control,40.0,5

 and you're going to cook and you're going to clean and you're going to make sure that this house is spotless by the time we get back ,control,38.70967741935484,9

and the clock strikes twelve or one laughs ,control,12.5,3
I can't remember laughs ,control,40.0,1
and she um says ,control,25.0,1
so  she runs out the door and she loses a slipper um but she still has one on ,control,42.10526315789473,2
so  she gets home ,control,40.0,1

and they say ,control,33.33333333333333,1
