in order to prepare for the party the mother had baked a three layer cake and was really excited that  that the the boy would like it ,control,46.42857142857143,7

the dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing and the crumbs all through the house ,control,44.44444444444444,6

clears_throat ironically enough the pain started to travel down my back finger,control,25.0,3
I could feel it moving ,control,60.0,2
it wasn't a muscle I could ,control,71.42857142857143,2
I'm  I'm much a sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle ,control,52.94117647058824,6
it wasn't a bone ,control,60.0,2
something was really weird and it was moving ,control,50.0,2
they were kidney stones eventually I found out ,control,50.0,2
but I remember thinking ,control,25.0,1
 I don't have yet insurance here ,control,25.0,1
and I've just moved back ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I haven't been to a hospital here in twenty years ,control,50.0,3
this is going to be really horrible ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and  m and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where clears_throat I had a fever of a hundred and one or something and uh just was doubled over and couldn't even  and couldn't even really stand um as this thing was making it's way down ,control,40.0,1
so  we went to the hospital ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and the first thing I walked in and s I said ,control,27.27272727272727,3
 I'm sorry t bring you a bad news ,control,40.0,3
and the woman said ,control,25.0,2

 but anyway I don't have insurance ,control,25.0,1
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 that's no problem ,control,60.0,2
 that's  you're gonna get a  come on in ,control,50.0,5
and I remember thinking ,control,25.0,1
 okay this is gonna be alright ,control,37.5,2
um three hours later after some medicine and vomiting at_least forty times because of the intense pain the most intense pain I've ever had in my life ,control,35.714285714285715,7
just imagine like stones going through that little opening shows,control,30.0,5
sorry laughs ,control,0.0,1
and uh whew ,control,0.0,1
suddenly  and I was having to use a little strainer thing ges and seeing them come out ,control,27.77777777777778,0
and oh ,control,0.0,1
and then for t t about a day the blood and everything else ,control,30.76923076923077,3
um but I was amazed the body and how ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and once  and once they told me what it was I read a little bit about and realized it's not such a simple thing and how often we don't realize it ,control,50.0,4
so  water shows,control,0.0,2
people drink colas and ,control,0.0,1
coffees colas bubble gas d drinks are the worst ,control,22.22222222222222,5
and then red meat is another bad one because they don't end up being digested ,control,43.75,3
so  I learned ,control,50.0,2
and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasn't even vomit I thought ,control,40.0,4
my  my throat's going to come out because of  the convulsions were so strong ,control,47.05882352941176,5
and I just remember thinking ,control,20.0,1
my wife and son are coming next week ,control,25.0,2
 and oh_my_god here I am in the hospital ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  I was really  I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it ,control,42.10526315789473,5
except  for the first time in my life ever ,control,50.0,5
not death but enough to the point where something seriously wrong here ,control,33.33333333333333,3
that  that was the point of my story ,control,66.66666666666666,4
I  I've never had that ,control,57.14285714285714,2
at forty eight years old I'm too young for this ,control,45.45454545454545,5
in nineteen ninety six I was living in Japan ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I was contacted by a local city ,control,50.0,3
a city named Uwajima which is very near where my wife's hm traditional home town is in the mountains of a small village area ,control,40.0,8
um their local high school fishing cooperative ship kind_of like the sail USA or go around the world ges,control,26.31578947368421,4
up  the submarine came up ges,control,42.85714285714285,2
um this went on for months ,control,50.0,2
and the Japanese government demanded an apology ,control,28.57142857142857,2
the US government didn't wanna apologize nor the xxx of the US Navy ,control,35.714285714285715,4
at the end of the day they didn't know what to do ,control,53.84615384615385,6
at the local government some friends of a friend of a friend of a friend found me and said ,control,52.63157894736842,8
 we are not able to communicate with them ,control,44.44444444444444,4
 can you please explain to me what the difference is to an American of I'm sorry ,control,66.66666666666666,5
 what does excuse me mean ,control,50.0,3
I am talking about having a meeting with the secretary of the Japanese selfdefense ,control,57.14285714285714,8
so  kind_of a hm secretary of defense who I would never normally meet ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and the mayor two congress people or  parliament members ,control,10.0,3
sorry ,control,0.0,0
um and about forty very very very pissed off Japanese parents who had lost children wanting  demanding to understand what the English concept or the western concept was I'm sorry ,control,28.125,11
I hadta prepare a presentation for this ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and then I thought ,control,25.0,1
how am I going to explain what is I'm sorry ,control,63.63636363636363,4
it's like movies and songs we use this so often ,control,45.45454545454545,5
yet it  it has very very traditional deep meanings and depending on the level of the insult pesh perceived or injury perceived or not there are different ways to apologize in Japanese and all cultures ,control,25.0,0
as we  we have levels of formality ,control,50.0,3
anyway my next job was then I was to go to the US Navy representative through the US Embassy um to ask could they apologize ,control,40.0,6
laughs I'm not a diplomat and I don't pretend to be ,control,46.15384615384615,4
but I was also in the US Navy ,control,50.0,3
so  one thing led to another and I met with the people ,control,46.15384615384615,4
I was flown over to Hawaii with several of these Japanese to act as an intermediary watching these two groups try to communicate over a week period over something that was just the most absolutely dreadful topic for them ,control,48.71794871794872,10
dead school children ,control,0.0,1
clearly a mistake by one  an accident ,control,37.5,3
and how do you get beyond it ,control,71.42857142857143,2
all they would've been happy with if that captain of the US Navy had  all if the US Navy had allowed the captain to do what he wanted ,control,56.66666666666666,5
he wanted to apologize but he was n not allowed ,control,30.0,2
he was prohibited ,control,66.66666666666666,1
US government policy ,control,0.0,2
that's fine ,control,66.66666666666666,1
but because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing um the communication never developed ,control,41.66666666666667,11
two years after the man was fired ,control,42.85714285714285,2
the captain ,control,50.0,1
he came back to that area by himself his wife and his children and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the US government even more angry ,control,44.82758620689656,7
so  I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends the Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends but what was caught in the middle were some families and a s truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble ,control,36.53846153846153,10
stupid ,control,0.0,0
laughs ,control,0.0,0
uh when my wife was seven months pregnant we got news from her family that her mother inlaw was dying of intestinal cancer ,control,43.47826086956522,4
we were living away from them at the time ,control,66.66666666666666,3
we were living in Japan ,control,60.0,2
uh excuse me ,control,33.33333333333333,1
we were living in Germany but they were back home in Japan ,control,50.0,4
the  my wife's uh pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy ,control,35.0,4
and it was her first child ,control,50.0,2
so  I hadta go back to represent her in the Japanese mind anyway for my wife and I  to see the mother inlaw ,control,36.0,4
in a period of three months I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about ,control,40.909090909090914,6
uh the biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die ,control,41.935483870967744,7
I talked to the doctor ,control,60.0,3
uh but the father didn't know ,control,28.57142857142857,2
they kept that information from the father ,control,57.14285714285714,3
they didn't wanna tell him ,control,50.0,2
I've never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying ,control,32.142857142857146,6
the mother didn't know she was dying ,control,50.0,2
so  I was afraid that my wife couldn't get home ,control,50.0,4
um the sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and I will never be able to answer that question of what if ,control,53.84615384615385,5
so  that to me is a scared uh situation that I clearly remember ,control,57.14285714285714,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
after a series of unusually late spring uh excuse me  late winter early spring storms and a very quick warm  warming period the rivers and  and the local area overflowed ,control,21.21212121212121,5
um there were flash floods and several people were trapped or swept away ,control,15.384615384615383,3
in this case the  a young woman was trapped in the river and holding on to a tree for probably a very long time ,control,48.0,5
she looks tired and very nervous and distressed ,control,12.5,3
and it looks as though that the rescue services or hm fire technician or whomever um seemed to have arrived ,control,30.0,4
points,control,0.0,0
it's obviously very industrial ,control,40.0,2
and there is two of them points,control,42.85714285714285,4
and also the color of the vest ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and that this man risked his life in order to save this woman's uh life ,control,31.25,6
okay ,control,0.0,0
the boy is  n ah uh is on his  w has put on his backpack and is on his way out the door to school as usual ,control,55.172413793103445,11
and his  his mother is suggesting very strongly ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 please take the umbrella today ,control,16.666666666666664,2
that I watched the news and I saw that there will be rain showers later ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and the boy's saying ,control,20.0,2
 no  thank_you ,control,25.0,0
 it's not going to rain ,control,28.57142857142857,2
he then t goes out the door and turns to say goodbye to his mother but she's reminding him one more time ,control,34.78260869565217,5
 are you sure ,control,50.0,1
and he's ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 no ,control,0.0,0
 see you later ,control,25.0,1
 goodbye ,control,0.0,0
well  sure enough mother knows best ,control,0.0,0
just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour ,control,37.03703703703704,4
and the boy was running back home to get his umbrella ,control,27.27272727272727,3
when he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him ,control,52.94117647058824,4
 I told you ,control,50.0,1
and he then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school ,control,38.46153846153847,5
nothing that any other boy probably hadn't done in their life ,control,50.0,4
uh the young boy's in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window ,control,38.57142857142858,21
well  in the tradition of good old story books once upon a time there was a huh what  landowner well  well endowed family who adopted a little girl ,control,35.483870967741936,6
uh the little girl came into a family in which the mother and the two sisters  the two daughters pardon me  did not really appreciate having her around ,control,36.66666666666666,7
and as she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse ,control,29.03225806451613,5
um but n she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself ,control,44.44444444444444,7
uh clears_throat one day after ,control,40.0,3
uh excuse me ,control,33.33333333333333,1
the  in the  in the castle there was a prince and a king ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and the king was adamant that his son get married and k had been insisting and insisting ,control,41.17647058823529,3
and in order to help the son decide who might be a  suf uh an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a di dance ,control,46.875,11
invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom ,control,57.14285714285714,3
one day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that I mentioned ,control,50.0,5
and the mother and the evil sisters uh were all happy to realize and think ,control,26.666666666666668,3
 here's our chance ,control,40.0,2
 one of us  we can get married to this handsome prince ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and so they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would k uh go to the party ,control,37.5,8
and meanwhile Cinderella had been listening and thinking ,control,25.0,1
 oh  that's too bad ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she was very sad about herself ,control,66.66666666666666,3
but  and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and clears_throat one thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help Cinderella realize her dreams ,control,29.166666666666668,3
she tried to create a dress and give hope to Cinderella that she too could have a better life ,control,36.84210526315789,5
unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what Cinderella had been hoping ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and they ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others ,control,50.0,9
so  Cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made Cinderella wa to be a very very attractive woman ,control,29.545454545454547,11
on the eve of the  on the night of the dance Cinderella attended the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person ,control,54.16666666666666,5
noone could recognize that it was Cinderella because indeed she had changed so much ,control,50.0,4
uh however the fairy godmother had reminded Cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because that's when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be  revert to their original shape or character ,control,45.65217391304348,6
so  at the stroke of midnight Cillarella ,control,50.0,0
he then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman mystery woman ,control,38.095238095238095,6
he carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom ,control,52.94117647058824,6
when he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where Cinderella lived he of_course wanted to have everyone try it on ,control,48.0,8
and of_course the mother tried but it didn't fit ,control,30.0,2
and the sisters tried and the shoe didn't fit ,control,30.0,3
and Cinderella tried and it fit ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and from then on love took over ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and they lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
yesterday I was watching the news when I saw this crazy story ,control,50.0,3
uh turned out that this man was going to help h his cat that was stuck up in the tree ,control,50.0,8
so  he took the ladder out ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and the daughter was very happy that they were gonna be able to save the cat ,control,41.17647058823529,7
but once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and the girl started panicking ,control,20.0,2
so  she ran and called her mother ,control,37.5,3
and the mother called the fire department ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and the fire department came to help him down ,control,33.33333333333333,2
