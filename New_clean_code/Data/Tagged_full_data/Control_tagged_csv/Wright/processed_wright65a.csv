preferably whole wheat ,control,0.0,1
because that's the most healthy smile ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and a jar of peanut butter ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I will  get a knife to spread the peanut butter ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and I will also get a uh knife to spread the jelly along with the jar of jelly ,control,44.44444444444444,6
I will first put the peanut butter on one slic,control,40.0,3
I will either put ges,control,40.0,1
well  it looks like the little girl's kitten got stuck up in a tree ,control,43.75,4
and dad went up to help her out and get it down ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and then he got stuck in the tree ,control,50.0,3
so  they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down out_of the tree ,control,31.818181818181817,6
okay  um I'm going to tell you about the time that I had cancer and began my treatment ,control,40.0,7
um I was thirty seven years old ,control,28.57142857142857,4
an,control,100.0,0
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my shows,control,25.0,3
uh I had a modified radical mastectomy ,control,28.57142857142857,2
a,control,100.0,0
so  within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo ,control,57.14285714285714,3
lips_smack they worry a_lot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects of_course ,control,20.0,5
so  I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two ,control,41.66666666666667,3
I did not head,control,50.0,1
and um so after that first initial treatment um  head,control,18.181818181818183,3
um head,control,0.0,1
they told me not  to eat lightly on the days of my treatment ,control,42.85714285714285,7
clears_throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat laughs shrugs normally ,control,50.0,6
and  head,control,0.0,1
so  evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses ,control,37.5,5
lips_smack um  the person that I  that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the condition's getting worse is my husband's mother ,control,43.75,7
lips_smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have ges,control,29.411764705882355,6
so  it did affect her ability to communicate because she can't  hear what you're saying to her most of the time ,control,56.00000000000001,8
lips_smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her ,control,56.25,6
speak directly to her ,control,50.0,2
I think she's become very adept at reading lips and ges figuring out what you're saying without hearing it ,control,47.61904761904761,8
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation ,control,60.0,3
head,control,0.0,0
so  that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad ,control,60.0,0
um she now has the beginnings of uh shrugs basically uh Alzheimer's of the dementia type ,control,29.411764705882355,4
lips_smack so,control,0.0,1
and you can see her now and see her again in  thirty minutes and she won't remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually  as a normal rule ,control,37.5,5
she does recognize us you_know and is able to communicate hand,control,36.36363636363637,4
but basically,control,0.0,1
otherwise you're  you're having to repeat everything so many times ,control,38.46153846153847,4
you don't know if she's heard you or not ,control,54.54545454545454,2
so  that's about all you can do with that ,control,72.72727272727273,5
is just  make sure you have ges,control,25.0,4
 well  let me think laughs ,control,14.285714285714285,2
lots of them INV,control,50.0,2
but how frightened or how scared ,control,33.33333333333333,2
that's the trick ,control,75.0,2
laughs okay  um I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young  girl ,control,40.0,5
and clears_throat my parents um had a  liv we lived on a farm ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and my sister and I slept in the  bedroom that was farthest ges,control,42.85714285714285,4
and between the ges main part of the house ges and our bedroom was a long ges,control,41.17647058823529,5
so  at night when we would go to bed we had ges,control,53.84615384615385,3
and I would la lay there and try to go to sleep ,control,25.0,4
ges,control,0.0,0
but then I would go to sleep ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the points stairs ,control,46.15384615384615,6
and since the ges,control,50.0,3
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was ges next to the main part of the house ,control,45.0,8
and there was ges no way to get there except going by ges,control,30.76923076923077,6
lips_smack so  I  I lived several years in fear ,control,36.36363636363637,3
I head,control,50.0,1
and eventually the  we ges,control,33.33333333333333,0
and ges,control,0.0,1
and points,control,0.0,1
so  I hadta  points sleep next to the door ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and I hadta protect my laughs little sister ,control,25.0,2
so  that was probably the most frightened that I ever  was that I can remember ,control,58.82352941176471,0
 okay ,control,0.0,0
this um girl  has fallen into the river from somewhere ,control,45.45454545454545,3
I'm not sure if she's had a car accident and got out_of the car or if she just fell into the river or the  was walking  swimming in the river and it swept her away ,control,46.15384615384615,6

I don't know if it's a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the  limb to try to get her out_of the water ,control,50.0,7
at this point I think he's talking to her trying to get her out_of the water ,control,58.82352941176471,6
and she has her head out_of the water ,control,50.0,3
so  I'm assuming she's  not in the process of being sucked down ,control,62.5,7
I think they're trying to figure out a way to saf safely get both of them back to shore ,control,50.0,4
 okay ,control,0.0,0
