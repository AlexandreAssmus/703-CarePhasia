and they open the door to see what's going on ,control,45.45454545454545,3

and they see an angry mom and little Jonathan crying and cake everywhere ,control,15.384615384615383,4
and they wonder if there's still gonna be a party or not ,control,35.714285714285715,4
you'll probably laugh because uh this is kind_of a unique story ,control,50.0,3
um I  uh I once st owned uh two blacktailed prairie dogs ,control,15.384615384615383,2
and we  uh some friends of ours liked uh our prairie dogs so much that two hand,control,27.77777777777778,3
so  we had hand,control,40.0,1
and then one of them was going out_of the country and needed us to watch their  dum their prairie dogs ,control,38.095238095238095,6
and so um  we did ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and uh one of them was a male ,control,50.0,3
and he was a_little aggressive ,control,40.0,2
and he didn't like me very much ,control,37.5,2
and uh so I was trying to hand,control,25.0,2
uh hand,control,0.0,1
and uh so I was trying to pet him ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I was rubbing his chin hand,control,42.85714285714285,2
and he was getting all hands,control,50.0,2
and I really didn't read the warning sign very much ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and he bit me ,control,50.0,1
and took out a good chunk of my shows,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  uh so  I'm actually home um alone ,control,36.36363636363637,2
and I looks,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I can see shows,control,40.0,1
it's pretty good bite ,control,40.0,3
and uh I realize well ,control,20.0,1
 I should probably not  um I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it ,control,46.15384615384615,0
and I  I don't always do well with the sight of my own blood ,control,43.75,5
like I have no hands,control,40.0,2
but I got ges,control,25.0,1
and then like ,control,0.0,1
 oh_boy what do I do ,control,50.0,2
so  ironically or  hand,control,16.666666666666664,0
so  I hadta wrap hand,control,33.33333333333333,2
and interrupt points her class ,control,20.0,2
and  laughs to get her hand,control,14.285714285714285,3
and uh so I was standing there when she hand,control,40.0,2
you_know  I'm standing there ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I'm like ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 um the prairie dog bit me ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 can you drive me to the urgent care ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and she's like ,control,50.0,1
 okay ,control,0.0,0
so  she hasta ges,control,40.0,1
and then I get to urgent care for stitches ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona ,control,20.0,4
um w I had bought it in Texas ,control,50.0,2
and you can also buy them in Washington state ,control,44.44444444444444,3
ah but they're  they're considered restricted wildlife here ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and so I hadta completely lie about the entire ,control,33.33333333333333,3
because they ask you how you got the bite and was it an animal and whatever ,control,62.5,4
and I hadta hand,control,25.0,2
they probably would have come and taken the prairie dogs away ,control,36.36363636363637,3
so  laughs all_of_a_sudden it became a  uh um like I think I said a  a ferret ,control,36.84210526315789,5
because you're allowed to have ferrets here ,control,37.5,2
a ferret bite laughs ,control,25.0,2
anyway shrugs laughs that's my experience ,control,42.85714285714285,3
um uh my grandmother who's almost eighty is in a nursing home ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and uh she's slowly been losing her mental points,control,40.0,2
and I'm actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and um so every time I visit her I'm never quite sure what mental state she'll be in whether she recognizes me ,control,54.16666666666666,5
she  uh she usually  she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year ,control,40.0,0
and uh those people that she doesn't hand,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  usually  i sometimes I'm me her grandson ,control,54.54545454545454,2
but other times I'm other grandsons who see her more often ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and um so  uh um so you just hafta sort_of  uh it's easier to just sorta ,control,15.789473684210526,3
and get her  you_know sort_of uh force laughs her to realize who you really are ,control,31.25,4
um so you're  so you just sort_of play along ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and you basically just ask her how she's doing ,control,50.0,2
and she kind_of um makes stuff up or doesn't make a_lot_of sense ,control,23.07692307692308,3
um although I_mean h you can under  you can  she  hand,control,50.0,5
and you can understand what she's saying ,control,62.5,2
it's just that the  it's not coherent sometimes ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and so you just kind_of hafta um  take it as it goes and stay for about ten fifteen minutes ,control,25.0,6
and then  then you leave ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and it's kind_of sad ,control,40.0,1
but I think she at_least is somewhat happy to have a visitor ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  there's some solace in that ,control,62.5,3
um this is when uh my parents were still married ,control,50.0,3
and we were  I was a little hand,control,55.55555555555556,3
I was probably like  exhales seven ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and uh we we're all camping at a lake in  north of Dallas ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and we'd all gone to bed for the night ,control,50.0,3
and uh we're hand,control,40.0,1
and a really bad storm came ,control,16.666666666666664,3
we were camping hand,control,50.0,1
like in hand,control,33.33333333333333,2
and a really bad storm came that night ,control,25.0,3
and the winds really picked up ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh blew the tent  started to blow the tent hand,control,16.666666666666664,4
off its ,control,100.0,1
and uh actually started rolling all the way ,control,25.0,3
so  we were all in the tent ,control,75.0,3
and it was like rolling hands,control,50.0,3
and as it broke hands,control,40.0,2
and hands,control,0.0,1
laughs and  and my mom's screaming ,control,25.0,3
and my dad's freaking out ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and ges,control,0.0,1
um I probably would have handled it different now as an adult ,control,50.0,3
but as a kid it's really traumatic when you don't know head,control,50.0,3
and everything's hands,control,25.0,2
and  and it stopped hand,control,16.666666666666664,0
it like hand,control,66.66666666666666,1
and my dad was able hand,control,33.33333333333333,2
luckily we never got in the water ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and he was able hand,control,40.0,2
but then  um but then everything hands,control,12.5,0
but we couldn't really leave that night ,control,37.5,2
and there was some hand,control,40.0,2
so  my laughs dad sat up all night just to hands,control,41.66666666666667,2
and  and it was just a really bad camping experience ,control,27.27272727272727,0
and luckily I  we kept going and I had better experiences so I'm not afraid of camping anymore ,control,35.0,2
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid ,control,50.0,4
um I'm going to  assume  I'll  I'll say this is  uh this takes place in Arizona ,control,47.82608695652174,5
and unfortunately  I_mean it was in monsoon season ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and um there was a huge storm ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and caused uh what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent ,control,37.5,7
and um this poor woman decided that uh while she had gone that way home every day ,control,41.17647058823529,3
and she really needed to get home to um ges,control,20.0,3
and she was determined to get there across the wash that she crosses every day ,control,46.66666666666666,7
but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash ,control,50.0,4
and um didn't make it but a few feet ,control,30.0,3
and the water started um surrounding her car and uh pushing it around and f flooding her car ,control,22.22222222222222,5
and um she head,control,25.0,1
she couldn't go  reverse to get back ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and started to tumble the car ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and she managed to get her window down ,control,25.0,3
and uh um get on top of the car ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and uh waved to some people that were on the bank to call nineoneone and uh ,control,37.5,6
a rescue crew came out ,control,40.0,2
and um  um  she was able to  um well she got  uh right as they got there the water got higher ,control,24.0,4
and she got swept off the top of her car ,control,60.0,5
and it was floating downstream ,control,40.0,1
and they were able to uh shimmy out on a  a limb ,control,46.15384615384615,5
and she was able to get close enough to him ,control,40.0,5
and uh they were able to grab her and uh pull her to safety ,control,35.714285714285715,5
and she was okay ,control,50.0,1
