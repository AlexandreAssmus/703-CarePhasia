okay ,control,0.0,0
first you get some bread out_of the pantry ,control,37.5,3
and then you go to the refrigerator ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and you get a jar of jelly ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh and then you hafta ges,control,16.666666666666664,1
and you ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
you open up twists,control,50.0,1
you open up twists,control,50.0,1
and then you open up the bag of bread ,control,44.44444444444444,3
you take two slices of the bread out ,control,50.0,4
and you get a butter knife from the drawer ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and you take out ges,control,40.0,1
and you smear it ges,control,40.0,2
and then you take that same knife and use it to ges,control,33.33333333333333,3
and spread that ges,control,25.0,2
and then you claps,control,25.0,1
hadta think about that ,control,50.0,2
I was like ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 wow how ,control,33.33333333333333,0
so  little Sally was playing with her cat out in the front yard of the house ,control,52.94117647058824,5
she was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them ,control,57.14285714285714,5
the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and little Sally was worried about points,control,28.57142857142857,3
so  she went and found a ladder ,control,37.5,3
she was gonna put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said ,control,47.368421052631575,4
 oh_no  no  don't worry about it ,control,40.0,2
 points,control,0.0,1
at which point the dog came back and scared the man ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and he ran up into the tree ,control,57.14285714285714,3
little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree ,control,43.75,5
so  she hadta call the  pfoli the firemen so_that they could come and rescue everybody ,control,47.05882352941176,3
I will tell you about having my tonsils out laughs at the  at uh uh points,control,52.94117647058824,7
uh I had had strep throat five times in one year ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to hafta come out ,control,33.33333333333333,4
which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult ,control,50.0,4
and I still had them at all ,control,28.57142857142857,2
so  uh my sister came into town to uh stay with me traces,control,35.714285714285715,3
and I hadta go to Scottsdale ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um I think I went to Scottsdale_Samaritan to have it done ,control,36.36363636363637,4
but it  they did it like on a day surgery ,control,45.45454545454545,3
um but what I remember about it most is al it hurt ,control,50.0,3
but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning ,control,41.66666666666667,5
but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  by the time I got in there I was like a little bit dehydrated ,control,43.75,4
so  they couldn't find a vein touches,control,44.44444444444444,2
and they hadta stick me like six times in_order_to touches,control,30.0,5
and that was very very unpleasant laughs ,control,28.57142857142857,3
um they  they finally got it in ges,control,44.44444444444444,0
they had The_Wall on for the music ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and I was like ,control,50.0,1
 oh  that's gonna be great ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 you're gonna gimme drugs ,control,42.85714285714285,3
 and I'm listening to Pink_Floyd ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 so  this is gonna be a good day ,control,45.45454545454545,3
uh so  did that um laid down on the gurney ,control,45.45454545454545,3
they gave me ges,control,50.0,1
and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery ,control,46.15384615384615,4
uh ges,control,0.0,1
it was painful ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I felt I wanted to cry ,control,33.33333333333333,3
in_fact  I did cry just because it was so unpleasant ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and it hurt so bad ,control,20.0,2
um they were trying to give me like some water to help kind_of ges,control,35.714285714285715,4
and I couldn't swallow it ,control,50.0,1
so  it was coming back out_of my nose ,control,55.55555555555556,3
it was just  it was a mess ,control,62.5,3
it was horrible ,control,66.66666666666666,1
um but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out ,control,25.0,3
but it was like arms,control,60.0,2
um and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out ,control,58.333333333333336,3
so  I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to  to feel better ,control,28.57142857142857,4
the only thing I could eat were popsicles ,control,50.0,3
um you_know  people were like ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 oh  you always get ice cream ,control,12.5,2
 you get ice cream ,control,20.0,2
but I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have ice cream ,control,41.66666666666667,3
so  that made it that much worse ,control,50.0,0
um I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt  it was burning my throat ,control,50.0,4
um and it was probably  it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that ,control,42.10526315789473,4
um and I've had people ask me you_know ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 if you hadta do it all over again ,control,44.44444444444444,0
I was like ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 scoffs I'd have just  I'd just continue to have strep throat ,control,26.666666666666668,4
that's what I would continue to do ,control,62.5,3
I would not have had them out at my age points,control,63.63636363636363,3
so  laughs ,control,0.0,1
mhm ,control,0.0,0
yes ,control,0.0,0
uh,control,0.0,0
and they were  actually I spent a_lot_of time in Iraq and Afghanistan ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you ,control,40.0,3
so  it's  it's collectively a scary situation all the time because you're in a country and kind_of a situation where not everybody likes you ,control,58.620689655172406,5
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just don't want you there ,control,46.66666666666666,3
so  when we would hafta go ges,control,50.0,0
um any time you're on the road you're essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks ,control,52.94117647058824,5
so  you're constantly having to watch and look around points,control,33.33333333333333,4
um one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you don't stop on the road ,control,52.38095238095239,5
you just  you always keep going ges,control,25.0,2
ges,control,0.0,0
you always keep going keep going keep going ,control,12.5,5
and  we were part of a convoy ,control,50.0,4
it was like a ges,control,80.0,3
but I guess points,control,25.0,1
or he didn't get the memo that you don't stop because it makes you a target ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and he decided to stop for some cows ges,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  he decided to stop ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and we all lost our xxx ges,control,42.85714285714285,2
I_mean we were like ,control,50.0,1
 what are you doing ,control,60.0,1
but you don't wanna get out because that also makes you a target ,control,50.0,3
so  everybody's ges,control,40.0,0
 get back in the vehicles ,control,33.33333333333333,4
 get back in the vehicles ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and you're having to yell it ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  it was a little bit of a  of a crazy situation ,control,57.14285714285714,6
um the whole thing probably lasted  maybe two minutes ,control,10.0,2
maybe two minutes ,control,0.0,1
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to  to everything ,control,44.82758620689656,8
so  yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation ,control,41.66666666666667,4
yes ,control,0.0,0
um  th this person  they have dɪfɪkəlpɪu ,control,22.22222222222222,0
I_mean they have the ability to talk ,control,28.57142857142857,3
they are  um  don't have the skill base in talking with adults though ,control,43.75,7
um it's a friend of mine who teaches at a ges,control,58.333333333333336,5
so  she spends a_lot_of time around ges,control,50.0,4
so  when it comes time to ges,control,50.0,0
um  more it's being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time ges,control,31.818181818181817,5
um I think there's probably some selfesteem issues that go with that ,control,46.15384615384615,5
so  she's not out ,control,50.0,1
she's not socializing ,control,50.0,1
and then when she does go it's like puffs,control,60.0,2
it's like ges,control,75.0,1
or if there's something that's bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like you_know ,control,47.82608695652174,7
 do you wanna talk ,control,40.0,2
 do you wanna talk ,control,40.0,2
 do you wanna talk ,control,40.0,2
and you don't ever say anything ,control,42.85714285714285,1
so  um  eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as that's just part of that person's behavior ,control,40.0,7
um and that's how they're  they're choosing not to communicate by ges,control,50.0,4
 okay ,control,0.0,0
so  little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer ,control,33.33333333333333,5
he had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him ,control,60.0,4
but his dad said ,control,25.0,2
 no I'm very busy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 I hafta watch tv ,control,20.0,1
so  little Billy was kicking the ball around by himself ,control,45.45454545454545,2
and then the ball went too far ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and it went points,control,25.0,1
and it smashed points,control,25.0,1
little Billy's dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said ,control,29.411764705882355,5
 guess I should have gone out there and played with him ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and now I have dysfunctional family stories ,control,14.285714285714285,3
so  laughs ,control,0.0,1
 okay ,control,0.0,0
one morning little Billy was getting ready to go to school ,control,18.181818181818183,4
his mom said ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 little Billy before you leave make sure you take an umbrella ,control,33.33333333333333,0
and little Billy said ,control,0.0,2
 Mom  I live in Arizona ,control,28.57142857142857,0
 it never rains here ,control,20.0,1
 I certainly won't need an umbrella ,control,37.5,2
and mom said ,control,0.0,1
 okay  suit yourself ,control,20.0,2
so  little Billy started walking to school ,control,25.0,0
he got about halfway to school when it started to  he started to feel raindrops on his head ,control,47.368421052631575,6
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 hm,control,0.0,0
but the longer it went on the harder it rained ,control,50.0,3
so  he ran all the way home ,control,50.0,3
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 you know what  Mom ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 you were right ,control,50.0,1
 I should have taken an umbrella ,control,57.14285714285714,2
so  she gave him the umbrella ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and little Billy continued to walk in  s walk to school ,control,16.666666666666664,5
and he thought to himself ,control,60.0,2
 boy Arizona weather  changes from minute to minute  kinda ,control,8.333333333333332,3
so  laughs ,control,0.0,1
okay ,control,0.0,0
so  Cinderella was living with her father ,control,50.0,3
her mother had died a long time ago ,control,37.5,3
and her father had decided ,control,40.0,2
 it's time that you had a mother ,control,55.55555555555556,4
 and you need some brothers and sisters ,control,25.0,0
so  he went out ges,control,50.0,1
and he found a woman who he thought he could like ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and he married her and brought her and her two s daughters ges,control,30.76923076923077,5
 here you go ,control,25.0,1
 here's your family ,control,40.0,2
 uh you now have a new mother ,control,25.0,2
 and you have new sisters to go along with it ,control,36.36363636363637,0
well  what the father didn't know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet ,control,52.63157894736842,5
and they treated Cinderella horribly ,control,20.0,1
they made her do all the cooking ,control,57.14285714285714,3
they made her do all the cleaning while he was off ges,control,66.66666666666666,3
that's why he wasn't around ,control,71.42857142857143,2
that's why he didn't know what was going on ,control,72.72727272727273,3
so  uh  the ,control,40.0,0
Cinderella i is having to do all the housework ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and she's taking care of everything ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and the evil sis stepsisters are just you_know bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were uh there ges,control,33.33333333333333,4
and she would talk to them ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and they would talk to her because they had that special communication ,control,58.333333333333336,3
um then one day from where Cinderella was at she  when she would talking with the animals she could see like arms,control,56.52173913043478,6
and off in the distance ges,control,33.33333333333333,3
and she always thought ,control,25.0,1
 wow it would be so neat if I could live in a castle ,control,57.14285714285714,4
 that would just be amazing ,control,50.0,0
 but I'm Cinderella and that won't ever happen because I hafta make sure that I ges,control,42.10526315789473,0
meanwhile  ges,control,0.0,2
and people in the town are ges,control,42.85714285714285,4
so  he's a little bit worried about it ,control,60.0,3
so  he says ,control,50.0,2
 okay here's what we'll do ,control,50.0,2
 we will put this whole proclamation thing out ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 and we will get ges,control,33.33333333333333,2
 and we'll let the prince pick one ,control,33.33333333333333,0
 you_know  with all the women spreads,control,37.5,4
 so  we'll bring them all here ,control,55.55555555555556,2
so  they send out a message to ges,control,55.55555555555556,2
they say ,control,50.0,1
 okay  we're having this big birthday party for the prince ,control,38.46153846153847,4
 bring your single daughters ges,control,16.666666666666664,2
 and because he is going to be picking a wife ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and the evil stepmother gets this message ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  this is great ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 I'm going to put my daughters because then we can get out_of this hovel and move back in ges,control,38.095238095238095,4
and we'll be all rich and famous ,control,37.5,2
and Cinderella thinks ,control,0.0,1
 wow that would be kinda cool ,control,42.85714285714285,0
 um maybe I could get into this because I'm pretty good at you_know sewing and everything ,control,50.0,4
 and I've actually made a dress ,control,37.5,2
 so  you_know  I should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters ,control,42.10526315789473,3
so  she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and the ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
 wow she looks a_lot points better than we do ,control,30.0,3
 so  we can't let that happen ,control,44.44444444444444,2
so  they rip up ges,control,50.0,1
and then they take her ,control,40.0,1
and they like ges,control,25.0,1
and then they take off ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
and Cinderella is really sad ,control,20.0,2
and she's like ,control,50.0,1
 oh_no  this is really a bummer ,control,37.5,2
and while she's upset she finds this book ges,control,50.0,2
and while flipping through the book she sees a reference to a fairy godmother ,control,50.0,8
so  she reads the reference and all_of_a_sudden poofo opens,control,30.0,3
and she says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  Cinderella I'm here to help you out uh because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things ,control,40.0,4
 I'm gonna grant you some wishes ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 and we're gonna get you to ges,control,40.0,0
and so Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 okay  well  what are  how do we make this happen ,control,42.85714285714285,3
she said ,control,50.0,1
 well  first we need the  a way to get you there ,control,28.57142857142857,4
so  she takes Cinderella's little animal friends ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her ges,control,53.333333333333336,6
she turns the mice into coachmen ,control,50.0,2
and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into uh a big carriage ges,control,40.0,6
so  she does all of this ,control,71.42857142857143,3
and then she says ,control,25.0,1
 bingo ges,control,0.0,1
 the catch is  is that you gotta be back by midnight ,control,50.0,5
and Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 midnight shrugs that's cool ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 I can live with that ,control,66.66666666666666,2
so  she goes over to uh the coach ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and they get in there and they take her up ,control,40.0,2
and she's escorted into the big ball party ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and everybody is looking going ,control,40.0,1
 wow who's that amazing looking girl over there ,control,30.0,0
 we've never seen her before ,control,57.14285714285714,1
 but she must be new ,control,50.0,1
so  she comes in ,control,40.0,1
and the stepsisters see her ,control,40.0,2
and they're like ,control,50.0,1
 she looks familiar but we can't quite place her ,control,36.36363636363637,2
 but something's just not right ,control,28.57142857142857,2
so  the prince sees her and says ,control,37.5,2
 wow you're a pretty good looking girl ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 let's go dance ,control,20.0,2
 let's talk ,control,25.0,2
so  they're dancing ,control,60.0,1
and they're talking ,control,50.0,1
they're having a great time ,control,50.0,2
and he's like ,control,50.0,1
 wow this is amazing ,control,40.0,1
 I think I found the woman of my dreams ,control,50.0,5
when she happens to look at the clock and says ,control,40.0,4
 oh  I got to go and imit,control,11.11111111111111,2
and while she's running off to get back into uh the coach she loses a shoe ,control,47.05882352941176,8
so  she drops ges,control,40.0,1
but she ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
and at midnight bingo opens,control,20.0,3
and everything goes back to normal ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but she still has the other glass slipper ,control,25.0,2
so  she says ,control,50.0,2
 oh  this is a nice souvenir ,control,37.5,2
so  she holds on to that ,control,71.42857142857143,2
and then uh the next day the prince is like ,control,40.0,2
 well  I gotta find this girl because this is the woman of my dreams ,control,47.05882352941176,5
 so  I have this shoe ,control,42.85714285714285,2
