well  sighs this a story of um lips_smack a cat that climbed the tree ,control,40.0,7
and apparently didn't wanna get down  or couldn't get down ,control,30.76923076923077,2
and so the little girl asked the dad to climb up the tree to get the cat ,control,29.411764705882355,4
and  um and I   when he got up the tree,control,41.66666666666667,3
because the dog is  cl is barking ,control,50.0,3
and he is  like he's wanting to climb the tree ,control,50.0,4
so  they're stuck ,control,60.0,1
you've got the father in the tree ,control,62.5,3
lips_smack he's stuck in the tree now because there's no ladder for him to get down ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and the cat seems to be content up in the tree ,control,45.45454545454545,5
does not wanna get down ,control,40.0,2
and so somehow I don't know who called shrugs but s uh the fire department is here ,control,27.77777777777778,3
and they're here to rescue the dad and the ca ,control,36.36363636363637,4
we'll I've  th I've had very good health ,control,50.0,3
and I have not um had any major,control,37.5,2
which put me about fifty three ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  I've been really healthy ,control,57.14285714285714,2
bu,control,0.0,0
I ha,control,50.0,1
it was the sl one ,control,60.0,2
and um lips_smack the pain was so severe that I was on around the clock um lips_smack medication ,control,38.88888888888889,6
Oxycontin ,control,0.0,0
um lips_smack uh m um lips_smack Morphine_sulfate did not relieve my pain at all ,control,14.285714285714285,4
um I either hadta get Dilaudid ,control,16.666666666666664,3
um or get a shot ,control,20.0,2
or  um lips_smack or be on my Oxycontin ,control,33.33333333333333,4
because um I could not walk ,control,50.0,1
it was the most severe pain I've ever had in my whole life ,control,50.0,5
an,control,100.0,0
lips_smack and I had two options ,control,16.666666666666664,3
I h could either um lips_smack ges try some kind of um therappeutic ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and I opted for surgery ,control,40.0,2
and so a week later I went in to have a discectomy on  i on my sl one ,control,42.10526315789473,5
it's between my ll five and my sl one ,control,50.0,4
and uh it's been about two and a half years now ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and the pain has gone away ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but I still have um side effects that probably will stay with me ,control,38.46153846153847,4
however  I would rather have those side effects than the severe pain and not be able to function ,control,36.84210526315789,4
so  there ,control,66.66666666666666,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
on,control,100.0,0
and so my daughter took him in ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and we found out through uh several tests m_r_is  c_t scans that  um that he had a tumor ,control,35.0,5
and this w tumor had wrapped around the kidney and had pushed out the liver ,control,46.66666666666666,3
and that's how we found out that he had  uh uh he had a tumor ,control,52.94117647058824,4
lips_smack so  we went to,control,50.0,2
and it was diagnosed that he had a rare form of kidney cancer which is called clear cell sarcoma ,control,42.10526315789473,7
which only one in about twenty children a year uh get ,control,27.27272727272727,5
and um it was  um it was diagnosed as stage three cancer ,control,38.46153846153847,3
which means that it had  um an well lips_smack it had metastasized to,control,42.85714285714285,5
however  it was in  c contained to the lymph nodes hopefully ,control,46.15384615384615,6
um and so that was a scary situation in my family ,control,45.45454545454545,4
um you_know  not knowing exactly what the outcome was ,control,30.0,3
and having to  with my daughter uh uh you_know i it was  i it was a very hard i um situation  to know that your daughter is in this with her little boy ,control,47.22222222222222,6
and you can't say ,control,40.0,1
 yes ,control,0.0,0
 everything will be uh  fine ,control,42.85714285714285,2
a hundred percent sure ,control,25.0,3
and so uh i it was scary becau,control,37.5,2
and number two it was such a  s a little  little child that you didn't know what the results or the aftereffects of finger,control,44.44444444444444,6
and so that was a  scary time in our family ,control,45.45454545454545,4
okay ,control,0.0,0
um I am a  a school nurse ,control,50.0,2
and I have a program in my school ,control,50.0,4
and it's called SMD which is severely mentally uh disabled children ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and these uh children have uh traumanic ,control,14.285714285714285,2
or they're severely disabled where they're  uh they barely can function ,control,50.0,3
they're usually in  they are in wheelchairs ,control,66.66666666666666,3
um all their ADLs are done for them ,control,62.5,2
they are  they don't communicate at all  ges verbally ,control,50.0,4
and so basically the only way that you can f communicate with them a_lot is,control,46.66666666666666,4
um by the way maybe points,control,33.33333333333333,3
or if they're,control,75.0,2
um the way that you touch them ,control,57.14285714285714,2
um lips_smack uh maybe just communicating ,control,0.0,2
um some of them  um well lips_smack I have several classes ,control,33.33333333333333,0
there's another class that's MOMD which is a_little  more ges,control,46.15384615384615,4
and so in that class we communicate by sign language ,control,40.0,3
like this ges,control,66.66666666666666,2
or you_know something like ges,control,40.0,3
so  sometimes we do sign language with those kids ,control,50.0,3
and we com communicate with them that way ,control,50.0,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
the beginning of the story it looks like there is this little gir,control,53.84615384615385,5
and somehow  I don't know how she got into a raging  river ,control,40.0,4
but it looks really cold ,control,20.0,2
um lips_smack  uh and  the uh fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her ,control,18.75,2
and he has all his equipment on ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and basically he hasta go out into this raging river,control,40.0,3
um and he's grabbing on to some kind of head,control,54.54545454545454,4
and then he's got some kind of a belt or something to,control,46.15384615384615,4
but he's also out there um in  in danger in his life too ,control,40.0,5
lips_smack okay ,control,0.0,1
there's this little boy probably ten twelve years ol,control,20.0,3
and he's out playing soccer just having a really fun time ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and um the ball goes through  shrugs possibly maybe the neighbor's uh window ,control,20.0,3
or maybe it's his own front window ,control,37.5,2
and um lips_smack the ball lan er knocks over a lamp ,control,27.27272727272727,4
so  actually it breaks the finger,control,28.57142857142857,2
and the man was sitting in a chair ,control,50.0,3
and then he picks up the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and he looks out the window ,control,50.0,2
and that's all in those pictures ,control,71.42857142857143,3
so  I don't know what the end of the story is ,control,61.53846153846154,5
I don't know what the little boy does  d ,control,36.36363636363637,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
points I love this one because this is typical typical of kids and mothers okay ,control,40.0,6
so  the little boy is getting ready to go to school ,control,33.33333333333333,4

and he goes to school ,control,40.0,2
and I hope he learned a lesson to always listen to your mom ,control,38.46153846153847,6
once upon a time lips_smack there was a little girl named Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and she lived with her dad ,control,50.0,3
her mom had died years ago ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  it was just her  herself and her dad ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and then one day her dad remarried ,control,14.285714285714285,2

and the stepmom lips_smack was not a very nice mom ,control,30.0,3
and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and so they made Cinderella do all the chores ,control,33.33333333333333,3
they made her do the dishes ,control,50.0,3
and scrub the floor ,control,25.0,2
and make the beds ,control,25.0,2
and make the food ,control,25.0,2
and they would not let Cinderella be part of the family ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and they made Cinderella lips_smack sleep upstairs in the addict ,control,30.0,3
and so all her  fr all  the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there ,control,44.44444444444444,6
and she would look out her window ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and she could see far beyond the city  the castle ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and she would sit and watch and wonder ,control,25.0,2
oh what a beautiful place that she maybe some day would wanna go and see ,control,40.0,5
lips_smack well meanwhile there was the prince ,control,28.57142857142857,2

and the prince's father wanted him to get married ,control,30.0,3
because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom ,control,44.44444444444444,3

they could not believe that she  was able to find something so pretty to wear ,control,37.5,6

lips_smack and the prince caught eye  on her ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and fell in love with her ,control,50.0,2
and that's the only girl that he danced with  with for the rest of the night ,control,61.11111111111112,7
and she had the most beautiful time dancing ,control,25.0,4
