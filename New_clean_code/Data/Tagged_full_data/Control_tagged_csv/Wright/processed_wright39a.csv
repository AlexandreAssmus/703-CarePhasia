and my best friend Grace and I were at the Seven_Eleven which was new to town ,control,50.0,6
enjoying a Slurpee because every Friday we got to go to Seven_Eleven to get a Slurpee ,control,37.5,5

and fill up her gas tank ,control,33.33333333333333,2

um I stay ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and there's a_lot_of traffic ,control,20.0,2
and I decide to cross ,control,20.0,2

flipped ,control,0.0,0
and we find out later my leg is broken ,control,44.44444444444444,3

and uh called an ambulance ,control,20.0,2
they took me to the hospital ,control,66.66666666666666,3
set my leg ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I had a cast up to my hip ,control,62.5,4
I went home ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and was homeschooled for about three weeks ,control,28.57142857142857,4
but all in all it was very comfortable ,control,50.0,3
friends came to see me ,control,20.0,2
and it turned out it was a student teacher at our school laughs that hit me ,control,56.25,5
that was kind_of um an odd coincidence in our town ,control,50.0,5
but I healed very well ,control,20.0,2
and that's my story laughs ,control,50.0,3
can you imagine how the poor ,control,66.66666666666666,2
I take a class ,control,50.0,2
and at the class I noticed a,control,57.14285714285714,3
and then I heard him speak to the teacher ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and ges,control,0.0,1
it was s slightly impaired ,control,60.0,2
but you could understand him ,control,60.0,1
but it was uh uh very kind of nasal in the back of his throat ,control,46.66666666666666,6
um this is a tap class ,control,50.0,2
so  we dance ,control,50.0,1
and I was amazed to find out later that he actually was deaf ,control,46.15384615384615,4
um and he wears um heavy duty ges,control,12.5,2
I don't know much detail about it ,control,50.0,3
but yet he can feel the rhythm ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and he can tap dance ,control,40.0,1
but to understand him I just hafta look at him ,control,40.0,2
and listen very closely ,control,0.0,2
and I can understand him completely ,control,50.0,1
he's a responsible adult ,control,60.0,2
holds a job ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um and it hasn't affected him negatively in any other way ,control,41.66666666666667,3
um it just  you just hafta take time ,control,22.22222222222222,0
and listen carefully ,control,0.0,1
and watch him ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and that's how we've overcome it ,control,75.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
um my friends and I decided to go for a hike ,control,36.36363636363637,4
uh one is especially adventurous ,control,20.0,2
uh his name is Leo ,control,40.0,2
and my roommate Suzette and the man I was dating at the time was named Lee ,control,43.75,7
we took off on a hike ,control,66.66666666666666,3
well  equipped with backpacks full of snacks waters ,control,22.22222222222222,7
it was an beautiful day ,control,60.0,2
uh coo,control,0.0,1
and we planned to spend the whole day ,control,25.0,3
a_lot_of it  uh our plans were based on Leo ,control,50.0,0
he was uh more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy ,control,25.0,5
so  we went not knowing where we were going ,control,60.0,2
we just trusted him ,control,50.0,1
we got along ,control,33.33333333333333,1
had a snack ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and been gone about two and a half hours ,control,22.22222222222222,4
and nex,control,0.0,1
ready to head back uh to our destination ,control,25.0,4
and we're lost ,control,50.0,1
um three of us have absolutely no clue no concept of where we are ,control,57.14285714285714,5
we're surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look ,control,45.45454545454545,4
so  there really was no direction ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend Leo ,control,47.05882352941176,5
uh Leo doesn't panic ,control,20.0,1
I started to feel a_little panicked because I had uh twisted my knee a little bit ,control,37.5,3
so  I had a_little compromised gait ,control,42.85714285714285,1
and it was a_little tender ,control,40.0,1
but I didn't wanna complain ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I knew there's nothing we could do about it ,control,63.63636363636363,5
we just hadta get back home ,control,16.666666666666664,2
so  for the first time I really felt quite uh afraid that we might not make it ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and what to do about my knee ,control,42.85714285714285,3
we persevered ,control,50.0,1
we trusted Leo ,control,33.33333333333333,1
he  he uh went off on a couple wrong paths ,control,45.45454545454545,0
but he got us back on track ,control,42.85714285714285,3
got us back to the car ,control,50.0,4
my leg was fine ,control,50.0,2
and it all ended very well ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it was a great memory ,control,60.0,2
we laughed about it ,control,75.0,2
and um I won't go hiking with Leo again laughs ,control,27.27272727272727,4
the end laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it had been raining for days and days ,control,50.0,3
and everyone knew the river was rising ,control,42.85714285714285,3
residents in the area were warned to leave town ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and to find shelter elsewhere  elsewhere until the r river  river waters went down ,control,18.75,4
uh one family the Jones would not leave ,control,25.0,3

and never felt like they were threatened ,control,42.85714285714285,2

and uh Mister and Missus Jones looked around ,control,0.0,3
and they didn't see their daughter ,control,42.85714285714285,2

and the water had already risen that high ,control,37.5,2
so  she had been swept away by the river ,control,60.0,3
the parents suddenly realized ,control,25.0,2
they heard a yelling and a screaming ,control,42.85714285714285,3
they looked from the rooftop ,control,60.0,3
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river ,control,46.66666666666666,6
luckily with our technology the Jones had a cellphone ,control,44.44444444444444,3
they dialed nineoneone and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid ,control,31.25,7
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out ,control,33.33333333333333,3
they threw out a line across the river ,control,62.5,3
it was secure ,control,66.66666666666666,1
he climbed out clinging to the rope ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and saw the Jones' daughter ,control,16.666666666666664,3
he reached down ,control,66.66666666666666,1
grabbed her ,control,50.0,1
she grabbed ahold of his arm ,control,66.66666666666666,4
he wrapped a th s uh device around hi her waist to secure her body to his ,control,41.17647058823529,3
and climbed back across the rope back to the riverside ,control,40.0,4
Jessica was safe ,control,33.33333333333333,1
the family were delighted to see that she was okay ,control,50.0,4
but they learned a lesson ,control,40.0,2
next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home ,control,40.0,4

her mother had died ,control,50.0,2
the father was lonely ,control,50.0,2

and she did not see Cinderella as her own ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  she made her more of a house servant than a daughter ,control,53.84615384615385,4

and clean house ,control,0.0,1
