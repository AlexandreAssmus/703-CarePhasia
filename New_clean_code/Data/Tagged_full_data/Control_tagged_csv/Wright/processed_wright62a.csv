apparently a birthday uh uh celebration is planned ,control,25.0,2
and uh there is a cake with four candles on the table ,control,41.66666666666667,6
um we see on the right uh two women uh uh one already in  in the room the other entering through the doorway ,control,37.5,6
and each has a child ,control,40.0,2
the women already inside has a little boy ,control,25.0,2
and the women just entering is with a little girl ,control,40.0,3
both of  both children who are entering uh have wrapped presents presumably for the party ,control,50.0,4
um when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it a pretty good size portion of it ,control,51.85185185185185,4
and uh there are pieces of cake on the table ,control,40.0,4
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to what we percieve  what we see as a dog sort_of hiding underneath the sofa ,control,45.83333333333333,9
and the hostess apparently the women who's giving the party is standing there facing the dog ,control,41.17647058823529,4
she has a broom in her hand ,control,57.14285714285714,3
she appears to be very angry ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and the  uh the birthday boy uh laughs we can't tell what he's doing ,control,41.17647058823529,3
he seems to be w ,control,60.0,2
I can't tell weather he's wiping his eyes ,control,50.0,3
his  mou hi his uh mouth is wide open apparently uh to call or do something ,control,23.52941176470588,3
and looks as though the woman  the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom ,control,45.45454545454545,6
oh my favorite food laughs ,control,20.0,2
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,12.5,3
my way or the common way ,control,33.33333333333333,2
laughs well  we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all ,control,22.727272727272727,7
but use a good bread ,control,20.0,2
sometimes it's nice to toast it first ,control,37.5,2
uh on the other hand it's not necessary ,control,44.44444444444444,3
it's whatever you feel like at the time ,control,77.77777777777779,4
well  uh having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading ,control,31.25,4
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first ,control,33.33333333333333,6
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it ,control,54.54545454545454,3
it works better ,control,33.33333333333333,1
spread  uh spread the ,control,20.0,2
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread ,control,53.333333333333336,5
well  after that um a little bit of butter ,control,40.0,0
not too much but some ,control,20.0,1
uh tends to help uh make the thing a little bit m more moist than usual ,control,18.75,6
and on top of that goes the jelly ,control,50.0,4
now uh having done so  what a_lot_of people fail to have ever learned is uh you_know regardless of how much uh bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth ,control,30.952380952380956,8
well  there's an easy way around that ,control,44.44444444444444,3
most people don't know my special secret ,control,25.0,2
my special secret is lettuce ,control,40.0,2
nice uh leaves of iceberg lettuce ,control,16.666666666666664,3
just a couple is just right to do it ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had ,control,21.428571428571427,3
I got a_lot of them but I can tell you  I'll tell you this one ,control,58.82352941176471,4
um when the Korean_War started uh I was twenty one and One_a ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and um in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself uh in a  in  ar in a stinky rice paddy uh shooting people uh I arranged or  I  I applied for the Air_force's uh Aviation Cadet program ,control,30.23255813953488,10
um and uh I was  I was appointed ,control,44.44444444444444,2
I finally got an appointment to an air  air cadet class ,control,33.33333333333333,5
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia ,control,50.0,5
and uh in those times ,control,40.0,3
well  I never did uh do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid ,control,48.14814814814815,2
uh in the  I was still in the  in the  within the very first  uh I guess  it was just the first phase of  of training ,control,50.0,7
uh I had already d had some flying instruction ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh I awoke one Saturday morning ,control,14.285714285714285,2
uh no  actually it was a Sunday morning ,control,44.44444444444444,2
I awoke feeling hungover ,control,25.0,2
I knew the hungover feeling ,control,40.0,3
uh but I had not had  I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then ,control,33.33333333333333,7
I was only in my twenties ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and uh I thought ,control,25.0,1
 boy_oh_boy this is terrible ,control,40.0,2
so  I kind_of stayed ar you_know just  I hung back all day ,control,28.57142857142857,3
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover ,control,12.5,2
well  I knew that I didn't feel well enough to fly ,control,30.76923076923077,4
I was not safe ,control,50.0,1
so  I put myself into sick call ,control,50.0,3
well  this was  this was a civilian contract flying school ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and they had a f infirmary but only a  you_know it wasn't  it wasn't a hospital ,control,40.0,4
so  I found myself in the infirmary ,control,62.5,3
well  I wasn't feeling too good but I wasn't feeling quite as bad as I had ,control,31.57894736842105,2
you_know  little by little it sort_of left ,control,25.0,3
and it got to the point where you_know the doctors would come in they'd looked at me and they'd say ,control,54.54545454545454,5
 well  you don't have any jaundice but your liver and your uh s uh spleen are enlarged ,control,30.0,4
 and we know there is something very very wrong going on internally ,control,30.76923076923077,3
 we don't know what it is ,control,62.5,2
well  laughs story ,control,0.0,1
uh we even  I  I  I  I felt good enough at or for  after awhile that I  you could even played a little bit of wheelchair football ,control,42.42424242424242,5
but then one of the medics came in and he said ,control,36.36363636363637,4
 okay ,control,0.0,0
he says ,control,50.0,1
 I'sd ,control,0.0,0
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 no you're not ,control,40.0,1
he said ,control,50.0,1
 yes I am ,control,50.0,1
he says ,control,50.0,1
 don't worry  sir ,control,16.666666666666664,1
he says ,control,50.0,1
 I givesd ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I thought ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  not another one ,control,16.666666666666664,0
well  he did ,control,25.0,2
didn't seem to make very much difference ,control,12.5,4
upshot of it all was that they gave up ,control,77.77777777777779,4
they didn't  they couldn't begin to imagine ,control,40.0,0
they had never seen a situation like this with an  with a  uh an uh enlarged and palpable liver palpable spleen and no jaundice ,control,42.30769230769231,8
it wasn't anything they had ever seen before ,control,66.66666666666666,3
next thing you know I was sitting in the back of a  s of a uh staff car uh being driven from there down to the uh Tyndall Air Force Base in uh Tallahassee Florida ,control,38.88888888888889,14
well  they put me in there ,control,28.57142857142857,2
they still didn't know ,control,40.0,1
you_know lots_of poking around uh but finally they just said ,control,10.0,3
 okay  you are  you are confined to just bed rest ,control,38.46153846153847,5
 don't get out_of bed ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 except to go to the bathroom ,control,42.85714285714285,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
well  it got pretty boring ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and I was feeling pretty good ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  I'd wander around at night ,control,50.0,2
and you_know I'd have the buddies over in the next ward or something like that ,control,56.25,3
we'd have visit ,control,75.0,1
or I'd get the nurses to give me ice_cream or something like that ,control,50.0,5
well  one morning the flight surgeon came around ,control,11.11111111111111,2
didn't find me in my bed ,control,57.14285714285714,3
he was very disappointed ,control,50.0,2
and when I returned from wandering around visiting my buddies I was feeling pretty good ,control,40.0,4
he said ,control,50.0,1
 if you get ou ,control,60.0,0
he says ,control,50.0,1
 if ever I catch you out_of bed again ,control,44.44444444444444,0
he says ,control,50.0,1
 that's court marshal ,control,40.0,2
 that's the story ,control,60.0,2
well  it turned out that there was a new disease that they  nobody knew anything about ,control,55.55555555555556,4
the year would have been nineteen fifty one ,control,50.0,2
and the disease is called infectious mononucleosis ,control,28.57142857142857,2
you get it from kissing ,control,60.0,2
hm that was that girlfriend I had back in town ,control,50.0,5
back  up there in Moltrey ,control,16.666666666666664,0
that's what it was ,control,100.0,2
okay  that was the adventure ,control,50.0,0
however  end of the story ,control,50.0,3
uh one year later  a li little over a year later I found myself in Korea ,control,35.294117647058826,5
and I was  uh I  f I  fe I felt the needta go to the uh flight surgeon uh for another slight malady known as crabs ,control,37.93103448275862,9
you get them from toilet seats  over there ,control,33.33333333333333,3
this is in Korea ,control,75.0,2
lo_and_behold it was the same flight surgeon who I met the year before ,control,53.84615384615385,5
and we had a good laugh ,control,33.33333333333333,2
that's the story laughs ,control,60.0,3
yes ,control,0.0,0
I think I already have ,control,40.0,2
not at all ,control,0.0,1
I have a hearing problem ,control,40.0,2
and uh you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU uh uh gave a  uh uh uh a workshop over time it was several weeks where we come over and we'd learn all about hearing loss ,control,40.0,6
well  it ended up with me being a regular patient here ,control,50.0,4
and uh what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss ,control,53.333333333333336,4
well  uh even now uh I find that many people particularly young women uh they've been taught to talk through their nose real fast ,control,26.923076923076923,5
and that's what they do ,control,66.66666666666666,2
imit,control,0.0,0
and I hafta say to them ,control,50.0,2
 excuse_me I have a hearing problem ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 it's not your problem it's mine ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and uh after several times of asking them to repeat what they said I've had  I  I explain that ,control,45.45454545454545,8
 I have a hearing problem ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 I don't understand what you just said ,control,44.44444444444444,2
 now if you would be kind enough please to s speak a_little more slowly and perhaps put some space between your words then I'll not hafta  uh then I'll not hafta ask you continually to repeat yourself ,control,31.70731707317073,7
 okay ,control,0.0,0
that's how I handle that ,control,83.33333333333334,2
you bet I have ,control,50.0,2
the beginning is uh this occured in  um laughs this occurred in uh Louisiana ,control,40.0,4
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and um uh we were then flying ,control,28.57142857142857,1
I was a fighter pilot ,control,60.0,2
we were then flying the  sw the uh swept wing version of the Fl eighty four known as the Fl eighty four Fl ,control,33.33333333333333,9
uh and we were  um we had been out or  uh on a  you_know a series of missions ,control,42.85714285714285,4
uh and we were just returning to the base ,control,44.44444444444444,3
well  uh actually I was by myself ,control,50.0,2
I was flying solo not in formation with anybody ,control,55.55555555555556,4
it was  it was just a  uh just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane ,control,42.30769230769231,8
and also proficiency ,control,0.0,1
just practice ,control,0.0,1
practice this practice that ,control,50.0,2
well  uh in those times we  uh uh we had a  a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at uh three hundred and forty knots air speed ,control,37.142857142857146,7
when directly over the air  when we were directly over the end of the runway we'd cut our power back ges,control,60.86956521739131,6
and uh uh that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees ,control,33.33333333333333,4
after that the airplane is slow enough so_that we would  uh we would have not have touched the throttle ,control,60.0,3
in other words it cut power completely ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and just bring it on around ges,control,42.85714285714285,2
well  um the  uh th um the  the legs of the  of a  f of the pattern are called the approach ,control,42.30769230769231,7
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind ,control,16.666666666666664,2
ninety degrees from that is the base ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and f f following that is the final ,control,37.5,3
so  it's just frel if  ges,control,44.44444444444444,2
well  here I am on the base leg with no power ,control,50.0,3
all the garbage is out ,control,60.0,2
we call it garbage ,control,50.0,1
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and all_of_a_sudden I'm about I don't know  three four hundred feet off the ground ,control,41.17647058823529,5
no  m more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet ,control,23.07692307692308,0
something like that ,control,100.0,2
I'm not really sure ,control,40.0,1
the airplane started to shutter ,control,20.0,2
uh shuttering is the sign of a stall ,control,50.0,4
that means the air  w when an  when an airplane stalls it means it's falling out_of the sky ,control,52.38095238095239,5
and I knew immediately people do not survive these  a situation like this ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and yet I automatically didn't even  I  I almost didn't have time to think ,control,27.77777777777778,3
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway ,control,62.96296296296296,9
I didn't want that to happen ,control,42.85714285714285,2
well  what did I do ,control,50.0,1
I gave it full power which did not catch in time ,control,45.45454545454545,4
I pulled in the  the landing gear ,control,50.0,3
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone ,control,36.36363636363637,3
well  with low r_p_m there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended ,control,28.57142857142857,4
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down ,control,60.0,3
I overshot the runway ,control,50.0,2
but I wouldn't  I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side ,control,56.00000000000001,0
and um laughs the Fl eighty four Fl has a  a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that th the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left hand,control,32.35294117647059,2
you can't predict it but it will do that ,control,60.0,2
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe because its a jet ,control,50.0,8
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward ges,control,41.66666666666667,3
well  pretty soon there came the ground ,control,25.0,2
in retrospect I can remember very well that the  the horizon was jumping up and down ,control,41.17647058823529,3
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction ges,control,26.666666666666668,4
it yawed ,control,50.0,1
and as I say uh I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on ,control,58.06451612903226,5
well  eventually it did  it did uh come to rest ,control,25.0,3
it had  the  it had yawed to the right so_that at full power the engine was or  the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in  pla which is always in place uh for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up ,control,50.0,17
well  laughs they about panicked ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well  at which I followed the proper procedures ,control,44.44444444444444,0
uh I cut all power turned everything off ,control,50.0,2
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I  th I  I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing ,control,45.71428571428572,6
I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again ,control,40.0,5
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground ,control,55.55555555555556,4
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels ,control,50.0,4
uh and it  d i it did fly again ,control,40.0,0
so  did I of_course ,control,60.0,1
but in this  this moment of panic was  it  i it was only a  fla you_know only a quick flash fingers,control,44.0,3
it was  the  the thought was ,control,62.5,3
 I'll do what's  I know what I needta do but people don't  don't walk away from these things ,control,48.0,3
I walked away ,control,33.33333333333333,1
it was later determined that um while I was  I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots ,control,44.44444444444444,7
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and he's  he was  h uh his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating ,control,46.66666666666666,7
but he could tell that he was overtaking me ,control,66.66666666666666,2
so  obviously it was an air speed problem ,control,33.33333333333333,3
from what I see I haven't the foggiest idea of what it  what is really going on ,control,57.89473684210527,5
I see a man who appears to be lying  possibly lying on his back ,control,40.0,8
um I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch ,control,46.15384615384615,6
uh he is  l over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish ,control,52.17391304347826,8
uh so  possibly she's there to help him and doesn't know what to ,control,31.25,3
you_know  I don't know if she even knows what to do ,control,38.46153846153847,3
uh I don't know any more than that ,control,55.55555555555556,3
I_mean I can tell you what I see which is uh uh uh some kind of a belt uh which he has uh around his left arm ,control,51.85185185185185,7
um he appears to be quite mucu muscular ,control,25.0,4
she appears to be uh very concerned ,control,28.57142857142857,3
that's as much as I can tell you ,control,66.66666666666666,3
laughs a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks ,control,40.0,4
it goes into the air ,control,60.0,3
it encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it ,control,53.333333333333336,4
uh a man sitting in a chair l looks like an easy chair um uh is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp ,control,40.0,6
he then stands picks up the soccer ball looks out the window to see ,control,35.714285714285715,3
 let's see how did it get here ,control,44.44444444444444,3
that's the story ,control,75.0,2
a little boy is ready to go to school ,control,33.33333333333333,4
apparently the weather is somewhat threatening ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella ,control,50.0,4
well  he refuses ,control,25.0,2
he is going to be very brave ,control,42.85714285714285,3
nothing's gonna stop him ,control,50.0,2
he doesn't need an umbrella ,control,50.0,2
that's for sissies ,control,75.0,2
out he goes into the weather ,control,66.66666666666666,3
it's raining ,control,66.66666666666666,1
it's raining hard ,control,50.0,1
it's raining so hard that he's stepping in puddles ,control,54.54545454545454,4
he's getting soaked ,control,75.0,1
his hair is dripping ,control,50.0,2
he returns home much to the conversation ,control,42.85714285714285,3
well  apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella ,control,40.74074074074074,6
well  this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disney's that's for sure ,control,40.0,5
Cinderella was a good girl ,control,40.0,2
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters ,control,18.181818181818183,3
and um um um th they were pampered spoiled and they were nasty ,control,30.76923076923077,2
and Cinderella was called Cinder Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace ,control,37.03703703703704,3
she hadta take out the  uh uh take out the cinders and do things like that ,control,41.17647058823529,5
so  it was pretty dirty ,control,50.0,2
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom uh decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one ,control,38.095238095238095,5
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother uh got an  in got invitations to go ,control,27.77777777777778,5
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home ,control,14.285714285714285,2
but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared out_of nowhere and said to her ,control,42.10526315789473,3
 look  you deserve to go ,control,14.285714285714285,2
 we could arrange this but there are conditions ,control,44.44444444444444,2
 first of all um w there will be a coach for you pulled by horses ,control,62.5,4
 and um there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers ,control,35.294117647058826,0
 and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at  at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be out_of there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin ,control,56.09756097560976,7
Cinderella went to the ball ,control,40.0,3
the prince f could not take his eyes of ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and she had a wonderful time ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but all_of_a_sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve ,control,33.33333333333333,3
she knew she hadta get the heck out_of there really fast ,control,36.36363636363637,5
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers ,control,44.44444444444444,4
but it didn't make any difference ,control,42.85714285714285,2
she got out  she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home ,control,35.0,5
well  the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away ,control,50.0,3
but that didn't matter because he wanted her ,control,55.55555555555556,2
he was  he was so struck by h what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was ,control,60.0,4
so  he decreed that uh there would  a search would occur over the  over the kingdom until  uh until the  until Cinderella was  until the woman was found ,control,55.88235294117647,6
now why was this  why was this such a thing ,control,72.72727272727273,3
well  Cinderella had tiny feet ,control,0.0,2
and the glass slipper was so tiny that very few people  very few grownups could fit into it ,control,31.57894736842105,5
so  he  he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who  who  whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one ,control,55.172413793103445,7
well  lo_and_behold uh uh in his search  his search was successful ,control,30.76923076923077,3
they did find  they did find Cinderella as the one who  whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper ,control,47.61904761904761,8
and they were married and lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,3
we see here a tree ,control,40.0,2
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs um holding on to it sort_of so to speak an an and barking ,control,43.47826086956522,5
in a branch  in  in the  in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of uh rescuing a cat wh who is uh on one of the smaller branches ,control,51.16279069767442,14
under  directly underneath of which is a little girl uh who  uh who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down ,control,46.42857142857143,6
uh she has a tricycle in front of her ,control,55.55555555555556,5
and we see uh uh near the little girl a ladder on the ground uh which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is ,control,50.0,6
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains as I say  remains on the ground ,control,50.0,13
uh that's  um that's what we  s that's what we  ap that's what we see to the left  left side of the trunk of a tree ,control,58.82352941176471,11
on the right side is another branch uh which had a few leaves on it ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and uh one of  on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing ,control,44.44444444444444,6
at the same time we see in the  in the distance directly uh to the right of the truck a firetruck and two  what appear to be two firemen each  each uh carrying an end of a ladder which presumably is going to be  they will use uh to climb the tree  rescue the man laughs and uh probably the cat as_well ,control,40.298507462686565,9
