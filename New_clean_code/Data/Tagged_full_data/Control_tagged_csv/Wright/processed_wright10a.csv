but mine hit the bumps and ,control,33.33333333333333,2
as my body was coming off of a bump my bike had hit another bump and came back up ,control,52.63157894736842,7
and I heard a loud and felt a really loud pop ,control,27.27272727272727,4
and  I stopped the bike or the bike stopped itself ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and  I realized I was in a_lot_of pain ,control,44.44444444444444,3
couldn't move ,control,33.33333333333333,1
so  my husband came back ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he took me off the bike ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and laid me on the ground ,control,50.0,3
and I remember making sounds ,control,20.0,1
I remember I was embarrassed at the same time that I was in pain because I was making sounds like an animal ,control,63.63636363636363,7
it was embarrassing ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and uh I told my husband I could not get back on the bike ,control,42.85714285714285,5
that I couldn't do it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I couldn't move ,control,50.0,1
and I was in too much pain ,control,42.85714285714285,4

so  he lifted me back on the bike ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and he put both of my hands on the steering wheel or  the um handlebars ,control,43.75,4
and he put my feet on the pedals ,control,50.0,3
and  he drove  he drove ahead of me ,control,40.0,4
and he  he went as quickly as he could back to the car ,control,50.0,5
meanwhile  it took me about an hour to get three miles ,control,25.0,3
and I made it back to the car ,control,50.0,4
and he hadta lift me off ,control,50.0,2
and put me in the seat ,control,50.0,3
it took three hours for us to get home or  to the hospital ,control,35.714285714285715,4
and xrays and everything ,control,25.0,1
broken back ,control,50.0,1

my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia ,control,37.5,3
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia ,control,60.0,3
so  her first language is Mandarin Chinese ,control,37.5,2
and then her second language is English ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and  I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods instead_of really understanding things ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and it's taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her even_though she insists she understands ,control,47.61904761904761,4
you_know  and the the very next day she'll not have a clue what I had told her ,control,47.368421052631575,4
and so I have just learned to um uh watch for cues that she's not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding ,control,26.923076923076923,7
and I've hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase in_order_to make sure that she understands ,control,23.809523809523807,7
I was in the military ,control,80.0,3
I'd just come to Phoenix from Korea ,control,50.0,2
and I didn't know anybody yet ,control,42.85714285714285,1
and so I got a parttime job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard ,control,42.10526315789473,7
and I worked middle of the night shift all night shift ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed ,control,55.55555555555556,5
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes ,control,40.0,6
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons ,control,27.27272727272727,3
we weren't allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon ,control,43.75,3
there's actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for selfdefense or as a weapon ,control,44.44444444444444,7
so  on this fifty acre site there was one light pole ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds ,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  all around you it's pitch black ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and you're just under this light pole ,control,50.0,3
and you can't see beyond the darkness or  beyond the light ,control,46.15384615384615,3
and so I would sit there at night ,control,37.5,2
and uh  one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work ,control,29.411764705882355,0
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and this time it was around three in the morning ,control,50.0,3
and I didn't realize that they were going to be coming that early ,control,50.0,4
and I was s sitting where I shouldn't have been sitting ,control,66.66666666666666,3
I was just outside the light so_that I could see ,control,70.0,4
because it's creepy ,control,75.0,1
very creepy all night long ,control,20.0,3
and so you_know by three o'clock in the morning I was already on edge ,control,42.85714285714285,6
and all_of_a_sudden ,control,0.0,1
and I hadn't seen anybody approaching ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but all_of_a_sudden a man jumped out from behind a close_by Port_a_Potty ,control,45.45454545454545,4
he yelled ,control,50.0,1
and he had a rope in his hand ,control,50.0,3
and he was stretching the rope in_between his hands like this ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and he yelled ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I screamed ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and he laughed ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up ,control,52.63157894736842,4
and he continued to laugh ,control,20.0,2
and I cried because it had scared me so badly laughs ,control,45.45454545454545,3
laughs as it turns out he was just one of the construction workers that showed up early and maybe got dropped off along the road ,control,52.0,10
yeah laughs ,control,0.0,1

and the  there were roads that were impassable ,control,44.44444444444444,3
there were roadblocks up everywhere ,control,20.0,3
but every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads ,control,30.76923076923077,5
they don't realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water ,control,56.25,4
and that it's much deeper than they realized ,control,55.55555555555556,2
one father had gone across the or  had attempted to cross the road ,control,35.714285714285715,4
he thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine ,control,50.0,3
then as they entered the water very quickly the hand,control,40.0,2
and pushed his truck right off the road ,control,37.5,3
he and his daughter were the only ones in the truck ,control,54.54545454545454,4
daughter was in her seatbelt ,control,60.0,3
he was able to get out_of his seatbelt ,control,37.5,5
then he climbed to the top of the truck ,control,55.55555555555556,5
and over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter ,control,46.15384615384615,5
the water swept them off the top of the truck ,control,60.0,5
and as they  as they were swept downstream they caught a tree ,control,53.84615384615385,3
and the girl hung on to the tree alone because her father had been swept further down ,control,47.05882352941176,3
and he hadta grab another tree down the way ,control,44.44444444444444,3
someone watching who had seen everything had called nineoneone ,control,55.55555555555556,4
the fire department got there ,control,20.0,2
and they saw the little girl clinging to the tree ,control,40.0,4
one particularly strong handsome young fire fighter  put on his life vest ,control,15.384615384615383,4
jumped out into the water ,control,60.0,3
grabbed the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,2
put his arms around the little girl ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and she clung to him  knowing that her life depended on it ,control,53.84615384615385,4
he held her very tightly while he put another belt around her ,control,58.333333333333336,3
it was a belt similar to the one he was wearing ,control,63.63636363636363,6
and they  they tied themselves together with the belt ,control,50.0,0
and his friends back on shore the other fire fighters pulled him back to the shore with the girl ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and when she was safe a different fire fighter went in after the father ,control,50.0,3
and got him safely out ,control,20.0,1
and they gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law ,control,41.66666666666667,5
laughs and he got a bill for fifteen hundred dollars for the rescue of him and his daughter ,control,44.44444444444444,8
