one day I was out to lunch with my friend Bill ,control,54.54545454545454,3
it was a work day ,control,60.0,2
and we were at Mimi's cafe ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and my stomach started hurting ,control,20.0,2
and I thought shrugs that it might just be stre,control,50.0,3
so  I ignored it ,control,60.0,1
but by seven o'clock that night I was throwing up constantly ,control,45.45454545454545,3
it never  the pain never let up ,control,37.5,0
and I was just throwing up throwing up throwing up ,control,50.0,3
at five o'clock in the morning I decided well I had decided before but  at five o'clock in the morning I felt comfortable calling my exhusband's father my ex father inlaw to come get the two older kids ,control,32.5,6
who were shrugs  ten and nine at the time ,control,40.0,3
and I didn't have my third one ,control,37.5,2
so  my two kids ,control,40.0,0
um and take them to his wife ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and drive me to the hospital ,control,50.0,3
which he did ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and I spent from,control,50.0,1
uh they did a_lot_of tests on me ,control,57.14285714285714,3
they found out that I have one kidney ,control,50.0,3
I was thirty one years old ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and I had no idea I only had one kidney ,control,30.0,4
but they looked for kidney stones ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and they only saw one kidney which was huge ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and they thought ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 what's going on ,control,60.0,1
they looked for the other one ,control,50.0,3
they never found it because I don't have another one ,control,54.54545454545454,3
so  I found out I didn't have another kidney ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and I also found out I didn't have kidney stones ,control,36.36363636363637,3
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis ,control,45.45454545454545,2
and it was about to kill me ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  Doctor Geiger came ,control,20.0,2
he was the anesthesiologist ,control,75.0,2
he introduced himself ,control,66.66666666666666,1
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists ,control,58.333333333333336,4
I said ,control,50.0,1
 yes ,control,0.0,0
I was in a_lot_of pain ,control,60.0,2
because the pain medication they had given me um ,control,55.55555555555556,2
I couldn't have any more ,control,50.0,2
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons ,control,25.0,3
so  I was in a_lot_of pain ,control,57.14285714285714,2
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things ,control,42.85714285714285,11
and so Doctor Geiger put me under ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly ,control,44.44444444444444,3
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a ges,control,50.0,4
what are those things called ,control,60.0,2
a ventilation tube down my throat ,control,50.0,3
um and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up ,control,50.0,4
and they gave me some medication ,control,50.0,2
and sent me home ,control,25.0,1
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo ges,control,11.11111111111111,3
and now I have a third baby ,control,28.57142857142857,2
the end ,control,50.0,1
okay  one time I was at ,control,42.85714285714285,2
oh was it Sea_World ,control,50.0,1
it was Sea_World in San_Diego ,control,60.0,2
with three children ,control,33.33333333333333,2
uh one of which was in a stroller ,control,62.5,3
and I was walking ,control,50.0,1
and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said ,control,53.333333333333336,8
 look ,control,0.0,1
so  I was looking ,control,60.0,1
and then there was a man off to the right of the  of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily ,control,62.96296296296296,12
and I looked up at him and there was  he was indicating to me something ,control,62.5,4
and I looked to my right ,control,50.0,3
and there's a woman there with a stroller ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and she's fuming at me ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and she's telling her husband six feet away to tell me that I'm in her way ,control,50.0,5
and I look over at the woman ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and she looks at me like she wants to  hit me ,control,50.0,4
and she's points yelling at her husband to tell me points,control,33.33333333333333,4
um so  I looked at her husband ,control,50.0,3
and I looked at her ,control,60.0,2
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 she can talk to me ,control,66.66666666666666,2
 and the words excuse me work very well ,control,22.22222222222222,3
um and so I looked at her ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she continued to fume at me ,control,42.85714285714285,3
didn't say a single thing to me um until after her husband had told me to move ,control,50.0,3
um then she cussed at me and called me a name ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and um so I basically let her live her miserable life ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and um that's all I really did about it ,control,60.0,4
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred and six degree temperature ,control,29.411764705882355,5
so  I took her to the emergency room ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and um she wouldn't take anything orally ,control,37.5,1
she jus,control,50.0,1
um and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard even_though her temperature was a hundred and six was a good sign ,control,51.85185185185185,5
so  they gave her um um ,control,42.85714285714285,1
um what's the nice way to say this ,control,44.44444444444444,3
a rectal fever reducer ,control,25.0,1
and she eventually got better ,control,20.0,1
we got her on antibiotics ,control,60.0,2
um but I was extremely afraid because it was my first child ,control,50.0,3
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred and six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature ,control,52.0,4
so  I took her to the hospital ,control,62.5,3
and she eventually got better ,control,20.0,1
okay  once upon a ti,control,33.33333333333333,0
it was raining very hard ,control,40.0,2
but she hadta get home ,control,20.0,2
and so she crossed the bridge ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but the bridge wasn't very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was ges decaying the under girders ,control,42.10526315789473,5
made that up ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and so the bridge gave way ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and the girl fell off of the bridge ,control,50.0,4
for she was really riding a bike ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and it was a rumbly bridge ,control,50.0,2
and she fell into the water ,control,50.0,3
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help ,control,36.36363636363637,3
eventually someone heard her cries for help ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and put on all the rescue  necessary rescue gear ,control,30.0,3
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and she was very grateful ,control,40.0,2
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him ,control,64.28571428571429,5
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 don't ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain ,control,42.85714285714285,6
 and be safe ,control,25.0,2
the end ,control,50.0,1
one day a bo,control,25.0,2
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball ,control,25.0,5
and he kicked it into the air ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and it crashed through a neighbor's window ,control,37.5,4
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window ,control,50.0,5
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window ,control,45.45454545454545,3
but the boy ran away ,control,20.0,2
and the man walked outside looking for the boy ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball ,control,23.07692307692308,3
the man scolded him ,control,50.0,2
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge ,control,31.25,7
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even ,control,41.17647058823529,3
the end ,control,50.0,1
one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and told him to take an umbrella ,control,28.57142857142857,3
the boy said ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 no I'll be fine mom ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and the mother was hesitant ,control,40.0,2
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella ,control,45.83333333333333,10
then the boy was walking to school ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and it started to rain ,control,20.0,2
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did ,control,52.63157894736842,4
and so he,control,33.33333333333333,1
and wetly came in the door saying nothing ,control,37.5,3
but showing his mother that she was indeed right ,control,44.44444444444444,2
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being ,control,43.47826086956522,6
so  she gave it to him ,control,71.42857142857143,2
and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mother's love ,control,42.85714285714285,5
the end ,control,50.0,1
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella ,control,40.0,3
I would guess ,control,66.66666666666666,1
there was a little girl ,control,40.0,2
and her father was widowed ,control,40.0,2
and so he remarried ,control,25.0,1
and the new stepmother had two daughters the w girl's age ,control,16.666666666666664,4
and the stepmother was not very nice ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and as the dad got out_of the picture by an unfortunate series of events um the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave ,control,45.83333333333333,5
and turned her into basically a scullery maid ,control,37.5,3
and made her clean out the fireplace ,control,42.85714285714285,3
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I don't know what her name was before ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and the  one da,control,20.0,2
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife ,control,50.0,4
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress ,control,27.77777777777778,8
and the ,control,50.0,1
let's just call her the wicked stepmother ,control,37.5,3
the wicked stepmother um was not interested in letting Cinderella go ,control,27.27272727272727,5
so  when Cinderella came downstairs she,control,42.85714285714285,0
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress ,control,36.36363636363637,3
actually  not Cinderella ,control,0.0,0
she didn't do that at all ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and um they had taken things from the sisters ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress ,control,41.66666666666667,5
Cinderella was very sad ,control,25.0,2
but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and a,control,50.0,1
her rather plump fairy godmother came ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown ,control,25.0,3
turned the mice into coachmen and  horses ,control,25.0,3
and turned a pumpkin into a coach ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and Cinderella went to the castle ,control,33.33333333333333,3
the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her ,control,40.0,4
what are the chances ,control,75.0,2
and um as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight the magic would wear off ,control,52.94117647058824,3
and so when the crock ,control,40.0,2
leaving one of her beautiful glass slipper,control,28.57142857142857,4
uh however,control,0.0,1
so,control,0.0,0
even_though the prince had spent couple hours with her ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and went looking for her using the glass slipper ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and when the people came to the door of Cinderella's abode ,control,41.66666666666667,7
um the stepmother locked her in  had locked her in because s they didn't want her to find  she didn't want him to find  she didn't want them to find her ,control,48.64864864864865,8
and so they,control,33.33333333333333,1
she raced downstairs ,control,33.33333333333333,1
the shoe fit perfectly,control,25.0,2
they found Cinderella,control,33.33333333333333,1
and Cinderella went to the palace ,control,33.33333333333333,3
married the prince ,control,33.33333333333333,2
rode off in a coach ,control,60.0,3
and they lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
the end ,control,50.0,1
one day a girl was out playing ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she had her do,control,40.0,2
and no she had a cat ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and she and the cat were playing ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and the  do a dog came by and chased the cat up the tree ,control,46.66666666666666,4
the little girl couldn't reach the cat ,control,37.5,2
so  she called her dad ,control,50.0,2
her dad came with a ladder ,control,50.0,3
and climbed up the tree ,control,40.0,3
but the ladder fell ,control,25.0,2
the dog continued to bark ,control,20.0,2
the dad was stuck ,control,50.0,2
the cat contentedly sat at the end of the branch ,control,50.0,5
and the little girl still couldn't reach the cat ,control,30.0,2
so   she called the fireman to come save the dad and the cat ,control,28.57142857142857,5
and they brought their ladder ,control,40.0,2
and saved them all ,control,50.0,2
and sent the doggie home ,control,20.0,2
and had a talk with the doggie's owner about a leash law ,control,38.46153846153847,5
the end ,control,50.0,1
um well  I guess I can back up and say that the girl rode her bike to the place where she played with her cat ,control,50.0,9
but that was a long time ago ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and there was a bird singing happily in all the cacophony ,control,45.45454545454545,5
the end ,control,50.0,1
