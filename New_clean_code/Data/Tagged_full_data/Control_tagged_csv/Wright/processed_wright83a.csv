 the little boy was going to school  I guess ,control,36.36363636363637,2

so  when he got out there it started raining real hard ,control,33.33333333333333,3
he ran back to the house  in the rain ,control,50.0,5
and his mother  told his mother ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she gave him an umbrella ,control,60.0,2
and he went on to school laughs ,control,42.85714285714285,3
once a ,control,50.0,1
there was once upon a time a  a motha ugly mother and her two ugly  gir and her two ugly girls  daughters ,control,28.000000000000004,6
and they were very selfish children ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and evidently the ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I don't know who it was ,control,71.42857142857143,2
 but it brought  it brought the other  Cinderella to her home to take care of ,control,33.33333333333333,0
she hadta take care of the  ch the Cinderella ,control,40.0,5
well  Cinderella was a very beautiful little girl ,control,22.22222222222222,3

so  she just went  uh uh try to do the best she could ,control,33.33333333333333,5
she hadta do all the work for them ,control,62.5,3
and one day uh she looked in a trunk ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and there was a beautiful dress in there ,control,25.0,3
so  she hung this hand,control,50.0,2
and uh I  and then the fairy godmother came and  to her and was talking to her ,control,36.84210526315789,3
so  then the  w evidently the fairy godmother must have talked to her ,control,53.333333333333336,2
then  the  the  moth the h ugly mother received a invitation to the  uh a ball for them all ,control,43.47826086956522,6
and Cinderella wanted to go ,control,0.0,2
and the fairy godmother was there  for her ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and uh uh  she ges put on  I think she put on this pretty pink dress ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and then there was  uh m then when she  then the m fairy godmother evidently ordered a pumpkin with four horses and a fellow to  to uh  take her in there ,control,28.57142857142857,5
and she was dressed up ,control,60.0,1
then they had put beautiful clothes on her ,control,50.0,2

and th she was leaving she dropped it ,control,50.0,2
and they looked all over for the slipper and uh where the little girl was ,control,40.0,3
because uh the prince was very enchanted with her ,control,55.55555555555556,3
 well  I guess the jester or the footman or somebody had tried the  sli the slippers on all the other daughters and the mother ,control,40.74074074074074,7
wouldn't fit ,control,33.33333333333333,1
but it fit the little girl Cinderella ,control,28.57142857142857,2
then  cinder then uh I guess the bo footman went back to the prince and told him ,control,27.77777777777778,5
and the prince went to her and fitted her foot with the shoe ,control,46.15384615384615,4
