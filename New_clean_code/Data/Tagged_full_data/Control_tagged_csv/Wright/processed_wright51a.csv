yeah  well  get your slice of bread whether wheat or white ,control,23.07692307692308,3
uh what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first ,control,33.33333333333333,4

uh put the knife into the peanut butter ,control,37.5,3
uh take out a  sc take out a scoops ,control,40.0,3
spread it over the bread ,control,60.0,3
uh and then I open up a,control,42.85714285714285,1
and I usually use a spoon for that ,control,50.0,2
uh put that on the other slice of bread ,control,44.44444444444444,4
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter ,control,40.0,5
spread it over the bread ,control,60.0,3
and put the two slices together ,control,16.666666666666664,2
a little girl was uh  riding through the neighborhood on her bike ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree ,control,54.54545454545454,4
uh  uh her father came along ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and said ,control,0.0,1
 what is it dear ,control,60.0,1
she says ,control,50.0,1
 Dad  my cat's in the tree ,control,44.44444444444444,0
 well  I can get the cat out ,control,44.44444444444444,2
 let me go get my ladder ,control,28.57142857142857,4
father sniffles went and got the ladder ,control,14.285714285714285,3
climbed up the tree ,control,50.0,3
and then a neighborhood dog came by ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and noticed a man up in a tree ,control,50.0,3
and started barking at the man up the tree ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and accidentally knocked down the ladder ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  the man was stuck in the ladder along laughs with the cat ,control,57.14285714285714,5
and the fire department hadta be called to uh rescue them both ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh it was about I guess  about seven years ago I really hurt my back ,control,37.5,6
there's this family that I go and visit that has a little child ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and from the time that child was born as a little boy uh I always picked him up and swung him around ,control,45.45454545454545,6
uh but as this boy was getting older  as I was getting older I  I guess  I can't do some of the things that  that uh I n normally do ,control,45.71428571428572,8
uh this particular uh time I picked the boy up ,control,40.0,2
and I was swinging him around ,control,66.66666666666666,1
m b swinging  picking him up by the arms ,control,50.0,4
and I spread my legs wide open ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I was swinging him uh backwards and forwards ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I felt something snap in my back ,control,50.0,4
uh I was in excruciating pain ,control,50.0,3
I almost dropped the kid laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids ,control,60.0,6
but this was pain like I have never felt before ,control,60.0,2
because even just to walk or  or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms it's all tied into the back ,control,36.66666666666666,6
it would be like a knife was twisting so ,control,66.66666666666666,3
that's  that's the injury ,control,71.42857142857143,3
and it put me out_of commission for a couple of weeks ,control,54.54545454545454,4
uh and uh the thing that comes to the  to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating with someone else ,control,51.85185185185185,7
uh it's the family that I described earlier with a child ,control,58.333333333333336,5
they're Hispanic ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and their English is not very good ,control,28.57142857142857,2
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school ,control,38.46153846153847,4
uh but whenever uh oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want ,control,40.0,5
I help them with their homework ,control,66.66666666666666,3
my wife she speaks Spanish ,control,40.0,2
so  it's alright when she goes over there ,control,50.0,3
but when it comes to me trying to convey my thoughts ,control,45.45454545454545,3
uh and uh trying to convey my wants and desires ,control,10.0,3
and also me trying to listen to theirs ,control,37.5,3
I don't always understand what they're talking about ,control,60.0,3
or  and then  and they don't understand what I'm talking about ,control,40.0,0
yeah  in high school a friend of mine  myself and a friend of mine we ditched uh class so_that we could climb Camelback_Mountain ,control,40.0,0
neither one of us had ever climbed Camelback_Mountain ,control,50.0,3
so  we didn't realize exactly you_know where to go or where to start ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh we just picked a spot on the uh northern side of the mountain ,control,42.85714285714285,6
you_know  walked in between some of those uh very expensive homes ,control,41.66666666666667,6
and started climbing ,control,0.0,1
little did we know uh we really had gotten ourselves in  in a_lot_of trouble doing that ,control,47.05882352941176,4
uh there were times where we were actually ch hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs you_know uh uh just to  just to get from one point to another ,control,34.375,5
uh about halfway up uh we're sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot ,control,50.0,3
and uh I said to him I says ,control,50.0,2
 man there's no way we can go back the same way we came ,control,40.0,5
and he says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I know ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I'm serious ,control,50.0,1
he goes ,control,50.0,1
 so am I ,control,50.0,2
and so we knew the only way  the only thing  we  we figured what we hadta do is uh make it to the top ,control,40.74074074074074,5
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side ,control,50.0,5
but then we would still hafta hike all laughs the way back around the mountain to get to our car ,control,40.0,5
uh  to make a long story short ,control,12.5,0
uh you_know  we were all scuffed  k scuffed up ,control,36.36363636363637,5
we were tired scratched up chlor clothes torn ,control,37.5,2
uh but uh we could finally see we were kind_of getting to the top ,control,42.85714285714285,4
as we were approaching the top we saw more people uh up there ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and uh older people younger people ,control,0.0,2
a we couldn't believe it that you_know these people  all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time ,control,59.25925925925925,6
so  when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we  sa we asked them ,control,59.09090909090909,1
 how'd you get up here ,control,57.14285714285714,1
they said ,control,50.0,1
 oh  we took this trail you_know down here on the other side ,control,28.57142857142857,4
a and laughs we couldn't believe that there was a trail ,control,50.0,3
laughs so  uh uh after that experience uh you_know I thank God for helping us through it ,control,44.44444444444444,5
uh because it  uh it really  it really made me understand why people hadta be rescued from Camelback_Mountain ,control,40.0,4
and I understand how people can get stuck ,control,50.0,2
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges ,control,27.27272727272727,4
but prior to that experience uh I  I  I couldn't understand how could people n get to a certain place and not get back down the same way ,control,35.483870967741936,4
uh a couple decided they would go uh white water rafting ,control,27.27272727272727,3
uh  and so  uh they were white water rafting ,control,27.27272727272727,3
the man told his girlfriend to put on her vest ,control,40.0,3
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I can swim ,control,50.0,1
 I don't needta put on a vest ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and he goes ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  I'm gonna put mine on because I think that's just a safe thing to do ,control,42.85714285714285,5
so  as they're white water rafting the further down they got the rougher the water uh became ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and uh as  uh as they continued to go down uh the water got so rough that her life vest  uh uh her life vest fell out_of the boat ,control,29.03225806451613,5
and seconds later the boat tipped over ,control,28.57142857142857,2
so  both of them are  are  are  uh are in the water with the rapids  in the  in the rapids hitting rocks uh with the heavy flow of the stream going  going by them ,control,53.65853658536586,9
fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to  to stay afloat uh a and last long enough to  to float to the edge and grab a branch ,control,34.375,7
his uh girlfriend was coming quickly behind him ,control,50.0,2
and as he's hanging onto the branch he's reaching for her ,control,69.23076923076923,5
uh early one morning uh s it's time for little Johnny to go to school ,control,25.0,4
little Johnny's about to walk out the door ,control,22.22222222222222,4
but mom stops him ,control,25.0,1
and says ,control,0.0,1
 Johnny uh you better take this umbrella with you because I heard the forecast ,control,46.66666666666666,3
 and I think it's gonna rain ,control,33.33333333333333,3
Johnny says ,control,0.0,1
 oh  Mom ,control,0.0,0
 I don't need an umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 umbrellas are for sissies ,control,40.0,2
 and besides a little bit of rain isn't going to hurt me ,control,35.714285714285715,4
she says ,control,50.0,1
 I think you should take it ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 no I don't need it ,control,42.85714285714285,1
 I'll see you later  Mom ,control,37.5,2
so  as Johnny is walking to school it starts to rain ,control,33.33333333333333,3
at first a little bit and then harder and harder ,control,20.0,2
and as Johnny is walking he's putting his hands over his head trying to stop all the wetness from falling uh on his face ,control,48.0,7
and he's hating himself for not having to  n for not having uh to get that umbrella ,control,31.57894736842105,5
so  he races back home uh you_know  he races back home ,control,23.07692307692308,3
and when his mom opens the door he's soaking wet ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and his mom looks at him disappointedly ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and said ,control,0.0,1
 see you're all wet because you didn't take the umbrella ,control,46.15384615384615,3
 maybe next time you'll listen to me ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  Johnny took the umbrella ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and went outside while it was still raining ,control,37.5,2
and this time he used it ,control,50.0,2
and he figured ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 hey  I guess umbrellas aren't for sissies after all ,control,25.0,3
Bobby loves to play soccer ,control,0.0,2
he loves playing soccer so much he can even play by himself ,control,41.66666666666667,5
he was outside in his front yard one day just practicing kicking the ball ,control,35.714285714285715,4
uh he kicked it so hard boomo ,control,28.57142857142857,3
it went right through his neighbor's window ,control,37.5,4
and when it went through the window it went right into the neighbors living room ,control,46.66666666666666,4
knocked over a lamp close to where a man was sitting ,control,54.54545454545454,6
it startled the man ,control,50.0,2
the man picked up the ball ,control,50.0,2
and looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from ,control,42.85714285714285,4
okay ,control,0.0,0
there was once a girl called Cinderella ,control,28.57142857142857,3
she didn't have any parents ,control,50.0,2
and she lived in an orphanage ,control,50.0,3
uh so  but there was a  she lived in an orphanage ,control,38.46153846153847,0
and uh the orphanage was looking for a family to take her ,control,41.66666666666667,3
uh so  they put out a notice ,control,37.5,2
a mother that had  that had two daughters showed up at the orphanage to see Cinderella to take her in ,control,38.095238095238095,4
they saw Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,1
uh the orphanage director introduced cell Cinderella ,control,14.285714285714285,2
she  Cinderella did a curtsy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
said ,control,0.0,0
 pleasure to meet you ,control,20.0,0
and they took Cinderella away ,control,20.0,1
once they got Cinderella home she fou found out  Cinderella found out that the stepmother was really mean and so were the stepsisters ,control,41.66666666666667,5
all they made her do was chores all day long ,control,50.0,4
nothing but work work work ,control,40.0,3
 Cinderella do this ,control,25.0,1
 Cinderella do that ,control,25.0,1
 Cinderella get my food ,control,20.0,2
 Cinderella do the laundry ,control,20.0,2
 Cinderella feed the animals the cats the dog the horses ,control,36.36363636363637,3
all Cinderella could do was just work work work all the time ,control,41.66666666666667,4
uh all  in the  later  uh later that evening a invitation came to the house uh from the uh king inviting all the girls  all the unmarried ladies to the uh prince's ball so_that perhaps the prince could find somebody to marry ,control,38.297872340425535,5
uh and so everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball ,control,46.66666666666666,6
uh and  e and so was Cinderella ,control,12.5,2
she thought she would be going too ,control,57.14285714285714,2
Cinderella went into a bed  whi while she was cleaning she went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and so she went ahead and tried the dress on ,control,30.0,3
however  when the stepmothers and stepsisters came in and saw her with the  with the dress and also the jewelry she was wearing she says ,control,48.14814814814815,8
 what are you doing ,control,60.0,1
 what are you doing ,control,60.0,1
Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 well  I'm going we've all been invited to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,4
Cinderel and the evil stepsisters and the stepmother said ,control,22.22222222222222,4
 you're not going ,control,40.0,1
 you're ugly ,control,50.0,1
 you're staying here ,control,40.0,1
 nobody's gonna wanna marry you ,control,37.5,2
and they snatched the jewelry off of her ,control,62.5,3
and they snatched the dress off of her ,control,62.5,3
and says ,control,0.0,1
 you're not going anywhere ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 we're going to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
 and one of us will marry the prince ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 uh but you've got to stay home because nobody wants to marry you anyway ,control,31.25,3
and so off to the ball they went ,control,37.5,4
uh Cinderella stayed at home ,control,20.0,2
and she was crying ,control,50.0,1
uh and before you knew it she was crying so hard all_of_a_sudden uh she started hearing uh bells ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and there's twinkling all around ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and a fairy godmother appeared ,control,20.0,2
and Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 who are you ,control,75.0,0
 I'm your fairy godmother ,control,50.0,2
 and I'm here to  gr to grant your wish to go to the ball ,control,35.294117647058826,0
and uh Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 well  I can't go because I don't have a dress ,control,42.85714285714285,3
 and I don't have a way to get there ,control,27.27272727272727,3
so  fairy mother ,control,0.0,1
and  and created a dress for her ,control,37.5,3
she says ,control,50.0,1
 oh the dress is beautiful ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 but I don't have any shoes ,control,37.5,2
she may  waved her magic wand again and ha and there was some glass slippers for her ,control,38.88888888888889,4
uh so  she put on the glass slippers ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  now she was truly a beautiful  a beautiful beautiful young lady ,control,35.714285714285715,3
uh so  they walked outside ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and Cinderella said that ,control,25.0,1
 I don't have a way to get there ,control,30.0,3
and the fairy godmother says ,control,20.0,2
 well  ga get that pumpkin and those mice ,control,20.0,3
 they're your friends ,control,60.0,2
 tell them to come over here ,control,28.57142857142857,3
 and the dog seems to like you too ,control,22.22222222222222,2
so  fairy godmother waved her magic wand ,control,12.5,2
and the pumpkin turned into a carriage ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and the mice turned into uh horses ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and the dog turned into a chauffeur ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so they all pi or  so  so  uh Cinderella now was able to go to the ball ,control,30.0,5
she got into the carriage ,control,60.0,3
and off to the ball they went ,control,57.14285714285714,4
when Cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty ,control,55.55555555555556,3
they couldn't believe how incredible she looked ,control,50.0,3
ah but s w she tried to remember  as much fun as Cinderella was having she tried to remember one thing that her fairy godmother had told her ,control,27.58620689655172,8
she says she needed to be back by midnight ,control,44.44444444444444,5
she says if she wasn't back by midnight the pumpkin was gonna turn back in or  the carriage was gonna turn back into a pumpkin ,control,37.93103448275862,6
and that the horses were gonna turn back into mice ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and that the uh chauffeur  chauffeur was gonna turn back into the dog ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then ,control,50.0,3
she was having so much fun she lost track the time ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and when she looked up at the clock she noticed that it was almost twelve o'clock ,control,56.25,4
and while she was dancing with the prince she quickly broke away from him and says ,control,50.0,7
 I gotta go I gotta go ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and she  s and the prince says ,control,25.0,3
 no  you can't go ,control,42.85714285714285,3
 I think I found my true love ,control,37.5,3
Cinderella continued to run ,control,0.0,2
 I got to go ,control,20.0,2
 I must go ,control,50.0,1
and as Cinderella was running out she left a shoe behind ,control,45.45454545454545,2
she hesitated for a second to get it but realized she didn't have enough time ,control,37.5,4
so  she quickly hopped into the carriage ,control,50.0,3
the carriage drove  drove off ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and uh got her home just in time ,control,25.0,2
the clothes turned to rags ,control,40.0,2
the carriage turned into a pumpkin ,control,50.0,3
the horse turned into  mice ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the chauffeur turned into the dog ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh back at the palace the prince uh while he was chasing Cinderella noticed that there was a glass slipper that was still there ,control,45.83333333333333,5
so  he picked up the glass slipper and said ,control,40.0,2
 I must find this woman ,control,50.0,2
 whosever foot can  whosever woman's foot can fit into this shoe that's the person that I'm going to marry ,control,41.66666666666667,0
sighs laughs so  so  the prince went from house to house looking for females to fit that shoe ,control,30.0,5
how  one house after another ,control,50.0,2
uh none of the female's foot would fit into the glass slipper ,control,38.46153846153847,5
uh and so finally he came to Cinderella's house ,control,20.0,4
as uh the prince arrived the mother and the evil stepsisters they locked Cinderella into the closet ,control,41.17647058823529,6
uh where she couldn't get out ,control,57.14285714285714,1
uh and so the prince came in ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and uh the two daughters tried on the shoes with all of their might  the shoe with all their might ,control,52.38095238095239,6
and they could not put their feet into it ,control,55.55555555555556,2
uh however her friends the little mice noticed that uh that the prince was there ,control,40.0,3
and so they found a key to the room ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and they gave it to Cinderella so_that she could open the door ,control,58.333333333333336,3
and the prince could see that there was another woman in the house ,control,53.84615384615385,5
so  uh the prince asked her to try on the shoe ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and she did ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and magically you_know she transformed back into the lady that he saw laughs that night ,control,40.0,4
