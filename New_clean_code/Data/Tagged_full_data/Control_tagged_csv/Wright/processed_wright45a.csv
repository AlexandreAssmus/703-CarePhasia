and in one section this little girl  got trapped ,control,30.0,3
she was probably with her mommy or her daddy in the car or with a friend playing on the banks and fell in ,control,52.17391304347826,9
and the river is with a xxx coming down ,control,55.55555555555556,4

and cheerfully went back to school in dry clothes ,control,22.22222222222222,3
well  the story starts with Cinderella being into  eh with her father there ,control,40.0,5
and I guess the mean old aunt came in ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 with the two horrible two beyond despicable daughters ,control,33.33333333333333,0
they were terrible ,control,66.66666666666666,1
