okay  there's a home um with a little boy and a very upset mother ,control,31.25,5
it looks like the little boy was going to have a birthday party ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and  the mother had placed the birthday cake on a table ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and the family dog had come in ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and gotten into the cake ,control,40.0,3
eaten part of it ,control,50.0,3
and retreated under the couch because the mother caught him in the act and was chasing him with a broom ,control,55.00000000000001,5
so  he's under the couch ,control,71.42857142857143,3
the mother's very upset ,control,20.0,2
the little boy is crying ,control,40.0,2
and the guest are starting to arrive ,control,28.57142857142857,2
um there's um another woman with probably her son bearing a gift ,control,38.46153846153847,5
and then another mother coming with a daughter with a gift ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and they're just standing in the doorway um watching what is going on ,control,50.0,3
I take two pieces of bread from the loaf of bread ,control,45.45454545454545,4
put it on a plate ,control,60.0,3
I open the peanut butter ,control,40.0,2
and get a knife ,control,25.0,2
and spread the peanut butter on the bread ,control,37.5,3
I would put the two pieces of bread together ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and cut them in two ,control,40.0,2
and I have a peanut butter sandwich ,control,28.57142857142857,3
okay  the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago ,control,28.57142857142857,4
I had vertigo ,control,33.33333333333333,1
extreme vertigo ,control,0.0,1
and I was working at the time ,control,57.14285714285714,3
um I couldn't walk without bumping into things ,control,44.44444444444444,4
um I was afraid to drive ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I went through all this testing ,control,57.14285714285714,3
I was never hospitalized ,control,50.0,1
but I hadta take six weeks off from work ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I never miss work ,control,25.0,1
and I've never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me ,control,43.75,4
um I did cat ,control,25.0,1
and they could never find any reason for it ,control,55.55555555555556,3
um all the blood work was fine ,control,42.85714285714285,2
um it's very frustrating because they don't know how to treat it or what to do ,control,44.44444444444444,4
you just hafta wait it out ,control,50.0,2
so  I um stayed at home ,control,42.85714285714285,2
uh went through all the testing ,control,50.0,3
went to the doctor's ,control,40.0,3
um finally decided to go to a chiropractor ,control,25.0,4
and my doctor agreed that was fine ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  I went for massage therapy and uh muscle and nerve stimulant ,control,23.07692307692308,5
and that helped ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium ,control,50.0,4
now that's not proven ,control,40.0,1
my regular doctor of_course doesn't go along with it  laughs ,control,41.66666666666667,2
my chiropractor thinks that's the answer  laughs ,control,44.44444444444444,4
but it was just a terrible ordeal ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and um I've not had it return ,control,37.5,2
um just a little bit once in awhile ,control,25.0,3
but I find that when my back is out_of alignment and my discs are compressed that it kind_of slows down your  your functioning ,control,50.0,5
so  anyway that was the worse thing I've probably experienced ,control,50.0,5
um somewhat yes ,control,0.0,1
well  my husband um has been treated for lung cancer ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and he had extreme um hard core treatment ,control,12.5,3
he had chemotherapy and radiation ,control,20.0,2
and he had brain radiation ,control,20.0,2
uh they do that to uh ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain ,control,37.5,6
but in the process of doing this my husband's been on a_lot_of medications ,control,57.14285714285714,6
and he's a very bright man and very articulate ,control,30.0,3
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow ,control,63.1578947368421,6
his thought process was very unlike him ,control,57.14285714285714,2
he just didn't process well at all ,control,25.0,2
so  you hafta be very patient ,control,28.57142857142857,2
hafta listen ,control,0.0,1
hafta try not to lose your temper ,control,14.285714285714285,3
try not to be argumentative ,control,20.0,2
um tried my patience as much as it's ever been tried ,control,41.66666666666667,3
um just kind_of wait  wait it out ,control,25.0,2
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and um you work back into it from there ,control,44.44444444444444,3
um he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment ,control,53.333333333333336,6
but it  his,control,50.0,0
and uh the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me laughs ,control,55.00000000000001,5
um it's just a matter of speaking distinctly ,control,44.44444444444444,4
I hadta repeat my  myself ,control,50.0,2
I hadta make decisions for him ,control,50.0,3
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it ,control,50.0,5
so  we did work through that ,control,71.42857142857143,2
actually  it went pretty well ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be ,control,53.84615384615385,4
and head,control,0.0,1
head,control,0.0,0
I do not wanna be a care giver  laughs ,control,40.0,3
but you work through it ,control,60.0,2
you do what you hafta do laughs ,control,57.14285714285714,3
 oh yes ,control,0.0,0
hm let's see ,control,25.0,2
um I guess the most frightening time would be um I lived in Colorado ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and I worked for the telephone company ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley ,control,22.22222222222222,4
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down ,control,53.84615384615385,4
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities ,control,22.22222222222222,4
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne ,control,50.0,2
that  once they closed my office I commuted first to Fort Collins ,control,46.15384615384615,3
we closed that office ,control,50.0,2
Boulder we closed that office ,control,40.0,2
and then I went to Cheyenne ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and that's about um just under a seventy mile trip ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and it's on il twenty five ,control,42.85714285714285,3
it was winter time ,control,50.0,2
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible ,control,33.33333333333333,4
um I was on the road and a storm came up ,control,54.54545454545454,3
I slid off the road ,control,60.0,3
ditched my car ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I hadta call for help to come and get me ,control,27.27272727272727,5
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up um transmission ,control,50.0,3
so  I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley ,control,46.66666666666666,6
and he came with a tow truck and got me out ,control,45.45454545454545,3
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there ,control,30.76923076923077,4
and it's very frightening because you're not really sure what's going to happen laughs ,control,41.17647058823529,5
but he did get me ,control,60.0,1
we got back to town ,control,40.0,3
they got my car back ,control,40.0,2
and um I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne ,control,37.5,4
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over laughs ,control,52.63157894736842,5
okay  I'm not real sure ,control,28.57142857142857,2
is that ice ,control,66.66666666666666,2
it looks to me like there's water with ice on it ,control,66.66666666666666,6
and a young girl has fallen through the ice ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and she's unable to get out ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and there's a rescue person probably a firemen um that is holding onto um a stick or an overhang of some kind ,control,43.47826086956522,9
and he has on a life jacket ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and he is going out to rescue her ,control,50.0,2
and it looks like he is very close to getting her ,control,54.54545454545454,5
um and it looks to me like he's within reach of  of grabbing her out_of the water ,control,63.1578947368421,6
very scary ,control,0.0,1
there's a young boy playing with a soccer ball ,control,40.0,5
and he kicks it ,control,50.0,1
it goes through a window ,control,60.0,3
breaks the window ,control,33.33333333333333,2
goes inside a house ,control,50.0,3
knocks a lamp over ,control,50.0,2
and there's a man sitting in a chair by the lamp ,control,50.0,5
he gets out_of the chair ,control,60.0,3
retrieves the ball ,control,33.33333333333333,2
goes to look out the broken window ,control,28.57142857142857,4
but I don't think he finds the young man who kicked the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,5
he's just standing there looking out the window wondering where the ball came from ,control,46.66666666666666,6
there's a mother with an umbrella ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and her son with his backpack going to school ,control,44.44444444444444,4
um he is trying to leave ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella to take ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but he doesn't want it ,control,50.0,1
so  he waves goodbye ,control,40.0,1
goes off without the umbrella ,control,60.0,3
gets outside and it starts to rain ,control,14.285714285714285,3
and it starts to rain really hard ,control,14.285714285714285,3
it's coming down ,control,75.0,1
and he's getting quite wet ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  he turns back ,control,40.0,1
goes home ,control,0.0,1
and he appears to be quite soaked ,control,28.57142857142857,3
his mother is scolding him ,control,60.0,2
he then evidently leaves with the umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and walks to school in the rain with the umbrella ,control,50.0,3
mother does know best ,control,25.0,1
okay  um Cinderella lives with her father ,control,25.0,3
and her mother had died ,control,40.0,2
and her father decides to remarry ,control,16.666666666666664,2

and the mother  the stepmother of Cinderella is very mean to Cinderella ,control,38.46153846153847,5
and the stepsisters are very mean to her also ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the father is away ,control,40.0,2
he really doesn't know this is going on ,control,55.55555555555556,2
but Cinderella hasta clean the house and feed the animals ,control,20.0,3
and she becomes more of a chambermaid than a daughter while the stepsisters are pampered and get lots of nice clothes ,control,42.85714285714285,6
um Cinderella makes friends with all the animals in the yard ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and she longs to be part of the family and to be happy again ,control,35.714285714285715,5

and there's the castle where the  the beautiful  the handsome prince lives ,control,40.0,5
and she daydreams about being pretty and meeting the prince someday ,control,36.36363636363637,6

and in order to find a nice young wife for him they're going to have a ball and invite all the  the eligible ladies from the kingdom to come to the ball ,control,41.17647058823529,6
so  they send out invitations ,control,50.0,1

and they're very mean to her ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and they tell her she can not go ,control,50.0,2
so  she hasta stay home and clean the house ,control,30.0,3

and she gives Cinderella this beautiful gown with some beautiful slippers ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and turns a pumpkin into a coach ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and the mice into beautiful horses ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and she sends Cinderella to the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but she cautions ,control,33.33333333333333,1
