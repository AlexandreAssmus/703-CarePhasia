all the cooking ,control,66.66666666666666,1
all the sewing ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and she didn't have anyone to talk to ,control,44.44444444444444,2
so  she made friends with the animals ,control,50.0,3
she'd go out and feed them ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and they'd talk together,control,40.0,1

they made it look beautiful ,control,40.0,2
they sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball ,control,47.22222222222222,12
lips_smack sighs so uh when it was time to leave she came down ,control,38.46153846153847,5
and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be ,control,58.333333333333336,3

 oh  Cinderella that's my scarf and my  my necklace ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and they ripped the things off because they s,control,55.55555555555556,2
