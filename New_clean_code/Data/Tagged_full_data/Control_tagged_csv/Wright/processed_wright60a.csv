pretty easy ,control,0.0,1
well  you get the ingredients out ,control,42.85714285714285,2
you get the  the bread that you'd wanna use ,control,54.54545454545454,4
I would first inhales take a paper plate and uh  put the two uh slices of uh bread on the plate ,control,31.818181818181817,4
and then inhales either before or after I'd go get uh uh the jelly and the peanut butter ,control,31.57894736842105,4
and if they were already open they'd probably be in the refrigerator ,control,61.53846153846154,3
inhales and then I would take two knives because I don't wanna adulterate one or the other ,control,33.33333333333333,0
inhales and I would  uh I would probably put the butter on first ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and uh  I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly ,control,31.57894736842105,4
and inhales I would the  uh put the butter on the one side ,control,42.85714285714285,4
probably the right side just because it's  that's where it's at in my mind ,control,66.66666666666666,5
inhales and I would put it on evenly ,control,50.0,2
but I would put it on very  over the whole area ,control,50.0,3
not this area because I hate that ,control,57.14285714285714,2
an,control,100.0,0
inhales I'd probably use a_little less jelly than the  the peanut butter because I'd rather have more peanut butter ,control,36.36363636363637,5
inhales and then I would put the two  uh I would probably take the  uh in the left hand take the inhales one with the jelly and put it over the uh one with the peanut butter ,control,41.02564102564102,0
so  the two inhales uh surfaces that have stuff on it uh face each other ,control,37.5,4
and I would put them so the top of the loaf is where the  to you_know the top of the piece is where it has a w symmetrical ,control,55.172413793103445,7
inhales and then I would cut it in half probably this way hori uh horizontally ,control,33.33333333333333,0
inhales and then I would   know what I'd eat it ,control,50.0,0
I don't know if you wanna know that so c ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and at some point I'd  probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife  wouldn't yell at me ,control,57.692307692307686,4
looks like there is uh a kitty got up into uh uh the branch of a tree ,control,47.05882352941176,7
and uh it looks like the father uh climbed up on the tree with a ladder ,control,43.75,4
and somehow the ladder  fell down ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and the father is stuck in the tree ,control,50.0,3
inhales there's a girl up there uh reaching up for uh  probably her cat ,control,31.25,4
and there's a tricycle uh next to her ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and there's a ladder there that's inhales quite a ways from the tree ,control,53.333333333333336,4
so  I don't understand how it got that far away ,control,50.0,4
but  maybe it tipped over backwards ,control,28.57142857142857,1
inhales and then there's a dog probably their dog barking uh up the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and you_know why I have no idea what dogs do ,control,40.0,4
inhales and then there's a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree ,control,44.44444444444444,6
and then lips_smack evidently somebody called a fire department ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and there's a firetruck ,control,40.0,2
and there's a couple fireman inhales carrying a ladder uh towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there ,control,47.82608695652174,6
but maybe it's not a good enough one ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and that's pretty much it ,control,50.0,2
so  evidently inhales the father uh climbed up the tree to get the cat out ,control,37.5,4
and inhales for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down ,control,41.17647058823529,4
and somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the uh fire department ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and inhales they're responding ,control,40.0,2
an,control,100.0,0
looks like it's low enough he can just jump down so ,control,50.0,3
the thing was is that uh  I never had a heart attack ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and  other_than having a very little uh  chest pain ,control,9.090909090909092,5
uh it was kind_of somewhat of a surprise so ,control,55.55555555555556,4
inhales I had  uh went and had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and inhales he said that was alright ,control,42.85714285714285,3
which they don't show anything INV,control,57.14285714285714,1
so  now he suggested a stress echo ,control,37.5,2
so  I  inhales I had a stress echo ,control,40.0,0
and I went to it ,control,60.0,2
and  and I failed it ,control,33.33333333333333,1
you_know  I was kind_of shocked ,control,33.33333333333333,2
is  and I w was gonna do things afterwards ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and inhales I just called my wife ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and  and uh talked to her ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and then I went home ,control,20.0,1
and  lips_smack and then uh they did a uh cardiac catharization ,control,16.666666666666664,1
lips_smack and uh  between the first day and the second day uh they gave me nitroglycerine ,control,29.411764705882355,5
and then I just  didn't do anything because I didn't wanna have a heart attack INV,control,36.84210526315789,3
and I had a cardiac catharization ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I didn't know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was inhales older and past his prime wouldn't have done anything if  if  if ,control,54.83870967741935,4
and he wouldn't even put it in a stent ,control,50.0,3
because  m which I wouldn't have used him if I would have known that ,control,68.75,4
inhales make a long story short I had three main,control,20.0,2
one was blocked a hundred percent ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 one was blocked ninety eight percent ,control,14.285714285714285,3
inhales and one was blocked eighty percent ,control,14.285714285714285,2
so  I was very fortunate that I didn't inhales either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that INV,control,42.30769230769231,4
and I had surgery ,control,25.0,1
and I had surgery by a  uh  a cardiac surgeon that was considered by uh  the nurses and people in general one of the better ones ,control,37.93103448275862,9
I went to Scottsdale_Healthcare_Osborn ,control,50.0,1
and before I went I called and asked them how many inhales uh procedures they did the previous year ,control,36.84210526315789,5
and based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance  you had a better success ,control,45.0,6
so  they were even better than inhales at Mayo ,control,50.0,3
th at the time Mayo was at uh  Scottsdale uh Shea ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and it was like oh three or four hours there ,control,20.0,3
I  to this day I don't know because what my wife told me inhales and w what she now says is different ,control,54.16666666666666,0
so  it d doesn't matter ,control,42.85714285714285,1
lips_smack and uh when I got done ,control,42.85714285714285,2
inhales uh it's  it's very intrusive ,control,44.44444444444444,3
you don't know what the INV,control,57.14285714285714,2
inhales and uh they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked laughs really bad ,control,40.909090909090914,6
but I was calm ,control,50.0,1
and well   my brother just had it a couple weeks  ago ,control,23.07692307692308,3
and his wife said he didn't look that bad ,control,30.0,3
so  I don't know what that means ,control,55.55555555555556,2
well  lips_smack when I saw my mob ,control,37.5,0
but she did  ver she recovered very g rapidly ,control,20.0,3
and she's still alive ,control,40.0,1
and that's about fifteen years ago ,control,28.57142857142857,4
inhales uh lips_smack and then I just remember that it  eh uh  it took a long time to recover ,control,23.809523809523807,1
and then one day I went to the  cardiologist and he said you_know ,control,28.57142857142857,3
 go back to work ,control,20.0,3
inhales which  when I went back to work I had problems because it really was too soon ,control,44.44444444444444,5
I should have said you_know ,control,60.0,1
 well  I'm not really ready ,control,25.0,2
and uh my wife has always said that uh after that I acted like an old man ,control,47.05882352941176,4
I was  I was fifty five at the time ,control,60.0,4
that must have been ten years ago ,control,57.14285714285714,3
inhales and uh the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems ,control,37.5,4
inhales and uh I would go from one room to the other to find out  to get something ,control,36.84210526315789,4
by the time I got there I forgot  that ,control,50.0,4
inhales and they said that uh that was uh go away in six months ,control,35.714285714285715,0
it never did ,control,33.33333333333333,1
inhales uh I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long ,control,40.0,5
and inhales at that time they didn't have a filter in there that filters out the  little particles or whatever that causes your problem ,control,46.15384615384615,6
inhales and uh I've never really been the same since then ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and uh you_know that's the  pretty much the end of the thing  ,control,40.0,5
the story ,control,50.0,1
 n no  no  I had a little chest pain when I was at work when I walked from the  the place I worked into the washroom ,control,53.333333333333336,5
and inhales one day it  it was a l very very little right here ,control,26.666666666666668,5
and uh just to be on the safe side you_know the other pharmacist said you_know ,control,26.666666666666668,4
 oh  you should call your doctor ,control,37.5,2
like I got in right away ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 and the e_k_g it was like on a Friday ,control,50.0,3
an,control,100.0,0
the c cardiac INV,control,25.0,2
and inhales Thursday I have the surgery ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  and INV,control,25.0,0
 yeah  well  well  I ,control,12.5,0
 ninety eight and eighty  ou INV,control,0.0,0
but the thing was they did five bypasses ,control,37.5,3
and they took out ,control,50.0,1
both of what they identified as a stroke ,control,75.0,5
and  and they  it was very difficult to communicate with them ,control,38.46153846153847,3
uh I had an aunt that had  uh was very old ,control,33.33333333333333,3
in the nineties and had Alzheimer's ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and  and she didn't even know  INV,control,20.0,0
she was a inhales aunt that was very near and  dear to me ,control,50.0,5
and uh  uh was always very nice ,control,12.5,2
that's probably my favorite aunt so  ,control,50.0,2
and uh sometimes I have problems communicating with my wife ,control,30.0,5
b we both don't hear that well ,control,50.0,2
and  we'd t start talking and walk away ,control,20.0,3
and  and uh a_lot_of people if you pay attention they just s s speak a_lot ,control,25.0,0
like my  I've got a son that is an engineer ,control,66.66666666666666,4
and  I think he's just stressed out from work because he's overworked ,control,53.333333333333336,0
and he's  they're pushing him into management ,control,60.0,3
and  he  for a young guy that's really pretty sharp ,control,38.46153846153847,0
all my kids are pretty sharp ,control,50.0,2
he  he misspeaks INV,control,40.0,2
so ,control,0.0,0
hm,control,0.0,0
 wow  yeah  like in adulthood or child or what ,control,16.666666666666664,0
 okay  I'll  g I can INV,control,40.0,1
um I was probably,control,50.0,1
you could figure it out ,control,80.0,1
I was in  like in  in junior high ,control,50.0,3
not  yeah  junior high ,control,0.0,0
that's like seven and eighth grade ,control,28.57142857142857,3
 okay ,control,0.0,0
I don't know if that's the right term ,control,60.0,3
and it was like eighth grade ,control,50.0,3
inhales and uh we were moving from one location to another because my dad's inhales uh place of employment uh moved ,control,36.36363636363637,6
and uh  we were uh carrying some stuff on a  a big long trailer that he was pulling with his uh nineteen fifty five uh Buick ,control,39.285714285714285,5
inhales and it was a rented U_haul ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and we were driving down the  two lane highway and uh ,control,33.33333333333333,3
probably going about forty forty five ,control,0.0,2
 and all_of_a_sudden inhales something happened ,control,16.666666666666664,3
I didn't know what happened at the time ,control,55.55555555555556,4
but subsequently I found out that inhales uh one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch inhales ,control,45.0,9
because it was put in upside down ,control,57.14285714285714,2
it came aw undone and it fell out ,control,37.5,2
and because of that inhales it  uh the trailer caused the car to go like this ,control,47.05882352941176,3
 and uh the car was going like this ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and I had a big inhales round mirror that was above the dresser ,control,46.15384615384615,5
and I had it in my  in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side ,control,57.89473684210527,5
inhales because uh  you_know so it didn't get broken ,control,45.45454545454545,3
 and the car whipped around ,control,33.33333333333333,0
an,control,100.0,0
and to make a long story short ,control,14.285714285714285,2
inhales the trailer caused the car to spin all the way around ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and the end of the trailer hit a big tree that was literally that big in diameter ,control,41.17647058823529,5
and damaged the trailer ,control,25.0,2
and the tree a little bit ,control,33.33333333333333,2
inhales and if he uh woulda ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and  and uh  then I remember getting out_of the car with my dad ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and looking at the inhales uh trailer and all that ,control,40.0,4
and that was pretty i ,control,60.0,2
and then you_know it wasn't  it didn't take a long time for all this to happen ,control,42.10526315789473,4
but that kind_of sticks in my memory ,control,42.85714285714285,3
it  you_know that  inhales uh you_know for the m grace of God ,control,35.714285714285715,0
or  or uh my dad's ability or something ,control,20.0,0
other_than having a damaged trailer ,control,20.0,3
and I don't know  inhales can't remember if he hadta pay for it or it was covered under insurance or,control,43.47826086956522,5
but uh the mirror was not broken ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and inhales I don't think m anything or much was damaged ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and it was very  but it was li big long trailer ,control,33.33333333333333,4
uh a double  tandem you_know ,control,16.666666666666664,0
tandem  ,control,0.0,0
two wheels ,control,0.0,1
so  that was  that was  I don't know if that was real scary but it  it certainly left an impression on me so ,control,53.57142857142857,5
 well  looks like there's a,control,37.5,2
oh,control,0.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
I didn't get what this was to begin with ,control,60.0,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
uh looks like there was a young  girl ,control,33.33333333333333,3
or maybe a young woman ,control,20.0,1
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
probably in the teens or maybe oh  I can't tell  really tell the age ,control,29.411764705882355,4
inhales looks like that uh she was in a  uh an area where there was uh  rocky or stony or inhales cliff type things ,control,34.61538461538461,9
and she evidently fell in the  into the xxx ,control,50.0,3
it looks like xxx on the bot ,control,57.14285714285714,5
I can't really see that xxx ,control,42.85714285714285,2
it's not that good a picture ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she evidently got  uh fell in ,control,25.0,2
and she ha hanged onto a  uh a dead tree's uh branch out_of the rocks ,control,29.411764705882355,4
inhales and looks like there's probably some man ,control,33.33333333333333,4
by the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person ,control,57.14285714285714,4
uh in a red uh lifejacket ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and he's got a belt that inhales I don't know if that's connected to a rope or not ,control,52.38095238095239,5
I can't really see that ,control,50.0,1
lips_smack you_know looks like that the ,control,50.0,2
oh  I see what it is ,control,57.14285714285714,2
he's got a belt he's gonna pu probably put around her ,control,57.14285714285714,3
okay  I didn't see that ,control,42.85714285714285,2
similar to his ,control,66.66666666666666,2
inhales and it looks like he's just got to the point where he's up by next to her and he's gonna inhales when he gets a chance put the belt around the uh girl and rescue her ,control,51.21951219512195,9
uh  probably uh paramedics or police ,control,0.0,0
and  looks like he's in well shape ,control,44.44444444444444,4
he's got a  a gigantic bicept ,control,50.0,2
inhales and the girl doesn't look really that  she looks a little  scared ,control,31.25,4
I_mean she looks a_little  shocked out too or something ,control,30.0,3
so  inhales I would assume it had a happy ending ,control,45.45454545454545,3
so  I  I don't know about that ,control,60.0,2
well there's   inhales well there's a boy playing with a  I guess that's a soccer ball ,control,42.85714285714285,9
when  there little different sections ,control,16.666666666666664,0
inhales and he's in a  probably a grassy area with some shrubs behind him ,control,56.25,0
and he's got a baseball cap on ,control,50.0,2
and he  kicks it and it  appears to go through a window ,control,35.714285714285715,5
and it breaks the window ,control,40.0,2
inhales it uh  lands inside a house ,control,37.5,3
and it knocks a lamp off a  a table ,control,50.0,3
and there's a man that was evidently sitting in there ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and inhales I think it looks like it maybe startled him or  something ,control,42.85714285714285,5
inhales and he picked up the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and he's looking out the window ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and uh doesn't  you_know can't see his expression on his face ,control,35.714285714285715,4
but he inhales probably in the  either in the stages of finding out you_know who did it or whatever ,control,50.0,5
and then he's probably gonna react to it one way or the other ,control,33.33333333333333,4
 well  looks like there's a mother uh offering to a child ,control,35.714285714285715,6
maybe a girl ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
kind_of hard to  no,control,20.0,3
it's probably a boy ,control,60.0,2
inhales unbrella ,control,0.0,1
and he goes out ,control,25.0,1
and walks with his backpack in the rain ,control,50.0,5
and he's starting to get wet ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and inhales he,control,33.33333333333333,1
so  he comes back ,control,40.0,1
and inhales he's all wet ,control,50.0,2
and his mother seems to not that be happy about it either ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and so then uh the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now ,control,22.22222222222222,4
and he's you_know using it the proper way ,control,44.44444444444444,2
that he's getting most of the rain not go on his upper  upper body ,control,43.75,5
and uh doesn't say if uh  they  he was dried out before that or not ,control,44.44444444444444,3
but he doesn't seem to be inhales wet from the picture ,control,41.66666666666667,6
so  I no ,control,50.0,0
that's just speculation ,control,50.0,1
