lips_smack I have  been fortunate to have had excellent health ,control,27.27272727272727,5
um I have not been hospitalized since having my tonsils out when I was in fourth grade ,control,58.82352941176471,6
um I do remember that ,control,60.0,1
and uh know most people remember the great difficulty of swallowing ,control,18.181818181818183,4
what I remember was the inhales aftertaste of the ether that was used for anesthetic in those days ,control,61.11111111111112,7
and the um nightmares that were prompted because of the anesthetic ,control,54.54545454545454,4
with inhales recurring dreams about giant pythons and jungle creatures ,control,20.0,7
but lips_smack inhales other_than that uh  my life has been pretty free of uh physical difficulties ,control,35.294117647058826,4
 um exhales head,control,0.0,2
nothing prolonged ,control,50.0,1
inhales um exhales probably the first thing that I  came to mind was inhales um maybe seeing our son when he was maybe four or five years old inhales go down a f,control,32.35294117647059,7
inhales and uh hitting a cement floor on the  uh on  on  on the bottom ,control,38.88888888888889,4
that kind_of stopped our hearts momentarily ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but uh inhales both of us were  um trained in rescue procedures ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and so therefore we didn't particularly panic ,control,25.0,1
we just uh inhales dealt with him by the prescribed manna manner fr we learned from our emergency medical services training ,control,38.095238095238095,9
and it all turned out well ,control,50.0,2
but it was quite frightening at the moment ,control,50.0,3
lips_smack inhales my experience has been very very limited with that ,control,45.45454545454545,4
being that uh inhales we've not had people in our family who have been physically challenged ,control,52.94117647058824,6
and in our acquaintance  uh group most of them are been very very healthy ,control,40.0,4
inhales I do have one rather  humorous incident of uh inhales a good friend of mine who had uh a slight stroke ,control,30.434782608695656,8
and uh  lips_smack complained about it that his uh inhales his mind was going a thousand miles an hour as usual but his mouth only went about twenty five ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and he was very frustrated about that ,control,57.14285714285714,3

that the motor had conked out ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and that um the  um the car was actually being pushed off the road ,control,46.66666666666666,3
inhales she was uh eventually req forced to crawl out the window and crawl up to the top of the car ,control,42.85714285714285,8
and try to  uh to wait there until some help would be arrive ,control,28.57142857142857,4

uh the  the car eventually from the force  great force of the water inhales was tipped over onto its side ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and  and the lady in distress was washed down the uh fast flowing stream ,control,33.33333333333333,4
inhales where she caught on to uh a branch ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and eventually uh h hung and clung on to the branch until such time as a helicopter ,control,35.294117647058826,6
which was hovering overhead ,control,50.0,1
inhales was able to lower inhales one of the um lips_smack paramedic technicians inhales by rope uh down uh to be able to uh rescue her ,control,23.07692307692308,9
inhales and to retrieve her back to safety ,control,25.0,4
inhales um her life was saved ,control,33.33333333333333,2
even_though she put the paramedics into great danger ,control,37.5,3
uh the car was lost ,control,40.0,2
and she paid her ten thousand dollar fine for dispatching the f helicopter ,control,30.76923076923077,4
inhales um exhales Billy liked his new soccer ball ,control,11.11111111111111,3

inhales and he was practicing kicking it ,control,42.85714285714285,3
inhales when the ball slipped off the side of his foot and went right through the picture window of his neighbor's house ,control,43.47826086956522,8
inhales and landed in the lap of his neighbor ,control,44.44444444444444,6
lips_smack knocking over the lamp shade ,control,33.33333333333333,4
inhales and breaking the window ,control,20.0,3
lips_smack inhales his neighbor ,control,25.0,2
who was the soccer coach ,control,60.0,2
inhales would probably have been more angry ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but he knew about the skill and he knew that accidents happen ,control,41.66666666666667,3
inhales so,control,0.0,1
 inhales you_know I think what we needta do is to be able to fix your directional kicking ,control,38.88888888888889,6
inhales and so they went to the playground ,control,37.5,4
inhales and to the ball field ,control,33.33333333333333,3
inhales and the c coach soccer gave some direction to the ball player ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and it all turned out well ,control,50.0,2
how's that for a positive spin ,control,71.42857142857143,3
sighs a mother was reminding her son that it was uh ,control,54.54545454545454,3
 inhales the weather forecast looked like it was going to be rain today ,control,35.714285714285715,3
and she handed her son an umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,2
lips_smack um lips_smack and he said ,control,16.666666666666664,1

 that's really twinkie ,control,40.0,1
 and  inhales and I don't wanna have my friends laughing at me for carrying an umbrella ,control,36.84210526315789,6
so  off he went to school with his backpack on ,control,54.54545454545454,3
inhales and he got halfway there almost inhales when it started to pour rain ,control,21.428571428571427,4
and he didn't wanna go to school ,control,37.5,3
inhales and he didn't wanna face his mom ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  he hadta choose between two bad choices ,control,33.33333333333333,3
lips_smack and he returned home ,control,20.0,1
inhales where he changed clothes ,control,40.0,2
inhales mom handed him his umbrella ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and off he went to school ,control,33.33333333333333,2

and uh the woman had two little girls  young girls inhales by her first marriage ,control,18.75,4
and the man had inhales a little girl by his first marriage ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and so they combined their families ,control,33.33333333333333,2
inhales and um  the two stepsisters I think  were uh not very  nice to the new stepsister ,control,25.0,8
um and they were a_little older ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they ordered her around ,control,40.0,1
and  inhales and they were really really mean to her ,control,36.36363636363637,1
so  she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her inhales new stepsisters or siblings ,control,34.78260869565217,4
inhales um in the land that they lived there was a  and they  gr and the girls grew up and  to become young ladies ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and  with Cinderella virtually becoming the  uh the personal servant of her two stepsisters ,control,31.25,0
inhales uh in the land that they lived there was a  inhales a king ,control,46.66666666666666,5
who  who had a son ,control,50.0,4
who would take his place ,control,60.0,2
but the king was concerned that his son uh inhales was unmarried ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and they needed to socialize ,control,20.0,2
and decided that they would uh inhales have a ball ,control,40.0,3
in which they would invite all the young  eligible young ladies in the inhales kingdom to come and to enjoy a  inhales a marvelous ball at the royal palace ,control,38.70967741935484,4
inhales and the invitation came in the mail ,control,37.5,3
and uh the two seps stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to uh inhales um go to the ball and dance and maybe find the  the young prince to be of interest ,control,28.57142857142857,9
inhales but they um planned and schemed that Cinderella inhales would not be allowed to attend and  and uh  was excluded ,control,21.73913043478261,5
and uh when it came time to leave for the ball Cinderella was left behind ,control,33.33333333333333,4
but was um  visited by a   a  a fairy prince ,control,38.46153846153847,5
inhales who uh knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,4
inhales said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella ,control,35.714285714285715,5
and inhales turned her into this beautiful young lady ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and inhales provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin ,control,45.45454545454545,6
inhales um  and told her that she wud ,control,33.33333333333333,2
which she did but that she hadta leave ,control,50.0,1
inhales and be home by midnight ,control,33.33333333333333,4
at which time  she would be re restored to her   her normal self ,control,53.333333333333336,3
inhales so  Cinderella went to the ball ,control,37.5,3
and inhales much to the chagrin of the stepsisters and the other young ladies in attendance ,control,37.5,6
inhales was immediately noticed by the prince ,control,42.85714285714285,3
who was captivated by her ,control,80.0,2
and inhales the prince and Cinderella danced and danced ,control,11.11111111111111,2
inhales until almost the stroke of twelve when Cinderella remembered inhales that she hadta back into th her pumpkin coach ,control,45.0,9
and inhales ran ah out_of the palace ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and jumped into her pumpkin coach to return to her home ,control,36.36363636363637,4
but inhales in her haste one of her  slippers that I think  was made of glass or something would  had fallen off ,control,48.0,10
and uh she returned home ,control,20.0,1
well  inhales the prince who was in hot pursuit ,control,40.0,5
inhales was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin ,control,33.33333333333333,6
lips_smack drawn by these horses ,control,40.0,4
inhales but did find the slipper ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and um commanded his  uh  his helpers to search throughout the realm for inhales um a young lady that's foot would fit in that uh slipper ,control,34.48275862068966,7
and so the h,control,25.0,1
and eventually came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters ,control,38.46153846153847,6
inhales and try as they may the stepsisters inhales could not  put their large uh feet into the glass s,control,38.095238095238095,0
but the  lips_smack uh the attendant tried the glass slipper on Cinderella ,control,30.76923076923077,2
inhales and Cinderella's foot fit perfectly ,control,0.0,4
inhales and so the attendant knew that Cinderella was the inhales the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,7
inhales and took her with him back to the  inhales back to the royal palace ,control,43.75,8
uh where she and the inhales prince were united ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and became a couple ,control,25.0,2
and were married ,control,33.33333333333333,1
