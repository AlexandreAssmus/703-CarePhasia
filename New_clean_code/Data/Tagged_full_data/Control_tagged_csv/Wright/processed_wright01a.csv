my daughter Stacy  Jason my son  Michael my grandson  and me ,control,28.57142857142857,3
we were playing around  you_know ,control,50.0,2
and then things got a_little hectic  I'd say ,control,20.0,3
and anyway  so  we're  we were splashing each_other and everything like that and everything ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and  and somehow one of them bumped me ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I fell in the pool ,control,50.0,3
and then my son fell on top of me ,control,44.44444444444444,4
but he had caught  what he'd done was like fell on my knee ,control,53.333333333333336,5
 so  it  it kind_of like shattered and tore the ligaments ,control,30.76923076923077,0
and  you_know  and uh fractured it actually ,control,11.11111111111111,2
and all the ligaments and everything ,control,50.0,1
and it was  j th it was so funny because we all fell like that  you_know ,control,55.55555555555556,5
we were all laughing ,control,75.0,1
and everybody's laughing ,control,50.0,1
and I'm going ,control,50.0,1
 get off me laughs ,control,40.0,3
 you_know  I'm really in pain ,control,37.5,2
 you_know  I'm really seriously in pain here ,control,30.0,2
 I'm on the bottom of this  you_know laughs ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and  um  and they thought I was just trying to get up and just kidding around ,control,22.22222222222222,4

 hey  I'm  no  seriously  something's wrong here ,control,28.57142857142857,4

and they  and then it just  it was like  like being a big blob in this ges,control,50.0,0
but I couldn't move my knee ,control,42.85714285714285,2
I couldn't get up ,control,60.0,1
anyway  so  they all straightened up ,control,37.5,2
and anyway  they helped me get up out_of the pool ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and then  they hadta almost carry me into the house ,control,36.36363636363637,3
then I hadta go to the emergency room because it was like you_know ,control,46.15384615384615,3
but it was just odd because you know how you're playing and laughing ,control,50.0,3
and it was such an odd accident that it was just weird ,control,58.333333333333336,3
otherwise than that just childbirth ,control,40.0,3
sure you don't wanna hear about that ,control,50.0,4
I took care um ,control,25.0,1
I have my own house cleaning business ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and I've had it for a few years which I've slowed down now ,control,60.0,4
but I useta take care of this older woman not that she was really old ,control,40.0,4
but she had a hard problem with people ,control,37.5,2
and so when I started cleaning her house because my sister worked for them ,control,50.0,5
they owned a restaurant in town ,control,50.0,3
and um she was just having a hard time communicating to anybody ,control,41.66666666666667,4
strangers coming in ,control,0.0,1
and she'd been out  she hadn't been out in a long time ,control,66.66666666666666,4
you_know  she just was getting old ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she was embarrassed ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and she didn't like people coming over ,control,37.5,2
and she couldn't get what she wanted to get done ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and she had a hard time with people ,control,37.5,2
I guess all her life ,control,60.0,2
but anyway  when I started cleaning her house ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and we really developed a very very good relationship and  with her ,control,30.76923076923077,3
with her ,control,100.0,1
yeah ,control,0.0,0
I sat and talked to her a_lot ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and I told her ,control,50.0,1
 it's okay ,control,50.0,1
you_know  I_mean I  she says she can't communicate with people ,control,38.46153846153847,3
you_know  of_course  owning restaurants for years and years and years when she was a_lot younger and her husband was alive which he had emphysema ,control,30.76923076923077,5
she was sorta like house  in the house all the time so ,control,53.84615384615385,5
but her  her daughter and son took care of the businesses ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but they overpowered her ,control,50.0,1
so  through the years she was having problems ,control,55.55555555555556,0
she didn't wanna go to the restaurant like she useta and visit the people and oversee ,control,41.17647058823529,5
I_mean  she owned them ,control,40.0,2
and I told her ,control,50.0,1
 you_know  you shouldn't be ,control,42.85714285714285,2
you_know  she was having a hard time ,control,37.5,2
I says ,control,50.0,1
 you can't be embarrassed about ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 because you can't get around as much ,control,33.33333333333333,0
 you_know  on a walker you don't want the neighbors to see ya ,control,40.0,0
 I'll roll you around in a wheelchair ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and I says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 we can go visit your neighbors ,control,42.85714285714285,3
you_know ,control,0.0,0
that's because you got to keep communicating to   to keep your mind active  you_know ,control,35.294117647058826,5
and I says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 you're fine with me because we developed this special friendship ,control,58.333333333333336,3
 you_know  I'm here twice a_week ,control,37.5,2
you_know  and it's easy to talk to me ,control,40.0,0
 and I'm  I'm cleaning your house ,control,50.0,0
 and  and you_know  we go  we have lunch ,control,16.666666666666664,3
 I take you to the doctor ,control,57.14285714285714,3
which she didn't like to go because she just still feels awkward ,control,38.46153846153847,2
you_know  get  getting old ,control,0.0,2
it's hard to explain ,control,40.0,2
but anyway  and I said ,control,16.666666666666664,2
 you needta  maybe we could go down to the restaurant ,control,50.0,4
you_know ,control,0.0,0
 I  you_know I got a car ,control,37.5,0
 I'll drive you ,control,60.0,1
 you get in ,control,50.0,1
we'll go visit the  you_know the girls that worked for you for like fifteen years and the people that you've known and they know you ,control,50.0,6
you_know  just trying to get her to open up and like visit or   you_know ,control,12.5,4
 it's okay if you're out in a wheelchair ,control,63.63636363636363,4
 I'll push you around ,control,50.0,1
 you need you  you've lived in this neighborhood for a long time ,control,53.333333333333336,4
people don't foresee you as crippled up old lady that  you_know is getting older ,control,37.5,5
so  we discussed those type of problems ,control,50.0,3
and settled them pretty much ,control,20.0,2
she a beautiful woman ,control,50.0,2
that would be my marriage but I ain't ,control,55.55555555555556,2
I think an accident in a car  that I was in ,control,66.66666666666666,4
my daughter was driving ,control,50.0,2
and um so we were driving down the street ,control,44.44444444444444,3
the grandson of_course is the baby ,control,50.0,2
and um we were in the car ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and um you could see this guy coming from ,control,44.44444444444444,3
we were stopped ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and then we pull up but the guy didn't stop ,control,36.36363636363637,3
so  you could see him  you_know coming towards you ,control,54.54545454545454,3
nothing you can do ,control,75.0,2
nothing ,control,100.0,0
and it's  it's  probably the s third scariest thing I think I've ever experienced because you can't do anything about it ,control,51.85185185185185,3
you cannot do anything about it ,control,71.42857142857143,2
 hello ,control,0.0,0
 hit me laughs  you_know ,control,16.666666666666664,2
anyway and the the car  ges,control,28.57142857142857,0
and I was more frightened for the  for my grandson than anything ,control,61.53846153846154,4
but that's frightening when you know you can't control ,control,54.54545454545454,3
if you cannot control  your situation like that and you know something bad is gonna hap run into you it's very difficult ,control,50.0,5
it's scary ,control,66.66666666666666,1
because you know it ges,control,60.0,2
it looks like  it looks like there's a ,control,60.0,3
I was gonna say she looks like a young child ,control,45.45454545454545,5
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
not young young but um ,control,0.0,2
she's stuck in the water ,control,66.66666666666666,3
it looks like after a flood ,control,66.66666666666666,3
she's very stressed ,control,50.0,2
scared half to death no doubt ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and um  I'd venture to guess that this would be a rescue person who's hanging on a tree limb trying to get to her ,control,48.14814814814815,8
and he's got a  he's got his life uh jacket on and stuff like that ,control,50.0,4
and they're really really struggling in this water that is just like terminal ,control,50.0,5
looks like a flash flood or something like that ,control,55.55555555555556,5
he's really trying to get a hold of her there and trying to get her going ,control,35.294117647058826,5
I couldn't tell you what the end of it is ,control,72.72727272727273,4
he ain't ,control,33.33333333333333,1
difficult time there ,control,0.0,1
well  there's a boy playing kickball   soccer outside kicking the ball around ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and he's playing and having a good time and all that and everything ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and he kicks the ball ,control,40.0,2
and it goes through a window ,control,50.0,3
and he's probably going ,control,40.0,1
 uhoh laughs ,control,0.0,1
 I'm in trouble ,control,60.0,2
and there's  in the home you can see the ball coming through ,control,50.0,5
lands  break the lamp ,control,20.0,2
a gentleman is sitting in a chair ,control,57.14285714285714,3
it's coming through there ,control,60.0,2
and he's standing up  of_course looking out the window with the ball in his hand trying to figure out who and where this ball came through ,control,50.0,6
so  I would imagine the ending would be he's gonna go out and the boy's gonna be in trouble ,control,45.83333333333333,7
it's a school morning ,control,60.0,2
and um the boy ,control,25.0,1
and he's got his backpack on ,control,57.14285714285714,2
his mom's got the umbrella in her hand because she's saying ,control,61.53846153846154,3
 it probably will rain ,control,40.0,1
 you needta take this umbrella with you ,control,50.0,2
and the boy is saying ,control,40.0,2
 no no  I'll be fine ,control,50.0,3
 it's not gonna rain ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 I'm tough ,control,50.0,1
 I'll be okay ,control,60.0,1
clears,control,0.0,0
so  as he's walking along to school or he  it starts to rain ,control,43.75,4
and he's going ,control,50.0,1
 oh_no ,control,0.0,0
then it's really starting to rain a_lot harder ,control,22.22222222222222,2
I_mean  there's even puddles ,control,16.666666666666664,2
now he's running back home ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he went in his house ,control,50.0,3
and his mom looks like ,control,40.0,2
 well  see  I told you ,control,25.0,2
 it was gonna rain ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 you needed an umbrella ,control,40.0,2
he's standing there looking just drenched and patheticlikenadj ,control,22.22222222222222,3
 ugh ,control,0.0,0
I'm not as tough as I thought I was ,control,60.0,4
so  and then he's leaving again with the umbrella ,control,45.45454545454545,0
and he's happily walking in the rain now ,control,44.44444444444444,3
at_least he isn't getting wet ,control,33.33333333333333,1
on to school ,control,66.66666666666666,2
okay  this is the story about Cinderella who was kinda ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and she had a stepmother and two stepsisters ,control,25.0,3
that she was in this family   this family and everything ,control,63.63636363636363,3
but the stepmother treated the stepsisters very good and treated her very bad ,control,23.07692307692308,3
I_mean  she hadta clean everything ,control,33.33333333333333,3
she hadta do all the work ,control,50.0,2
and she was just treated like  no good ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and so anyway  so  that's the way it went all the time ,control,40.0,4
it was continually ,control,66.66666666666666,1
there was nothing she could do about it ,control,75.0,4
but she enjoyed the  the animals ,control,42.85714285714285,2
you_know  the dog and the cat and the mouse and ,control,27.27272727272727,0
she was just very nice  young lady ,control,25.0,3
did what she was sposta do ,control,50.0,2
and then um  there was a ball coming up that they were all invited to the whole family ,control,42.10526315789473,5
and  um but the stepmother wouldn't let her go ,control,27.27272727272727,2
she said she hadta stay home and clean the fireplace  and do chores and that she could not go ,control,30.0,5
it didn't matter ,control,50.0,1
so  while the  step the stepmother and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go and got all new dresses and jewelry and you_know were getting all ready to go to it she got really sad ,control,25.64102564102564,6
she was very sad very very sad ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and then  um  so the stepmom and two stepsisters left to go to the ball ,control,23.52941176470588,4
and this was a prince's ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
it was actually a king's ball but  I_mean  you_know ,control,25.0,3
and um so she went outside ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and I believe she was probably crying ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and then the um like fairy godmother came along and was sitting out in the garden and everything ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and was talking to her and says ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 you_know  do you wanna go ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 we'll make it so you can go and everything ,control,63.63636363636363,2
 I'll fix everything with my magic wand laughs ,control,50.0,3
anyway  and uh so she ges,control,14.285714285714285,0
and she had this beautiful dress that you_know appeared on her and beautiful shoes and ges,control,31.25,6
I can't think of what that thing is ,control,66.66666666666666,4
tiara and everything ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and then she  they went outside ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and they turned the mice and pumpkins into this great big beautiful carriage with horses and with like a pumpkin carriage and everything for her to go and  you_know ,control,33.33333333333333,9
so  she got in the carriage ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and  uh but the fairy godmother said ,control,12.5,2

and she was gonna have a good time and everything ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and um they went on to the ball at the king's palace and all that ,control,50.0,4
and then she met the prince ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they danced ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and they just really really liked each_other very very much ,control,10.0,2
you could tell ,control,66.66666666666666,1
so ,control,0.0,0
and everything ,control,50.0,1
so  she was out dancing and talking to him and the stuff like that ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and then it rang at twelve midnight ,control,28.57142857142857,3
