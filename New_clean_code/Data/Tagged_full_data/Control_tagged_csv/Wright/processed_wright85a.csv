we have a man stranded in a tree ,control,50.0,5
because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat ,control,45.45454545454545,3
because a little girl was crying because a cat was up in the tree ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and uh lips_smack after the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down ,control,42.85714285714285,5
a dog came along and is barking up the tree ,control,50.0,3
and the firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and I'm assuming everything ends up okay ,control,50.0,2
the end ,control,50.0,1
well  the most recent episode is a broken bone ,control,30.0,3
but it was  head,control,40.0,2
I uh  had been having pai,control,42.85714285714285,2
the more I walked the more it hurt ,control,50.0,2
but I really just kind_of ignored it ,control,28.57142857142857,2
I was more concerned about my right foot with the toe nail looking like it was lifting off the bed ,control,55.00000000000001,7
and I didn't quite know what to do about this ,control,45.45454545454545,3
so  I made a appointment with the foot doctor ,control,50.0,4
but my foot doctor is in Waukegan  lips_smack Illinois ,control,30.0,4
and uh let's see ,control,20.0,2
how did that work ,control,75.0,1
 sighs oh_boy ,control,0.0,1
we came  we came directly from  we had been on a  c a cruise ,control,52.94117647058824,5
and we had visited our children in  in Orlando ,control,50.0,2
and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan  so I could see the foot doctor ,control,37.5,3
 lips_smack a,control,33.33333333333333,1
but anyway when I finally got to the foot doctor uh she just explained that the,control,43.75,4
so  she just ges,control,40.0,1
took half a ges,control,50.0,2
that was done ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and then I casually mentioned laughs that my left foot was hurting ,control,33.33333333333333,4
an,control,100.0,0
an,control,100.0,0
and that led to xrays ,control,40.0,2
which showed there was a small broken bone ,control,37.5,3
eh which led to my having to wear a boot for a month ,control,46.15384615384615,6
and then come back  for more xrays ,control,12.5,3
so,control,0.0,0
then I turned arou,control,25.0,1
more xrays ,control,0.0,1
and the stupid thing is not healed yet which is  usual for me ,control,42.85714285714285,5
because this whole scenario happened once before ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and uh she says ,control,25.0,1
 another month with the boot ,control,50.0,0
 lips_smack an,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I forgot to do it ,control,33.33333333333333,2
no  I did it yesterday ,control,50.0,0
and uh  lips_smack she also told me that when I came  ba when I would be coming back th the end of this month she would not be there because her husband was  taking a job somewhere else ,control,48.78048780487805,8
and of_course she's following him ,control,50.0,1
lips_smack and nice thing about the visit is k I really like that foot doctor as a person ,control,38.88888888888889,5
and she's pregnant ,control,50.0,1
and she's gonna have her second child ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I thought that was real nice ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but anyway I said ,control,25.0,1
 well  since you're not gonna be here in a month I will get a foot doctor in Arizona ,control,45.45454545454545,5
so  that's where I am now ,control,62.5,0
I'm waiting for this stupid foot to heal ,control,44.44444444444444,3
the end ,control,50.0,1
oh_my ,control,0.0,0
let's see ,control,33.33333333333333,2
right ,control,0.0,0
first I hafta think frightened or scared ,control,14.285714285714285,2
lips_smack  ges,control,0.0,1
lips_smack um  we had  uh in the bathroom was a crawl not a crawl space  was a  a  ges  laughs a cubicle ,control,39.285714285714285,6
I don't know how to describe it ,control,50.0,2
ges you had your linen closet ,control,33.33333333333333,3
ges and then underneath the linen  linen closet was an open area ,control,30.76923076923077,5
eh which had a uh ges uh area inside of it to get to the plumbing i in the bathtub ,control,45.0,4
and we used that open area for uh a dirty clothes,control,36.36363636363637,3
except there head,control,66.66666666666666,1
and for a reason I don't remember  lips_smack the children  told me that there was a big animal  looking out_of this  ges area ,control,39.285714285714285,7
so,control,0.0,0
 well  hand,control,0.0,0
but nevertheless I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn't get out ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and then we  we went outside ,control,28.57142857142857,0
and we saw,control,33.33333333333333,1
I'm not sure,control,50.0,1
with its hand,control,66.66666666666666,2
looking out at us from the uh  ges air vents I guess you call those  that are in the uh  ges foundation of the house ,control,50.0,8
lips_smack and that really scared me ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I thought ,control,50.0,1
 if that thing gets in the house eh or gets out it could bite the kids ,control,47.05882352941176,4
 and it might be rab rabid ,control,42.85714285714285,2
um so  I called the  animal shelter  I think it was ,control,42.85714285714285,3
lips_smack laughs and they told me that they  everybody was on lunch ,control,53.84615384615385,5
lips_smack and so they wouldn't be there for an hour ,control,45.45454545454545,3
which,control,100.0,0
because if someone gets bit I will sue the city ,control,60.0,2
lips_smack so,control,0.0,1
and uh the uh men uh were not happy to see this,control,25.0,3
because he really looked hand,control,40.0,1
and they ges took off the vent ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and somehow they caught him ,control,40.0,1
lips_smack and then they discovered  I believe this is   they discovered  a nest of baby opossums ,control,36.84210526315789,8
which all looked very cute ,control,40.0,2
when they're babies they're  ges all kinds of babies look cute ,control,50.0,5
so  anyway they took the opossum and babies away ,control,30.0,2
and the story ended happily ever after laughs ,control,25.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
well  my mother had a stroke ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and uh but thank the good lord that he,control,33.33333333333333,2
uh so  I was able  you_know we were able to communicate with no problem ,control,37.5,5
but I remember one time again uh living in my own home in  in Waukegan ,control,31.25,5
um  my neighbor who  who was going to be my husband ,control,46.15384615384615,0
but of_course hand,control,0.0,1
uh he  w he rents out a uh I call it a garage ,control,50.0,0
it was,control,100.0,1
so  anyway  he rents out the garage and there's uh uh Spanish speaking couple there ,control,27.77777777777778,3
points,control,0.0,0
lips_smack lips_smack and the lady comes over to my house  and somehow communicated to me that she had locked herself out_of her house ,control,50.0,6
lips_smack an,control,50.0,1
lips_smack so,control,0.0,1
and I don't  I c didn't have any children that would ges,control,46.66666666666666,0
and I don't even remember if the kids were home ,control,45.45454545454545,3
but then I took her head,control,33.33333333333333,2
and spoke Spanish ,control,0.0,1
lips_smack and so then we found out for sure what the problem wa,control,38.46153846153847,3
and I volunteered to take the lady to work ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and that wouldn't  wasn't feasible ,control,37.5,2
because she hadta have her i i_d ,control,57.14285714285714,3
which was ges locked in the house ,control,57.14285714285714,5
so  then we went down the street further laughs uh where I knew a ges,control,43.75,4
and laughs we got this  uh asked this child to help ,control,25.0,4
but of_course he answered the door very cautiously ,control,25.0,2
and told us that he couldn't come out_of the house ,control,54.54545454545454,4
because he's not allowed to come out_of the house when mom and dad aren't home ,control,41.17647058823529,4
 hand,control,0.0,1
 well  when mom gets home laughs come and see us ,control,16.666666666666664,3

he comes up the street ,control,60.0,3
he climbs in her ges,control,60.0,3
and end of story again laughs ,control,16.666666666666664,3
 hm  lips_smack well I'm ready ,control,25.0,1
uh this  uh  this looks like a  a  uh a picture of a flood ,control,44.44444444444444,6

and a fireman or some kind  other kind of rescue personnel is tr going to try to rescue her ,control,25.0,5
he's hanging on for dear life to a limb ,control,60.0,3
and he's got what looks like a belt over an arm ,control,58.333333333333336,6
perhaps to put around the uh lips_smack girl to rescue her ,control,27.27272727272727,2
 and this looks like it could be an actual picture of a real happening ,control,53.333333333333336,5
lips_smack the end ,control,33.33333333333333,2

an,control,100.0,0
and he's looking out through the broken window ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and that's the end of this story ,control,62.5,4
oh ,control,0.0,0
laughs okay ,control,0.0,1
lips_smack we have a child  a mother holding an umbrella and a child who I would guess is going to school ,control,40.909090909090914,7
