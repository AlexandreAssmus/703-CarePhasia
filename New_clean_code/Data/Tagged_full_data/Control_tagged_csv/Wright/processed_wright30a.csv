first you take two pieces of bread ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and you get out the peanut butter and a knife ,control,40.0,3
and you smear the peanut butter on one side of the bread ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and then you get out the jelly and a knife ,control,40.0,3
and smear the jelly on the other side of the bread ,control,45.45454545454545,5
then you take the ges,control,40.0,2
and that's your sandwich ,control,60.0,2
um you dig a hole in the soil ,control,50.0,4
and then you take the flower out_of its pot ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and you hafta loosen the roots ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and if you want you can put Miracle_Grow laughs underneath ,control,50.0,3
I love gardening ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and you put the flower in the hole ,control,50.0,3
and then you fill it back up with dirt ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and then you water it ,control,40.0,1
it is the little boy's birthday ,control,42.85714285714285,3
he's having his birthday party today ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but the dog found the cake ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and ate a big chunk out_of the cake ,control,25.0,3
and left caky doggie footprints laughs all the way under the couch ,control,33.33333333333333,4
the mother is ma,control,50.0,2
she's got the broom ,control,60.0,2
I think she's gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why it's hiding ,control,62.5,7
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  they are coming in with their presents um seeing a  a mangled cake for the birthday ,control,52.63157894736842,5
oh  and it looks like the little boy is crying ,control,36.36363636363637,3
um okay  so  I was hospitalized well sort_of um in November for abdominal surgery ,control,31.25,3
and um I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before ,control,52.63157894736842,5
but it kicked in really fast ,control,33.33333333333333,2
like they tell you to take three deep breaths ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out ,control,41.66666666666667,3
um and it was kind_of like taking a long blink ,control,40.0,4
and then I opened my eyes ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and it was like three hours later ,control,28.57142857142857,3
which was really strange because usually like you_know when you sleep you can feel time passing ,control,43.75,3
like it didn't feel like any time had passed ,control,50.0,3
so  it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that you_know three hours had gone by ,control,45.45454545454545,6
everything was all over with ,control,60.0,2
um and then I was on pain meds ,control,37.5,3
I stayed overnight ,control,33.33333333333333,1
um and then I went home ,control,16.666666666666664,1
I was on pain meds ,control,60.0,3
um but then I  I was able to go off of those ,control,46.15384615384615,5
um I'm not sure what else you wanna know about it laughs ,control,46.15384615384615,6
um no not off hand ,control,20.0,2
um okay  so  I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator ,control,42.10526315789473,3
um she would hold things in ,control,50.0,1
and you_know you could just feel the energy that she was upset ,control,50.0,3
but um she wouldn't talk about it ,control,50.0,2
I asked her on numerous occasions to  you_know if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her ,control,61.90476190476191,3
she always said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 no ,control,0.0,0
um and then um she kind_of passively aggressively started you_know not participating in things or you_know just kind_of being rude  I guess laughs ,control,16.666666666666664,5
so  it finally you_know broke my last little straw ,control,30.0,2
and I yelled at her one day ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and kicked her out_of the group ,control,50.0,3
so  laughs that's what I did about it laughs ,control,54.54545454545454,3
okay  well  I'm afraid of heights ,control,33.33333333333333,3
even little heights ,control,0.0,2
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder ,control,40.0,3
so  I decided uh one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving um you_know thing  you_know jump  I guess that's what you call it a jump  for his birthday ,control,37.142857142857146,6
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights ,control,54.54545454545454,4
so  we went sky diving ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and it was terrifying ,control,50.0,1
and when I  when we jumped out_of the plane you_know you're attached to someone else ,control,58.82352941176471,4
so  when we jumped out_of the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute laughs while we were free falling because I was just like ges,control,51.51515151515152,6
um and then the parachute opens ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and then you start gliding which is kind of nice ,control,30.0,4
that was  that was better ,control,66.66666666666666,2
it was a little bit more like being a bird you_know and flying ,control,46.15384615384615,4
um so  that was nice for a little bit ,control,50.0,0
and then we landed ,control,25.0,1
and then that was that ,control,60.0,1
and I said I'm glad I did it ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and I'll never do it again laughs ,control,37.5,2
and I'm still afraid of heights laughs ,control,37.5,3
um so  the story starts with the flood ,control,44.44444444444444,3
there's lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat  um to save her cat from the flood and the rains ,control,44.82758620689656,7
so  she got caught in the flood ,control,62.5,3
she got swept downstream ,control,50.0,1
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out ,control,46.15384615384615,6
and she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her ,control,46.15384615384615,6
um someone saw her ,control,50.0,1
called the fire department ,control,25.0,2
and now the  the firemen are there ,control,37.5,2
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on ,control,58.82352941176471,4
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him I think that's what that looks like  uh to get her out_of the water ,control,48.14814814814815,4
and that's the end ,control,60.0,2
okay  the boy is playing soccer outside ,control,25.0,2
he kicks the ball really hard ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it goes crashing into the window ,control,50.0,4

um he jumps up ,control,50.0,1

he goes outside ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and it's sprinkling a little bit ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and then it's r,control,40.0,1
and there's puddles all over ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and mom was right ,control,25.0,1

and then um there's  Cinderella  let's see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them ,control,29.629629629629623,7
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream ,control,52.63157894736842,5
so  then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married ,control,59.09090909090909,7
and he must have a ball to find his wife ,control,40.0,4
so  they send out invitations to  around the town ,control,54.54545454545454,6
and the stepmother gets the invitation ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince ,control,33.33333333333333,8
so  they get ready ,control,40.0,1
Cinderella has the  the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them ,control,42.85714285714285,4

so  she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers ,control,50.0,3
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and her stepmother and the sisters don't know who she is because she looks so different ,control,47.05882352941176,3

so  they show up with the slipper at her house ,control,63.63636363636363,3
and the stepmother locks her in the room  locks Cinderella in the room ,control,42.85714285714285,6
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsister's feet which it doesn't fit because they have big feet ,control,40.909090909090914,5
