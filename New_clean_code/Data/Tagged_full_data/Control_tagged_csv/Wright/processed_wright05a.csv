and it was the last one before  as it turned out before it exploded and  um in  in its return trip ,control,50.0,6
and so my dad was real anxious to see this thing that  that he had been talking about ,control,47.368421052631575,6
so  we went to see it ,control,42.85714285714285,2

I poked my finger in the cage ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and the monkey ges,control,25.0,1
uh so_that although it didn't actually break the bone it twisted my finger so_that it's always been crooked ,control,55.00000000000001,6

and of_course I do  do not speak Italian ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  it became imperative that I be able to at_least read enough so that I knew what was going on ,control,47.61904761904761,4
but lots of times I misunderstood ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and so I would hafta um point to what somebody else was eating if that's what I wanted to order ,control,52.38095238095239,4
or uh we'd go in a  caf a cafeteria and so I could point to the food that I wanted ,control,50.0,5

and the father was disturbed because he hadn't found uh the princess that he wanted to marry ,control,44.44444444444444,5
so  he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday ,control,53.84615384615385,4
and he sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball ,control,38.88888888888889,4
so  the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation ,control,50.0,3

and had Cinderella polish and shine everything so_that they would look just elegant ,control,30.76923076923077,4

 oh ,control,0.0,0
they couldn't  she could not go with them ,control,60.0,0
that was absolutely impossible because she was nothing but a chambermaid ,control,72.72727272727273,5
and so they actually tore her dress so she couldn't wear it ,control,46.15384615384615,2
they got in their coach and left ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and the sisters were so mean to her ,control,50.0,3
and all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appeared ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I will take care of this ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land ,control,60.0,6

and it was just gorgeous ,control,40.0,2
and Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful ,control,20.0,2
but she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 how am I going to get there ,control,37.5,2
and the fairy said ,control,25.0,2
 bring me the pumpkin and mice ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she made a coach out_of the pumpkin and horses  and mice became horses ,control,26.666666666666668,4
so  they carried her to the  to the ball ,control,63.63636363636363,3
when she entered the prince was just dazzled by her ,control,60.0,3
and he asked her to dance ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they danced again ,control,25.0,1
and they danced again ,control,25.0,1
and finally it struck midnight ,control,20.0,1
and she knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave as soon as  uh before midnight ,control,42.30769230769231,6
so  she dashed out_of the uh ball ,control,50.0,3
and in her hurry she lost one of her slippers  um glass slippers ,control,35.714285714285715,5
and got into the coach and uh took off ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve ,control,40.0,2
and she had nothing but a pumpkin and mice ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and she had lost her pretty dress ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but she still had one single glass slipper ,control,12.5,2
and so she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she didn't think she'd ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and the  the sisters came home ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and they were talking about this strange young woman who was there ,control,50.0,4
that she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her ,control,60.0,3
and they wondered who she was and how_come he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and then the prince was dis  so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing Cinderella ,control,40.54054054054054,13
and the  um the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper uh on all  all of the eligible young women ,control,41.935483870967744,7
and so the stepmother said ,control,20.0,2
 we have only two ,control,20.0,2
and um so he  they tried to push their big feet into the sli sli glass slipper and it wouldn't work ,control,30.434782608695656,5
they were too big ,control,50.0,2
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 but isn't there another young woman here ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and Cinderella came out ,control,25.0,1
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 yes I'm here ,control,40.0,1
even_though the stepmother said ,control,50.0,2
 no no no we don't have anybody else ,control,30.0,2
and the envoy said ,control,25.0,2
 oh  well  then you must try it on ,control,36.36363636363637,2
and so she pulled out the slipper that was in her pocket that she'd been carrying ,control,64.70588235294117,5
and said ,control,0.0,1
 I think this matches ,control,40.0,2
and he slipped the other shoe on her foot ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and they both fit beautifully ,control,40.0,2
and he then took her back to the palace ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and they had a beautiful wedding ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after laughs ,control,18.181818181818183,3
