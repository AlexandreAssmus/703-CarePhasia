and they noticed he was stuck in the tree ,control,55.55555555555556,4

um last spring right before summer vacation I was laughs in my house  small apartment uh complex  small apartment just doing some schoolwork or something ,control,25.925925925925924,5
and I suddenly started hearing this imit,control,28.57142857142857,3
um and I,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I went into the kitchen ,control,50.0,3
and I notice there's a bee in my  inside my house which I don't understand how ,control,57.89473684210527,7
covers,control,0.0,0
because it's absolutely closed all the time ,control,62.5,2
screens on the window ,control,50.0,3
there's no way ,control,50.0,2
so  I thought that was odd  you_know trying to get out the window ,control,40.0,4
and I captured it ,control,50.0,1
and I put it outside ,control,40.0,1
and I noticed there were some bees flying around outside ,control,30.0,4
ges,control,0.0,0
I go into the bathroom ,control,60.0,3
and my bathroom  my shower stall has been invaded by about fifty bees ,control,35.714285714285715,4
I'm telling you it was like a horror movie ,control,70.0,4
it was the sound of ges imit,control,57.14285714285714,4
yes points,control,0.0,1
and I'm not overly phobic of bees ,control,37.5,3
I like them in their place ,control,66.66666666666666,3
I'm not like someone who runs away from them ,control,70.0,6
but a_lot_of them in my house in my bathroom ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and that feeling of going in ,control,50.0,3
and it was like a horror movie like imit,control,55.55555555555556,4
so  ges,control,0.0,1
ges,control,0.0,0
ges and they're all trying to get out the window which was good ,control,50.0,5
they were focused on the window ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  yeah I  I freaked ,control,28.57142857142857,2
um I,control,50.0,1
I actually got a dirty towel and like ges,control,33.33333333333333,2
because you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and uh gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying ,control,25.0,3
 um you needta get here now ,control,14.285714285714285,2
 we needta figure this out ,control,50.0,2
 what's going on ,control,60.0,1
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole ges,control,57.14285714285714,4
they were looking for a new um place to start a hive ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting ,control,41.66666666666667,4
we hadta get someone um ,control,40.0,2
you_know  were they going in everywhere ,control,42.85714285714285,2
how were they getting in ,control,80.0,1
they hadta call a bee expert ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so then  but yeah that was a freaky moment ,control,30.0,1
and I was very creeped out ,control,50.0,1
I remember going into my closet and like ges,control,44.44444444444444,4
and I_mean ges they were very focused on the windows ,control,40.0,4
but it was a_little creepy to think that like it might be ges,control,46.15384615384615,3
points,control,0.0,0
ges,control,0.0,0
that was creepy uh for sure ,control,50.0,2
you_know  and the bathroom is the last place you need anything ,control,41.66666666666667,3
yeah  you're vulnerable enough ,control,33.33333333333333,2
let's be honest ,control,50.0,2
like you just don't need anything coming at you with a stinger ,control,61.53846153846154,5
so  yes that was  that was  that was scary ,control,58.333333333333336,2
certainly ,control,0.0,0
sighs I'm trying to think of specific examples in the moment  whispering ,control,35.714285714285715,7
it's interesting  whispering ,control,40.0,1
um  um I'm trying to think of,control,33.33333333333333,2
certainly while teaching um sometimes having students  particular students who really are struggling ,control,21.428571428571427,4
and you feel like there's not clear communication ,control,33.33333333333333,3
it's not uh a coherent reason for why it's not working and a resolution kind of thing ,control,47.368421052631575,4
and you're struggling to understand ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um certainly sending emails to find out ,control,14.285714285714285,3
taking a moment saying ,control,25.0,3
 I wanna talk with you ,control,50.0,3
 I'm feeling you_know this  this is  this is  these are my concerns ,control,58.82352941176471,5
 um how can I better support you,control,50.0,1
 is there anything going on that you wish to share with me ,control,61.53846153846154,5
like those  ges trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy um and whatever they'd be interested in ,control,45.45454545454545,5
asking them ,control,50.0,1
you_know  I think it really helps to just start with you_know ,control,25.0,4
 these are my concerns ,control,60.0,2
i_e missing work or behavior in class or something like that ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of ges where to go next um with that ,control,46.66666666666666,9
I'm trying to think ,control,40.0,2
I've had  I've had some really difficult situations with students of you_know basically just really disagreeing over the  the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences ,control,39.39393939393939,7
and um oh I'm trying to think specifically ,control,22.22222222222222,2
I_mean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because  then it's not just ges you and the other person ,control,27.27272727272727,5
um ges,control,0.0,1
is it just in this situation ,control,66.66666666666666,3
or is it a broader picture ges uh problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers ,control,41.66666666666667,8
and shrugs those are things I can think of ,control,55.55555555555556,3

and he was saying ,control,50.0,1
 no no no waves,control,20.0,1
 I don't want it ,control,50.0,1
 I don't believe in umbrellas ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  he left ,control,50.0,1
he said ,control,50.0,1
 goodbye  Mom ,control,0.0,1
and he started walking out the door ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and then lo_and_behold it started to rain a few drops ,control,20.0,3
he put his hands out hand,control,50.0,2
and all_of_a_sudden a_lot came down ,control,20.0,2
he was covering his  head excuse me  and running back to the house ,control,40.0,6
he was all wet ,control,50.0,2
he went into the house and he was soaking wet ,control,50.0,3
his mother was very displeased because she ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and this was something they were working on ,control,75.0,3
his ability to listen to her and accept her direction ,control,40.0,4
long term goal ,control,0.0,2
and then he took the umbrella and started walking back to school ,control,25.0,5
and it was okay because the umbrella kept him from getting rained on ,control,61.53846153846154,4
the end ,control,50.0,1
okay ,control,0.0,0
so  slaps,control,0.0,1
and she loved her father very much ,control,28.57142857142857,2
but her mother died ,control,25.0,2
so  her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl ,control,38.88888888888889,6
her name was Cinderella ,control,50.0,2
this woman came with two daughters ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but they were unpleasant ,control,50.0,1
and they were ugly ,control,50.0,1
we hafta be honest ,control,25.0,1
they were very ugly ,control,50.0,2
so  there's a great deal of stress after Cinderella's father,control,38.46153846153847,5
she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and they useta make her clean fingers,control,28.57142857142857,3
and they useta make her cook fingers,control,28.57142857142857,3
and they were very mean to her,control,57.14285714285714,3
and they made her live in the attic fingers,control,44.44444444444444,4
and they made her wear ug old ugly clothes fingers,control,30.0,3
but she was very very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative ,control,14.285714285714285,4
and she befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds ,control,50.0,3
and when she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of Fantasialand ,control,43.333333333333336,8
and laughs so she useta dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress  a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown ,control,29.629629629629623,8
but she never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear ,control,47.82608695652174,5
and they always said to her ,control,50.0,2
 you'll never go to the ball ,control,50.0,3
 you'll never go the palace ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big  a very big dance because the king was slaps,control,38.46153846153847,5
seriously ,control,0.0,0
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men ,control,46.15384615384615,3
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day he's going to be the king ,control,50.0,4
and he needed to have children ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and he needed to have a wife ,control,28.57142857142857,3
so  they were gonna have a big ball ,control,40.0,3
so  they were having a ball ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and Cinderella's ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go ,control,8.333333333333332,3
and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes ,control,37.5,5
and Cinderella really really wanted to go ,control,0.0,2
she was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go ,control,56.25,5
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds ,control,35.294117647058826,6
and they knew how to sew ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they knew how to accessorize ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they knew how to design dresses apparently ,control,25.0,2
so  they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and she was so surprised and so excited ,control,25.0,3
I wonder what was next  whispering ,control,42.85714285714285,3
then she,control,50.0,1
and at the ball she met the prince ,control,50.0,3
and it was just love at first sight ,control,37.5,3
the way it should be ,control,80.0,2
he loved her and she loved him ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and they had a wonderful time dancing ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and  then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there ,control,37.5,4
and they were pulling her dress ,control,50.0,2
and they were tearing her scarves ,control,50.0,2
and they chased her away and made her go home ,control,30.0,3
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry ,control,60.0,7
and so he sent out a message to ges,control,44.44444444444444,2
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry ,control,57.692307692307686,7
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper ,control,43.75,12
so  the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out ,control,43.75,4
and then the prince did find her ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and then they got married ,control,40.0,1
and then the king was happy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and we don't really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters ,control,38.46153846153847,4
