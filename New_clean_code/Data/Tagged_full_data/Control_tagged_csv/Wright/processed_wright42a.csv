mom had planned a birthday party ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it was gonna be the fourth birthday party for her  s her youngest boy ,control,43.75,6
she had set out a  m the most beautiful cake ,control,45.45454545454545,3
well  the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake ,control,35.714285714285715,4
so  he got himself a big mouthful ,control,50.0,2
and got his paws into it too ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and ran and hid underneath the sofa so_that the mom couldn't get at him with the broom ,control,50.0,5
the little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined ,control,50.0,3
and his mom was trying to hit his dog ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um in the meantime the guest started showing up at the door  uh carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on ,control,41.66666666666667,7
you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking uh two pieces of bread ,control,26.666666666666668,5
you  on one side you spread the peanut butter ,control,40.0,0
and on the other side you spread the jelly ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and then you put the two together ,control,28.57142857142857,2
oh_my sighs uh in about nineteen eighty four  eighty five ,control,9.090909090909092,4
it's been a long time ,control,66.66666666666666,2
um I had my four points,control,33.33333333333333,2
um I had  as a precaution I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so_that I wouldn't get an infection ,control,47.82608695652174,6
um because when I was seven years old I had rheumatic fever ,control,41.66666666666667,4
you_know  and they always told me ,control,28.57142857142857,0
 well  your immune system isn't gonna be near as strong so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery  including oral surgery ,control,27.27272727272727,7
so  I did that ,control,60.0,1
and tha that evening I  early evening my throat swelled up ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh don't know if it was from the penicillin or what but um I ended up back at the dentist's office ,control,47.82608695652174,4
and they ended up having to take uh some epinephrine ,control,30.0,4
they gave me shots of epinephrine ,control,50.0,3
I think two of them ,control,60.0,3
and they also took s a syringe points,control,37.5,2
uh shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called ang uh ,control,50.0,4
they called it then angioneurotic edema uh but it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called uh hereditary angioedema ,control,28.57142857142857,5
um the difference between ges,control,40.0,2
hereditary angioedema cannot ,control,25.0,2
it hasta be  the only thing that  i until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that uh during an episode was the epinephrine ,control,55.172413793103445,8
uh during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up ,control,50.0,4
just out_of the clear blue ,control,40.0,2
uh I went to urgent care ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um in urgent care they started an i_v on me ,control,50.0,3
and the doctor ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I don't know if she was a doctor or a p_a ,control,58.333333333333336,4
um anyway she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline ges,control,41.66666666666667,5
an and anybody that's head,control,66.66666666666666,3
it goes intermuscular ,control,33.33333333333333,1
um because it takes  within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty beats a minute ,control,29.411764705882355,5
uh in my case I think I went over two hundred ,control,45.45454545454545,3
um and I remember my  th it felt like points,control,36.36363636363637,3
you_know  at the base of my skull ,control,50.0,0
um j just from so much pressure ,control,14.285714285714285,5
and I'd head,control,50.0,1
I've been knocked out once you_know playing football but I never passed out ,control,42.85714285714285,2
um and I knew I was gonna pass out ,control,40.0,3
and I told the doctor that ,control,50.0,2
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 okay lay back ,control,0.0,2
so  I  s I looked at her and said ,control,45.45454545454545,3
 I can't I can't ,control,57.14285714285714,2
 I don't dare ,control,40.0,1
so  she put her hands behind me ges,control,55.55555555555556,2
and at that point I don't know what was going on externally but internally I was  fishing with my grandfather ,control,50.0,5
and he was  it was at a favorite fishing place that I  that I had uh when I was growing up ,control,60.86956521739131,6
and he was walking up the  r the stream bank wanting ta ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I wanna go ,control,25.0,2
 I wanna go ,control,25.0,2
 h no it's not your time to go fishing with me ,control,38.46153846153847,1
 go home ,control,0.0,1
so  I woke up and later was told that um ,control,45.45454545454545,2
I  I can recall actually  I don't  I don't know if this is something you want on tape or not but ,control,50.0,6
I  I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was like looking at myself and looking at the doctor and you_know watching what they were doing ,control,50.0,9
and it was like ,control,50.0,1
 jeez  what are you doing to me ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and then it hit me that ,control,50.0,1
 oh  yeah  they're doing it to me laughs ,control,41.66666666666667,3
uh  my wife hasta fill in the details you_know of other stuff that happened ,control,33.33333333333333,5
but apparently they brought in the crash cart ,control,37.5,2
and I guess you_know zapped me at_least once ,control,25.0,2
uh I did come back ,control,40.0,1
uh overall I was out for seven minutes ,control,37.5,3
uh not breathing for seven minutes ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and to this day have had little if any uh effects you_know  aftereffects from that ,control,43.75,3
you_know  they  they say seven minutes your brain is dead ,control,33.33333333333333,4
well  I have no idea why but it didn't affect me ,control,46.15384615384615,2
not  I'm sure sometimes it effects me you_know in some of my memory but that could be aging too laughs so ,control,47.82608695652174,7
that is very vivid to me ,control,66.66666666666666,3
the  sighs probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee uh who was actually hired for me ,control,50.0,5
he came in as  uh I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe uh and needed an assistant ,control,43.47826086956522,6
the assistant was brought in ,control,60.0,2
and  when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kind_of looked at each other and said ,control,54.54545454545454,6
 what did he just say ,control,50.0,1
uh he's Filipino ,control,50.0,1
uh he's  he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog ,control,52.38095238095239,4
um I don't know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently ,control,42.85714285714285,7
uh there's a_lot_of people that wouldn't give him the chance ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and you_know I actually was doing some interpreting for him beca you_know at one time or another because I understood what he was saying ,control,50.0,4
uh and  that was  to me it was probably the most difficult uh one that I hadta deal with ,control,47.61904761904761,5
uh not because I didn't understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him ,control,40.0,5
um but I also spent some time in Mexico ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and there's people down there that speak no English ,control,30.0,4
so  I've you_know hadta adapt ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish ,control,36.36363636363637,4
enough to get by ,control,25.0,2
uh things like uh uh uh ,control,0.0,2
 gustans,control,0.0,0
uh or uh ,control,0.0,2
 dondes,control,0.0,1
you_know  the important stuff you_know laughs ,control,14.285714285714285,3
uh the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico ,control,50.0,5
and we were  at the time we'd been discussing this ,control,66.66666666666666,4
and we were just standing in line at the movie theater ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico ,control,52.63157894736842,5
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see ,control,27.77777777777778,6
you_know  to go to the  the island of Cozumel and you_know travel around there a little bit ,control,26.31578947368421,5
because there's some ruins there and it's a really nice place ,control,46.15384615384615,4
well  the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there uh apparently was an ex marine or something ,control,43.47826086956522,6
he was just perfectly built ,control,40.0,1
um and he had  they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab they'd gotten near the port ,control,45.83333333333333,8
I think they were doing uh one of the Princess_Cruises or something ,control,50.0,5
so  they'd come into port and had been  spent the day there ,control,46.66666666666666,3
and then they hadta get back to the ship ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  they hired a cab ,control,50.0,2
well  the cab starts going the other direction ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and he kept telling him ,control,40.0,2
 no  no  no  no you're going the wrong way ,control,42.85714285714285,3
 the port's over here ,control,16.666666666666664,3
you_know ,control,0.0,0
 you needta go back this way ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and he wouldn't stop ,control,40.0,1
and he kept saying ,control,25.0,1
 not to worry ,control,0.0,1
 I know short cut ,control,20.0,2
 it's okay ,control,50.0,1
and he said he finally ended up uh convincing the guy that he better stop ,control,40.0,4
um and he and his wife just jumped out_of the vehicle as it was moving ,control,46.66666666666666,3
and people in the neighborhood that they were  that they had jumped out_of into uh started screaming about  you_know at  yelling for the federaless,control,48.14814814814815,6
uh so  here we are ,control,33.33333333333333,2
maybe a month away  not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this ,control,35.294117647058826,0
we get there to Cozumel ,control,40.0,2
and soon as you get off the ferry uh there's all these cab drivers there ,control,43.75,4
and  wanting to you_know take you around the city  or around the island ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  this one kin you_know kind_of  I don't know  it was kind_of like hey pick me raise,control,33.33333333333333,0
and  and so we went over to him ,control,44.44444444444444,0
and he says that oh yeah he'd be glad to take us ,control,46.15384615384615,1
and he says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 uh I'll even give you a tour of the whole island ,control,46.15384615384615,4
you_know ,control,0.0,0
 you can spend however long you want with me today ,control,45.45454545454545,3
says uh you_know and he told us how much ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I can't even remember the amount ,control,37.5,2
we get in the vehicle and ,control,50.0,3
you_know  we made the contract ,control,33.33333333333333,2
we got in the vehicle ,control,60.0,3
and right off the bat he takes off into the middle of town ,control,53.84615384615385,4
 don't worry ,control,25.0,1
 it's okay ,control,50.0,1
 I just hafta stop and let the owner of the cab know where we're going ,control,41.17647058823529,6
so  here I am with my wife and my sister inlaw ,control,50.0,4
the three of us ,control,75.0,2
and we're sitting there ,control,40.0,1
the sister inlaw is just in La_la_land like ,control,37.5,2
 hey  this is just great ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 you_know  this is fantastic ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 we paid this much money which was nothing for a cab for all day ,control,60.0,8
 and we're gonna go see this you_know  this island ,control,30.76923076923077,0
and this guy goes in  into it's basically a bar ,control,50.0,3
and my wife and I are going ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 oh_my_god ,control,0.0,0
this is it ,control,100.0,1
 we're gonna   we're either gonna be abducted or we're gonna be killed right here ,control,36.36363636363637,4
well  come to find out the guy was just going in to tell the cab  the owner of the cab because apparently they owned it  uh it was coownership ,control,40.625,8
so  he went in to tell the other guy that ,control,45.45454545454545,3
 hey don't worry about using the cab because I'm using it for the day ,control,52.94117647058824,4
and he was a very good tour guide ,control,37.5,3
very good to us all day ,control,50.0,2
uh but it was  i like I said it  w it was scary there for quite awhile ,control,42.10526315789473,1
well  it was the great flood of uh nineteen eighty ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and people were doing such foolish things ,control,14.285714285714285,2
but in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people ,control,50.0,4
putting their lives on the line ,control,50.0,3
we have a firefighter that jumped in the water n to save a little girl who was about to drown ,control,40.0,6
and he held onto her until other help could get there to help get her out_ofthe  the water  the swirling water ,control,39.130434782608695,6
surely she would have died if he hadn't been there to help her out ,control,60.0,3
well  Danny was out playing soccer in the front yard ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and he'd been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well ,control,38.46153846153847,3
um so  he gave it a boot one time ,control,40.0,2
and he actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and it went over an and uh hit the window of the  the house nearby ,control,43.75,6
and broke the window ,control,25.0,2
and fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair ,control,57.14285714285714,8
the father of the house ,control,60.0,3
when they  when he approached  when it fell on his lap he was startled ,control,62.5,6
and got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from ,control,43.75,5
but of_course the little boy had run away ,control,25.0,2
well  it was a cloudy day ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and mother had watched  the uh or  heard the news  the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day ,control,37.93103448275862,7
so  when I was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella ,control,50.0,5
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  mom  it's not gonna rain today ,control,16.666666666666664,4
 I have my backpack ,control,40.0,2
 if anything happens I can hold it over my head ,control,63.63636363636363,3
 and I won't get as wet ,control,37.5,0
 so  I'm not gonna take the umbrella ,control,36.36363636363637,3
 I'll be fine ,control,60.0,1
I no sooner got down the road then wouldn't you know lo_and_behold it started to rain ,control,35.294117647058826,5
the rain turned into a torrent ,control,50.0,3
and I was actually getting very soak  soaked  from head to toe ,control,28.57142857142857,3
my backpack was wet ,control,50.0,2
my shoes were even wet ,control,40.0,2
I got back to my  to the house ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and my mom looked at me and didn't say a word ,control,41.66666666666667,3
but she knew ,control,33.33333333333333,1
after changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack I headed out again on my way to school ,control,47.368421052631575,6
this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain ,control,54.54545454545454,3
the story of Cinderella ,control,50.0,2
once upon a time in a land far far away ,control,40.0,5
there was a young girl whose parents had died ,control,44.44444444444444,4
she had an aunt but her aunt was a very bitter person ,control,41.66666666666667,4
so  she and the children  her children  her daughters were living in the house ,control,47.05882352941176,0
but Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid ,control,37.5,3
she hadta keep the house cleaned up no matter what ,control,40.0,3
as she grew older she grew more and more beautiful ,control,30.0,3
but even as beautiful as she was she was still just the housemaid ,control,46.15384615384615,3
the other girls grew up ,control,40.0,2
they weren't near as beautiful as she was ,control,55.55555555555556,3
in the meantime the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married ,control,60.0,5
and to do that he wanted ta ,control,28.57142857142857,2
he sent out invitations to all the  w the influential people within the land that they would  could attend the ball ,control,60.86956521739131,8
Cinderella's mother ,control,0.0,2
and had decided to send her two daughters ,control,25.0,3
Cinderella said ,control,0.0,1
 well  can I also go ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and they  and her mother said ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 no you can't ,control,40.0,0
 you're to stay here and keep this place clean ,control,27.27272727272727,4
so  while she was doing that she was  became a little bit disconcerted ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and her  a all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball ,control,61.90476190476191,6
because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and she asked what she really wanted ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball ,control,46.66666666666666,7
so  her fairy godmother waved her wand ,control,37.5,2
a and gave her s a the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear ,control,27.77777777777778,5
to take her off to the ball she hadta have a coach ,control,50.0,4
so  she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin ,control,50.0,3
she turned the pumpkin into the coach ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and the mice who were friends of and playmates of Cinderella were there to draw the coach ,control,41.17647058823529,6
and the cat was there to  to guide the coach ,control,36.36363636363637,3
they get to the ball ,control,60.0,3
and Cinderella meets the prince ,control,20.0,2
she has a dance with the prince ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and the prince doesn't wanna see anyone else ,control,33.33333333333333,3
he is enjoying himself so much ,control,50.0,2
but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight you will become the same Cinderella that you were before ,control,60.0,6
no matter where you are you needta be  you needta come home ,control,46.15384615384615,4
so  as this clock was striking mid the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince ,control,45.0,6
on her way out she lost her slipper  one of her glass slippers ,control,42.85714285714285,4
she got to her coach ,control,60.0,3
and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin ,control,37.5,3
and turned  and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat ,control,28.57142857142857,5
she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again ,control,42.85714285714285,4
as it turned ,control,66.66666666666666,1
the prince was so excited about this pretty young women that he wanted to meet her ,control,43.75,6
he had kept the  the glass slipper ,control,50.0,2
and knew that he hadta see her again ,control,37.5,2
so  he sent out a decree to look for the young woman whose  who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper ,control,46.42857142857143,9
that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her ,control,80.0,4
all of their  all of the women  the young women decided to go and try the slipper but none of them could make it fit ,control,44.44444444444444,6
including her sisters ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  eventually she was able to go and see the prince ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and try on the slipper ,control,40.0,3
and the prince announced that he  this was the woman that he would marry ,control,60.0,3
and they all lived happily ever after ,control,42.85714285714285,2
well  at the very beginning there was uh a bird that was hopping around in the yard ,control,50.0,5
