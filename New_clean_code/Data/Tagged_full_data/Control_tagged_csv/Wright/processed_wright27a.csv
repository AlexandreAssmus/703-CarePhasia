and so to try to have a conversation of um any depth or anything you can really just get the basics ,control,33.33333333333333,6
so  it's very interesting to try to communicate with a s,control,38.46153846153847,5
I think I'm communicating just fine ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I think they're not laughs listening ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but  laughs do you mean like they couldn't understand what I was saying to them INV,control,50.0,3
um can I tell you how that was ,control,75.0,2

and they'll ask you like what do you have in your trunk or things like that ,control,70.58823529411765,5
or they'll say something to me ,control,71.42857142857143,2

and then finally they'll find English words ,control,25.0,2
and I'll be  like head,control,57.14285714285714,3
and so it's just  it's just  it's  um it's a little scary because you don't know  w you really don't know what they're trying to say ,control,45.94594594594595,8
and you could get in trouble if you don't respond the right way ,control,50.0,3
