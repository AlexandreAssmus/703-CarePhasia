I was ill as a young girl ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and um so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health ,control,53.333333333333336,4
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did ,control,60.0,4
so  going along pretty healthy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
you_know  I had uh one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery ,control,11.76470588235294,5
no drugs no anything ,control,75.0,2
so  I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains ,control,42.10526315789473,3
and they would be like between my waist and my boobs ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and they would last like four hours ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and they were bad ,control,50.0,1
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position you_know where I could just get some relief ,control,50.0,4
you_know  and you kind_of felt sick to your stomach but it was  pains were terrible ,control,35.294117647058826,2
so  this happened a few times and you_know you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out what's wrong ,control,41.66666666666667,6
so  you tell them all of this and they think ,control,63.63636363636363,3
 hm,control,0.0,0
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but they're not telling you a thing ,control,50.0,5
so  they send me a for a sonogram ,control,66.66666666666666,3
well  I've never had one of those ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and so I told them at the place I said ,control,50.0,4
 if you find a baby in there and I'm like sixty years old ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I said ,control,50.0,1
 we both can make a_lot_of money ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  it kind_of made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me ,control,50.0,5
well  the report comes back later ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and so I have a gall bladder problem ,control,25.0,3
so  you_know it's like what do I do about it ,control,75.0,4
and um you_know nothing happens few little simple attacks ,control,11.11111111111111,3
but my husband and I are in Tennesee ,control,50.0,2
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks ,control,53.333333333333336,4
scared my husband to death because he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane ,control,60.86956521739131,4
so  when we get back I go back to the doctor again ,control,46.15384615384615,4
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and that's the way life goes ,control,42.85714285714285,3
yes um the other people uh would be my mother because I do feel like she's maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory ,control,45.83333333333333,6
and I want her to be my mother and like she always useta be ,control,35.714285714285715,3
so  it's been very hard like in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently ,control,46.15384615384615,5
I try not to tell her ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 can't you remember ,control,40.0,1
um because I'm now learning that she can't ,control,60.0,2
um so  it's difficult because it's a learning process ,control,58.333333333333336,3
it's changes weekly maybe even daily ,control,28.57142857142857,3
um that's the main communication problem right now ,control,33.33333333333333,2

but I did live in the town ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh my  fa I guess I was uh scared maybe because my father uh would go away to work into the big city ,control,37.5,5
and he would leave like on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night ,control,31.25,4
um my father being that he didn't live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family ,control,56.52173913043478,8
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and  and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town ,control,40.0,10
then we had uh a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was um loud and um I'm gonna say verbally abusive even_though I didn't realize that at that time ,control,46.15384615384615,7
and um so he would scream and yell and uh maybe not som always treat our mother like we thought ,control,25.0,1
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and  and the difference ,control,46.66666666666666,3
