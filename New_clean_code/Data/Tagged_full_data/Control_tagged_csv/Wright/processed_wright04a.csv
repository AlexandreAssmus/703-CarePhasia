and then they go across another fairy area ,control,37.5,3
and oh it's green and it's beautiful ,control,44.44444444444444,2
but all_of_a_sudden the truck hits a boulder in the road ,control,40.0,4

Carl is looking over the door to the laundry chute ,control,50.0,4

and she pets him and gives him love ,control,37.5,2
and that's the story of Carl and the little boy and mommy ,control,38.46153846153847,5
first we go to Lowes ,control,40.0,2
and we decide what kind of flower we're gonna buy ,control,41.66666666666667,5
so  we decide to get pansies ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and we want a six pack because they're already started and easy to plant ,control,33.33333333333333,4
each one has its own little square of soil ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  we go home and we say ,control,37.5,2
 where are we gonna put them ,control,50.0,0
so  we're gonna put them around the birdbath ,control,54.54545454545454,4
so  we dig little holes around the birdbath evenly ges,control,36.36363636363637,3
and when we have ges,control,40.0,2
and ges,control,0.0,1
ges,control,0.0,0
then after we ges,control,50.0,1
or the  beneath the pansy he her roots and her root ball I'll call it ,control,52.94117647058824,5
ges,control,0.0,0
ges,control,0.0,0
now pat ges,control,0.0,1
pat it down so_that the pansy stands up ,control,50.0,4
I'm talking like that book  laughs ges,control,44.44444444444444,3
stands up big and tall laughs ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and ges,control,0.0,1
and after that's done we water gently ,control,50.0,2
and then they're planted ,control,40.0,1
and happy ,control,0.0,1
well  first you need bread ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and you need peanut butter ,control,20.0,2
and you need jelly ,control,25.0,1
and you need a knife ,control,40.0,2
so  I would take two slices of bread ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I'd put them on the bread board ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and on one side I would spread peanut butter ges,control,30.0,3
and on the side I would spread jelly ges,control,44.44444444444444,3
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place ,control,52.94117647058824,7

I went into the hospital the day after Christmas to have major surgery  laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,4
but getting ready for that is  is uh much more of a story ,control,42.85714285714285,5
because uh uh my daughter and her husband came from Florida um two days before Christmas ,control,31.25,3
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife ,control,50.0,6
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and there were seven of us for Christmas ,control,50.0,3
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldn't let me drink wine because  but I snuck some in ,control,42.10526315789473,4
then five o'clock the day after Christmas um we went to the hospital ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and the rest wasn't that much fun ,control,25.0,3
um the rest of it ,control,60.0,2
the  the reason my daughter was there was to take me  look  aft look after me because she's a registered nurse ,control,44.0,5
and so she was there for about a total of seven days ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and then the cousins stayed on ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but that's what I did over the Christmas holiday laughs ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and I don't plan to do that ever again ,control,30.0,2
no ,control,0.0,0
it was a new experience however ,control,50.0,2
last weekend ,control,0.0,1
oh  last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida ,control,38.88888888888889,4

so  I moved the car out_of the garage ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and I got my ges,control,40.0,2
and I ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I took my chamois and some pail of water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing ,control,42.10526315789473,4
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday ,control,44.44444444444444,3
Sunday I vacuumed the living room ,control,33.33333333333333,2

so  I did that to ges,control,57.14285714285714,2
then having  sss laughs having vacuumed forwards ges,control,0.0,3
because you_know if I don't have everything looking just right they'll think ,control,50.0,5
 mm things are getting ahead of her ,control,37.5,3
 time to put her in the home ,control,37.5,4
you_know  ges,control,0.0,2
so  then I discovered the spots in the rug ,control,50.0,4
so  now I go out and I do the spot rug thing ,control,38.46153846153847,4
upstairs made sure everything was ready in the  in the uh guest room ,control,42.85714285714285,7
generally I didn't have a whole lot of fun ,control,40.0,3
laughs you_know ,control,0.0,1
oh and I  I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing uh the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason they're coming ,control,43.333333333333336,0
so  all in all I worked the entire weekend ,control,50.0,0
and I'm tired laughs ,control,40.0,2
oh_my_gosh what  when did I have my last vacation ,control,50.0,2
it was probably in ,control,75.0,1
well  you_know when you're retired it's hard to tell when you're on a vacation  laughs ,control,50.0,5
but I did go to Florida ,control,50.0,2
I think it was in June ,control,66.66666666666666,3
it was a sad time because ,control,66.66666666666666,2
yeah ,control,0.0,0
and you_know it's a sad time but I did have fun ,control,41.66666666666667,2
the reason it's sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years ,control,46.66666666666666,4
they were litter mates ,control,50.0,2
and one became very ill and hadta be put down ,control,20.0,2
and um I think it was  well February or March ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down ,control,42.85714285714285,4
so  those were  those were not fun ,control,55.55555555555556,2
those were not fun ,control,50.0,1
but had  I did have fun in  in Florida ,control,36.36363636363637,3
because we always do ,control,50.0,1
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx ,control,41.66666666666667,6
and we go out to dinner ,control,50.0,2
and we have wonderful gourmet meals ,control,16.666666666666664,2
we just kind_of play family ,control,20.0,2
because we don't see each other that often ,control,55.55555555555556,2
but we do things ,control,25.0,1
we  we go to the Everglades ,control,57.14285714285714,0
we take an airboat ride ,control,40.0,2
and uh  and that kind of stuff ,control,25.0,0
and they have  they once had two dogs and three cats ,control,16.666666666666664,4
they're down to two dogs and one cat now ,control,30.0,5
so  that  laughs that keeps me happy ,control,33.33333333333333,0
but pretty much that's it ,control,50.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
we'll  we'll set the scene first ,control,55.55555555555556,0
we're in a lovely little rural location here ,control,44.44444444444444,3
um the banks of a very tranquil lake ,control,37.5,3
and we have a sailboat in the lake ,control,50.0,4
and we have  actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite ,control,37.5,4
a boy  little boy playing with a kite ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  it's  it's windy ,control,62.5,2
it's windy enough to keep the flag fluffering ,control,33.33333333333333,4
now we have a cozy little house on the shore ,control,40.0,4
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and the car is parked in front of the garage ,control,50.0,5
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach ,control,43.75,3
now the beach is very very narrow ,control,28.57142857142857,2
but it's wide enough that the little girl out there can play and sh she's making a sandcastle ,control,40.0,4
and it also has a pier ,control,33.33333333333333,2
that's where the sailboat comes when it's tired ,control,70.0,3
and looks like dad's on the edge of the pier ,control,45.45454545454545,5
or maybe it's Grandpa ,control,40.0,1
we can't tell from here ,control,50.0,2
but he's fishing and he's caught a fish ,control,50.0,3
now the boy who's flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog ,control,53.333333333333336,4
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass ,control,50.0,5
shoes beside them radio playing dad reading a book ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine ,control,30.76923076923077,5
and then they have a picnic basket between them ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home ,control,52.0,6
now here we have a rural scene ,control,28.57142857142857,2
we have just a two lane highway ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees ,control,52.94117647058824,5
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front ,control,50.0,10
and the man has a map in his hand ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree ,control,44.44444444444444,7
well  it's clear ,control,40.0,1
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is ,control,50.0,9
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the car's headed ,control,38.46153846153847,4
off they go ,control,33.33333333333333,1
we see them receding into the distance ,control,57.14285714285714,4
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and suddenly there's the car back in front of the farmer ,control,41.66666666666667,7
it looks like they just went around in a circle ,control,50.0,4
who knew ,control,50.0,1
we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boy's birthday party ,control,38.88888888888889,7
and the little boy looks to be about six ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and uh what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table ,control,42.85714285714285,4
we have the front door open ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in ,control,36.36363636363637,3
obviously they're guests ,control,50.0,1
and they're carrying presents ,control,40.0,1
each one accompanied by the mother ,control,50.0,4
and they all stop and they look at the cake ,control,50.0,4
well  there's a big chunk taken out_of the cake ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and one of the candles ,control,40.0,3
looks like the little boy's fifth birthday according to the candle count ,control,30.76923076923077,4
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints ,control,50.0,4
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug ,control,50.0,3
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and there's a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa ,control,40.0,7
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom ,control,37.5,4
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this ,control,58.333333333333336,4
the little boy is crying ,control,40.0,2
doesn't look like we had much fun at this birthday party because it leaves it right there ,control,44.44444444444444,4
but there she is ,control,50.0,1
everybody's unhappy ,control,66.66666666666666,1
but I'm gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out that was  that the dog chewed on ,control,54.54545454545454,7
and the little boy stopped crying ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and everybody came in and they had a wonderful party ,control,40.0,3
don't you wish real life was like that ,control,55.55555555555556,3
I counted the candles ,control,50.0,2
I cheated ,control,50.0,1
laughs well I have dogs and kids ,control,14.285714285714285,3
we have a little household setting here ,control,28.57142857142857,2
we're in the living room ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and husband and wife ,control,0.0,1
husband's sitting in the chair trying to read his newspaper clearly angry mouth wide open ,control,18.75,4
and what we assume is his wife is standing in front of him pointing at him in a very menacing way ,control,57.14285714285714,6
in the next picture we see husband with paper up  ges,control,41.66666666666667,3
and the wife heading for the door with her coat on and a suitcase ,control,50.0,4
she has had it ,control,75.0,1
looks as though as soon as she goes out the door the door closes husband was sad ,control,41.17647058823529,6
possibly remorseful ,control,0.0,1
thinking of the things he should have said ,control,62.5,4
thinking of the things he should not have said ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and all that kind of stuff ,control,50.0,2
what's he going to do ,control,50.0,2
he doesn't know ,control,50.0,1
it shouldn't have gone this far ,control,57.14285714285714,1
door opens ,control,0.0,1
he looks over his shoulder ,control,60.0,3
it's his wife ,control,75.0,2
she's back ,control,66.66666666666666,1
he can't believe it ,control,60.0,1
she forgave him for whatever it was he did which he doesn't really know it was ,control,76.47058823529412,4
so  they embrace ,control,50.0,1
and they're both very happy ,control,50.0,2
and in the middle of the embrace the husband looks out the open door ,control,50.0,6
and he sees the family car throat,control,28.57142857142857,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
set the scene here ,control,25.0,2
here we have what  what appears to be an emergency ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and how do we know this ,control,66.66666666666666,1
because we have a fire truck on the street and  f that goes by this large tree ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder ,control,27.27272727272727,3
hm ,control,0.0,0
so  we look at the tree ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and we have a dog barking up the tree ,control,44.44444444444444,4
barko barko barko what's he  what is he barking at ,control,58.333333333333336,3
well  there's a little bird up there but I don't  th he's not barking at the bird ,control,36.36363636363637,5
gasps we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree ,control,46.15384615384615,7
well  what ,control,33.33333333333333,0
wait a second ,control,33.33333333333333,2
what is he doing up there ,control,50.0,2
so  we look a_little further and we see a kitty_cat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man ,control,37.5,8
and beneath the kitty_cat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying ,control,44.44444444444444,5
 go kitty jump ,control,0.0,2
 come kitty come down ,control,20.0,2
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder ,control,35.714285714285715,4
now this  this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree ,control,44.44444444444444,5
can't get down ,control,50.0,1
dad went up after the kitty_cat ,control,50.0,3
got stuck up there ,control,25.0,2
the dog is yelping ,control,50.0,2
he's barking ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and someone called the firemen ,control,40.0,2
and then they're coming to rescue first the father and then the kitty_cat ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and it's a happy ending because the little girl gets her kitty cat back ,control,40.0,3
I better pay attention ,control,25.0,1
that is an easy one because it's fairly recent ,control,60.0,3
the the  s the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes ,control,52.38095238095239,5
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and I remember hearing a woman's voice saying ,control,22.22222222222222,4
 oo she's a bleeder ,control,50.0,2
and then I went head,control,20.0,1
and that's the only thing I remember from the recovery room ,control,50.0,5
I reme ,control,50.0,1
is this what you want ,control,80.0,2
memories ,control,0.0,0
okay  and then I remember being ges,control,25.0,0
and uh I remember having a  ges,control,25.0,3
I can't remember what it was exactly because I never knew ,control,58.333333333333336,2
but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it ,control,52.94117647058824,4
and they said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 you could push this button whenever you have a_lot_of pain ,control,45.45454545454545,3
 uh you can't push it  any less than six minutes apart ,control,35.714285714285715,4
 if you try it won't do anything ,control,55.55555555555556,2
 so  you're alright ,control,50.0,2
 don't worry about it ,control,50.0,2
so  whenever I fel felt that I couldn't stand it I would push that button ,control,58.82352941176471,3
then I remember seeing my daughter's face ,control,25.0,4
I remember seeing her and her husband ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and I head,control,33.33333333333333,1
I remember bits and pieces of uh nurses coming and catheters being inserted and ,control,21.428571428571427,5
but again hands,control,0.0,1
I never saw ges,control,25.0,1
just bits of it ,control,50.0,2
and I remember getting out_of bed the first day and being hands,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I remember the second day ges,control,28.57142857142857,3
w I'd had a hip replacement ,control,42.85714285714285,2
around the  the ges,control,60.0,3
and uh ges,control,0.0,1
and uh  each day I remember seeing my daughter and her husband at some time ,control,37.5,4
but not communicating with them or anything ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and when I left my daughter asked me several s questions ,control,36.36363636363637,3
sh being a nurse ,control,50.0,3
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 do you know I remember one day you came twice ,control,36.36363636363637,4
she said ,control,50.0,1
 we came twice every day ,control,33.33333333333333,2
see ,control,0.0,0
so  that's  that shows how much I was out ,control,50.0,0
I remember another thing ,control,50.0,2
sitting  sitting up straight in the hospital watching ges,control,30.0,4
and uh fingers,control,0.0,1
and the nurse came in later and she  s ,control,30.0,2
I could hear her ges,control,60.0,2
she was saying ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 boy she fell asleep sitting up ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I thought ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I'm not asleep ,control,40.0,1
 I'm just imit,control,40.0,2
laughs you_know ,control,0.0,1
and that  that's pretty much it ,control,50.0,2
and I  I remember the  the uh therapy afterwards and  and you_know pain and the  and the medication of the Vicodin ,control,32.0,5
and I remember saying things that didn't make sense ,control,30.0,4
and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to hand,control,52.94117647058824,5
and um I remember asking him ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I had just taken Vicodin ,control,40.0,1
and I remember asking him ,control,40.0,2
 now who are you ,control,60.0,0
and I knew very well who he was ,control,50.0,2
and he would answer very slowly ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I thought ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  he's  ha he's he's   he's trying to you_know ges,control,44.44444444444444,5
and I'd say ,control,50.0,1
 why am I asking these stupid questions laughs ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and I was  wri and I said ,control,37.5,1
 ges,control,0.0,1
I could hear myself saying ,control,60.0,2
 now let me write this down ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and so in due course about three hours later these men showed up ,control,23.07692307692308,4
and I was back fingers,control,40.0,1
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 hi ,control,0.0,0
and they  they had come in ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and we  s we talked a bit ,control,37.5,2
and I had a my ges,control,50.0,2
I was walking around ,control,50.0,1
and finally I said to him ,control,50.0,2
 did your dispatcher say anything to you about the telephone conversation he had with me before he sent you out this morning ,control,69.56521739130434,5
you_know  he said  he said ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 yeah ,control,0.0,0
laughs I said ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 what'd he say ,control,60.0,1
he said ,control,50.0,1
 well  I don't know what you're gonna find when you get to eighteen sixty East Crystal Way ,control,36.36363636363637,7
laughs so  I told him I said ,control,50.0,3
 when you get back please tell him I was on drugs ,control,50.0,3
 tell him I was thoroughly drugged ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 I had just taken a pain pill ,control,37.5,2
 and it was three hours ago ,control,28.57142857142857,3
 and this is the difference between me right after it kicks in ,control,53.84615384615385,3
so  that's what I remember from  from that ,control,63.63636363636363,3
is that any help ,control,75.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
the first uh problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese ,control,40.0,5
so  um it was frustrating ,control,33.33333333333333,2
uh I hadta put children in school ,control,28.57142857142857,2
I hadta take them shopping to get their uniforms ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I hadta take a taxi and tell him where I wanted to go and how to get home and ,control,31.57894736842105,5
so  how did I deal with it ,control,75.0,0
I studied Japanese ,control,33.33333333333333,1
uh every morning five days a week until I got so I could do it ,control,46.66666666666666,4
happened again when I went to Korea ,control,42.85714285714285,3
it happened again when I went to Guatemala ,control,50.0,3
so  and and  and Brazil ,control,14.285714285714285,0
where they did not speak English ,control,50.0,1
uh spoke English in Jamaica and they spoke in English in Malaysia at that time ,control,40.0,4
but uh the only time that I've really had what ges,control,41.66666666666667,3
and I hafta communicate immediately and then study at the same time ,control,25.0,4
and I find I do it by reading body language reading facial expressions ,control,30.76923076923077,6
um and a_lot of this moving hands and  to describe what I want ,control,28.57142857142857,4
and then as  as the language picks up on ges,control,45.45454545454545,2
that's pretty much my experience with that ,control,62.5,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
I was on a boat  a ship I should say ,control,63.63636363636363,3
and the USS President line it was President Wilson ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and we were sailing from I think it was  Los Angeles to Tokyo ,control,50.0,1
and I had my  my husband and my two youngsters were there ,control,38.46153846153847,4
uh they were probably third and fourth grade ,control,25.0,3
and we came in  we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up ,control,55.55555555555556,6
so  uh the captain you_know notified us ,control,37.5,2
 there's a  m m ges,control,25.0,2
well  what happened was ges,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
and our little ship was in the vortex ,control,50.0,3
I was frightened ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I was  uh my children one of them was thrown out_of uh her bunk and you_know ges,control,38.88888888888889,4
and  and I  we strapped them in something ,control,50.0,3
I can't remember exactly because I was miserable ,control,55.55555555555556,2
I was s seasick ,control,75.0,1
and I was on the uh promenade deck ,control,50.0,4
and they had ges,control,25.0,1
so  because the promenade you're sposta be able to see but they had these ges,control,47.05882352941176,0
and I was strapped in a deck chair that was ges,control,54.54545454545454,5
and I was sitting in this chair sick as I could be watching the waves come up over me  gpxraises arms above head ,control,54.16666666666666,4
and then I would hear crashing ges,control,28.57142857142857,2
and one wave would go up real high ,control,25.0,2
the ship would creak ,control,50.0,2
it would go imit,control,50.0,1
I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life ,control,62.5,7
they had um ropes uh for people you_know if you hadta go to the bathroom or something you couldn't walk so you would do this to try and find your way ,control,43.75,5
they had bed spreads ges,control,20.0,2
so  that was it ,control,80.0,0
and you_know we survived ,control,25.0,1
the boat didn't go down but it  uh I don't think it ever sailed again because it was already thirty years old and it was ready to be ,control,38.70967741935484,7
which wasn't very helpful laughs being  being on it ,control,54.54545454545454,4
but we survived ,control,33.33333333333333,1
but I've never been as frightened before or after ,control,40.0,2
also I had two little kids there with me ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  that was scary ,control,60.0,0
bet that's a new one for you laughs ,control,55.55555555555556,5
this one is puzzling to me ,control,66.66666666666666,2
it's clearly a rescue operation ,control,50.0,2
and it clearly is in water because the man who appears to be rescuing the young lady is wearing a buoyancy vest ,control,45.45454545454545,6
what I can't make out is whether  she ,control,70.0,2
ahhah ,control,0.0,0
it looks like she  she got caught in a flood possibly ,control,58.333333333333336,4
and she has grabbed a branch that has stuck out into the raging waters ,control,57.14285714285714,5
that's what it is I bet you ,control,87.5,3
and she's clinging to this branch for dear life ,control,50.0,3
and he is trying to get her and bring her to shore ,control,33.33333333333333,4
did I make it up good laughs ,control,57.14285714285714,3
boy that was tough though ,control,40.0,2
I couldn't figure out what was going on there for a minute ,control,61.53846153846154,4
okay  we have a series of four drawings here ,control,30.0,4
the first one shows a youngster about eight or nine having a wonderful time kicking what looks to be a volleyball ,control,28.57142857142857,6
his aim is good ,control,50.0,2
goes right through the neighbor's window ,control,28.57142857142857,4
we don't know whether it's his window or whether it's a neighbor's window ,control,58.82352941176471,5
but as luck would have it it breaks the window goes through knocks a lamp over probably breaks the lamp ,control,45.0,6
yes it does ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and uh there's a gentleman sitting in the chair right next to the lamp ,control,40.0,6
now we don't know whether this is this boy's father or whether it's a neighbor ,control,55.55555555555556,4
but the gentleman stands up ,control,40.0,2
and he picks up the volleyball ,control,50.0,2
and stands looking out through the hole in his window ,control,50.0,6
and we are looking  we are left trying to decide whether he is going to throw the ball back at the little boy or whether he's going t ,control,43.333333333333336,8
he's not sure exactly what he's gonna do yet ,control,41.66666666666667,5
but he's gonna do something ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but we don't really know ,control,33.33333333333333,1
the title of this little scenario is Mother Knows Best ,control,40.0,4
in the first picture we have little boy setting  setting off for school ,control,35.714285714285715,4
he's ready to go and mom pulls out an umbrella ,control,36.36363636363637,3
 nah I don't want an umbrella ,control,37.5,2
 I don't need an umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
she says ,control,50.0,1
 alright ,control,0.0,0
so  she keeps the umbrella and he heads off ,control,50.0,2
 it's not raining ,control,40.0,1
he says goodbye xxx ,control,25.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
he starts off to school ,control,60.0,3
and little drip drip drip starts ,control,0.0,2
just a little bit of rain ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and then it's more than a drip drip ,control,44.44444444444444,4
we have a little downpour ,control,40.0,2
so  hm,control,33.33333333333333,0
so  puts his hands over his head turns around races back home ,control,38.46153846153847,5
there he is with his mom ,control,66.66666666666666,3
she's looking down with that I told you so look that mothers have ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and he's standing there soaking wet ,control,28.57142857142857,2
next picture he's smiling going back to school and he has his umbrella ,control,35.714285714285715,4
once upon a time a long time ago there was a clears_throat beautiful little girl whose mother died ,control,33.33333333333333,4
so  her father married giving her a stepmother ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the new stepmother had two daughters ,control,14.285714285714285,2
well  the two daughters were not anywhere near as fair as Cinderella ,control,23.07692307692308,3
and the stepmom did not treat Cinderella very well ,control,22.22222222222222,2
she did not treat her like she did her own daughters ,control,54.54545454545454,3
she made her do all the laundry ,control,57.14285714285714,3
she made them do all the housework ,control,57.14285714285714,3
she made  she made her wait on her stepsisters with her xxx ,control,53.84615384615385,5
and it looks to me like she slept out in the barn with the horses ,control,66.66666666666666,4
but she liked horses and she liked the dogs and she liked all the animals ,control,40.0,3
so  they liked her so she didn't care ,control,50.0,2
well  one day she was looking out the window at the castle ,control,46.15384615384615,3
she could see ges,control,50.0,1
and word came that the king was very angry with his son prince because he was not in any hurry to get married  to take a queen ,control,42.85714285714285,6
so  the king says ,control,40.0,2
 alright enough of your fooling around ,control,42.85714285714285,0
he sent out an ,control,75.0,1
well  it wasn't an edict it was more of a letter ,control,53.84615384615385,5
 to everyone in the kingdom saying that there would be a ball ,control,69.23076923076923,6
and his son would meet all of the eligible young ladies in the kingdom ,control,50.0,6
and there would be a way that one would be chosen from this ball ,control,71.42857142857143,5
gasps Cinderella thought ,control,0.0,1
 wouldn't that be wonderful ,control,50.0,1
 wouldn't that be wonderful ,control,50.0,1
so  she ges,control,50.0,1
and she made a beautiful  well very beautiful dress ,control,20.0,3
wasn't fancy really but she was such a  such a pretty girl it looked beautiful on her ,control,52.63157894736842,1
so  she thought she could go to the ball because she was certainly one of the members of the of the kingdom ,control,65.21739130434783,10
two stepsisters came in ,control,25.0,2
 no way are you going bitch ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  they ripped off her gold necklace ges,control,44.44444444444444,3
 go back into the scullery ,control,33.33333333333333,4
so  she went back into the scullery ,control,50.0,4
and there sitting on a big trunk was someone who looked very much like a fairy godmother ,control,41.17647058823529,5
she had a ges,control,50.0,2
she took the story and she says ,control,42.85714285714285,2

she didn't really know it was but she was all ready to go ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she got into the carriage ,control,50.0,3
and she had gorgeous horses ,control,20.0,2
and the mice were now footmen ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they ges,control,33.33333333333333,1
when they helped her down ges,control,66.66666666666666,1
the prince took one look at her and he thought ,control,40.0,3
 who are points these dogs ,control,50.0,0
he didn't say that ,control,60.0,1
he  he thought it ,control,60.0,2
so  he's dancing with her ges,control,62.5,3
and they're dancing around the ballroom ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and then comes time for her pumpkin to  her pumpkin and her mice to reappear ,control,31.25,6
it's midnight ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and she was told finger,control,40.0,1

she sees the clock ,control,50.0,2
she races out_of the ballroom ,control,40.0,3
and the prince says ,control,25.0,2
 where are you going ,control,60.0,1
he starts following her ,control,50.0,2
and she races down the stairs and jumps in the  into her coach and they race home ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and then there she is in her regular clothes sitting on a pumpkin ges,control,42.85714285714285,6
but as she was running down the stairs she lost one of her glass slippers ,control,53.333333333333336,8
gasps the prince saw it ,control,40.0,2
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 this is the slipper from the most beautiful woman in the kingdom and I am going to find her ,control,50.0,5
and so that began  the search ,control,28.57142857142857,2
they went to every house in the kingdom ,control,62.5,5
every young woman in the kingdom ,control,50.0,3
and noone could fit their big fat foot into that pretty little glass slipper ,control,28.57142857142857,4
went to Cinderella's home where Cinderella was nowhere to be seen ,control,33.33333333333333,5
two ugly stepsisters they tried to push it and they shove it ,control,33.33333333333333,3
they could head,control,66.66666666666666,1
and so the question was ,control,40.0,2

 no  no  no  no  no ,control,40.0,0
well  finally head,control,0.0,1
