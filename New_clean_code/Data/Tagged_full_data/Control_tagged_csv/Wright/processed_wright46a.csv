a very large party has been planned ,control,42.85714285714285,3
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and good friends were invited over ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well   somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after  of the cake after climbing up onto the table ,control,44.44444444444444,6
mom sees this and is very very upset ,control,25.0,3
very frustrated ,control,0.0,1
and grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch ,control,40.0,4
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy ,control,57.89473684210527,6
to see this cake having much much less than it's sposta have laughs ,control,35.714285714285715,5
first you hands,control,33.33333333333333,1
lightly toast them ,control,33.33333333333333,1
bring the peanut butter and jelly to the table ges,control,30.0,4
apply jelly to one side ges,control,16.666666666666664,3
and peanut butter ges,control,0.0,2
and then bringing them together so_that the jelly and the peanut butter meet ,control,23.07692307692308,5
put them together hands,control,25.0,1
and eat it laughs ,control,25.0,2
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the p_x ,control,46.66666666666666,4
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck  was kept up ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time ,control,28.57142857142857,5
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible ,control,33.33333333333333,8
but  this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck ,control,50.0,6
and as I left  laughs by kicking my left leg up and over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed of the truck ,control,50.0,13
I was lightly tupped ,control,50.0,2
because I had only been moved about a  an inch and a half ,control,57.14285714285714,4
sighs if I had had this awareness it would've been much easier for me to push away uh from the truck and sustain less injury than I had ,control,48.27586206896552,5
as that my left leg was kicked up and about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries I've ever u had ,control,52.77777777777778,8
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest ,control,54.54545454545454,4
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate ,control,47.61904761904761,5
then falling down further the back of the bed ,control,44.44444444444444,4
then the bumper ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and  in my attention anyhow almost laughs eons later sighs after I had thought that the last of the contusions were  sighs occurring the same spot sighs on the under side of my left calf hit the  uh the  gar the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle ,control,38.46153846153847,8
the bed of the  v of the vehicle itself just hand,control,50.0,6
and coming down underneath ges,control,40.0,2
well  this hit in the same spot one two three four ,control,25.0,0
and uh I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries ,control,42.10526315789473,6
fr at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle ,control,41.17647058823529,4
and their uh discretion chose to take me to the hospital ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and they're my drill sergeants so I let them do that um instead of saying it's just a sprained ankle ,control,50.0,5
and finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop ,control,30.76923076923077,3
well  t I immediately went into shock ,control,25.0,2
and being in basic training uh there is much suggestion to do as one is told ,control,37.5,5
and a myriad  f uh manner of forms laughs directly and indirectly ,control,15.384615384615383,3
so  uh my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and uh uh damage that I had just gone through ,control,38.70967741935484,8
sighs I actually hadta walk the next morning to uh the clinic on a very very swollen calf ,control,33.33333333333333,7
so  swollen in_fact that I was unable to take the b_d_u's which are the uh battle dress uniform ,control,35.0,8
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants uh from being able to be lifted up ges,control,45.45454545454545,6
my calf was so swollen ,control,40.0,2
uh unfortunately that was the major holiday of that um laughs uh whole fort ,control,35.714285714285715,3
combination of its anniversary and Fourth_of_July ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  the crew at the clinic on that Saturday ,control,60.0,0
which then being a Saturday busses never ran uh so I hadta walk about two and a half miles on that condition ,control,31.818181818181817,6
did a very cursory and um less than effective look at my injury ,control,30.76923076923077,4
and described me as uh rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches ,control,27.77777777777778,7
the next  and without  and ges,control,25.0,0
the next day uh because it was a holiday and uh through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given k_p duty ,control,50.0,6
and uh the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing k_p because everyone else had been working ,control,53.125,7
uh and I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself ,control,45.45454545454545,3
I was in shock continually this entire time ,control,50.0,2
so  I never volunteered for any of the k_p duties ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and uh sprained almost knee ,control,35.714285714285715,6
well  regardless to say as I got back on Monday the uh staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physician's assistant ,control,25.925925925925924,0
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and uh started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms ,control,31.818181818181817,7
and uh pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies ,control,25.0,5
and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic ,control,41.66666666666667,3
yes head,control,0.0,1
actually  I,control,33.33333333333333,0
for the last uh year I've been a life coach for a developmentally disabled man where I live ,control,52.63157894736842,5
and his developmental disablement has come about because of uh a actual large set of circumstance ,control,37.5,4
um traumatic uh psychological and physiological experiences have pretty much left him with the mental state  a mental emotional state of a very high strung five year old ,control,24.13793103448276,7
and uh various communication  miscues ,control,0.0,2
and the lack of my um focus to make sure ges,control,27.27272727272727,3
and to  uh to better his activities has created a  a very large ges,control,31.25,4
and uh at this moment I have hadta disconnect from being a life coach for this individual ,control,47.05882352941176,6
in the past reiterations and nonreactive acceptance of whatever form of communication this individual has relayed ,control,43.75,7
and then full discourse a about the perspectives and the  the missing pieces of the  uh the sides of the total experiences happening ,control,40.0,8
repeatedly and calmly uh delivered to this gentleman has helped ,control,30.0,4
though current situations and my own revealing of larger circumstance has led me to necessitively ,control,40.0,5
yes heads,control,0.0,1
sighs the only  only thing that's coming up to my mind right now was a trip to Hoover_Dam when I was young ,control,50.0,5
and I had uh at that time my  sist my youngest sister ,control,38.46153846153847,4
she was about four and a half ,control,42.85714285714285,3
well there was this  uh this very  lar we went on a tour in Hoover_Dam ,control,41.17647058823529,5
and  and saw all  all the insides ges,control,30.0,3

when the water gets too high ges,control,28.57142857142857,3
I got an immediate uh sensation of fear ,control,37.5,3
prolly ,control,0.0,0
um and I immediately saw my sister ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I just felt horrible of  about potential of her being drug down ges,control,46.66666666666666,5
and then spit out the side ,control,33.33333333333333,2
because this thing  this thing is about a  a good hundred yards wide and very very very deep ,control,35.0,6
and it j just gave me this ominous sense of  of lack and  and grief ,control,29.411764705882355,6

and held on for dear life ,control,33.33333333333333,3

and one man with a lifejacket and silver harnesses was dropped  from a helicopter  into the flood reaching the girl ,control,36.36363636363637,5
 m but then helped her to put the harness on ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and be brought back away from the flood itself  to safety INV,control,30.76923076923077,4
