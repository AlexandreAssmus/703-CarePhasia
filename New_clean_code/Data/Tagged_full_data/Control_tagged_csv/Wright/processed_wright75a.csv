the cat's stuck in the tree ,control,42.85714285714285,3
the dad tried to get the cat out_of the tree ,control,40.0,4
but he  h doesn't look like he was successful ,control,45.45454545454545,0
and his ladder fell down ,control,40.0,2
and the little girl's standing under the cat crying ,control,30.0,4
and the dog's barking at the man up the tree ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and the firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um and there's also a bird in the tree ,control,40.0,4
well  you take two slices of bread ,control,25.0,3
and you put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other one ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and you put them together ,control,40.0,1
and that makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,22.22222222222222,3
well  not on camera but I've already told you that five years ago I had cancer ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I had surgery ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I had radiation ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I had chemotherapy which lasted well into three months ,control,33.33333333333333,5
uh all my hair fell out ,control,50.0,2
it grew back in ,control,50.0,1
my eyelashes didn't ,control,25.0,2
but head,control,0.0,1
uh w actually my eyelashes came back ,control,28.57142857142857,2
shows,control,0.0,0
uh  I lost thirty pounds ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and that was not from being sick ,control,57.14285714285714,3
uh because I was head,control,60.0,2
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo ,control,50.0,5
I  I lost it because something in the chemotherapy  gave ges me a very bad taste in my mouth ,control,57.14285714285714,6
it tasted like I was chewing on pennies ,control,62.5,3
you ges ever p when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth and felt that ges taste ,control,45.0,5
that's what everything tasted like to me no matter what it was ,control,76.92307692307693,4
and so food just didn't really have much of an appeal ,control,25.0,4
but I'm diabetic so I hadta eat ,control,37.5,2
but I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check ,control,27.27272727272727,3
so  I lost thirty pounds which was not b a bad thing ,control,46.15384615384615,4
I wish I coulda kept it off ,control,57.14285714285714,3
unfortunately as I  once we got the  the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation ,control,47.61904761904761,0
uh it took about two and a half years ,control,22.22222222222222,4
but I gained all the weight back ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and uh I go in  two weeks back to my oncologist for my five year checkup ,control,35.294117647058826,4
and at that time if all sims ,control,57.14285714285714,3
so  that's  that's head,control,50.0,3
uh yes head,control,0.0,1
um well  let's see ,control,16.666666666666664,2
um when it came to  m to me probably the most frightening thing I ever had was when somebody w uh somebody p a Peeping_Tom was standing at my window ,control,51.61290322580645,4
and I just happened to look up and stared him right in the eye ,control,35.714285714285715,5
scared me to death ,control,50.0,2
but on a even deeper level the thing that scared me the most I think ,control,46.66666666666666,5
I lived in Japan ,control,50.0,2
and my daughters were one and two ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I had them  my husband was in the field and I had them both in high chairs ,control,47.368421052631575,4
and I was making hot chocolate for them ,control,50.0,2
and it was the kind where you put ges,control,55.55555555555556,3
and then you pour the hot water ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 y and my oldest girl was not in a high chair ,control,33.33333333333333,3
she was at the table ,control,80.0,3
and uh I had the powder in both k in the cups ,control,50.0,4
and I went ges,control,25.0,1
and as I did she was so anxious she decided to get up at the table as ges,control,50.0,6
and her fingers hit the  cu ges,control,25.0,2
and flipped the cup ges,control,20.0,3
and scared me to death ,control,40.0,2
what scared me was she didn't cry ,control,62.5,2
uh she  fortun it was winter and she had ges,control,36.36363636363637,0
and uh I hurried up and got that off of her ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and  got in my car ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and you couldn't call nineoneone then ,control,28.57142857142857,1
it's  this is fifty years ago ,control,50.0,4
uh so  I got in my car to take her to the dispensary which was a good ways away ,control,45.0,6
and uh I had my neighbor  I gave the baby hands,control,33.33333333333333,4
and ges,control,0.0,1
and started points to the  dis the dispensary ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and uh as I went through the hand,control,50.0,3
and honked the horn like crazy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he came over ,control,50.0,1
and I told him what had happened ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 move over ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and he got hand,control,25.0,1
and the guy points in the jeep  in the MP jeep led the way points with his siren on ,control,45.0,5
the other MP drove my car ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and we went over to the base  to the  the  to the dispensary ,control,56.25,4
and they took her ges right in ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and while I was sitting there she shrugs passed out I thought ,control,50.0,2
and the doctor said to me ,control,50.0,2
 talk to her ,control,50.0,2
 keep talking to her ,control,40.0,3
and so I kept talking ,control,20.0,1
 Marianne  it's Mommy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 Marianne  talk to me  Marianne ,control,25.0,0
and I'd watch eyelashes,control,40.0,1
head,control,0.0,0
the next day he told me that her heart has had ges stopped ,control,46.15384615384615,3
that she had gone into shock ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and that it was only ges,control,50.0,1
but it scared me ,control,50.0,1
s I_mean I wasn't even aware of how bad it was ,control,50.0,1
he didn't wanna tell me ,control,50.0,2
I said to him the next day when I took her back to him ,control,64.28571428571429,5
I said ,control,50.0,1
 why didn't you tell me what was happening ,control,60.0,2
he said ,control,50.0,1
 because I didn't need two patients ,control,37.5,0
 I only needed one ,control,20.0,1
 uh and you were the only one ,control,37.5,2
 it was  ye your points voice was the only thing that was gonna bring her back ,control,42.10526315789473,5
so  that's probably head,control,33.33333333333333,0
 yes ,control,0.0,0
I worked as a speech therapist I told you this uh in  El Paso Texas at the  cerebral palsy clinic there ,control,39.130434782608695,6
uh and a_lot of the people that I worked with had ,control,45.45454545454545,7
they were children for the most part ,control,57.14285714285714,4
uh and I loved working with kids ,control,28.57142857142857,3
so  that was  it was fun for me ,control,70.0,3
but they had ges all different kinds of problems ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 uh  some of them were ah ,control,50.0,3
we didn't know at the time ,control,57.14285714285714,3
the diagnosis wasn't thrown around like it is now because this was fifty years ago ,control,56.25,5
and uh uh d uh some of them were autistic ,control,40.0,3
the one little girl had had spinal meningitis ,control,25.0,2
and had  was now blind ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and had a hard time hearing ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and couldn't  head,control,20.0,0
she was nine ,control,66.66666666666666,1
but  she  they ges hadta start all over with her like she was a baby  to teach her hand,control,40.909090909090914,5
and they said eventually she was gonna be okay ,control,40.0,3
and I only worked with her for a year or so ,control,45.45454545454545,4
I don't know but I did speech therapy with her ,control,45.45454545454545,1
uh th the one patient that they sent me to see uh ,control,41.66666666666667,5
I_mean I had no business doing any of this ,control,55.55555555555556,5
I had no background ,control,50.0,2
uh but they head,control,25.0,1
and uh the one patient was a woman who had had a stroke ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and had aphasia ,control,0.0,1
and ges,control,0.0,1
and she was talking about her cake ,control,57.14285714285714,3
but ges,control,0.0,1
and uh I don't think I accomplished a thing with her ,control,50.0,3
I  I really don't ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um but that was before they placed so much value on early work with stroke people ,control,37.5,4
and I head,control,33.33333333333333,1
um  other_than that uh I had  uh a daughter ,control,27.27272727272727,0
I have a daughter who is  has a genetic  she's missing part of a chromosome ,control,50.0,6
and didn't talk at all til she was about two and a half ,control,28.57142857142857,2
never head,control,0.0,1
and then started off very slowly ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and now n I can't shut her up ,control,44.44444444444444,2
uh she's fifty  five ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and has the mental ,control,25.0,2
well  it's uh ,control,40.0,1
she would test probably at about ten years old ,control,33.33333333333333,5
she reads ,control,50.0,1
uh she's a sports fanatic ,control,50.0,3
but it  it was a long time coming and working with her trying ges,control,40.0,0
uh  to express herself in any way really  was difficult ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh other_than that  I don't think so ,control,33.33333333333333,2
it's a picture of two people stuck in a flood ,control,54.54545454545454,5
 and he's hanging on for dear life to a ,control,54.54545454545454,0
 a tree limb ,control,25.0,1
but he also seems to be wearing a lifevest ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  maybe he  is a paramedic or fireman or something ,control,41.66666666666667,3
I see nothing like that on her ,control,85.71428571428571,3
so  I guess he's in there to rescue her ,control,45.45454545454545,3
uh  yeah  I think that's about all I can tell you ,control,57.14285714285714,5
I wouldn't wanna be either one of them thank_you ,control,60.0,4
 hm ,control,0.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
the little boy is kicking a soccer ball around ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and it goes through somebody's window ,control,42.85714285714285,4
into a room where it knocks a lamp down ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and there's a man sitting ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he gets up and looks out  takes the ball and looks out the window ,control,37.5,5
I don't really see there's an end to that story ,control,50.0,5
he winds up with the ball ,control,66.66666666666666,3
but I'm sure it didn't end there ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 that's about the best I can tell you on that one ,control,61.53846153846154,4
mkay ,control,0.0,0
 okay ,control,0.0,0
little boy's going out the door with his backpack ,control,50.0,3
apparently he's going to school or something ,control,50.0,2
and mother wants him to take an umbrella ,control,25.0,3
and he tells her ,control,50.0,1
 uh hand,control,0.0,1
 it's not gonna rain ,control,28.57142857142857,2
he doesn't want an umbrella ,control,50.0,2
and he goes out ,control,25.0,1
and pretty soon it's raining ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he goes running home through the puddles with his hands trying to keep the water off his head ,control,42.10526315789473,6
and she's standing there waiting for him because she knew he'd be back  or drown one or the other ,control,45.45454545454545,6
and he goes off again with an umbrella ,control,50.0,3
a man has a daughter ,control,40.0,2
and apparently is a widower ,control,40.0,2
and marries a woman who has two daughters ,control,25.0,4
and  but he must travel ges a_lot because he's never around in the rest of the story ,control,47.368421052631575,0
um n n the stepmother doesn't like the  the stepdaughter ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and turns her into a maid for her two daughters and for herself ,control,53.84615384615385,5
and she's the one that hasta clean and wait on them ,control,50.0,5
and  and uh  she's uh very good with the anima,control,30.76923076923077,4
and  and they're her friends because she really has no other friends ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and the  meanwhile at the castle the king decides he's going to throw a ball for the prince because the prince should get married ,control,50.0,5
and he's not showing any signs of being interested in anybody ,control,58.333333333333336,6
so  they put out the word that there's gonna be a ball ,control,53.333333333333336,5
and they send out invitations ,control,40.0,1
and the stepmother gets the invitation and sets to making ready her two daughters ,control,28.57142857142857,4
and Cinderella uh who uh they don't even consider as part of the family wh goes into the trunks of things that pro probably shrugs were her mother's ,control,40.0,9
and makes herself a dress ,control,40.0,2
which they totally destroy and tell her she's going nowhere ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and  and she cries ,control,20.0,0
and she's all upset ,control,40.0,1
and her fairy godmother comes ,control,20.0,2
and dresses her in this beautiful ges dress ,control,37.5,3
and turns her mice into footmen ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and her horses into the ges horses for this beautiful carriage ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and sends her off to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
but tells her that she hasta be home before midnight ,control,40.0,3
so  she goes to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and of_course the prince falls in love at first sight ,control,30.0,3
and she's all he's interested in ,control,75.0,4
while stepmama and stepdaughters are  just don't know what to do with themselves ,control,40.0,3
and at five to twelve all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes she better get home ,control,16.666666666666664,4
so  she goes tearing out ,control,50.0,2
and as she runs away loses one of her sl glass slippers ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and goes home and everything ges,control,16.666666666666664,2
the coach the everything the beautiful dress ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and all she has left is the other glass slipper ,control,50.0,3
so  the prince is beside himself ,control,71.42857142857143,2
he decides he hasta find her ,control,50.0,3
so  he sends this  w one of his people out to find her with the slipper ,control,55.55555555555556,5
and they  everybody in the ges realm hasta try this slipper on ,control,46.15384615384615,0
and of_course it doesn't fit anybody because obvious  she  sh she had very tiny feet ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and finally they find her ,control,40.0,1
she tries the slipper on ,control,60.0,2
and the prince  marries her ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they live happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
