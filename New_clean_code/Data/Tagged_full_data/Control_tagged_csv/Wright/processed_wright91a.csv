first of all I pull out the bread ,control,62.5,3
then I hafta go in the cupboard and get the peanut butter,control,33.33333333333333,3
and we keep our jelly in the refrigerator ,control,50.0,3
so  I hafta open up the refrigerator pull out the  jelly ,control,46.15384615384615,4
spread the peanut butter onto the one slice of the bread ,control,45.45454545454545,5
uh actually I like a_lot_of peanut butter ,control,14.285714285714285,2
so  I usually would put it on both slices of the bread ,control,61.53846153846154,5
and then just put the jelly in the center of it ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and close it up ,control,50.0,1
put the bread away into the cupboard ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and put the other items away of_course ,control,14.285714285714285,2

the uh family pet  the girl's pet which is a cat got stuck up in a tree ,control,47.368421052631575,4
the father tells his uh daughter that he will get the cat down out of the tree ,control,58.82352941176471,5
climbs up into the tree ,control,60.0,3
and uh the  loses the ladder that he got up into the tree ,control,50.0,5
so  now the cat and the father are both stuck up in the tree ,control,53.333333333333336,5
the dog is of_course barking and barking ,control,28.57142857142857,2
but uh that's just to laughs see what's going on ,control,41.66666666666667,3
because the dog probably is the one that chased the cat up in the tree to begin with ,control,55.55555555555556,6
and then uh somebody called the fire department of_course to get everybody out_of the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I got  uh I  head,control,28.57142857142857,3
I have a back problem ,control,40.0,2
I guess that's my worst problem right now ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and um I uh have pains points,control,14.285714285714285,2
and I have uh appointment with the uh neurosurgeon in March to see what it's all about ,control,44.44444444444444,4
but they think what it is it's a pinched nerve points,control,58.333333333333336,3
I have hand,control,33.33333333333333,1
and uh I have bone spurs and things like that up there ,control,25.0,4
so  I'm sure they probably are gonna be doing a surgery of some sort ,control,52.94117647058824,7
because I  right now I hafta take pain pills to get to sleep at night ,control,31.25,3
that's my only problem ,control,60.0,2
it doesn't bother me too much in the day time ,control,45.45454545454545,3
because it's not that great of pain ,control,50.0,3
I can  I can uh deal with it ,control,66.66666666666666,2
just at night I can't ges,control,42.85714285714285,2
because it hurts too much ,control,40.0,2
uh the pain does ,control,25.0,2
so  I hafta take a pain pill right now at night ,control,33.33333333333333,2
which I don't like to do ,control,42.85714285714285,2
because I don't really like to take uh any kind of pills ,control,38.46153846153847,4
the only any kind of pills I take at all are for high cholesterol ,control,50.0,4
but  uh so  I don't like that at all ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but um I do take those at night ,control,50.0,2
so  I can least sleep halfway decent ,control,37.5,2
and  uh but that's about all ,control,37.5,2
I don't really  I been  ges,control,44.44444444444444,0
 I've been  uh been fortunate basically uh throughout my life ,control,46.15384615384615,3
uh I never smoked and  and um only really drink at like Christmas and special occasions  and stuff like that ,control,22.727272727272727,6
so  I didn't drink a_lot ,control,42.85714285714285,1
the reason I don't do that is because my mother died from drinking ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and uh my father was German ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  he drank a_lot ,control,40.0,1
so  maybe that's why I don't drink ,control,60.0,2
but uh uh uh so I been living a healthy life ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and um you_know I just head,control,16.666666666666664,1

and um so we decided to go and eat at Ihop ,control,18.181818181818183,4
we went over there ,control,25.0,2
and  and uh oh it was about  it wasn't too late ,control,35.714285714285715,3
it was about four thirty in the afternoon ,control,50.0,4
lips_smack uh I have a thing where I don't eat anything  anything with sugar in it uh like snacks or anything after six or seven o'clock ,control,46.42857142857143,10
because I found out for whatever reason I wake up in the next morning with a headache if I  if I have sugars in the evening ,control,62.96296296296296,7
but anyways we had  I  uh we ha both had a cup of cocoa ,control,37.5,3
and then I just had a hamburger ,control,28.57142857142857,2
so  can't believe it was the hamburger ,control,55.55555555555556,3
so  we figured it was the cocoa ,control,62.5,3
but anyways uh came back ,control,0.0,1
lips_smack and I started feeling queasy in my stomach ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and  and um uh I just  just was like  I was  it  wa I was like having anxiety attack ,control,37.5,3
my whole uh stomach was going all over the place ,control,40.0,3
and we usually go to bed around ten o'clock ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  I went to bed ,control,50.0,2
uh Donna stayed up uh read a book for awhile ,control,30.0,3
and I head,control,33.33333333333333,1
I couldn't ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I had  all_of_a_sudden I was sweating like a stuffed pig ,control,45.45454545454545,5
um  didn't seem like my heart was racing ,control,40.0,3
so  and don't think it was any kind of um an attack of any kind ,control,52.94117647058824,0
uh but I was sweating ,control,40.0,1
then all_of_a_sudden I pulled all the covers off ,control,50.0,2
and then I was cold ,control,40.0,1
and  and uh so I got up ,control,25.0,0
an,control,100.0,0
and uh w about one o'clock laughs in the morning finally finally uh went back to bed ,control,23.52941176470588,5
but in the meantime I was just head,control,50.0,3
and I was sick to my stomach ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and it was just a  head,control,42.85714285714285,2
but if I ever had one I think that would've been it ,control,61.53846153846154,2
uh and head,control,0.0,1
and of_course I went to sleep ,control,16.666666666666664,2
but I was scared ,control,50.0,1
because I was  uh I didn't think it was a heart attack or  I was having ,control,52.63157894736842,3
uh I just you_know  we just come to the conclusion it was just too much sugar or whatever it was  ,control,40.909090909090914,6
but it was so early in the evening ,control,50.0,4
we couldn't figure,control,50.0,1
but  I just couldn't figure out what else it was at ,control,53.84615384615385,4
but head,control,0.0,1
I just kept going over in my mind ,control,50.0,4
 oh  what  what if something happens ,control,44.44444444444444,0
or  whate I  maybe that was it ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and then I just  you_know I just  uh uh just uneasy ,control,15.384615384615383,0
 and uh it was bad ,control,33.33333333333333,0
it was bad ,control,66.66666666666666,1
but anyways  that was it ,control,66.66666666666666,2
um have you ever had any experience with people who have had a difficult time communicating ,control,43.75,6
 like talking ,control,33.33333333333333,0
you mean communicating ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 well uh only  only the experience of  of ,control,27.27272727272727,0
a friend of Donna's is  um um uh she's,control,41.66666666666667,5
and um so this was awhile ago when we first got here ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and so she made friends with her ,control,42.85714285714285,2
her name is uh Janine ,control,40.0,2
and she made friends with her ,control,50.0,2
and so she learned to do sign language ,control,25.0,2
be  so  she could communicate with her ,control,66.66666666666666,3
but I  of_course I don't ,control,28.57142857142857,1
it's too deep for me to learn ,control,50.0,2
so  I didn't learn it ,control,57.14285714285714,1
but anyway she did ,control,25.0,1
so  she can communicate ,control,60.0,1
but I would  um I went over there quite a bit to their house and everything ,control,47.05882352941176,0
and it was an experience because you hafta ,control,62.5,2
uh she could read lips as long as you talk ges directly to her ,control,42.85714285714285,4
lips_smack and so I went over there a_lot_of times because if she had problems with her uh uh computer I would help her out ,control,41.66666666666667,6
because I know quite a bit about computers ,control,62.5,3
and then uh if uh she had any problems ,control,33.33333333333333,2
like she had problems with her telephone company one time ,control,30.0,4
so   I called the telephone company for her ,control,44.44444444444444,2
because it's so hard for her to communicate with anybody ,control,63.63636363636363,3
because she hasta go through that TDY thing that you_know that  you have on the telephones ,control,52.94117647058824,5
but um that was quite an experience ,control,57.14285714285714,2
because uh you  you just  it's just not a normal thing ,control,42.85714285714285,3
because you hafta ges for sure ,control,50.0,2
you_know  you're so useta just taking to people ,control,30.0,4
 and you hafta get in the situation where you're always talking points in front of her ,control,50.0,7
 uh and this type of thing ,control,28.57142857142857,0
but it  it was a good experience ,control,50.0,0
and um I really enjoyed it ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and um you_know uh I guess got a_lot out_of it ,control,30.0,2
because you  you're so thankful then of uh head,control,45.45454545454545,3
and  and you don't  have things like that and everything else ,control,35.714285714285715,3
but uh anyways that was that ,control,50.0,1
looks to me like a couple uh go are  are uh tied up in a flood  rapids ,control,47.368421052631575,5
and uh they're washing them down stream probably ,control,44.44444444444444,1
he  they finally hung up on a tree ,control,55.55555555555556,0
and um he's got a belt around um ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I guess it must have came off of her because he's still got his belt on ,control,70.58823529411765,4
anyways  it uh looks like they  they got a belt tied around um  something ,control,47.05882352941176,4
and uh looks like uh hopefully they're looking up ,control,40.0,2
because uh hopefully the  uh uh the rescue people are in helicopter above them ,control,46.66666666666666,2
and are about to lower a line down ,control,25.0,4
and rescue these two people who are tied up in this situation ,control,50.0,5
this little boy's out uh playing with his uh soccer ball ,control,25.0,3
lips_smack and uh he kicks it  up in the air ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and lord behold it goes throu,control,16.666666666666664,2
um don't know laughs ,control,20.0,1
hopefully it's his parents window ,control,50.0,2
which would be a_lot better even_though it uh went through a window ,control,58.333333333333336,2
but anyways it goes through the window ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and  and lands in the living room where this uh man is sitting ,control,35.714285714285715,0
uh knocks over a lamp ,control,40.0,3
lips_smack uh the man gets up ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and looks out the window to see uh who threw the ball of_course ,control,30.76923076923077,4
um and uh hopefully he doesn't get too mad at the little boy that  kicked the ball through the window ,control,36.36363636363637,7
his mother  uh the little boy is gonna go  be going to school ,control,25.0,4
and the mother wants the boy to take an umbrella along ,control,36.36363636363637,3
because it's sposta be raining that day ,control,62.5,2
but of_course um most of the time the kids think they know it all ,control,42.85714285714285,7
and he says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 no  Mom ,control,25.0,0
 I don't wanna take the umbrella ,control,37.5,3
 I'm alright ,control,50.0,1
sure enough on the way  to school it starts raining ,control,27.27272727272727,5
he hasta run back home ,control,20.0,2
of_course  by the time he gets home he,control,44.44444444444444,0
uh the mother is very  very angry at him of_course ,control,36.36363636363637,4
because he didn't  take the umbrella ,control,50.0,0
but all in all in the end the boy is happy now ,control,33.33333333333333,4
because he has the umbrella ,control,60.0,2
and he's dry again ,control,40.0,1
and it looks like with a,control,66.66666666666666,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
sil Cinderella was brought into the uh family as a stepchild ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and uh there were two other sisters in the  in the family ,control,38.46153846153847,6
and of_course they did not  uh k along with the mother did not like Cinderella ,control,37.5,5
they used her as basically a maid lips_smack to do all the chores and  and all the uh cleaning and everything else around the house ,control,42.30769230769231,5
in the meantime Cinderella  made friends with the animal,control,40.0,3
because uh um they wanted to make her happy ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh an invitation came to the family for the  the sisters to go,control,42.85714285714285,4
and uh they of_course had their dresses ma,control,25.0,2
and  and uh lips_smack they went to the ball in hopes of meeting the prince ,control,37.5,6

in the meantime Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and uh her dress was made um by uh mice ,control,30.0,2
and  and the animals basically made her dress ,control,22.22222222222222,2

no  no  no  no  no  no  she had her dress made ,control,47.05882352941176,0
lips_smack and uh when their mother saw her dress it was more beautiful than her sisters' was ,control,44.44444444444444,6
so  consequently they ripped it apar,control,42.85714285714285,1
um she uh then of_course got very sa,control,12.5,2
the fairy godmother appeared to Cinderella and told her that um uh she would be able to go to the ba,control,42.85714285714285,7
uh she would have her dress for he,control,62.5,3
and um they had a carriage which was of_course a pumpkin ,control,45.45454545454545,4
uh but the only uh thing was that Cinderella would hafta leave by twelve o'clock be  from the ball ,control,40.0,5
uh because if she didn't she would turn back into her normal or her regular self again ,control,44.44444444444444,5
