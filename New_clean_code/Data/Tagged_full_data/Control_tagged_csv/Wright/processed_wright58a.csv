a little girl has taken her  not neccesarily taken but  a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree ,control,45.16129032258064,9
and the  uh apparently a man has brought  has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder ,control,35.0,3
and he's attempted to get the cat down ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and he himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down ,control,50.0,4
a dog may well have accompanied him ,control,57.14285714285714,2
there was a dog there ,control,40.0,2
and the uh fire department has also arrived  with their ladder ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and they are approaching the scene ,control,50.0,2
and they are certainly going to get the cat down and well  along with the man more than likely ,control,35.0,5
shrugs and everything will be just fine ,control,42.85714285714285,2
the first step is to assemble the items you need ,control,40.0,4
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a uh knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread ,control,23.809523809523807,5
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread ,control,41.17647058823529,4
and you would  how I would go about doing it I was  I would put  uh spread jelly on  on one slice of bread ,control,50.0,6
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and I would put the two of them together ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and then shrugs m eat the sandwich ,control,28.57142857142857,2
my recollection I haven't ever been seriously injured but um one of the  uh the typical but more unusual things I've encountered would be chicken pox ,control,37.93103448275862,5
not that that's unusual but for me a seriousness ,control,60.0,3
and I don't recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that ,control,40.909090909090914,2
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience ,control,50.0,3
not excruciating pain but  but quite a bit of unc discomforts ,control,25.0,4
 and the applica application of calamine lotion  to uh ease uh the sores  the itchiness  of the sores ,control,27.27272727272727,0
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didn't obey mother's advice fully of not picking at the scabs ,control,44.0,6
so  that's my recollection of chicken pox ,control,44.44444444444444,4
the person who I've had the most difficulty communicating with was my father ,control,57.14285714285714,5
and I  in part due to he suffered from a  some type of ataxia ,control,56.25,5
and  and he was  well I was  I was born when he was in his forties so I_mean he was  by the time I was  he was quite elderly by the time  not quite elderly but up there in years  by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so ,control,45.614035087719294,6
but he  uh  in part I  he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of his failing  his failing ability to walk adequately and uh ,control,35.483870967741936,3
but he was very   very  um  little bit short tempered I'd say ,control,25.0,3
 and just wanting  he badly wanted to do things himself ,control,16.666666666666664,2
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind of thing ,control,36.36363636363637,4
but he couldn't do it ,control,50.0,1
so  he'd ask for help ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and then you'd try to help ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and he would put his hands in the  in the project ,control,58.333333333333336,3
and it was just more trouble ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and wh when you tried to say you_know ,control,25.0,3
 I hafta do this myself ,control,50.0,1
he would get frustrated ,control,50.0,1
and it was just uh very difficult time trying to communicate  that we both can't do this ,control,36.84210526315789,6
so  and just  just an overall  difficulty ,control,20.0,0
occasionally it would brew into an argument ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and there would be some walking away because it's either you do this or I do this ,control,61.11111111111112,4
and we both can't do this ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and you_know I know you'd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but um ,control,31.818181818181817,4
it's ju you  you just try to remain calm ,control,36.36363636363637,1
and  and just explain the situation as best you can ,control,27.27272727272727,2
and  and try to resolve it ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and of_course there were good days and bad days ,control,11.11111111111111,3
you_know  days where he'd be more tolerant of  of that kind of thing ,control,50.0,9
but  but just a it was more of a communication issue  that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do ,control,37.03703703703704,7
so  even_though he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied wi j th s in a assistance because it was more ,control,45.83333333333333,4
 I wanna be able to do this ,control,37.5,3
so ,control,0.0,0
the  uh not too long ago maybe a couple of years ago ,control,23.07692307692308,0
my girlfriend and I had taken a trip to Flagstaff to go into the lava tubes ,control,43.75,5
there was something there called the lava tubes ,control,37.5,4
it's a  uh it's  na it's near fr Flagstaff ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and it's  it's just an underground  well it was produced by volcanic activity ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and it's a very large crevice in the ground ,control,50.0,4
kind_of a  a tunnel ,control,40.0,2
and um we had gone in it then ,control,50.0,2
I believe it was a Sunday afternoon ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and it was rather late in the day ,control,50.0,3
and by the time the um ,control,50.0,2
and in the center of this  this thing ,control,55.55555555555556,6
it's basically a straight tunnel ,control,50.0,2
 but in the center there is a  um and  somewhat of a  I  re you'd call it a pole ,control,44.0,5
it's not really a pole but it's  it's ,control,58.333333333333336,2
the  um the tunnel splits off in the center  and goes around another chunk of rock ,control,44.44444444444444,0
so you have it  it splits into a wide fork ,control,45.45454545454545,4
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel ,control,30.0,3
well  we didn't look at the map adequately ,control,40.0,3
and we got in there ,control,20.0,2
and  th h and the  the flashlight started to dim ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and we were  tur we had gone all the way to the end ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and we turned around ,control,50.0,1
and we were unaware of this thing in the middle ,control,60.0,4
and happened to be turning around it in circles ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the flashlights were going dim ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and by that time the other people who had visited had left ,control,50.0,3
so  we were in there alone ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and at that point going in circles in the dark or  the dim lights ,control,40.0,5
you're kind_of like you_know how do you get out_of this place ,control,58.333333333333336,3
and it became quite  quite fearful ,control,14.285714285714285,3
not  I wouldn't say terror but the  the uh belief that maybe we'll be spending the night in here ,control,43.47826086956522,0
and obviously it's you_know you don't think you're gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes ,control,50.0,6
but its certainly you don't have food you don't have ,control,41.66666666666667,2
so ,control,0.0,0
I cannot be certain of what happened ,control,62.5,4
this is a photograph ,control,75.0,2
but clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water ,control,41.66666666666667,4
it may be a creek a stream a river shrugs or just an extreme  extreme area flood ,control,38.88888888888889,3
but uh that's really irrelevant ,control,33.33333333333333,2
she is in trouble ,control,75.0,2
and someone has either noticed a passerby or has um ,control,30.0,2
or she alerted somebody that  um of her  s her situation ,control,46.15384615384615,6
and the authorities were alerted because it appears that a  a professional is attempting to rescue her ,control,50.0,4
he has on rescue equipment ,control,40.0,3
and I really cannot give an end to the story because I don't know what the outcome of the situation was ,control,56.52173913043478,6
I assume she was saved ,control,60.0,2
but there's no shrugs telling based on this photograph ,control,40.0,6
there is a boy and  a young boy ,control,33.33333333333333,3
he's outside ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and he's kicking about a soccer ball ,control,50.0,3
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house ,control,46.15384615384615,6
shatters a window ,control,33.33333333333333,2
lands inside ,control,50.0,1
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it ,control,60.0,12
he is quite startled ,control,50.0,2
we then see him with the ball in his hand ,control,60.0,3
he's looking out the broken window ,control,57.14285714285714,2
uh he  I can't tell that he's glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption ,control,60.0,5
and he's certainly not happy ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I'm not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother  removed it from his hand ,control,43.47826086956522,5
 and he is still asking for it ,control,50.0,2
and she is reluctant to give it to him ,control,55.55555555555556,4
he's then outside with ,control,60.0,1
well  he has a backpack on so I assume he's headed off to school  but not necessarily ,control,40.0,2
and uh he's outside ,control,40.0,1
and he's walking ,control,50.0,1
and he sees raindrops falling ,control,20.0,2
and the rain picks up ,control,40.0,2
and he is getting soaked ,control,60.0,1
and h it uh appears he's turned around ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and he's returned home ,control,40.0,1
his mother is looking at his  his drenched body ,control,50.0,3
and then he uh was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain ,control,46.66666666666666,6
okay the story of Cinderella ,control,40.0,2
well Cinderella is  uh  she's one of three sisters ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and two of them are  rather in modern terms stuck up ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and  and well they're high on themselves ,control,44.44444444444444,0
and they  um their mother is somewhat the same way ,control,36.36363636363637,0
and she  uh as the story progresses there is a  one of the wealthy gentleman ,control,41.17647058823529,0
the uh uppity ups in  in the area ,control,44.44444444444444,3
he b is trying to I believe marry off his son ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and uh there is a ball being held ,control,37.5,3
and Cinderella is not invited because she  she has been rather outcast by the family as just the  the servant girl ,control,47.82608695652174,5
and  and she's to wait on everybody else ,control,40.0,0
so  she's rather lower class in the family ,control,50.0,4
and uh it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the  uh  the ability to go to the ball I suppose you'd say ,control,41.37931034482759,7
and she goes there in this fancy  fancy uh vehicle ,control,27.27272727272727,4
and she's  she's wearing glass slippers ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the uh son of the  the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son ,control,46.42857142857143,11
so  she's  she's dancing with the son and it  f it turns out that the son is  is rather enamored by her ,control,57.14285714285714,5
so  but uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by uh I believe it was midnight something shrugs ,control,48.14814814814815,7
or else she turns into shrugs a pumpkin laughs something like that ,control,50.0,4
I'm not exactly sure what the  the gist of it was ,control,61.53846153846154,5
but regardless she  um it gets close to midnight ,control,30.0,3
she realizes this ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and she darts off ,control,25.0,1
and leaves the  uh the prince shrugs or the son shrugs of the wealthy landowner whoever he was uh kind_of depressed that she hadta leave early ,control,37.03703703703704,7
and um she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers ,control,23.07692307692308,6
and these glass slippers are magical ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and um then she  uh the uh prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her  her foot ,control,38.46153846153847,5
so  and then he's again  you_know they're together again ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and he's happy to have found her ,control,50.0,3
and the  the other sisters are  who had planned on one of them getting the  uh the guy they're kind_of left in the dark ,control,50.0,0
and  and everyone kind_of gets their  their comeuppance ,control,30.0,3
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after ,control,22.22222222222222,3
