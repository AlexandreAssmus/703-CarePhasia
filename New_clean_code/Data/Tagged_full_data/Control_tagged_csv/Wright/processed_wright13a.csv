okay  when I was seventeen years old after I'd gra graduated from high school ,control,50.0,0
I went to Anaheim for a week long conference ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and while I was there I developed meningitis ,control,50.0,2
and uh I couldn't lay my head down on the pillow ,control,50.0,3
it  it  it was excruciating ,control,57.14285714285714,0
you_know  the  my scalp is very sensitive so I couldn't lay my head down on anything ,control,52.63157894736842,2
I really didn't know what was wrong with me ,control,60.0,4
I just thought I had a bad headache ,control,37.5,3
so  I went out to the kitchen and uh just sat there for about an hour or two ,control,36.84210526315789,5
it was the middle of the night and uh didn't really know what to do because I couldn't lay my head down ,control,50.0,4
but I was exhausted ,control,50.0,1
and uh so I ended up um going ,control,25.0,1
and uh there was someone staying in the room with me ,control,54.54545454545454,5
I  I told them that I couldn't sleep ,control,60.0,2
something was wrong with my head ,control,66.66666666666666,4
and uh he was actually a neurologist ,control,42.85714285714285,2
uh but uh he ended up giving me some pretty strong uh um pills to help the pain go away ,control,25.0,6
and it helped through the morning ,control,50.0,3
but then the next day it continued to hurt ,control,22.22222222222222,2
so  uh I ended up going to the hospital that evening ,control,50.0,4
I was actually staying with three doctors ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  they took me to the the hospital ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and uh they checked me in ,control,50.0,1
they did a  um first did a elec ,control,44.44444444444444,3
let's see what was it ,control,66.66666666666666,3
a cat ,control,50.0,1
think it was a cat ,control,60.0,3
uh um and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me ,control,55.55555555555556,6
uh so  that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture ,control,35.714285714285715,3
a  it was a  it was a resident it was a teaching uh hospital it was U_C_Irvine ,control,63.1578947368421,4
and uh he didn't do a very good job at it ,control,41.66666666666667,3
so  the the doctor was watching him took over ,control,60.0,2
it was painful ,control,66.66666666666666,1
but they had given me morphine by this point ,control,55.55555555555556,3
so  I felt much better ,control,33.33333333333333,2
uh I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside ,control,10.0,2
and uh I was still in the emergency room at that point ,control,50.0,3
and eventually the next morning got me into my own room ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and uh I felt fine by the next day ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um but they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much ,control,47.05882352941176,4
but when I was seventeen I was only eating uh one meal a day ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but they said I they would let me go home if I didn't eat more ,control,50.0,4
so  I hadta eat three meals a day ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they wanted to monitor me ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and but I felt great ,control,20.0,1
and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and they kept me two more days ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and uh they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go ,control,46.15384615384615,3
and to check my white blood cell count ,control,12.5,4
and it was pretty much the same as it was before ,control,63.63636363636363,3
so  it didn't show much of an improvement ,control,50.0,4
but I felt great ,control,25.0,1
so  they let me go home ,control,42.85714285714285,2

well  eventually Cinderella's father also passed away ,control,11.11111111111111,3
and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother ,control,44.44444444444444,3
her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her um their servant basically ,control,37.5,4
and uh everyone  they were very cruel to her ,control,50.0,3
and she lived a very um meager life ,control,25.0,3
and um but she was f friends with all the animals ,control,45.45454545454545,4
uh the animals were the people she got along with people she could talk to or  the  the creatures that she could talk to ,control,57.692307692307686,6
and uh then one day the there was a prince in that um country ,control,35.714285714285715,4
and uh they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife ,control,40.0,4
and  uh as it was time for him to marry ,control,45.45454545454545,0
and all  and Cinderella and their  her stepsisters were very excited to go ,control,26.666666666666668,5
uh however Cinderella uh could not go unless she had finished all her chores ,control,42.85714285714285,3
her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish ,control,27.27272727272727,4
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first ,control,42.85714285714285,4
um so  um by the time uh it came to go um Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to um make a dress or prepare herself to go ,control,24.24242424242424,7
but uh unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters' clothes and such that uh they had cast away because they didn't want it ,control,48.78048780487805,8
um so  Cinderella was very happy um that they had the dress for her ,control,40.0,4
and sh while the  the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it um Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go ,control,31.428571428571427,11
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away ,control,41.17647058823529,6
and um they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters ,control,56.52173913043478,10
and she went out to the yard and was crying ,control,50.0,3
and then uh a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight ,control,38.88888888888889,5
she made her very beautiful and uh all that ,control,44.44444444444444,2
but she warned her ,control,50.0,1
it would only last til midnight ,control,50.0,2
and you_know she turned you_know uh a pumpkin into a carriage and you_know transformed all these elements uh to make her look very beautiful ,control,29.166666666666668,5
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince ,control,46.15384615384615,5
and uh I guess it was love at first sight ,control,40.0,4
and they were dancing together ,control,40.0,1
and you_know he he very much enjoyed his time with her ,control,45.45454545454545,2
and uh they were dancing outside ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and she saw the clock ,control,40.0,2
and she knows it's almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs uh leaving one of her glass slippers behind um ,control,39.130434782608695,2
and she went racing off in the carriage ,control,50.0,4
and um she actually didn't make it quite home in the when it struck midnight ,control,43.75,3
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin ,control,55.55555555555556,4
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers ,control,56.25,10
and so this prince um after this happened he uh was very interested in finding her ,control,43.75,5
you_know  he was  wo he wondered why she had ran away ,control,53.84615384615385,3
and so he um set out to search for her using the glass slipper ,control,35.714285714285715,5
you_know  whoever's foot it fit would be that girl ,control,54.54545454545454,4
he sent out his  um I don't know it was the duke or something uh to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit ,control,48.14814814814815,7
it was very small ,control,50.0,2
um and eventually that duke got to Cinderella's house ,control,20.0,4
and uh Cinderella got excited ,control,0.0,2
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella ,control,52.17391304347826,5
I don't remember how ,control,60.0,1
and um locked Cinderella up there ,control,0.0,2
and  um while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper ,control,36.36363636363637,0
their feet were way too large ,control,33.33333333333333,2
they went flying you_know every time ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and uh the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the  the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind ,control,42.30769230769231,8
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper ,control,30.0,4
the stepmother was very angry at this ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper ,control,30.76923076923077,4
and uh the stepmother tripped him ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces ,control,40.0,6
and you_know the duke thought that everything was over ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and everything was ruined ,control,50.0,1
and they'd never find her ,control,50.0,1
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity ,control,31.25,3
and she ended up marrying the prince ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and they lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
one day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat Patches was in the tree stuck and was crying ,control,45.83333333333333,5
she ran home quickly to get her dad to help him  to help the cat out ,control,29.411764705882355,5
ah the dad brought a ladder just in case ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and as they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree ,control,52.17391304347826,7
the father then climbed up the tree ,control,42.85714285714285,3
well  that's kind_of wrong but laughs ,control,25.0,2
and uh the dog happened to knock over the ladder uh after the du dad  ha the dog knocked over the ladder after the dad already climbed into the tree ,control,38.70967741935484,5
now the father was also stuck ,control,33.33333333333333,2
uh meanwhile the neighbor called ah nineoneone ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and then  an  uh a  uh the firemen came to help him down from the tree ,control,36.84210526315789,4
