mom made him a nice cake and she frosted it and put four candles on top of it ,control,38.88888888888889,6
but when she went back into the kitchen to make sure everything was cleaned up for the party their dog jumped up got on top of the table and started eating the birthday cake ,control,44.11764705882353,9
when mom heard the commotion in the living room she grabbed a broom and chased the dog under the couch ,control,45.0,5
just then the doorbell rang ,control,20.0,2
the guests were arriving ,control,50.0,2
and the cake was destroyed ,control,40.0,2
mom was more worried about the cake than the little kids were though ,control,46.15384615384615,4
they enjoyed the rest of the cake just fine and had a great time ,control,35.714285714285715,4
uh when I was seven years old uh I went swimming at the Northern_Michigan university pool with a good friend of mine ,control,40.909090909090914,5
uh I started feeling chills while I was swimming but I thought it was just because the water was cold ,control,50.0,2
I went out and uh showered off afterwards ,control,37.5,2
and the hot water felt really good ,control,14.285714285714285,2
but I was getting stiffer and stiffer ,control,28.57142857142857,2
when we left the sun was shining and it was about eighty degrees ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and just standing still in the sun felt really good but moving was getting incredibly hard ,control,18.75,4
since my friend only lived a couple of blocks away I sat down and said ,control,40.0,4
 I'm just gonna sit here ,control,25.0,2
 can you go home and have your mom call my mom and have her come and pick me up ,control,35.0,6
well  my mom came to pick me up ,control,33.33333333333333,2
sh she felt that I had a fever took me to the hospital and they found out that I had meningitis ,control,52.38095238095239,5
and I was in the hospital for four days ,control,55.55555555555556,3
oh  it might have been five I can't remember ,control,54.54545454545454,2
it it  I was seven okay laughs ,control,50.0,2
and they gave me a spinal tap ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and that's terrifying because they have you laying on your side ,control,58.333333333333336,5
and here I was seven ,control,40.0,1
 saying ,control,0.0,1
 now don't move ,control,20.0,1
 this'll hurt but don't move you might end up paralyzed ,control,46.15384615384615,3
well  that certainly calmed me right down ,control,25.0,0
but with the exception that they bring in uh uh the uh flavored uh uh pops whenever I wanted from the nursing station ,control,43.47826086956522,7
the refrigerated uh like fruit drink things that are frozen ,control,40.0,2
that was okay ,control,66.66666666666666,1
but they didn't turn the tv on t for my room until the day I left ,control,52.94117647058824,4
so  I was in the hospital for four days with no tv ,control,61.53846153846154,3
but I'm ,control,66.66666666666666,1
okay ,control,0.0,0
um my mom uh when I was twenty one had a brain tumor ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and she went in for surgery ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and when she came back out ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh this is in the late seventies ,control,57.14285714285714,3
they did the surgery ,control,50.0,2
they got the tumor out ,control,60.0,2
but at the same time it caused some damage to her ability to speak well and to uh understand well ,control,30.0,6
um it  it was difficult uh trying to develop uh lists of things that she wanted done around the house ,control,38.095238095238095,0
um but we managed to work out a pretty good system of uh you_know ,control,28.57142857142857,4
she'd write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper which she always kept with her ,control,63.63636363636363,6
and that seemed to help a_lot because you_know she could remember something short term but an hour from now forget it ,control,38.095238095238095,5
but just by carrying that pad around with her all the time she was able to make lists of things so when I came home I knew what she wanted done ,control,45.16129032258064,9
and we were able to you_know bridge the gaps for awhile until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home ,control,44.44444444444444,5
I've had a stress free life laughs ,control,37.5,3

when I was in high school I was out with some friends at Presque_Isle ,control,71.42857142857143,4
there's no death in this story ,control,57.14285714285714,4
um and uh we were walking along ,control,42.85714285714285,1
and it's all rocks along the edge of Lake_Superior ,control,60.0,5
it's not a beach at that particular spot ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and it was a big rock cliff on one side ges,control,36.36363636363637,4
and I looked over at it ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and I thought I could climb it ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and one of my friends said ,control,33.33333333333333,4
 I don't know head,control,33.33333333333333,1
 looks,control,0.0,1
 oh  no  head,control,16.666666666666664,0
well  I managed to climb head,control,14.285714285714285,2
it was probably a sixty or seventy foot cliff ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I got up within about five ten feet to the top and then ran out of hand holds ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and I was looking down looks,control,50.0,1
I didn't wanna look down anymore ,control,28.57142857142857,2
it was way far down ,control,40.0,3
but I was able to move off to one side ,control,40.0,5
and there was a tree that was actually raises,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I was able to reach up with one hand raises,control,36.36363636363637,5
but at that point I was pretty darn scared because I didn't know how secure that tree was ,control,52.63157894736842,4
but there was only one way to find out ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and it was strong enough since I'm here laughs ,control,50.0,2
uh this woman was walking ,control,40.0,2
and all_of_a_sudden a flash flood came up and swept her down stream ,control,33.33333333333333,3
fortunately she was lucky enough to grab on to a tree branch and hold on ,control,40.0,5
and a rescue  worker came along looking to see if there are any victims in the flood saw her out there begging for help ,control,36.0,7
and he climbs out on a long branch to rescue her ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and brings a belt so_that they'll be able to  with a rope attached to it that so_that they'll be able to pull her back to shore safely ,control,53.333333333333336,8
and boy she looks cold ,control,20.0,1
little boy is getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella ,control,26.666666666666668,4

it starts raining harder and harder ,control,16.666666666666664,3
he turns around runs back and runs into the house ,control,40.0,5
he's soaking wet ,control,50.0,1
his hair's plastered down ,control,40.0,2
his shirt is soaked ,control,50.0,2
his mom looks at him and says ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 now didn't I ask you if you needed that umbrella ,control,50.0,3
so  he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school again ,control,42.85714285714285,6
there's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can ,control,51.85185185185185,6
the ball sails quite a ways ,control,50.0,2
in_fact  it sails s so far it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room ,control,33.33333333333333,6
when it comes through the glass after breaking a window it even knocks over a lamp in the living room ,control,55.00000000000001,5
the man who's sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through jumps up grabs the ball and looks out the window ,control,44.82758620689656,8
but the boy's run away ,control,16.666666666666664,2
there once was a young girl called Cinderella ,control,37.5,3
she had three ugly stepsisters ,control,20.0,2
and her family  didn't like her very much and made her do all,control,33.33333333333333,3

and she hadta cook and sew and everything all by herself while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun ,control,27.58620689655172,7

and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear ,control,50.0,4
looking around buying dre new dresses checking out how they looked ,control,36.36363636363637,6
but Cinderella couldn't go ,control,20.0,1
when all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appears and says ,control,25.0,2

Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 I can't go to the ball that the prince is having but my stepsisters get to go instead ,control,40.0,5
and the fairy godmother says ,control,20.0,2
 well  nonsense ,control,0.0,0
and she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and she says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  you're gonna need a horse or  horses and a coach to ride ,control,22.22222222222222,5

and she gives her  gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball ,control,38.88888888888889,6

 the magic's only good for one day ,control,22.22222222222222,0
 at the stroke of midnight all of this will disappear ,control,63.63636363636363,4
so  Cinderella goes to the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and she has a wonderful time ,control,33.33333333333333,2
she's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince ,control,53.84615384615385,7
he just wants to dance with her all night ,control,44.44444444444444,3
when she all_of_a_sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight ,control,50.0,5
oh_goodness ,control,0.0,0
so  she turns and races out_of the ball ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers ,control,35.714285714285715,4
falls off of her foot ,control,60.0,4
hops into her carriage ,control,50.0,3
and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight the horses change back into mice ,control,38.88888888888889,7
the carriage changes back into a pumpkin ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen ,control,43.75,7
she sneaks into the house ,control,60.0,3
and all her stepsisters wha were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady ,control,50.0,6
he tries to find her ,control,40.0,2
and all he hasta go by is the one glass slipper that she f lost behind her ,control,47.05882352941176,4
he goes around ,control,33.33333333333333,1
he tries every girl is town to see whose foot the slipper will fit on ,control,40.0,6
the three step  stepsisters all try to squeeze their feet into that glass slipper as hard as they can ,control,40.0,4
but they can't make them fit ,control,42.85714285714285,2
when the prince looks over at the  s f what he thinks is just the maid and says ,control,47.368421052631575,4
 why don't you try it on ,control,62.5,1
 oh  she's just the maid ,control,37.5,2
