um he  he was hard to understand ,control,37.5,2
but I did my best to communicate with him by um maybe not trying to understand his complete sentences but trying to pick out words out_of what he was saying and try to match that into the context of what was going on around us to piece together what he might be saying ,control,45.28301886792453,5
and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on uh stating how I was understanding him so_that at some point if I didn't understand him he would realize that I wasn't understanding him ,control,55.55555555555556,11
