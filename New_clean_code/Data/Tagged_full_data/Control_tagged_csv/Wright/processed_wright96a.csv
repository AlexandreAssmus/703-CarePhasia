and I was having uh pain in my left hip ,control,40.0,4
points,control,0.0,0
and I'd had a car accident earlier that year ,control,40.0,2
so  I thought maybe it was related to that ,control,60.0,3
uh but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an xray ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and they found out that um the bone  the joint was actually dying because I had what was called uh avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didn't join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off ,control,42.5,7
so,control,0.0,0
so  um we set up the appointment ,control,37.5,2
um or the  the specialist set up the appointment uh you_know with the hospital for the date of surgery ,control,45.0,0
and I went into the hospital ,control,50.0,3
and um shrugs shakes,control,0.0,1
I've never really been sick or anything in my life ,control,54.54545454545454,4
so  um they put me under ,control,42.85714285714285,1
and I actually kind_of woke up before they were completely finished ,control,45.45454545454545,2
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldn't feel anything from the waist down ,control,50.0,5
but they were finishing up ,control,60.0,1
and I was like looking around ,control,50.0,3
and the doctor was kinda surprised ,control,33.33333333333333,2
he was like ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 oh  just be calm ,control,16.666666666666664,2
 we're almost done ,control,40.0,1
um and uh so then after that they wheeled me into the r recovery room where you_know I kinda came more out_of the anesthetic ,control,41.66666666666667,6
and then I spent two days in the hospital uh before they were  uh before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home ,control,42.85714285714285,6
um and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work ,control,24.0,7
um and then it was ges a year before they said I was completely healed ,control,46.66666666666666,3
but um yeah that was the  the only time I've ever really been in the hospital ,control,50.0,5
no  it was really kind_of strange because I  you_know I trusted the doctors ,control,46.66666666666666,2
and I thought I w would be afraid you_know especially when they were putting me under ,control,56.25,3
um but I really wasn't frightened or  or scared ,control,18.181818181818183,2
oh yeah definitely ,control,0.0,2
sure laughs ,control,0.0,1
alright this was uh gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager ,control,56.25,4
and uh my family uh we lived in Anchorage and we'd always  every weekend we would go down to the Kenai_Peninsula to either the Kenai_River or the Russian_River to go salmon fishing because the salmon would run ,control,43.58974358974359,6
and so um I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and I was wearing ges,control,40.0,1
everybody wears waders ,control,33.33333333333333,1
so  anyway I was ges,control,50.0,1
and I'm walking along ,control,40.0,1
and I hear something ges,control,40.0,2
and I look over to my right ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and I see a little baby moose ges ,control,25.0,3
and I'm like ,control,50.0,1
 oh  how cute a baby moose ,control,25.0,0
well  I hear something ges,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I look over and it's the mother moose ,control,50.0,4
and it freaked me out ,control,60.0,1
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby ,control,44.11764705882353,9
and I had this huge thing of fish ges,control,33.33333333333333,4
and I was like   s I  I didn't wanna drop the fish because I thought that would make noise ,control,50.0,2
so  I was trying to like tiptoe as fast as I could through that area ,control,50.0,5
and I was able to get past that ,control,50.0,3
I don't know how I was able to get through there ,control,50.0,5
I don't know how the  m the mother moose didn't hear me because they have good hearing ,control,50.0,4
they don't see very well ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but apparently ges,control,0.0,1
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
but yeah  I was like scared for laughs my life there for a little bit until I got past that area and back to camp ,control,42.30769230769231,5
they're huge ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and they look so goofy and ,control,16.666666666666664,2
but they can be really dangerous ,control,50.0,2
yeah  actually my grandmother uh on my dad's side um you_know as she got older um ,control,27.77777777777778,4
she'd had uh a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks um in her life ,control,44.44444444444444,5
but as she got older her memory started to go ,control,30.0,2
and it was  uh I think she ,control,50.0,2
I don't know if it was Alzheimer's that she had or dementia or what ,control,50.0,5
but we would go to see her you_know from time to time ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and you_know sometimes she would be really th you_know with it ,control,54.54545454545454,2
she could remember lots of things ,control,50.0,3
and other times you would kind_of hafta tell her who you  who you were and talk really slowly ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and you_know she would keep repeating twirls,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she'd be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother ,control,61.53846153846154,5
and so ,control,0.0,1
 no ,control,0.0,0
you hafta say ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 no Grandma it's Rich ,control,50.0,1
and she's ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 oh  Richie ,control,0.0,0
and so then you_know she would remember who I was for awhile ,control,50.0,3
and then she'd kinda fade out again ,control,37.5,1
so  it was difficult to communicate ,control,42.85714285714285,2
it was kind_of hard emotionally too you_know because I remember her from when she was younger ,control,56.25,4
and she was like my favorite grandmother ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and she was really a_lot_of fun ,control,50.0,2
and then to see her in that situation where she's just kind_of a shadow of her former self was  was upsetting ,control,47.82608695652174,8
so ,control,0.0,0
um well  I would hold her hand you_know and just be  you_know modulate my tone of voice ,control,31.57894736842105,4
um you_know  just repeat it if  if she couldn't understand ,control,38.46153846153847,3
um you_know  just be there for her really ,control,33.33333333333333,2
sometimes she couldn't understand ,control,40.0,1
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didn't ,control,53.84615384615385,3
you_know  you would talk to her and she may not understand ,control,50.0,2
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm ges,control,43.47826086956522,6
okay ,control,0.0,0

and the soccer ball went through a window in his neighborhood ,control,45.45454545454545,5
Mister_Moss was sitting calmly in his chair watching tv when all of a sudden the soccer ball came crashing through his window in the living room and hit a lamp and knocked it over ,control,47.05882352941176,4
he jumped out_of the chair grabbed the soccer ball and looked out the window ,control,42.85714285714285,4
but he couldn't see anybody because Joey had hidden in the bushes ,control,53.84615384615385,4
and he was perplexed as to who had done this and what he was going to do about it ,control,63.1578947368421,7

um once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and unfortunately her father passed away ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and she was sent to live with um her stepmother and stepsisters um who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful ,control,45.83333333333333,7
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun ,control,52.94117647058824,6
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm ,control,45.45454545454545,7
um one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son ,control,37.03703703703704,7
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that uh somebody was  would be uh able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king ,control,45.16129032258064,10
so  couriers went across the land and delivered the uh message or delivered invitations to all the eligible uh bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom ,control,29.629629629629623,8
and the  t the stepsisters were very excited ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and Cinderella was excited too ,control,20.0,1
but then they laughed at her saying ,control,42.85714285714285,3
 you can't go to the ball ,control,50.0,3
 you don't have a dress ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 you're just a scrub girl ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and Cinderella was very sad about that ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but her friends the animals um made a dress for her so  so she could go to the ball ,control,50.0,3
um unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball ,control,53.333333333333336,5
so  they ripped the dress up ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and Cinderella was sent down to the  to the cellar ,control,54.54545454545454,3
um and she cried ,control,25.0,1
and then all_of_a_sudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying ,control,43.75,3
and she told her story to the fairy godmother ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the fairy godmother waved her wand ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with  with glass slippers ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and it turned into a beautiful carriage ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and she waved her wand over the mice ,control,50.0,3
and the mice turned into horses ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  Cinderella arrived at the  at the uh royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress ,control,40.0,9
uh she met the prince ,control,40.0,2
and they danced the night away ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but the  Cin but the uh fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight ,control,46.42857142857143,4
so  Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away ,control,35.714285714285715,4
and the prince tried to catch her um because he was so enchanted with her ,control,46.66666666666666,4
but uh he couldn't catch up with her ,control,55.55555555555556,2
she  Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden slip or  one of her glass slippers on the stairs ,control,45.16129032258064,10
uh she made it to the carriage and got home just in time ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin ,control,37.5,3
and the mice turned or  the horses turned back into mice ,control,25.0,3
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because he was  his heart belonged to her now ,control,48.38709677419355,8
so  he sent couriers across the land again with the  g the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and then he would know who  who was the beautiful woman at the ball ,control,53.333333333333336,6
so  when the courier got to uh Cinderella's house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting uh to try the slippers on ,control,34.78260869565217,0
but unfortunately they  the slippers didn't fit either one of them ,control,46.15384615384615,0
and Cinderella came out_of the cellar and sat down ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at  at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle ,control,47.05882352941176,7
and she and the prince lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,3
