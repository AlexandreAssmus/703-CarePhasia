Lisa was calling for the little kitty to come down ,control,40.0,3
but the kitty was afraid so the kitty stayed up in the tree ,control,53.84615384615385,4
so  her father got the ladder ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and decided to climb up the tree to see if he could get the cat down ,control,43.75,5
well  while he was climbing up and the dog was barking  the ladder fell down ,control,47.05882352941176,4
and so he was stuck up in the tree ,control,55.55555555555556,3
so  the mother hadta call the fire department ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the fire department brought their ladder a on their fire truck ,control,41.66666666666667,3

and proceed to eat ,control,0.0,2
n i_c_us were not um known then ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and so I was put in a semi private room which was um what they used during those days ,control,52.63157894736842,7
and my um classmates specialed ,control,20.0,2
what do I remember about it ,control,83.33333333333334,2
I remember being so ill  before I had the surgery that um I refused the baby because actually we thought  I thought that I had the flu ,control,48.27586206896552,6
and I was just feeling so badly ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didn't know really what was wrong ,control,55.00000000000001,4
but they really didn't think anything was wrong ,control,44.44444444444444,2
they just thought that I didn't wanna take care of my little girl ,control,42.85714285714285,5
um finally after three days I had that ,control,37.5,3
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three a_m ,control,50.0,3
and finally I had surgery at um Monday evening ,control,22.22222222222222,3
so  I was really very very ill ,control,37.5,2
in_fact  I had um peritonitis ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and they really did not think that I would live ,control,50.0,2
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they  um that's just the way they did things ,control,60.86956521739131,5
and I actually chose  you could choose if you wanted to have the baby um to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby ,control,42.85714285714285,8
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are  um healthy and not ill ,control,45.0,7
and I chose the baby  to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby ,control,41.66666666666667,8
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kind_of thought of her as their own ,control,55.00000000000001,6
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses ,control,57.89473684210527,6
and consequently from that uh I had ototoxic drugs ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  I lost my hearing that way ,control,50.0,2
okay since I am hearing impaired um I understand that situation really well ,control,38.46153846153847,3
so  I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing  and not admitting it or not having hearing aids ,control,33.33333333333333,5
because you can  you just notice um that they're not understanding or they're not interested in what is being said or they're just on a different page ,control,54.83870967741935,6
and what have I done about it ,control,71.42857142857143,2
actually  what you do is you just talk to them ,control,63.63636363636363,3
and you just go right in front of them so_that they can see your face and your lips ,control,50.0,4
and also if you're in a really noisy environment go outside and  uh where it's quiet ,control,42.10526315789473,5
okay ,control,0.0,0
oh don't put that on yet I hafta think ,control,40.0,2

okay  the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon ,control,54.16666666666666,5
and we were driving in Florida ,control,50.0,2
and seatbelts were new ,control,25.0,1
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car ,control,50.0,4
and we were just driving down a country road ,control,44.44444444444444,2

and came right out in front of us ,control,37.5,4
and we actually drove into the ditch ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and if we wouldn't have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured ,control,62.5,3
but since we had our seatbelts on we just took  th my husband just turned the car ,control,38.88888888888889,3
and we continued on ,control,50.0,1
and that guy just never  that truck just never stopped and just kept going ,control,13.333333333333334,0

well  it looks to me that it had been raining for many days or  raining very hard ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and  this   hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream ,control,40.0,6
and managed to grab a hold of a branch ,control,33.33333333333333,5
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and uh the man is there rescuing her ,control,37.5,3
and pulled her to safety ,control,40.0,2
well  looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking ,control,25.0,5
well  Johnny was kicking really too hard ,control,12.5,2
and kicked the ball right through the neighbor's window ,control,30.0,4
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair ,control,40.0,4
and the ball came through the window ,control,42.85714285714285,3
knocked over the lamp ,control,50.0,3
and the neighbor went ,control,25.0,2
 oh ,control,0.0,0
and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball ,control,50.0,6
 well  it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and mother said ,control,0.0,1

and Johnny says ,control,0.0,1

and sure enough it started raining ,control,16.666666666666664,2
in_fact  it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands ,control,29.411764705882355,5
and run through the puddles ,control,40.0,3
and run home ,control,0.0,1

 when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters ,control,37.5,0
and so Cinderella uh grew up with two stepsisters ,control,22.22222222222222,3
but then the father must have died because all_of_a_sudden it's the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and Cinderella became the um cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day ,control,34.78260869565217,6
um it was   the  everyone had grown up and gotten older ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and they received an invitation from the prince  from the castle because the prince was um old enough to get married now ,control,43.47826086956522,5
and he was looking for a bride ,control,57.14285714285714,3
so  they were having a big party at the castle ,control,54.54545454545454,3
so  the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters ,control,50.0,4
and Cinderella overheard it ,control,25.0,1
so  she ran to her room ,control,57.14285714285714,3
opened up her trunk ,control,50.0,2
and got out her special gown that she'd been saving for a long time ,control,53.333333333333336,5
she tried it on ,control,75.0,1
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was ,control,50.0,4
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball ,control,50.0,5
so  the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and Cinderella was left home all by herself ,control,37.5,2
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and especially the mice were  felt very sorry for her  and were very upset ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and then all_of_a_sudden a  f Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared ,control,9.090909090909092,4
and said ,control,0.0,1
 Cinderella we  you are going to go to the ball ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and so she fricked ,control,25.0,1
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown ,control,12.5,2
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach ,control,37.5,4
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach ,control,22.22222222222222,4
and I think the dog became the footman ,control,37.5,3
and everybody went off to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and she had a wonderful time ,control,33.33333333333333,2
oh and she had glass slippers ,control,16.666666666666664,2
that was the special thing ,control,60.0,2
the g fairy godmother had given her glass slippers ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything  the coach would turn back into a pumpkin ,control,54.16666666666666,6
and she would not have her dress anymore ,control,37.5,2
so  she had a wonderful time at the  uh party and s danced with the prince all night ,control,45.0,4
and then all_of_a_sudden the clock started striking midnight ,control,12.5,2
so  she ran down the steps ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and ran into the coach ,control,40.0,3
and ran all the way home ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but  she had lost her one shoe ,control,37.5,2
so  the prince had found the shoe ,control,50.0,2
and said ,control,0.0,1
 I will only marry  the  girl that fits into their shoe ,control,42.85714285714285,5
so  there was a proclamation sent around that the  uh prince's  uh footman would be going around with the shoe ,control,45.83333333333333,5
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe ,control,45.45454545454545,3
so  s the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball ,control,46.66666666666666,5
so  she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket ,control,53.333333333333336,5
and the mice connived and got the key out_of the pocket ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe ,control,35.714285714285715,5
but they didn't make it as  um because their f feet were much larger than Cinderella's ,control,42.10526315789473,5
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and th the mice had just gotten the  door open to Cinderella's room ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and she came running down the stairs ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and said ,control,0.0,1
 may I try on the shoe ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and the footman said ,control,25.0,2
 yes of_course ,control,0.0,0
and he went over to  try the  put the shoe on her ,control,50.0,4
and the stepmother used her cane to trip him ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  the shoe fell to the ground and broke ,control,40.0,3
and so the stepmother said ,control,20.0,2
 well  that's that ,control,50.0,2
and Cinderella said ,control,0.0,1
 no ,control,0.0,0
and she pulled the shoe out_of her apron pocket ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and said ,control,0.0,1
 here it is ,control,50.0,1
and so the footman put it on her foot ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and the prince said ,control,25.0,2
 oh  Cinderella ,control,0.0,0
and everybody was happy ,control,50.0,1
the mice were dancing ,control,50.0,2
and everybody was happy except the stepsisters and  the stepmother ,control,45.45454545454545,6
