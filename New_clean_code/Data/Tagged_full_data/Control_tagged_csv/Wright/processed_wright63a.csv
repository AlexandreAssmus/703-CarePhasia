okay  it looks like they have problems with their pets ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and I have a cat ,control,40.0,2
so  I know that cats climb anywhere ,control,37.5,0
and all_of_a_sudden it's in a high tree ,control,50.0,3
and it doesn't look like the cat is stressed ,control,50.0,3
but the kids are s or  the little girl is stressed ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat ,control,35.714285714285715,4
but I don't think he's able to ,control,44.44444444444444,2
so  he calls the firemen ,control,50.0,2
and the firemen look like they're going to get the cat down ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and I'm just gonna assume that they got the cat down ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and the little kid is gonna be so excited ,control,30.0,3
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and they live happily ever after laughs ,control,28.57142857142857,2
okay  you take the  the loaf of bread ,control,40.0,3
and you open the bag ,control,40.0,2
and take two slices out ,control,20.0,2
you get your peanut butter jar ,control,33.33333333333333,3
you unscrew it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and you get your knife ,control,40.0,2
and take out the peanut butter ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and put peanut butter on both sides of the bre I mean  on one side ges,control,35.294117647058826,5
so_that both ges,control,33.33333333333333,2
and then you get your favorite jelly ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and you do the same thing ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and then you put them together ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and serve it ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and eat happily ever laughs after ,control,16.666666666666664,2
well  I  clears,control,20.0,2
and when I found out I had breast cancer ,control,44.44444444444444,2
which runs very prominently in my family ,control,42.85714285714285,3
um my husband um said ,control,20.0,2
 we're gonna whip this thing ,control,37.5,3
and so I had a mastectomy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said ,control,30.76923076923077,3
 we're going off to war again ,control,50.0,2
 and we're gonna beat it ,control,37.5,0
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband ,control,56.25,6
and my husband was b trying to be strong for me ,control,54.54545454545454,4
so  we always had a positive attitude ,control,37.5,2
and we  uh we never thought negatively ,control,25.0,0
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors ,control,50.0,3
yes ,control,0.0,0
okay  well  my mother was eighty nine when she had her s breast cancer ,control,37.5,4
and she came through that fine ,control,50.0,3
but then after that  a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes ,control,43.75,4
and so she herself said ,control,40.0,2
 I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and she was living by herself at the time ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and so she,control,33.33333333333333,1
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in  near my sister in Dallas ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and so then I went there once a month to visit her ,control,25.0,2
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well ,control,30.76923076923077,4
she um she would start sentences ,control,50.0,1
and never be able to finish them ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and she would say ,control,50.0,1
 would you ,control,66.66666666666666,0
and then she wouldn't be able to  to finish the sentence ,control,30.76923076923077,4
so  it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted  us to do ,control,50.0,5
but we didn't really know what to do ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  the only thing my sister and I did was we just um smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf ,control,41.66666666666667,5
so  we talked slowly and loudly ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and we always had a big smile on our faces ,control,40.0,4
and um we just showed her that we cared ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and we would always um read her mail to her ,control,50.0,2
and we knew two favorite people of hers ,control,25.0,3
so  we would always read those uh more than once ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her ,control,50.0,3
okay   um clears_throat when I was working for this man he was the  um he was a member of Young_Presidents_Organization ,control,54.54545454545454,5
and it was made up of presidents from around the world ,control,63.63636363636363,6
and they had um a  not a seminar but a  um they called it a university ,control,38.88888888888889,4
and it was like a week long ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and it would always be one would be in the United_States ,control,63.63636363636363,4
and the second one of the year would be outside the United_States ,control,58.333333333333336,4
and this year it was going to be in San_Francisco ,control,50.0,3
and um it'll be twenty years ago next month ,control,30.0,3
and um my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening ,control,50.0,5
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a_lot of the background work ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working uh week ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and so Don stayed here ,control,0.0,1
and my sister from Dallas uh flew in ,control,25.0,3
and that was the week that they had the San_Francisco earthquake ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and um so we were at Fisherman's_Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free ,control,58.82352941176471,4
and um we were waiting to go uh on the trolley cart back to um Saint_Francis  the Westin_Saint_Francis ,control,31.57894736842105,6
and as we're waiting in line the earthquake hit ,control,50.0,3
and um it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that ,control,66.66666666666666,5
and so my sister  just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down ,control,35.294117647058826,0
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 that was probably a two or three ,control,37.5,0
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didn't know ,control,65.21739130434783,4
but that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing ,control,53.84615384615385,6
well  the electricity was off so nothing worked ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel ,control,30.0,3
and um in San_Francisco you_know it's pretty hilly ges,control,30.0,3
and so um I_mean it was  it was uh quite a jog back there ,control,40.0,3
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel ,control,41.66666666666667,5
so  we sat outside this big uh park area um for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in ,control,45.83333333333333,4
and uh the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was ,control,35.714285714285715,4
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and we wanted to also call our two husbands ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news ,control,36.84210526315789,10
she doesn't like to hear uh the bad news ,control,30.0,3
and there's hardly any good news that's told ,control,40.0,3
so  we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know ,control,46.15384615384615,2
but my sister said ,control,25.0,2
 mother what are you doing ,control,50.0,2
and she said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  I'm watching the news because soandso told me that there was a big earthquake in San_Francisco ,control,45.0,5
so  this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco ,control,46.66666666666666,5
so  it was a_lot_of  fear at the beginning ,control,50.0,3
we were on the nineteenth floor ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor ,control,50.0,4
and then walk down with our luggage ,control,28.57142857142857,3
so  it was just uh the fear of the unknown ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and not knowing if we're gonna be able to fly out because maybe the  the airline canceled the flight or whatever ,control,41.66666666666667,5
but both of our flights were fine ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and we made it home okay ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and our families were okay laughs ,control,33.33333333333333,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
first of all it looks like there has been um a weather change ,control,61.53846153846154,3
and so whatever the girl was doing at the beginning I would say she was ,control,60.0,5
I can't tell if it's a young girl or if it's a young lady ,control,58.82352941176471,4
so  I'm  whatever she was doing I think it's ,control,69.23076923076923,2
she was  riding her bicycle ,control,50.0,2
I'm going to say it's a young girl riding a bicycle ,control,46.15384615384615,6
and she  the weather came up quickly ,control,37.5,2
and it looks like it is flooding the roadway ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and perhaps she was um I'm just gonna say a  on a bicycle ,control,43.75,6
and so it washed her haway ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and uh  she's very frightened and concerned and scared and  all other emotions  negative emotions ,control,15.789473684210526,6
and this one ,control,33.33333333333333,1
it might be a firefighter  or whatever rescuer is coming ,control,54.54545454545454,3
uh it looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb ,control,61.53846153846154,4
and he is  he's got his lifejacket on ,control,60.0,3
and so he is coming to rescue the little girl ,control,30.0,3
and being that he's a professional rescuer of one way or another ,control,53.84615384615385,6
um the family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land ,control,35.294117647058826,4
okay ,control,0.0,0
this young boy is practicing soccer ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and as happens most of the time or  many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood ,control,40.0,6
um whether it's baseball or  or golf or a soccer ball ,control,30.76923076923077,3
it goes in a way that it shouldn't have gone ,control,63.63636363636363,3
so  he's kicking this soccer ball ,control,50.0,2
and it accidently crashes through a window ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I'm going to say it's a neighbor's window ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and all_of_a_sudden it ,control,33.33333333333333,1
the neighbor is sitting in a chair ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and this ball comes through ,control,40.0,2
and knocks over a lamp ,control,40.0,3
and then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window ,control,53.84615384615385,3
and is looking outside the broken window to the young man ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and being that it's a neighbor I think that he knows that accidents do happen ,control,62.5,6
and he's not happy what happened ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but he's understandable  u understanding that it was just an accident ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and is not going to be upset with the boy ,control,40.0,4
but is just going to tell him ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 just be careful the next time ,control,28.57142857142857,2
well   little boy is  is with his mom ,control,40.0,4
and his mom is  sort_of insisting that he  ta even_though it's not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast ,control,48.0,3
and he should take this umbrella ,control,50.0,2
head,control,0.0,0
they'd rather have the rain probably and play in the rain ,control,41.66666666666667,4
but he's insisting that he does not wanna take the umbrella ,control,50.0,4
so  as he's walking ,control,50.0,0
looks like to school because he's got a backpack on ,control,54.54545454545454,3
uh it starts raining ,control,25.0,1
it's okay at the very beginning because it's just drizzling ,control,58.333333333333336,3
but then all_of_a_sudden it is really coming down ,control,37.5,2
so he's  you can see the puddles on the ground ,control,58.333333333333336,4
so  he's trying to cover his head with his hand ,control,50.0,4
and he's turned around to go back home ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and he comes in ,control,25.0,1
and he's very sad because he's soaked ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and his mother looks at him ,control,50.0,2
and is disappointed that he didn't take the umbrella ,control,50.0,4
but now he realizes that his mother was right ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and he should've taken the umbrella ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and he goes out using the umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and though it's pouring down rain he's now keeping dry ,control,50.0,2
okay  the story of Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I've forgotten some of it but anyway ,control,62.5,3
um it's a story of a family that has  mother that has three daughters ,control,43.75,8
two seem to be uh mean sisters to their one sister who is Cinderella ,control,35.714285714285715,5
they always have fun ,control,25.0,1
and they dress up ,control,50.0,1
they go places ,control,33.33333333333333,1
um she is left  Cinderella is left to do the chores the hard work ,control,33.33333333333333,4
feeding the animals cooking cleaning the house ,control,28.57142857142857,4
um then they get an invitation to a ball ,control,44.44444444444444,3
the prince has invited everybody to come to the ball ,control,50.0,4
and so they're all excited because they're gonna go to the ball ,control,46.66666666666666,5
well  Cinderella gets dressed ,control,20.0,2
and her sisters get dressed ,control,40.0,2
and they take some of their things that she was going to wear  for themselves ,control,56.25,4
and so now Cinderella really doesn't wanna go because she doesn't look pretty ,control,26.666666666666668,3
and so the other two sisters go to the ball ,control,30.0,3
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother comes ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and says ,control,0.0,1
 you're going to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and waves her magic wand ,control,20.0,2
and Cinderella looks beautiful ,control,0.0,1
and so she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball ,control,50.0,7
and she has on beautiful silver slippers ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and so all_of_a_sudden she gets to the ball ,control,37.5,4
and uh the prince dances with her ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and she says  all_of_a_sudden it's midnight ,control,37.5,3
and if she doesn't get out by midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin ,control,56.25,3
so  she runs away from the prince ,control,50.0,4
and gets into the uh carriage ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and somehow she lost her one shoe ,control,28.57142857142857,2
the prince finds the shoe ,control,40.0,2
and they try to find the person that this shoe fits ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and he has help ,control,25.0,1
other people are helping him ,control,40.0,2
and so finally they  they try to fit the shoe on the two mean sisters ,control,31.25,5
head,control,0.0,0
but then they said ,control,25.0,1
 there was one other person here ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and Cinderella  it fit Cinderella ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and so the prince takes Cinderella ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and lives happily ever after ,control,20.0,2
