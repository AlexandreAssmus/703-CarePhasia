there are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,15.384615384615383,5
uh one of them is to get out the bread that's already cut ,control,50.0,4
and  uh and put peanut butter on it ,control,22.22222222222222,0
uh actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store ,control,25.0,3

and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into this  into the jar ,control,40.0,4
and you can put it right on the bread ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,12.5,3
very lazy ,control,0.0,1
very easy ,control,0.0,1
the good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread ,control,26.31578947368421,6
cut it in six inch long pieces ,control,28.57142857142857,5
slice it longways so_that it's open ,control,57.14285714285714,3
it's nice and crunchy on top ,control,42.85714285714285,2
it's very soft on the interior ,control,57.14285714285714,4
you take your peanut butter ,control,40.0,2
crunchy and   so and regular ,control,0.0,3
you mix those together ,control,50.0,1
you put it on the peanut   you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich ,control,56.25,4
you take the jelly ,control,50.0,2
uh I wouldn't use grape jelly ,control,28.57142857142857,1
but uh you can use other kinds of jelly ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I  I like strawberry ,control,33.33333333333333,2
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I put it on there ,control,40.0,2
and then I take that a sandwich ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and I put it in the microwave ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and I heat it so_that the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together ,control,41.17647058823529,4
I still have crunchy on the top ,control,42.85714285714285,3
but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and then I eat that ,control,40.0,1
uh four years ago I uh uh had my knees replaced ,control,18.181818181818183,3
uh I had them both done at the same time ,control,50.0,4
it was uh scheduled for July the fifth ,control,50.0,2
uh however they uh fouled up on the scheduling so it wasn't done until the next week which is I think  July the eleventh or twelfth ,control,46.42857142857143,6
uh we  I went into the hospital uh at uh seven in the morning  six thirty or seven in the morning ,control,39.130434782608695,4
uh they prepped me ,control,50.0,1
and I went into the operating room about eight ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and uh woke up about eleven eleven fifteen uh with two new knees ,control,15.384615384615383,3
uh they told me to go ahead and use the  uh the uh morphine drip for pain ,control,27.77777777777778,6
and so that's what I did ,control,57.14285714285714,2
I used the morphine drip for pain ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and uh uh unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them I have a sensitivity to morphine ,control,37.5,4
and I  uh as I'm using this little button that you push every ten minutes ,control,47.05882352941176,5
I  uh I begin to see rats coming out_of of the wall ,control,30.76923076923077,6
uh I got real oozy ,control,20.0,2
uh and I passed out ,control,40.0,1

 Bill Bill Bill ,control,0.0,0
 wake up wake up wake up ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again ,control,26.666666666666668,4
and uh they took me to the emergency room ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I  hadta stay in the emergency room for a little while or wherever they take you ,control,44.44444444444444,0
uh laughs you_know it was not in the recovery ,control,44.44444444444444,4
they run me down the hallway ,control,66.66666666666666,3
uh uh they uh were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that laughs sighs ,control,40.0,4
so  uh uh the next day I woke up ,control,40.0,2
and I was fine ,control,50.0,1
and uh they got me walking around ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees ,control,57.14285714285714,5
I did have some pain pills but it wasn't morphine ,control,45.45454545454545,2
and uh uh my knees  uh oh,control,12.5,0
ten days after I  I had my knees replaced I could walk ,control,46.15384615384615,3
do whatever I wanted to do ,control,33.33333333333333,3
uh I drove two weeks afterwards ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and uh I've had very very little problem with my knees since then ,control,35.714285714285715,3
except they don't have a_lot_of strength ,control,57.14285714285714,1
uh in getting up out_of this low chair that I'm sitting in right now I'm gonna have a hassle ,control,45.45454545454545,7
but uh uh it's  uh uh my knee replacement wa was very successful ,control,26.666666666666668,3

and uh when we got there she was unable to move her right side and unable ta ,control,29.411764705882355,4
uh all she could say was ,control,66.66666666666666,3
 Bill ,control,0.0,0
 Bill Bill Bill ,control,0.0,0
 Bill Bill ,control,0.0,0
uh I found out later that she thought she was carrying on a regular conversation with me ,control,58.82352941176471,6
and uh she thought she was saying all the words that she should have said ,control,60.0,4
but all  cu all she could say was ,control,55.55555555555556,4
 Bill ,control,0.0,0
uh after about a week of that I told her that we were gonna hafta change the word that she knew ,control,54.54545454545454,5
so  uh we sit down ,control,50.0,1
and I says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 okay  don't say Bill anymore ,control,12.5,2
 say bye ,control,0.0,1
so  Elaine began to say ,control,16.666666666666664,2
 bye ,control,0.0,0
then she'd say ,control,50.0,1
 bye bye  bye bye  bye bye  bye bye ,control,0.0,0
and uh that's what she still kind_of says sometimes when she gets uh flustrated ,control,46.66666666666666,2
but normally that's gone now ,control,33.33333333333333,1
she doesn't use that anymore ,control,50.0,1
she still has aphasia ,control,25.0,1
she still goes to the speech therapy ,control,42.85714285714285,3
she still cannot speak ,control,40.0,1
uh this is in two thousand and nine ,control,37.5,3
so  we've lived with this for uh fifteen years now ,control,50.0,3
and uh uh we get along ,control,16.666666666666664,1
uh I kind_of know what she's gonna say ,control,40.0,3
you_know  after you've been together long enough well  you kind_of figure out what the other one's wanting to talk about ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and she's very good at using alternate communication skills ,control,30.0,4
uh spelling words ,control,0.0,1
uh uh inflections on the few words that she can say ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and uh doing things that uh allow you to figure out what she's trying to say ,control,35.294117647058826,6
uh she still has trouble  just saying the most simple words ,control,16.666666666666664,4
this morning when we got up why uh we were in the bathroom ,control,69.23076923076923,5
and she was trying to tell me I always put a rubberband around the bottom of the toothpaste ,control,50.0,7
and we had a new coo toothpaste  thing ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and it needed a rubberband at the bottom of it ,control,60.0,4
because it had  we hadn't started rolling it up yet ,control,50.0,2
and it took her  two minutes ,control,28.57142857142857,2
when I get the newspaper in the morning I take a rubberband and put it on the handle of my chair ,control,57.14285714285714,6
and so it took her two minutes to tell me to go in and get a rubberband off my chair and put it on the toothpaste ,control,34.61538461538461,7
I had a rough time figuring out what she was trying to tell me  this morning to get ,control,42.10526315789473,6
you_know  she'd started spelling chair ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 chak ,control,0.0,0
and then she'd say ,control,40.0,1
 cheese ,control,0.0,1
and then she'd  you_know everything that had chq in it was the words that she used ,control,55.55555555555556,4
she'd never use chair ,control,40.0,1
and once she did get out chair I didn't know what the heck she was talking about ,control,61.11111111111112,3
and so uh then we finally understood I  s then she picked up the  the toothpaste ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and uh bent it over ,control,40.0,1
and says ,control,0.0,1
 chair ,control,0.0,1
and then I knew that she wanted me to go get a rubberband off the chair ,control,43.75,6
and put it on the toothpaste ,control,50.0,3
so  we still have trouble ,control,33.33333333333333,1
uh but uh normally we get along pretty good ,control,22.22222222222222,2
clears_throat I did tell her not ta ,control,57.14285714285714,1
we're not a depressed family ,control,50.0,2
so  uh we don't get depressed ,control,37.5,2
uh one of the things  she was starting to get depressed saying she was gonna die ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and I says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
