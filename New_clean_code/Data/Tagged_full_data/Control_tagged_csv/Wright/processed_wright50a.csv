uh well  it's birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old ,control,33.33333333333333,7
and uh maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite out_of cake which he obviously knew he wasn't sposta do because he's hiding under the couch ,control,44.44444444444444,7
and the boy's crying ,control,20.0,2
and the mother is waving the uh broom threateningly ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the guests are looking a_little startled ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and that's the end of that ,control,71.42857142857143,3
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich ,control,16.666666666666664,2
get  hafta get two pieces of bread ,control,12.5,4
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top ,control,40.0,3
and put them together ,control,25.0,1
well  this is fairly minor but many years ago I was  uh when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was uh w cleaning a glass ,control,39.39393939393939,7
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand ,control,53.84615384615385,4
and uh it  it started to bleed all over the place ,control,33.33333333333333,4
but I was also pregnant at the time ,control,50.0,3
and I don't know if that had something to do with it ,control,53.84615384615385,5
but I had this weirdest feeling ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and my husband came in and I just passed out ,control,40.0,2
it was the first and last and only time I've ever done that ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I guess the most  the time  the  ti most of the instances I've had with people that have trouble communicating it's usually more of a language barrier ,control,43.75,14
uh I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man um who had a stutter ,control,42.10526315789473,5
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too ,control,40.0,2
but you_know I found it so hard to  to talk to him that uh I tended to avoid him in a way ,control,43.47826086956522,5
uh so  I can't say that I really  other_than saying hi Julio how are you I never really went much beyond that ,control,40.0,4
and plus at the time I couldn't excuse me  I couldn't hear well ,control,43.75,4
so  I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway ,control,36.36363636363637,4
so ,control,0.0,0
that's about it ,control,100.0,2
one time I was just m moseying down the street in a car and uh was preparing to turn left ,control,40.0,3
and I thought I had my signal on ,control,50.0,3
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough ,control,58.82352941176471,4
but then somebody else who I don't even know where he came from I think he was walking out_of the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done ,control,54.054054054054056,3
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something ,control,50.0,5
laughs thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didn't  you_know wasn't upset ,control,38.88888888888889,5
he just said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  I ran into you ,control,42.85714285714285,0
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness ,control,36.36363636363637,3
oh apparently uh this girl has fallen into some water that's  maybe there's a flood or a storm ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and a man uh is trying to rescue her ,control,33.33333333333333,2
apparently she's been holding onto a tree branch ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and he's trying to get a hold of her ,control,50.0,4
but she won't let go of the tree branch probably ,control,36.36363636363637,4
about all I can say ,control,80.0,3
well  hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window ,control,40.0,0
it's really improbable ,control,50.0,2
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp ,control,38.46153846153847,4
um but uh obviously the boy has ran away because the man can't see him when he goes in at the window ,control,43.47826086956522,5
this is kind_of improbable too ,control,40.0,2
the mother wants to give the  the boy an  an umbrella ,control,38.46153846153847,5
he doesn't want it ,control,60.0,1
so  he goes off and gets wet ,control,37.5,2
um this is the improbable part ,control,50.0,2
he doesn't like getting wet ,control,33.33333333333333,2
he runs back to his mom who's mad ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and he's wet so he takes the umbrella ,control,44.44444444444444,3
now my son would love getting wet ,control,28.57142857142857,2
um laughs looking at that I can hear the music laughs from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old ,control,45.16129032258064,9
um Cinderella uh is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother ,control,35.714285714285715,4
uh wicked and stepmother always go together ,control,0.0,2
she has two ugly  sist two ug ugly stepsisters ,control,10.0,4
I can't remember their names ,control,50.0,2
one of them is Drizella or something equally ugly ,control,44.44444444444444,4
um anyway uh Cinderella is forced  forced to work like a drudge for the  the rest of the family who are cruel to her ,control,46.15384615384615,14
um but an edict comes from the uh ,control,37.5,3
I think I'm spinning tales here ,control,42.85714285714285,2
an edict comes from the prince that they're going to have a ball ,control,50.0,4
and every maiden is uh eligible to go to the ball ,control,36.36363636363637,5
uh but Cinderella's mother  stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready ,control,31.428571428571427,12
uh and at last the girls drive away uh in their carriage and Cinderella's left behind um crying in the cinders ,control,27.27272727272727,4
um then the little mice come to her aid and start uh ,control,25.0,3
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working ,control,64.28571428571429,3
um and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because uh yeah they didn't want her to go ,control,38.095238095238095,4
so  then the fairy godmother enters the picture ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um this is not in sequence at all ,control,37.5,2
laughs um and of_course she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the  the pumpkin carriage ,control,26.08695652173913,5
laughs oh yeah ,control,0.0,0
and she goes off to the ball where of_course she is the bell of the ball meets the prince ,control,57.89473684210527,5
the prince falls in love with her on sight ,control,55.55555555555556,2
but at twelve o'clock she hasta run off ,control,37.5,3
she leaves her slipper ,control,50.0,2
um I guess that story goes all the way to the end ,control,50.0,4
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the  the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper ,control,45.83333333333333,9
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they don't fit ,control,21.428571428571427,2
so  he find  m,control,33.33333333333333,1
here's one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree ,control,47.05882352941176,7
and then this uh the  the father has climbed up to rescue the cat ,control,40.0,0
and now he needs to be rescued ,control,28.57142857142857,2
for some reason  the ladder is on the ground ,control,60.0,3
and nobody has put it up there ,control,42.85714285714285,2
so  here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad ,control,26.666666666666668,4
that's all ,control,100.0,1
