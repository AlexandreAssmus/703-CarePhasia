and that shrugs was swine flu ,control,33.33333333333333,2
so  it wasn't as traumatic as I thought it would be ,control,61.53846153846154,4
but still felt like crap shrugs ,control,16.666666666666664,3
frightened or scared ,control,0.0,1
 oh  hand,control,0.0,0
and this is why probably I pass out when I have blood tests ,control,53.84615384615385,4
inhales when I was five ,control,60.0,2
and that was actually the second from last time was in the hospital ,control,53.84615384615385,5
I was six was the last time I was in the hospital ,control,66.66666666666666,6

and then she said ,control,25.0,1
 we're gonna poke your finger ,control,37.5,3
 and take a blood test ,control,16.666666666666664,0
and  she reached around her neck ges,control,37.5,3
ges,control,0.0,0
and attached to the cross was a needle ,control,50.0,4
and she rubbed it with alcohol ges,control,42.85714285714285,3
and jabbed ges,control,0.0,1
and then took ges,control,0.0,1
and I just thought  you_know thinking back ,control,12.5,2
that is the most bizarre thing that can ever happen ,control,50.0,3
I_mean it can turn you off to finger,control,50.0,2
inhales finger,control,0.0,1
so  there's my fear story ,control,42.85714285714285,2
since that day I do not do blood tests ,control,44.44444444444444,3
I haven't had a blood test since  I think  I was six head,control,43.75,4
 yup my mom ,control,25.0,1
she had um CBGD  I think it is ,control,55.55555555555556,3
inhales well  it was progressive ,control,33.33333333333333,3
she started out  she said she noticed it when she was like in her mid forties ,control,58.82352941176471,5
she was like an office manager secretary and ,control,50.0,4
but you_know whatever hand,control,25.0,2
she just kind_of got on with it ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and over  th ta over time she just kind_of talked a little bit slower ,control,26.666666666666668,4
and would use you_know shorter sentences ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and um course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic ges,control,33.33333333333333,4
so  hand,control,33.33333333333333,1
 but eventually you_know it was,control,33.33333333333333,0
they didn't really diagnosis it for awhile ,control,50.0,1
and then she went to University_of_Michigan where they have this inhales um neurology or aphasia center ,control,31.25,7
some type of where they do a_lot_of research in it ,control,70.0,4
thing is she didn't like the doctor ,control,50.0,3
and she told him to  fuck off hand,control,44.44444444444444,3
inhales so  um didn't really get um the whole research thing on it ,control,33.33333333333333,3
but over time um  she you_know just got less and less communicative ,control,15.384615384615383,3
inhales uh they thought she was having mini strokes for awhile ,control,36.36363636363637,3
 a,control,50.0,0
it was actually the evening of her sister's funeral ,control,50.0,5
they went out to dinner ,control,60.0,2
inhales and she passed out ,control,40.0,2
and they rushed her to the hospital ,control,57.14285714285714,3
inhales and um  the doctor ,control,16.666666666666664,2
well  the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital ,control,50.0,0
inhales after she woke up  that evening she was talking perfectly normal ,control,46.15384615384615,2
 I_mean it  it you_know had gone away ges,control,30.0,3
she could full sentences and  as if  if she'd  nothing happened ges,control,50.0,4
like take ges,control,0.0,1
inhales she went to bed that night ,control,42.85714285714285,2
she woke up ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and then she was back to where she was  before ges it happened ,control,57.14285714285714,5
so  noone could figure that one out ,control,50.0,2
but meanwhile the doctor pulled her driver's license because she passed out ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and you_know considered a seizure or something ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and that really pissed her off ,control,50.0,1
then she took her  my dad hadta take away the keys ,control,33.33333333333333,3
she actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up ,control,53.333333333333336,4
and we actually kept her car  until she died ,control,40.0,2
she  we couldn't sell her car because you_know ,control,50.0,0
 when you get better Mom you can have your car back ,control,41.66666666666667,3
but eventually she ended up losing muscle control ,control,25.0,3
and you_know she was we working with a walker ,control,55.55555555555556,3
inhales and then within a year after that she was in a wheelchair ,control,61.53846153846154,5
she was in the nursing home for about the last  year and a half ,control,46.66666666666666,4
and when she went in the nursing home she could still speak three or four  sentence or  three or four word sentences ,control,25.0,5
and towards the end she could get you_know one or two words out ,control,30.76923076923077,3
but the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time ,control,50.0,5
and um then eventually she died shrugs ,control,14.285714285714285,1
she just decided she was not gonna eat ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and she didn't eat ,control,40.0,1
and the last  that was it ,control,57.14285714285714,0
nyup no  it's  it's  you_know kind_of brought the whole family together ,control,37.5,4
I_mean there's funny stories about it ,control,42.85714285714285,3
I knew th she had decided not to eat ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and you_know like one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge massive breakfast because she useta love to eat ,control,34.78260869565217,4
and you_know we hadta tell her ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 nope  Jean's decided she's not eating today shrugs ,control,16.666666666666664,3
so  I_mean it was all kinds of stories about it ,control,54.54545454545454,5
but shrugs  so that's my story about that ,control,60.0,4
lib Cinderella ,control,0.0,1

and they saw a wash ,control,40.0,2
and they decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it ,control,33.33333333333333,4
because they're really cool ,control,60.0,2
and they can do these things ,control,50.0,2
and of_course the four wheel drive got run over ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and they uh got washed off the truck and into the flood ,control,50.0,4
and fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck ,control,44.44444444444444,5
so  they grab that on ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and it ooks ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and she is um  holding on to him ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and hopefully the police are gonna come and rescue them ,control,27.27272727272727,3
