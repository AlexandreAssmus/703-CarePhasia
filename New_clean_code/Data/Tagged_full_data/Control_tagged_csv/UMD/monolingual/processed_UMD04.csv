um and one day they  let her come to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing this lavish party for his son and is going to be looking for a bride ,control,41.66666666666667,8
and the stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince will want to marry one of her three daughters ,control,42.85714285714285,7

and while um Cinderella's at home  cleaning up her fairy godmother comes and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball ,control,39.285714285714285,7
and she waves her magic wand ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and um the pumpkin turns into a stage coach ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown ,control,30.0,3
and um she's whisked away to this lavish party ,control,40.0,3
and  um and she's uh also given these glass slippers to wear ,control,21.428571428571427,2
and  um and she   of_course  she comes into this party ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and nobody recognizes that it's her  including her stepmother and her stepsisters ,control,50.0,6
um and so she's this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and of_course the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the  stepsisters ,control,35.714285714285715,4
he dances with her ,control,75.0,2
and they immediately fall in love ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and she  um and they have a  a dance ,control,36.36363636363637,0
and  in the middle of this dance she remembers her  god her fairy godmother's instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken ,control,42.42424242424242,8
and so she realizes that it's almost midnight ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and she runs from the palace ,control,50.0,3
and in doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and um she goes  she gets home just in time ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and um  you_know she  when the  when the stepmother and the stepsisters come home she you_know is  is home in her tattered clothes again ,control,39.285714285714285,7
and she's cleaning ,control,50.0,1
and she asks them how the party went ,control,50.0,3
and they  they're not happy because the prince didn't notice them of_course ,control,46.66666666666666,0
um but then the prince  he wants to find this mysterious girl ,control,23.07692307692308,3
and the only way that he has to find her is the glass slipper that he found ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and  but he decides he's going to go to every house  to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on ,control,41.37931034482759,0
and that will be the way he will identify this girl ,control,63.63636363636363,4
and so he eventually arrives at the stepmother's house ,control,30.0,4
and of_course the three girls run right over because they  they know that they're gonna one  that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly ,control,41.935483870967744,6
and of_course none of them do because their feet are too big ,control,41.66666666666667,3
and they  the stepmother figures out that the  the shoe belongs to Cinderella ,control,46.66666666666666,0
and she tries to hide Cinderella ,control,16.666666666666664,2
but the  I think it was the fairy godmother who  who comes along and rescues Cinderella ,control,38.88888888888889,5
or maybe it was the mice ,control,50.0,2
anyway they   they free Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the prince sees her and has her put on the shoe ,control,41.66666666666667,5
