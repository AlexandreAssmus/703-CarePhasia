and he sees a ball coming ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and he went to the window to find out who did this because he was gonna go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games ,control,47.22222222222222,10
oh  okay  just the beginning  middle  and an end ,control,15.384615384615383,3
okay  so  then I hafta look at it so you don't hafta hear all my thoughts ,control,42.10526315789473,3
um there's a mother getting ready to send her child off to school ,control,35.714285714285715,7
she tried to urge him to take an umbrella ,control,33.33333333333333,4
obviously she's heard the weather report ,control,42.85714285714285,2
he went and he didn't listen to his mother ,control,50.0,4
so  he went out and got wet ,control,37.5,2
when he came back he looked very sad ,control,37.5,2
and his mother looked very annoyed ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and the next time he took an umbrella ,control,37.5,2
there's a whole lot going on here ,control,37.5,3
um well  okay ,control,0.0,0
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and he  and he  he's up on a tree for some reason ,control,53.333333333333336,0

the dog is barking because everything's out_of sorts for him ,control,63.63636363636363,4
and so the fire engine comes with a ladder  ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them ,control,34.48275862068966,9

the sisters don't want her to go ,control,37.5,2
isn't that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and then the xxx fairy godmother helps her go ,control,22.22222222222222,2
she captures the eye of the prince charming ,control,50.0,4
she hasta leave before midnight ,control,40.0,2

and her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin ,control,33.33333333333333,4
the wicked godmother locks her in ,control,50.0,2
but then they bring the key ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they take the key to the cellar ,control,50.0,3
they try every maiden in the um town whatever they call those old things parish to see who the shoe belongs to ,control,45.45454545454545,6
and it belongs to Cinderella ,control,40.0,2
and she marries the prince and gets  prince and gets ,control,18.181818181818183,2
lives happily ever after ,control,25.0,2
Cinderella is this  um she's living with her wicked  the wicked stepmother ,control,46.66666666666666,5

I don't know where her father is ,control,62.5,3
um and the stepmother has these two um not attractive daughters ,control,18.181818181818183,2
and Cinderella  she's very pretty but she's left in tatters and rags ,control,33.33333333333333,2
her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the  you_know the cinders from the whatevern ,control,45.0,6
and the fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor ,control,25.0,2
and so one day there was going to be a ball ,control,27.27272727272727,3

and he makes this announcement ,control,40.0,2
and she wants to go as_well_as his daughters  her daughters ,control,27.27272727272727,4
um but they're figuring whom you you_know ,control,50.0,1

get me a pumpkin and some rats whatever ,control,50.0,3
and the pumpkin will be your coach ,control,57.14285714285714,2

she gets her a great dress or something to wear ,control,40.0,3
her hair  they don't even talk about all that ,control,54.54545454545454,3

and um in running she drops one of her slippers ,control,40.0,4

the rats t turn  the coachmen turn into rats and whatever ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  the  the king  the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to ,control,44.0,0
he's gonna go to every house and um see if the shoe fits ,control,40.0,5
and the fairy godmother is like  she's trying to get her daughters now I remember this  their big feet into the shoes ,control,44.0,5

and he whisks her off ,control,60.0,1
and they get married ,control,50.0,1
and they live happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
that's a long story ,control,60.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
how I would make it ,control,80.0,1
from the word goq ,control,50.0,3
go to the cabinet and take down a jar of peanut butter ,control,41.66666666666667,5
I'd probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something ,control,57.14285714285714,4
so  I'd go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out ,control,53.84615384615385,3
and go to the refrigerator where I also keep my bread ,control,45.45454545454545,5
take out two slices of bread ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I'd put them  open them there ,control,50.0,2
I would take the peanut butter first ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and smear it on the  on one side of the bread ,control,50.0,5
pretty thick though ,control,0.0,1
I like a_lot_of food ,control,50.0,2
then I'd take the jelly and put that on  over top of the peanut butter  still on the same side ,control,43.47826086956522,7
and I would take the other side and put it down ,control,45.45454545454545,2
and then I would take it and cut it in half ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and then I would start eating it ,control,42.85714285714285,2
