and he kicks it ,control,50.0,1
and it goes through the window of the house  probably his own house ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and it breaks the window knocks over a lamp and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father ,control,50.0,10
who then picks up the ball stares out the window and probably swears at the  at the little boy ,control,45.0,4

and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella ,control,40.0,3
and he's saying ,control,50.0,1

and it starts raining on him ,control,50.0,3
and he runs home ,control,25.0,1
and he's soaking wet ,control,40.0,1

um Cinderella's father married um for the second time when um Cinderella's mother had died ,control,23.52941176470588,6
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters ,control,27.27272727272727,5
and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her um clean the fireplaces  hence the name Cinderella ,control,43.75,10
and do other menial work ,control,0.0,2
 um at some point the prince of the  whatever  principality it was um was in need of a wife ,control,54.54545454545454,7
said his father and the I don't know   minister of whatever  marriages ,control,40.0,4
so  they cooked up a scheme to have a ball ,control,54.54545454545454,4
and um they sent out invitations to um all the eligible young women  in the principality ,control,41.17647058823529,7
Cinderella got one but she of_course could not  did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation ,control,36.0,1
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with um white horses and a footman and so_forth ,control,27.58620689655172,8
so  she was able to go to the ball ,control,50.0,5
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight ,control,60.0,3
she went to the ball ,control,60.0,3
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love ,control,36.36363636363637,3
midnight came ,control,0.0,1
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be out_of there ,control,31.25,5
so  she hurried away ,control,40.0,1
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her ,control,52.38095238095239,6
um she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth ,control,37.03703703703704,9
but she managed to get home anyway ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and um later  the  um the prince was very depressed ,control,25.0,0
he had fallen in love with this woman ,control,62.5,5
and she had disappeared ,control,50.0,1
all he had left was a glass slipper ,control,62.5,3
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else ,control,36.36363636363637,6
so  the  his father  who I guess was the king  and the minister of marriages um went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on ,control,43.90243902439025,0
and of_course it would not fit anyone at all  including the two unpleasant stepsisters ,control,40.0,5
even_though I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit  try to fit in ,control,31.818181818181817,4
but it still didn't work ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and it got blood all over the place ,control,37.5,3
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper ,control,45.0,8
it was Cinderella ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and of_course she was just um um a sladeyn ,control,33.33333333333333,2
but he insisted that she try it on ,control,62.5,2
and sure enough it fit ,control,20.0,2
so  he had found his bride ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and there was great celebration throughout the land ,control,37.5,3
and they got married and lived happily ever after ,control,22.22222222222222,3
how I would make a peanut butter and je ,control,44.44444444444444,2
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it ,control,66.66666666666666,4
but I  you would  I would take two pieces of bread ,control,46.15384615384615,3
and I'd put peanut butter on one using a knife ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread ,control,42.85714285714285,6
and then I'd put the two together ,control,37.5,2
and I would probably slice it ,control,50.0,1
because it would be for a kid I'd probably slice it in quarters ,control,71.42857142857143,4
