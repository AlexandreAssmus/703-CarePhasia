did you want something to  raise it up ,control,66.66666666666666,4
oh  I think I'm a very good English speaker ,control,36.36363636363637,4
everybody tells me I'm very articulate ,control,57.14285714285714,3
just like a smattering of Spanish  just really a few words ,control,33.33333333333333,5
no ,control,0.0,0
uh well  I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from New_Mexico to the east coast ,control,48.0,6
it was such an immense change culturally ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and we  also we lived in a very uh rural area in New_Mexico up in the mountains ,control,44.44444444444444,4
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all ,control,47.61904761904761,8
so  when we came here it was absolutely shocking ,control,50.0,0
I_mean  just the fact that they had sidewalks alone ,control,40.0,0
they just amazed us ,control,50.0,1
and the street lamps and everything ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money ,control,41.37931034482759,10
it's so much richer ,control,40.0,3
and they can afford to do all of that you_know ,control,50.0,4
we had a_lot_of unpaved roads out there ,control,28.57142857142857,2
of_course there's  the  there's a_lot um uh sparser population ,control,23.07692307692308,5
so  a_lot_of times they're not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place ,control,33.33333333333333,5
but here it was just amazing to us  all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city ,control,39.130434782608695,5
it was just  indescribable the impact that it had on us ,control,58.333333333333336,4
I think it took us years to really kind_of overcome the culture shock ,control,30.76923076923077,4
so  I  I_mean I remember that period of my life all the time ,control,53.333333333333336,4
what  just the immense change that we underwent ,control,44.44444444444444,0
in fact we had um uh Spanish accents ,control,25.0,2
very heavy ,control,0.0,1
my parents always did their whole lives ,control,28.57142857142857,2
but we had such a terrible time at school  people teasing us and everything ,control,40.0,4
and we really tried hard to emulate um English speakers especially ,control,9.090909090909092,3
I used to listen to David_Niven for some reason ,control,44.44444444444444,4
I was really crazy about him ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and I wanted to sound like him ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  you_know and it really was a  it really  it had a huge impact on us  each in their own way ,control,48.0,4
okay ,control,0.0,0
alright ,control,0.0,0
um this little boy Tommy found this ball ,control,25.0,2
oh yeah ,control,0.0,1
found a soccer ball and decided to try his luck at kicking it around ,control,35.714285714285715,5
so  he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick ,control,40.0,4
and sure enough it went through the  his neighbor's window ,control,33.33333333333333,4
his neighbor was watching television ,control,40.0,2
and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window  knocks over his lamp ,control,33.33333333333333,4
he looks out the window but there's nobody there ,control,50.0,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
there's Tommy again ,control,25.0,1
his mother s that morning knew that it was gonna rain ,control,41.66666666666667,3
she'd been listening to the weather channel ,control,62.5,3
she told him to take his umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,3
no  he's positive that there's not gonna be any problem ,control,50.0,5
also he doesn't wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella ,control,50.0,6
and he says goodbye to his mother ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and he'll be fine ,control,60.0,1
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain ,control,25.0,4
so  he runs back ,control,40.0,1
his mother's quite annoyed with him because she'd argued with him ,control,61.53846153846154,3
and he said it was not gonna rain ,control,33.33333333333333,3
he feels bad ,control,33.33333333333333,1
finally takes the umbrella and goes to school ,control,25.0,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
Susan was out playing with her dog ,control,42.85714285714285,4
and uh the dog chased a  a cat up into the tree ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and  oh  I guess it was actually her  cat ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  she became quite upset about it ,control,50.0,3
and her neighbor came out and said ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 well  that's okay ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 don't worry about it ,control,50.0,2
 I have a ladder ,control,40.0,2
 and I'll get up there and get your cat ,control,27.27272727272727,3
so  he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb ,control,56.25,4
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and then he couldn't get down ,control,42.85714285714285,1
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree ,control,50.0,4
so  somebody hadta call the fire department ,control,37.5,2
and they came out and rescued the both of them ,control,60.0,4
oh yeah ,control,0.0,1
uh yeah ,control,0.0,1
I don't remember these animals ,control,50.0,2
I forgot what an involved story it is ,control,62.5,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
um Cinderella uh lived with her father and her mother in this little village ,control,35.714285714285715,4
uh when she was very young her mother passed away ,control,50.0,3
it was just her and her father ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry ,control,50.0,3
he met somebody there in their village ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and he remarried ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and uh then sadly he passed away very shortly after that ,control,36.36363636363637,3
so  she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters ,control,50.0,4
and it  they turned out that the stepmother was not very nicely  she was not very nice to Cinderella ,control,42.85714285714285,5
so  uh she made Cinderella into kind_of a little maid who hadta sweep out the ,control,43.75,4
sorry ,control,0.0,0
yeah ,control,0.0,0
it's another one of these turtlenecks ,control,71.42857142857143,4
these are my favorite things ,control,60.0,2
uh so  um they turned her into a little maid ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her sisters  her stepsisters and her stepmother ,control,33.33333333333333,6
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant ,control,36.36363636363637,3
she was very unhappy ,control,50.0,2
but she didn't really know what else to do ,control,30.0,3
there was nothing else she could do ,control,57.14285714285714,3
then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son  the prince  who was ,control,44.44444444444444,11
uh they were trying to find a suitable bride for him ,control,45.45454545454545,4
so  they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoi_polloi of the area ,control,56.25,7
so  the sisters decided they'd go ,control,50.0,2
and  uh  at first Cinderella thought that she might go ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and they laughed at her ,control,60.0,2
told her she didn't have anything to wear ,control,44.44444444444444,4
she was not pretty ,control,50.0,1
so they went to the ball ,control,50.0,3
she was very sad sitting among the cinders ,control,50.0,4
and her um fairy godmother shows up  appears and tells her she'll get it all set for the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,6
so  she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses ,control,40.0,5
and I forget what she made her dress out_of ,control,44.44444444444444,3
so  she goes to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers ,control,37.5,2
so  she goes to the ball ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and she meets the prince ,control,40.0,2
the prince falls madly in love with her because she's the most beautiful girl there ,control,50.0,4
but the  fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was ,control,55.55555555555556,5
so  she saw  midnight approaching ,control,28.57142857142857,3
so  she hadta leave suddenly the prince ,control,37.5,2
you_know  she hadta run away from him and hide  run away  jump in her carriage ,control,27.77777777777778,5
and just as she got back she jumped out_of the carriage ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and everything turned back to what it was before ,control,66.66666666666666,4
so  she real thought ,control,40.0,1
 well  that's gonna be my one night of happiness ,control,38.46153846153847,4
 but I'll always remember it ,control,42.85714285714285,1
but the  pri she had left behind  the way she was running out_of the castle she had left behind her glass slipper ,control,54.16666666666666,5
the prince had run  been running around trying to find her ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper ,control,50.0,3
so  he told  um his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper ,control,40.0,6
so  they went around to all the  villages ,control,50.0,3
and they  they had them try  had the women who might possibly be  that  uh Cinderella try on the glass slipper ,control,40.0,7
so  they got to the house of Cinderella ,control,55.55555555555556,4
and they asked her ,control,50.0,1
 how many girls do you have ,control,42.85714285714285,3
 no  I only have two ,control,28.57142857142857,3
because they had found out what was going on ,control,77.77777777777779,2
they were having them try on this glass slipper ,control,55.55555555555556,4
so  she hid Cinderella  forced Cinderella to stay inside her room ,control,30.76923076923077,5
and she  they tried the slipper on to the   um  uh the stepdaughters ,control,43.75,3
and the first one was   uh  was  the heel was too big ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  the mother said ,control,40.0,2
 no  no  that  it'll fit ,control,50.0,4
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel ,control,41.66666666666667,5
but it still didn't fit ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and they tried on the  for the second woman ,control,50.0,3
and  but her toe is too big ,control,25.0,2
and the mother says ,control,25.0,2
 no  no  it fits ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and she cut off her toe in secret ,control,50.0,2
but it still didn't fit ,control,33.33333333333333,1
so  they said ,control,50.0,2
 no  this isn't her  these aren't their shoes ,control,53.84615384615385,3
so  then they were leaving ,control,50.0,1
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there ,control,61.53846153846154,5
I don't remember exactly  who  what clued them into that ,control,53.84615384615385,5
so  they insisted on  looking around ,control,37.5,3
and they found Cinderella ,control,25.0,1
and sure enough they tried her  the shoe on her ,control,45.45454545454545,2
and it fit ,control,33.33333333333333,1
so they took her back to the castle ,control,50.0,4
she married the prince ,control,50.0,2
and she was very forgiving ,control,40.0,2
she brought her sisters to live with them ,control,50.0,3
um well  when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I toast the bread ,control,31.25,3
and then I let it cool off ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and then on one side I smear the peanut  peanut butter ,control,25.0,3
then on the other side I smear the um jelly ,control,40.0,3
and then I put them together ,control,33.33333333333333,1
