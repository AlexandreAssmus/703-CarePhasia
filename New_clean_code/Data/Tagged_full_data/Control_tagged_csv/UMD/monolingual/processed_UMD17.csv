how do I what ,control,75.0,1
very well ,control,0.0,1
excellent ,control,0.0,0
well  I have noone to talk Yiddish to so I don't know whether I should include that ,control,42.10526315789473,3
well  I  I can speak some Yiddish ,control,44.44444444444444,4
but there's nobody to converse with so I don't know whether that would qualify ,control,50.0,3
no ,control,0.0,0
would you consider Alzheimer's ,control,40.0,2
yes  my husband ,control,25.0,2
what ,control,100.0,0
well  it started about six years before he passed away ,control,36.36363636363637,4
I noticed that he was very forgetful ,control,57.14285714285714,3
he couldn't remember what building we lived in and other things ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and even driving  his driving was erratic ,control,25.0,2
and um I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and  uh and canasta that he no longer wanted to play ,control,29.629629629629623,6
he didn't want to  we used to square dance quite a bit ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and then he decided ,control,25.0,1
he never gave me a reason ,control,50.0,2
and at first I didn't quite understand ,control,37.5,2
and um he dropped out of a_lot_of the things ,control,44.44444444444444,3
he was a volunteer at the Kennedy_Center ,control,71.42857142857143,4
and he loved it there and they loved him ,control,44.44444444444444,2
and the next thing I know he wasn't uh going anymore ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I tried to figure out why ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  they want me to use a different technique when I write up a sale ,control,41.17647058823529,4
write it so_that he would write it  write the sales for  by hand ,control,53.333333333333336,5
and then they put it in the computer ,control,50.0,3
so  the final straw came when uh  I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him ,control,45.0,4
and uh that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts ,control,43.75,5
and he got very confused with the different women ,control,33.33333333333333,4
they all happened to be black ,control,50.0,2
and so he mixed them up ,control,50.0,1
and when one wanted to feed him he'd push her hand away ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldn't handle it and I couldn't handle it ,control,57.14285714285714,5
and that's when he went into a nursing home ,control,60.0,4
and he remained there ,control,25.0,1
and he deteriorated quite a bit ,control,50.0,2
he forgot how to walk ,control,40.0,2
he forgot how to teach  to um feed himself ,control,30.0,3
uh he didn't remember  whether  where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands ,control,47.61904761904761,7
and so um they took good care of him ,control,33.33333333333333,3
he was always neatly dressed and clean  out_of bed  until he reached the point where he stopped eating ,control,35.0,4
and he eventually passed away peacefully ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I've had so many happy memories  I don't even know where to start first ,control,29.411764705882355,3
just one ,control,0.0,1
um I can't think of anything outstanding ,control,50.0,3
I guess the day I got married ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh when my children were born ,control,50.0,2
um I'm trying to think of ,control,42.85714285714285,2
one  one really stands out ,control,16.666666666666664,2
we were fortunate enough to have my parents babysit for the children so we could get away ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and we went to Jamaica for a week ,control,50.0,3
and that was one of the most wonderful enjoyable vacations we ever had ,control,38.46153846153847,5
the weather was fine ,control,50.0,2
the food was great ,control,50.0,2
the  the entertainment ,control,50.0,0
the  just being together and um ,control,28.57142857142857,2
from all  we've been on many vacations but that one really stands out ,control,53.333333333333336,3
the scenery  the beach in front of you and um ,control,45.45454545454545,0
it was so enjoyable ,control,50.0,2
that was the only time that I remember crying the night before we hadta go home because I said ,control,52.63157894736842,6
 I don't want to leave this place ,control,33.33333333333333,3
so  I guess that's the one ,control,62.5,0
 have you been  have you been ,control,75.0,2
well  it's one thing to go with friends ,control,30.0,4
but it's another thing to go with a husband ,control,50.0,5
that's  that's what was perfect ,control,75.0,3
this one here ,control,33.33333333333333,1
is this supposed to be one story ,control,42.85714285714285,3
or is each picture supposed to be a story ,control,44.44444444444444,3
well  uh little Johnny is outside playing ,control,12.5,2
kicking a ball ,control,33.33333333333333,2
seems to be having a good time ,control,28.57142857142857,3
and lo_and_behold the ball goes through a window and it breaks ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and it goes through the window  practically onto the lap of this man who's ,control,56.25,7
is that a baby there ,control,60.0,2
 that's not ,control,50.0,1
it knocks over a lamp ,control,60.0,3
is that it ,control,100.0,1
or is it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
I see two feet here ,control,20.0,2
is there ,control,100.0,1
 it  it came through the window ,control,50.0,3
and he's sitting here ,control,40.0,1
now this is his hand ,control,60.0,2
but that looks like another leg here ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and that also looks either like a lamb ,control,37.5,3
xxx a chair ,control,33.33333333333333,1
what is this round thing over here ,control,42.85714285714285,2
is that a lamp shade ,control,60.0,2
and the man is quite surprised ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he is wondering  could his son have done that ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and he decides to go to the window and check ,control,30.0,4
and there's nobody there ,control,40.0,1
so  he doesn't know who to blame for this ,control,54.54545454545454,3
and I don't know ,control,40.0,1
xxx ,control,0.0,0
well  this mother who tells her son that he needs to take an umbrella because you are going to school and you'll get wet ,control,46.15384615384615,1
and he said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 no  it's not going to rain ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and uh he insists upon going without the umbrella ,control,44.44444444444444,5
and lo_and_behold as he's walking it starts to rain ,control,40.0,3
and his shoes get wet in the puddle ,control,37.5,4
his head is wet ,control,50.0,2
he comes home drenched ,control,25.0,1
and his mother is quite upset by this ,control,50.0,3
 now why haven't you listened to me  young man ,control,41.66666666666667,2
 don't you know that mothers know best ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he is a little bit remorseful about that ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and as a result of listening to his mother  the next time he goes out he takes the umbrella ,control,50.0,7
mother is happy ,control,33.33333333333333,1
he is not getting wet ,control,40.0,1
and everybody is very content with their life ,control,50.0,4
for some reason dad has decided to climb up the tree ,control,45.45454545454545,3
he's out on a limb ,control,66.66666666666666,4
and maybe he went to s rescue the little pussy cat that was there because his daughter is quite upset that the cat is up on the tree and can't get down ,control,45.45454545454545,10
now the dog is barking because he would like dad to come down ,control,46.15384615384615,3
somewheres ,control,0.0,0
and we're in the midst of a serious rescue ,control,60.0,5
do we pacify the dog ,control,60.0,2
do we take dad down ,control,60.0,1
or do we rescue the cat first ,control,42.85714285714285,2
what a dilemma ,control,66.66666666666666,1
these firemen really have a big job on their hands ,control,40.0,3
I'm just wondering who comes first ,control,42.85714285714285,2
yeah  I think so ,control,20.0,0
according to this book ,control,50.0,3
0  flipping pages ,control,0.0,1
hm  I don't remember who this man is ,control,50.0,3
the father is the ,control,75.0,2

the best I can ,control,75.0,2
Cinderella had a stepmother ,control,25.0,2
two stepsisters ,control,0.0,1
Cinderella was beautiful ,control,33.33333333333333,1
the two stepsisters were mean  ugly  vicious just like the mother ,control,30.76923076923077,5
and um she did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just uh indulged themselves ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and then they announced that the  the king would have a ball in the palace ,control,50.0,5
and uh everybody was invited ,control,40.0,1
of_course Cinderella was not ,control,25.0,2
and uh she would have liked to have gone to the ball ,control,50.0,4
and um along came the fairy godmother ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and he  s,control,25.0,0
 we'll get you dressed up and get you to the ball ,control,53.84615384615385,5
and she got into a beautiful gown and a  um a coach ,control,38.46153846153847,5
but um that she would hafta be back by midnight ,control,50.0,3
I'm improvising ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and off she went to the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and um the Prince_Charming asked her to dance ,control,25.0,2
and she danced with him ,control,60.0,2
and I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother ,control,41.66666666666667,4
and at the stroke of midnight Cinderella knew she hadta return home ,control,33.33333333333333,4
so  she quickly uh ran down the steps to get into the coach  and in the process lost one of her slippers ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and uh she got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters ,control,42.85714285714285,4
well  Prince_Charming was enamored with her but he didn't know who she was or where he could find her ,control,57.14285714285714,4
so  he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball ,control,48.57142857142857,9
and when they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into them  into the shoe ,control,52.0,11
and it wouldn't work ,control,40.0,1
and um Cinderella  they would not let Cinderella do it ,control,27.27272727272727,2
however the prince or the attendants said ,control,28.57142857142857,3
 why don't we have this  uh this young lady try on the shoe ,control,43.75,4
and they finally did ,control,25.0,1
and the shoe fit ,control,25.0,1
and that's when the Prince_Charming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball ,control,66.66666666666666,7
and um she uh was  she went back to the palace ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and the  the king granted a marriage for uh his son Prince_Charming and Cinderella ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and they were married ,control,50.0,1
and they lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
well  I guess you would take two slices of white bread ,control,33.33333333333333,5
smear some peanut butter on one side  some jelly on the other ,control,38.46153846153847,3
put them together ,control,33.33333333333333,1
see that they  the top one matches the bottom one ,control,36.36363636363637,3
cut them up  across in a diagonal ,control,62.5,3
put them in some Glad bag ,control,50.0,3
and then give it to your son ,control,42.85714285714285,3
