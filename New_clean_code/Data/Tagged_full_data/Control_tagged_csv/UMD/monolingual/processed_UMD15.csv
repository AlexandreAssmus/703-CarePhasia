they take tremendous advantage of her ,control,50.0,3

and uh the two daughters and the mother are going to the ball ,control,38.46153846153847,3
and of_course they're gonna leave Cinderella home ,control,22.22222222222222,2
they want Cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on ,control,40.0,5
and so she does ,control,25.0,1
and uh she thinks about the ball ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and she's really very very sad ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she makes a wish ,control,40.0,2
and the wish is that she can go to the ball ,control,63.63636363636363,4
when a fairy godmother appears and tells her ,control,37.5,2
 yes  you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight ,control,50.0,4
and she says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
uh okay  I will ,control,40.0,1
and the fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well ,control,25.0,2
and she gets into this big pumpkin ,control,42.85714285714285,3
uh what can I call it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
anyway  it's  it's something that carries her to the ball ,control,64.28571428571429,6
and when she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her ,control,42.85714285714285,5
and she hears the midnight stroke ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and she gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  she goes running down the steps ,control,50.0,4
and she loses her shoe ,control,40.0,2
and uh she gets home okay ,control,16.666666666666664,1
the prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and it doesn't seem to fit anyone ,control,37.5,2
and the  the ugly  the mean mother has him try on the  the shoes on the two ugly daughters ,control,40.909090909090914,0
and uh finally Cinderella comes down ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and although the mother doesn't want him to  he tries on the shoe ,control,53.333333333333336,3
and it fits her ,control,50.0,1
and I believe he  he then wants to marry her ,control,36.36363636363637,3
uh I would try and get good bread  like whole wheat bread or something like that ,control,35.294117647058826,7
and I'd first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick ,control,35.714285714285715,3
and then get uh raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on ,control,13.333333333333334,3
and put the second slice on top of it ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and then cut it in quarters for a young child ,control,40.0,5
