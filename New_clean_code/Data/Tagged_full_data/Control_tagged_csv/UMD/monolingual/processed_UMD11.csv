is that it ,control,100.0,1
how I would make one ,control,60.0,1
I would use two pieces of bread ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and I would put them down on the table ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and then I would take the peanut butter out_of the cabinet ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and I would take the jelly out_of the refrigerator where I keep it ,control,61.53846153846154,3
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread ,control,41.17647058823529,7
and then I would use a knife for that ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and I would probably use the same knife and put it in the jel or  I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread ,control,41.17647058823529,7
and I put the two pieces of bread together ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and then I would cut them either in half or on a diagonal ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and then that would be it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
and then I would wrap it in cellophane ,control,50.0,2
for one of the boys to take to school ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and then I'd put it in the freezer ,control,55.55555555555556,3
