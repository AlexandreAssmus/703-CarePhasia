well  not bad ,control,0.0,0
I've given several speeches ,control,40.0,2
um haltingly ,control,0.0,1
um  I've had um  uh prestroke incidents ,control,20.0,2
TIAs ,control,0.0,0
serious illness  yes ,control,0.0,0
I was um flat on my back for a year at age ten with uh rheumatic fever ,control,47.05882352941176,4
the days before there were antibiotics ,control,50.0,2
so  there was no way to cure it ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I was one of the few who survived at that time ,control,58.333333333333336,7
that was one of the close calls ,control,57.14285714285714,4
hm well  I  uh I was  uh when  when they told me I could get up I uh was very happy ,control,48.0,5
and I was gonna go out and play baseball ,control,30.0,3
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed ,control,33.33333333333333,3
I hadta learn to walk again ,control,16.666666666666664,2
um  so   I got into all sorts of athletic activities ,control,33.33333333333333,5
um my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again ,control,35.714285714285715,3
and uh he also bought a uh one arm printing press because he wanted me to exercise on this printing press ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  I went into business uh printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve ,control,29.411764705882355,5
uh but I  I maintained uh some form of athleticism all the way up until  uh up  up  up until the time that I uh enlisted in the  in the navy ,control,52.77777777777778,6
I was a uh long distance runner in school ,control,44.44444444444444,3
I played basketball with half hour quarters ,control,28.57142857142857,4
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time  laughs ,control,38.88888888888889,4
um  and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and  got into as much of that as I could ,control,53.84615384615385,6
and uh I think it  had a salutary effect ,control,30.0,3
that's the um naval air core flight test which is the toughest uh physical ,control,40.0,4
it's four days of uh physical examinations um as_well_as um um academic ,control,23.07692307692308,4
you hadta be at the top  top ten percent of your class to get started ,control,37.5,5
then came the physical ,control,25.0,2
that was a challenge ,control,75.0,2
and so that's why I got into the navy ,control,60.0,4
yeah  there's no  there's no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever ,control,42.85714285714285,4
um the few other people who survived  the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort ,control,40.625,8
and uh the first time I went through the navy exam they said ,control,38.46153846153847,5
 well  you've had rheumatic fever ,control,25.0,2
 you have a heart condition ,control,33.33333333333333,2
 get out ,control,33.33333333333333,1
so  when I went back again I  I checked to make sure I didn't ,control,35.294117647058826,3
and then I went back again ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and I didn't fill out the paper first ,control,44.44444444444444,2
I went through the exam and got through  got to the end and they said ,control,43.75,4
 uh well  have you had any conditions ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 yes  rheumatic fever ,control,0.0,0
 well  you  you can't be here then ,control,36.36363636363637,2
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  I just passed your exam ,control,25.0,2
 well  alright  if you wanna go  go ,control,18.181818181818183,4
oh  there's so many ,control,16.666666666666664,2
what kind of a story do you wanna hear ,control,55.55555555555556,4
uh  well  there  there was  there was one uh interesting time uh when I was  uh when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasn't working ,control,33.33333333333333,9
we  we had a  we had a good program by all appearances ,control,50.0,5
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms ,control,45.45454545454545,6
and they looked like an army ,control,50.0,3
and they'd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight ,control,53.84615384615385,4
and still malaria ,control,0.0,1
why ,control,100.0,0
so  I went out looking for answers ,control,50.0,3
and on this one occasion I drove for  across this desert area for about oh  musta been six hours ,control,33.33333333333333,4
I'd been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark ,control,53.84615384615385,4
and I'm getting a_little concerned ,control,33.33333333333333,1
I was also warned about the Danakil people uh also called Afars ,control,33.33333333333333,3
very um  no uh I don't think you'd call it hostile ,control,35.714285714285715,2
but they didn't have many friends because their  their  uh the way they qualify for marriage ,control,42.10526315789473,5
they had these mass weddings that were made ,control,50.0,3
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body ,control,46.66666666666666,12
so   after about six hours uh we happened upon this little group of tuplesn  round mud houses ,control,26.31578947368421,5
and we stopped the uh Landrover ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys ,control,37.5,4
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars ,control,54.54545454545454,3
I thought ,control,50.0,1
 boy  I shouldn't be here ,control,37.5,2
and it turned out that about a third of the community  maybe more  were down with malaria ,control,42.10526315789473,5
and they assumed that I was a physician because they'd  on the only white people they had seen before were physicians ,control,56.52173913043478,6
just by sheer accident I had a car full of  medication ,control,33.33333333333333,5
so  for about the next two hours I was a physician  laughs ,control,50.0,4
peering under eyelids and  and baby bottoms and  and administering this medicine ,control,14.285714285714285,4
and uh at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy ,control,46.15384615384615,5
and suddenly the chief appeared ,control,20.0,2
seven feet high  long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice ,control,17.647058823529413,3
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests ,control,52.94117647058824,5
I said ,control,50.0,1
 what's that ,control,75.0,1
they said ,control,50.0,1
 smoked camel's milk ,control,0.0,2
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days ,control,41.66666666666667,4
I said ,control,50.0,1
 apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and the driver kicked me and he said ,control,37.5,2
 you've been doing fine up until now  FirstnameJ ,control,36.36363636363637,2
 don't ruin it ,control,40.0,1
so  we had smoked camel's milk ,control,37.5,3
it's better than Pepto_Bismol ,control,60.0,3
it really works ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds ,control,25.0,4
and the chief got a big smile on his face ,control,40.0,3
it all ended well ,control,50.0,2
I don't know whether this is in your interview or not ,control,58.333333333333336,4
but um at my age I very often uh forget the word that I want to say ,control,35.294117647058826,4
and it's getting a_little worse  laughs ,control,25.0,4
names especially ,control,0.0,1
well  the dad sends the son out to get a_little exercise ,control,25.0,3
and  he finds the soccer ball ending in his lap ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and he looks out there and he says ,control,25.0,2
 good shot  son ,control,0.0,0
end of story ,control,33.33333333333333,2
oh  this reminds me of my childhood ,control,50.0,3
um  mom wants son to take an umbrella with him ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and he says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I don't need that ,control,50.0,1
 um it's just something to get in the way ,control,45.45454545454545,5
and is surprised on his trip by running into a rain storm ,control,50.0,6
he comes home drenching wet ,control,20.0,2
mother says ,control,0.0,1
 I told you so ,control,40.0,1
and son has learned a lesson ,control,33.33333333333333,2
just like my childhood ,control,50.0,2
laughs this  this is an instant right out_of my life ,control,54.54545454545454,5
girl's  girl's cat has crawled up into the tree ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and the dad says ,control,25.0,2
 well  I'll go fetch it ,control,37.5,2
why is the dog barking ,control,60.0,2
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
possibly because there's a man in the tree ,control,55.55555555555556,4
uh and in the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder ,control,47.05882352941176,7
somebody called for help ,control,50.0,2
here comes the firemen to get him out_of the tree ,control,40.0,4
this happened to the fellow next door to me ,control,55.55555555555556,3
uh when I had a house nearby he got up on the roof to repair it and uh accidentally kicked down the ladder ,control,43.47826086956522,3
and he called me over and said ,control,42.85714285714285,1
 can you pick the ladder up ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and I said ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 well  not for a while ,control,28.57142857142857,0
 I wanna call the neighbors here ,control,28.57142857142857,3

hm  what's with the key ,control,57.14285714285714,4
I don't  remember that part ,control,42.85714285714285,2
0  humming ,control,0.0,1
and I don't remember those  first two pages ,control,30.0,3
but I gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who  lives on an estate ,control,47.05882352941176,6
and uh  is um  is to have a um ball  maybe coming out party ,control,23.52941176470588,5
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
is that the way the story goes ,control,57.14285714285714,4
mhm ,control,0.0,0
well  as I recall  Cinderella and  and her  sisters were all workers in this estate ,control,36.84210526315789,4
and uh  she being the youngest one was the most discriminated against ,control,46.15384615384615,3
the others uh uh treated her badly ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she always got the worst tasks to perform   and longed for a different life ,control,26.666666666666668,4
uh  I don't remember the bit about the key  uh her ,control,42.85714285714285,3
her sister locks her in the room ,control,57.14285714285714,3
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
uh  well  that comes a_little later ,control,12.5,0
a fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because she's been such a  good person ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and uh uh  the arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight ,control,40.0,4
and uh  at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her ,control,44.44444444444444,4
uh but then hasta flee uh on schedule to avoid  the  uh  being converted back into a chambermaid ,control,23.809523809523807,7
and in the process  loses her shoe ,control,37.5,3
the uh handsome gentleman  uh upon  upon discovering the shoe  determines he's gonna look for a person that  uh that that fits ,control,39.285714285714285,6
uh  and the evil sisters are determined it's gonna be one of them ,control,43.75,5
so  that must be where the key comes in ,control,60.0,3
they lock her room ,control,50.0,2
I don't know  I don't recall how she gets out ,control,53.84615384615385,3
but at any rate uh it's eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits ,control,58.82352941176471,4
and everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters ,control,41.66666666666667,5
almond butter ,control,0.0,1
