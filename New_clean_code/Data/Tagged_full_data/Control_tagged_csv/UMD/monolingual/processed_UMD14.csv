and it fell inside  the man's house ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and it hit the lamp and broke it ,control,37.5,2
and the man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid ,control,35.714285714285715,4
trying to  and the kid probably ran away ,control,22.22222222222222,3

 pay me for my broken window ,control,42.85714285714285,3
mama said to the little boy ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 it's supposed to rain today ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 take your umbrella with you to school ,control,50.0,2
and the little boy says ,control,20.0,2
 ah no ,control,0.0,0
 I don't need an umbrella ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 it's not gonna rain on me ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and then he walks to school ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and it starts to rain ,control,20.0,2
and it rains really hard ,control,20.0,2
so  he hasta run back home ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and he's all soaking wet ,control,50.0,1
and he's not happy ,control,40.0,1
and his mother's not happy either ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and he hasta change clothes probably ,control,16.666666666666664,2
it's hard to tell ,control,40.0,2
and then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry ,control,28.57142857142857,4
well  the little girl has a cat that  the  dog chased up the tree ,control,35.294117647058826,4
and then a nice man  maybe her daddy  came along ,control,16.666666666666664,3
and he had a ladder ,control,40.0,2
and he climbed up in the tree to get the cat ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and then the ladder fell down ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and then he's stuck in the tree ,control,50.0,3
so   somebody else watched this whole deal while the dog's still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody ,control,29.629629629629623,5
and they came with their truck and ladder ,control,37.5,3
not quite there yet but they're getting there ,control,22.22222222222222,2
and there's a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them ,control,53.333333333333336,6
the cat's on the other side of the tree ,control,50.0,5
says ,control,0.0,0
 I'm gonna catch the bird and eat her ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and the firemen rescued them all ,control,50.0,2
yes ,control,0.0,0
hm that's interesting ,control,50.0,1
I don't think I remember the beginning ,control,50.0,3
 I obviously don't remember a_lot_of this ,control,50.0,1
 I don't remember any of these things from when I was a kid ,control,66.66666666666666,4
I used to read science fiction ,control,16.666666666666664,3
I still do ,control,33.33333333333333,1
well   let's see ,control,20.0,2
if I remember Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl ,control,40.0,3
the nice man took her home to his family or somebody ,control,45.45454545454545,3
and the stepmother had already had  daughters ,control,25.0,2
and they took her in ,control,60.0,1
but they treated her like  a servant ,control,50.0,3
and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff ,control,27.27272727272727,3
and she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out  to wear ,control,25.0,5
and she was usually in the kitchen cleaning ,control,50.0,3
and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball I think in honor of uh  Prince_Charming or somebody ,control,38.095238095238095,8
and the mm evil stepmother wanted her daughters to  get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and  be rich ,control,36.66666666666666,6
and um so they all got fancied up to go to the ball ,control,46.15384615384615,4
and Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go ,control,30.0,3
and she wanted to go ,control,20.0,2
and she was crying about it ,control,66.66666666666666,2
and  a good fairy godmother came along ,control,12.5,2
I'm not quite sure how she got there ,control,44.44444444444444,3
um and she  was able to  turn ordinary  things and creatures around her into fabulous ones ,control,26.31578947368421,6
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses ,control,40.0,4
and  she turned the mice into something ,control,50.0,2
anyway  and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers ,control,25.0,0
and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left ,control,50.0,3
and when she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her ,control,43.47826086956522,7
and they danced the night away ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry ,control,22.22222222222222,2
then the mm fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning ,control,57.692307692307686,6
and so she hadta be sure to leave by midnight ,control,20.0,4
and she was a little late ,control,50.0,3
and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach ,control,50.0,4
and she lost a glass slipper ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her  I think ,control,53.333333333333336,5
and she jumped in the coach ,control,50.0,3
and it ran away  they ran away from the ball ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and it turned back into a pumpkin ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and her clothes turned back into rags ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she had one glass slipper on her foot ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and then the prince was very sad ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and he wanted to find her ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he  they took the glass slipper she had  that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs ,control,54.16666666666666,6
and they went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit ,control,50.0,6
and the evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper ,control,30.76923076923077,5
and it wouldn't fit cause they had big feet ,control,40.0,3
and uh finally Cinderella got to try on the slipper ,control,20.0,4
and it fit ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and the prince and the  was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry ,control,47.05882352941176,6
he was in love with her ,control,83.33333333333334,4
so  he found out ,control,60.0,1
they told him  I guess ,control,50.0,2
and  all the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of Cinderella then ,control,47.368421052631575,4
and she married the prince ,control,40.0,2
and they lived happily ever after ,control,33.33333333333333,2
the end ,control,50.0,1
um so  we're gonna do something a_little different ,control,36.36363636363637,4
well  oddly enough I never had peanut butter and jelly growing up ,control,15.384615384615383,2
I still haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,control,27.27272727272727,3
it was not part of my growing up ,control,62.5,4
but I'd take two pieces of white bread ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and I'd put peanut butter  probably if it were me I'd put it on both pieces of bread ,control,57.14285714285714,6
and then I'd put jelly in the middle ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and I happen to like   well  grape jelly I think would go good with peanut butter probably ,control,21.052631578947366,5
strawberry is nice too ,control,25.0,1
and then I'd smush it together ,control,42.85714285714285,1
and then I'd cut it in half diagonally ,control,44.44444444444444,2
I believe ,control,50.0,1
we didn't eat peanut butter growing up ,control,37.5,2
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all ,control,16.666666666666664,4
occasionally I eat peanut butter out_of a jar because it's a protein ,control,46.15384615384615,3
and I  my stomach is growling at me  you_know ,control,45.45454545454545,0
adequate ,control,0.0,0
a few words of French occasionally ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I listen to people speaking Spanish ,control,33.33333333333333,4
and you_know I picked up a word or two ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and I usually can figure out what they're saying when they're trying to speak English ,control,52.94117647058824,4
and people who speak  ,control,20.0,2
I don't know what language is pakis that Pakistan ,control,50.0,3
and that there's multiple languages ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and I hear Arabic I  people wherever I go ,control,40.0,2
so  I hear English that's accented that way ,control,50.0,3
most of the time I  can figure them out too ,control,54.54545454545454,5
no ,control,0.0,0
illness ,control,0.0,0
well  my daddy died of a heart attack ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and my mother probably died of a stroke although they said heart attack ,control,38.46153846153847,3
strokes ran in her family and heart attacks in his ,control,40.0,4
and uh my mother had emphysema ,control,16.666666666666664,2
I guess these days they call it COPD ,control,50.0,3
she  well  her family were coal miners ,control,33.33333333333333,0
and you talk about secondhand cigarette smoke ,control,28.57142857142857,3
well  my family's got secondhand coal dust ,control,11.11111111111111,2
because they carried it in ,control,80.0,1
and by the time she was  in her early twenties  she already had stuff that showed up on the tv xrays that they do because she worked in a school cafeteria ,control,51.51515151515152,6
back in the days where they actually cook real food ,control,40.0,5
that's mostly  I_mean I've got glaucoma and you_know those kind of things but ,control,37.5,1
that's  well  I have diabetes ,control,50.0,3
that seems to run in the part of  my daddy's family ,control,38.46153846153847,7
hm well  I always wanted to do horseback riding ,control,10.0,2
and a friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at Rockcreek_Park_Stables in the district ,control,45.94594594594595,7
and she wanted to go but she didn't wanna go by herself so she asked me to go with her ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and since I'd always sorta wanted to do that I went with her ,control,50.0,3
and they taught um English_style riding ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and we took this introductory group of uh lessons ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and she quit and I kept on ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and um in fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids  my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp ,control,29.72972972972973,9
yeah ,control,0.0,0
but it was lots_of fun ,control,40.0,1
I learned a_lot ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and uh I enjoyed that for a couple years until I had sort_of a accident ,control,46.66666666666666,3
they tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy ,control,46.15384615384615,5
you_know  we'd be gestures ,control,50.0,2
and he'd go like that gestures at sound ,control,55.55555555555556,3
and I usually went right off  you_know ,control,25.0,2
and  uh so a couple of times  and I don't land on my feet ,control,35.294117647058826,4
so  I sorta landed on my lower back and so that's caused me problems ,control,43.75,3
and uh I didn't go back after that ,control,44.44444444444444,2
but it was really nice while I did it ,control,55.55555555555556,2
little bit of  almost jumping ,control,16.666666666666664,3
the best part was riding the jump trail in Rockcreek_Park which is a  a horse trail that they've let the little  little usually trees fall across ,control,44.82758620689656,7
and it's rough ,control,50.0,1
and if you take  and my horse because he didn't like his neighbor horses ,control,43.75,3
we were always at the end of the line ,control,66.66666666666666,5
that's not a good place to be when other horses are moving along ,control,42.85714285714285,5
because horses being herd creatures  they wanna catch up ,control,40.0,4
and stay with their good buddies ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles ,control,50.0,4
and I'm in the back of the line ,control,66.66666666666666,5
and he's running to catch up ,control,42.85714285714285,2
and um it's a_little more exciting being at the end of the line ,control,50.0,6
but it was really  it was really good ,control,44.44444444444444,3
but now I do helicopters and it's better ,control,33.33333333333333,2
