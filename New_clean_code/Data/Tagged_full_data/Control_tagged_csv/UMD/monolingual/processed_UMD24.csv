okay ,control,0.0,0
I do very well speaking English ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I'm a native English speaker ,control,50.0,2
I've been speaking since  I guess  the normal age ,control,50.0,2
when do kids start to speak ,control,33.33333333333333,2
a couple of ,control,66.66666666666666,1
young  very young ,control,0.0,0
and I've been reading pretty young ,control,42.85714285714285,2
I've learned  sort_of selftaught myself to read when I was about four ,control,42.85714285714285,4
so  I was reading pretty well by kindergarten ,control,44.44444444444444,2
my speech is  I think  fluent and generally understandable ,control,27.27272727272727,4
I talk a_little fast sometimes ,control,20.0,1
that's about it ,control,100.0,2
no  not really  no ,control,16.666666666666664,0
not that I know of ,control,60.0,1
yes  my mother had a stroke ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and my grandfather had two small strokes ,control,14.285714285714285,2
my grandfather's strokes or my mother's ,control,25.0,2
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four ,control,50.0,3
so  she was very young ,control,50.0,2
they think it was because she had um blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx in her  um in her atria ,control,48.27586206896552,9
and uh then she you_know unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid ,control,25.0,5
and it basically took out essentially a fistsized portion of her left hemisphere ,control,38.46153846153847,3
um so  it's left her pretty severely impaired ,control,40.0,3
um my grandfather's strokes were smaller ,control,28.57142857142857,3
I believe they were right hemisphere ,control,50.0,3
he had some serious apraxia ,control,40.0,2
but he had no evidence of aphasia ,control,42.85714285714285,3
he was still able to read and write and did not make a_lot_of effort to speak ,control,18.75,7
I was fairly young ,control,50.0,2
um and he was  mm hemiparesis and used a wheelchair ,control,27.27272727272727,3
but again he also just was very stubborn ,control,25.0,2
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all ,control,45.45454545454545,4
he just sort_of refused to do it ,control,28.57142857142857,2
so  he kind_of just lived in his own head for the last um maybe ten years of his life ,control,40.0,5
she's been pretty good ,control,60.0,2
um it's been ten and a half years now  almost eleven years ,control,28.57142857142857,6
yeah  it's been a long time ,control,50.0,2
uh she's been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then ,control,30.76923076923077,3
um initially she did uh about a month ,control,25.0,3
initially she was  after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute ,control,57.89473684210527,5
so  she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname ,control,59.09090909090909,5
she was there for about a month ,control,57.14285714285714,4
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks ,control,27.27272727272727,4
um and actually no sorry  she went home ,control,22.22222222222222,3
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a uh hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting ,control,34.61538461538461,7
um and then  after that  went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks ,control,31.25,3
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT uh and got to about the ,control,37.5,4
she was not as cooperative with that ,control,57.14285714285714,3
she found it very uncomfortable ,control,40.0,2
and  right  and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress ,control,34.78260869565217,0
especially given that she was not willing to  to work at home besides doing um range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own ,control,40.0,12
she's very good about that ,control,66.66666666666666,3
so  we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay out_of physical therapy ,control,55.00000000000001,6
and she  she's doing that ,control,57.14285714285714,2
and then  but we  we continue to do speech therapy ,control,16.666666666666664,3
we've done it here for at this point  I guess  almost ten years ,control,43.75,3
and um she's done a mix of group and individual ,control,36.36363636363637,4
and she goes to an adult daycare program where she's very social ,control,46.15384615384615,5
we don't spend a_lot_of time with friends outside of that ,control,54.54545454545454,3
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then ,control,33.33333333333333,4
but we hafta make an effort unless she's sick or has something else going on to get out_of the house at least once a day even if it's just for a small short activity ,control,41.66666666666667,6
it can  it's  it's hard ,control,66.66666666666666,3
it takes a_lot_of time and effort ,control,16.666666666666664,2
and for her  uh not every activity is easy ,control,40.0,3
um so ,control,0.0,1
see  now you make me wanna think of a really good story ,control,30.76923076923077,6
well  I've told you about my mom ,control,55.55555555555556,3
that's probably the  like the singular event that's most significant ,control,53.84615384615385,6
okay  I'll tell you a story ,control,50.0,2
this is a story um about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird ,control,50.0,5
but it's so clear in my mind and it still doesn't make any sense ,control,43.75,4
so  my first semester of  my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname ,control,42.10526315789473,5
but my family was from DC ,control,50.0,2
and I had a car ,control,40.0,2
uh so  I would drive back and forth over break time with my car ,control,33.33333333333333,5
um it's about a thousand miles ,control,42.85714285714285,3
so  it generally takes about two days ,control,25.0,3
uh so  the first semester back  um it's winter and I'm driving across I_Eighty which is  goes through a bunch of very flat states with a_lot_of corn ,control,40.625,8
so  it is an extremely boring repetitive drive ,control,44.44444444444444,3
there is a_lot_of you_know driver tunnel vision that happens ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and it's cold and gray so it's not even pretty green fields ,control,28.57142857142857,4
it's just empty empty empty fields ,control,28.57142857142857,3
um but I'm  I'm kind_of proud of myself because it's  my first semester went well ,control,50.0,4
I was you_know independent  excited ,control,33.33333333333333,2
um so  I'm on I_Eighty in sort_of the middle of Illinois ,control,61.53846153846154,3
and there is a slowdown ,control,40.0,2
and it's very flat so I can see ahead ,control,50.0,2
I don't see that there is construction ,control,50.0,2
I don't really see an accident ,control,42.85714285714285,2
but I you_know figure something's happened  probably a minor accident ,control,25.0,3
it looks like it's a rubbernecking delay ,control,62.5,3
it's kind_of pissing me off ,control,66.66666666666666,2
I_Eighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction ,control,45.45454545454545,4
um and there's like no exits  nothing  built along it ,control,38.46153846153847,4
and we get closer and closer and closer ,control,12.5,3
and I still cannot see what's going on ,control,50.0,2
I'm just like ,control,75.0,1
 what could this be ,control,80.0,1
and we get a_little closer ,control,20.0,2
and I see okay it looks like I'm in the left lane ,control,53.84615384615385,5
um and then there's a median between the you_know east bound and west bound routes ,control,25.0,6
and I'm going east ,control,40.0,1
um and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left ,control,62.5,5
and it looks  as I get closer  like an animal ,control,41.66666666666667,5
and I get closer ,control,25.0,1
and it looks like a fairly large animal ,control,37.5,4
and I'm thinking ,control,50.0,1
 is it a cow ,control,60.0,2
 is it a moose ,control,60.0,2
I_mean  there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois ,control,50.0,3
but it looks  it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it ,control,40.0,5
so  I'm a_little more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay ,control,45.45454545454545,4
but I'm still kind_of internally rolling my eyes going ,control,30.0,3
 why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal ,control,50.0,0
 wasting my time ,control,25.0,2
 I just wanna get home ,control,16.666666666666664,2
um and I get closer and I can see that there's these kind_of large hind legs ,control,35.294117647058826,4
so  it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car ,control,55.00000000000001,6
and there's kind_of a long tail ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and it's brown ,control,50.0,1
and it's this big hump ,control,50.0,2
and I'm getting closer and closer and closer ,control,22.22222222222222,3
and I  you_know my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern matching  going ,control,36.36363636363637,6
 what is this thing ,control,60.0,2
 I don't ,control,25.0,1
 it's not a cow ,control,50.0,2
 it's not a deer ,control,50.0,2
 it's too big to be a dog ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and I'm literally  as I'm passing it  like my head is tu ,control,56.25,4
you_know  we're just creeping along ,control,28.57142857142857,1
my head is sort_of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view ,control,31.25,6
and it's only until it's like at my shoulder and I passed it that it  my mind kind_of pattern matches and goes ,control,52.0,4
 it's a kangaroo ,control,60.0,2
and then you_know again I hafta turn around and look at the road ,control,23.07692307692308,4
and everything's cleared up behind me ,control,71.42857142857143,2
and I spent like the next five miles going ,control,33.33333333333333,3
 that's no way it was a kangaroo ,control,66.66666666666666,4
but it wasn't anything else ,control,50.0,2
it was a kangaroo ,control,75.0,2
it was clearly a kangaroo ,control,60.0,2
I saw the ears ,control,50.0,2
I saw the big massive tail ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I saw the big hind legs ,control,33.33333333333333,2
I saw the little tiny front legs ,control,28.57142857142857,2
it was a kangaroo ,control,75.0,2
and so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know ,control,53.333333333333336,3
I just don't know ,control,40.0,1
I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo ,control,57.14285714285714,5
I've even start  I_mean  this was ,control,44.44444444444444,3
okay  so  this was the winter of two thousand  two thousand one ,control,26.666666666666668,5
so  the internet was a thing but it's not like ,control,58.333333333333336,2
Google was around but there weren't really  if you didn't know how to search ,control,35.294117647058826,4
and I think I've subsequently every now and then done like kangarooq roadkillq kind_of to see if there's any  any information about this but no ,control,39.285714285714285,8
I'm pretty sure it was a kangaroo ,control,62.5,4
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that ,control,58.82352941176471,6
so  it's not a significant story ,control,50.0,2
but it is kind_of a funny story ,control,42.85714285714285,2
laughs I just don't know how ,control,42.85714285714285,2
I just  I am so certain and so uncertain ,control,30.0,3
and I mostly just kind_of like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going ,control,31.25,5
 what ,control,50.0,0
it doesn't have a neat little conclusion ,control,37.5,2
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
I don't know ,control,50.0,1
if it wasn't a kangaroo there'd be no story of it ,control,76.92307692307693,3
it couldn't be anything ,control,80.0,1
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo ,control,55.55555555555556,5
I_mean  it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind  I_mean massive hind feet ,control,22.22222222222222,0
I don't know what else it possibly could have been ,control,63.63636363636363,3
anything else that it might have been  a wallaby or something like that ,control,71.42857142857143,5
wallabys are pretty small ,control,25.0,2
it still wouldn't have been in Illinois ,control,62.5,2
I_mean  basically if it's not a dog or a cow or a deer  it's something that shouldn't be there ,control,50.0,5
okay  what am I looking at ,control,57.14285714285714,2
okay ,control,0.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
a beginning and middle and end ,control,16.666666666666664,2
alright so  there's a little boy named Ralph ,control,30.0,3
Ralph is a science geek kid ,control,33.33333333333333,3
his dad is a former athlete ,control,50.0,2
his dad is always on Ralph's back about you_know ,control,40.0,4
 yeah  you gotta participate in a team sport ,control,27.27272727272727,4
 you gotta  you gotta learn to be a member of a team and to compete ,control,36.84210526315789,7
 and you_know  it's fine if you like science and you wanna become an astronaut ,control,35.294117647058826,3
 but you_know  you still gotta learn some skills ,control,18.181818181818183,3
 so uh here  I bought you this um  this soccer ball  so_that you can you_know ,control,36.84210526315789,4
 it's easy to play soccer ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 all you hafta do is run around ,control,37.5,3
 you don't even really hafta have some skill ,control,30.0,3
 but here's this soccer ball ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 let's go out and practice ,control,28.57142857142857,2
so  Ralph whines and whines and whines ,control,12.5,0
and his dad says ,control,25.0,2
 listen  if you uh  if you don't do this then uh I'm gonna hafta severely restrict your internet time uh to get you to be a wellrounded kid ,control,38.23529411764706,6
so  finally Ralph goes outside ,control,16.666666666666664,1
and he's practicing with the soccer ball ,control,50.0,3
and of_course he's pretty terrible ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he  he can't quite get it ,control,44.44444444444444,2
he keeps doing the Charlie_Brown thing  running up to it  missing  almost falling down ,control,35.294117647058826,4
and finally finally finally he kicks it ,control,28.57142857142857,1
it arcs high ,control,33.33333333333333,1
he sees it ,control,66.66666666666666,1
it goes toward the house  toward the house  toward the house  into the living room ,control,50.0,8
Ralph's dad  we'll call him Jake  uh looks up ,control,30.76923076923077,3
and the soccer ball comes in and it knocks over this lamp ,control,41.66666666666667,4
but that's okay ,control,50.0,1
it's an ugly lamp ,control,60.0,2
he hates the lamp ,control,50.0,2
his wife might be mad but you_know for now ,control,44.44444444444444,3
uh and he's just  he's getting really angry ,control,36.36363636363637,3
and he gets up and he sees  he  he walks over to the  uh the window ,control,47.368421052631575,6
and he looks out ,control,50.0,1
and he's like ,control,50.0,1
 Ralph ,control,0.0,0
and Ralph's like ,control,0.0,0
 I was just practicing ,control,40.0,1
 can I use the internet now ,control,42.85714285714285,2
the dad Jake sighs and is like ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 yeah  you can use the internet ,control,37.5,2
he gives up at that point on ever making his son wellrounded and decides his son will just be the best damn astronaut that ever there was ,control,44.44444444444444,6
the end ,control,50.0,1
okay ,control,0.0,0
um well  this one's pretty simple ,control,25.0,2
there's a mom ,control,50.0,2
we'll call her Sally ,control,60.0,1
and there's a kid ,control,40.0,2
we'll call him Andre ,control,60.0,1
Sally has bought Andre a really really ugly umbrella ,control,22.22222222222222,3
Andre refuses to use it ,control,20.0,2
he gives it back ,control,50.0,1
he says to his mom ,control,60.0,3
 listen  mom ,control,0.0,1
 I'm gonna go out ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 it's going to be fine ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 I don't think there's gonna be rain ,control,36.36363636363637,3
 I'm a meteorology nerd ,control,50.0,2
 I saw  on our local news  my favorite meteorologist said there's no way there's gonna be rain ,control,34.78260869565217,6
 so  you keep your ugly umbrella ,control,37.5,2
 and uh if it does rain I'll come back and you get to say that you were right ,control,40.0,0
so  of_course little Andre  did I say  goes out into the weather ,control,40.0,5
and it immediately starts raining ,control,20.0,1
he thinks ,control,50.0,1
 ah gosh darn it ,control,20.0,1
 that meteorologist  I'm gonna hafta start watching channel nine instead of channel seven ,control,23.52941176470588,5
he runs back inside ,control,25.0,2
he's very upset ,control,50.0,2
he looks at his mom and he goes ,control,50.0,3
 you were right ,control,50.0,1
 the  the channel seven guy was wrong ,control,33.33333333333333,3
and mom says ,control,0.0,1
 well  I told you so ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 and you told me I could tell you so ,control,50.0,0
 here's your umbrella ,control,40.0,2
and little Andre goes out ,control,20.0,2
and he's got his umbrella ,control,50.0,2
and uh he's in the rain ,control,57.14285714285714,3
and he just thinks ,control,25.0,1
 well  I guess I'm a channel nine viewer now ,control,33.33333333333333,4
the end ,control,50.0,1
alright ,control,0.0,0
um there's a little girl Jenny ,control,28.57142857142857,2
she has a cat named Moggy ,control,33.33333333333333,3
Moggy  uh she's trying to play dressup with Moggy ,control,27.27272727272727,4
Moggy gets very upset ,control,0.0,2
he manages to dash out_of the door  um where he encounters the dog named Goldie ,control,37.5,6
Goldie starts barking at Moggy ,control,20.0,3
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard ,control,54.54545454545454,5
meanwhile little girl Jenny runs after them ,control,28.57142857142857,3
she starts yelling and yelling and yelling ,control,14.285714285714285,3
the cat won't come down ,control,50.0,2
he's terrified  little Moggy ,control,33.33333333333333,2
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder um and tries to  to carry it ,control,33.33333333333333,4
it's very awkward ,control,50.0,2
into the yard ,control,66.66666666666666,2
she's dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up ,control,66.66666666666666,3
he sees her out the window and starts yelling ,control,44.44444444444444,3
 no Jenny no  that's too dangerous ,control,44.44444444444444,4
so  the dad comes  grabs the ladder  sits it against the tree  climbs up it to try to get Moggy ,control,33.33333333333333,5
uh as he's climbing up the tree um uh Goldie the dog knocks the ladder over ,control,47.05882352941176,3
poor dad is stuck in the tree ,control,42.85714285714285,3
the ladder is too unwieldy for little Jenny ,control,37.5,4
she runs back to the house ,control,50.0,4
she calls the nineoneone ,control,50.0,2
uh the fire department comes running out ,control,28.57142857142857,2
on her way back she grabs her tricycle and tricyclesv out to the tree just to you_know save time ,control,42.10526315789473,4
and uh all this time the  the uh fire department comes out ,control,38.46153846153847,2
they rescue dad ,control,33.33333333333333,1
they rescue Moggy after a_lot_of difficulty ,control,50.0,2
and this whole time this little bird is just singing  enjoying the show ,control,28.57142857142857,3
the end ,control,50.0,1
sure ,control,0.0,0
okay ,control,0.0,0
well  I remember Cinderella but I will um give it a first shot ,control,35.714285714285715,2
oh_boy ,control,0.0,0
it's very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella ,control,44.44444444444444,3
okay ,control,0.0,0
once_upon_a_time there was a little girl named Ella ,control,25.0,3
she was the uh daughter of two loving parents ,control,44.44444444444444,4
only one day when she's a little girl  her mother dies suddenly ,control,35.714285714285715,4
it's very tragic ,control,50.0,2
everybody cries ,control,50.0,1
everybody loved her mother ,control,50.0,2
uh her father  in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom  goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own ,control,38.70967741935484,8
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures ,control,25.0,2
um he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they uh immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps ,control,44.0,6
until the father  partly out_of heartbreak and partly out_of just a really bad diet  also dies ,control,27.77777777777778,5
uh at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy ,control,40.0,3
um they make her run around working all the time  then begin mocking her for being dirty ,control,38.88888888888889,8
and they call her Cinderella ,control,40.0,2
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are ,control,33.33333333333333,4
so  one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other brides  all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people ,control,43.18181818181818,8
or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball ,control,33.33333333333333,3
um and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball um to meet and hopefully find a match ,control,41.66666666666667,6
so  the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this ,control,50.0,3
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns ,control,41.66666666666667,3
um Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to you_know get out_of the house and to have a bit of glamour ,control,40.625,7
uh but of_course they won't let her ,control,37.5,2
because they  they tell her that she would be an embarrassment ,control,75.0,3
but mostly they don't want the competition ,control,37.5,2
so  they go off to the ball ,control,62.5,3
and uh Cinderella is left alone sort_of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house ,control,20.0,4
and she begins crying ,control,25.0,1
and she's crying and crying by the fireplace when all_of_a_sudden a woman materializes from the flames and says ,control,42.10526315789473,5
 Cinderella  why are you crying ,control,42.85714285714285,3
Cinderella says ,control,0.0,1
 I just  I just wanted to go to the ball ,control,33.33333333333333,4
 I just wanted one night of happiness and joy ,control,20.0,4
and the woman says ,control,25.0,2
 well  I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this ,control,47.05882352941176,4
 so  can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and uh some frogs ,control,37.5,3
 and um uh you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and she waves her wand ,control,40.0,2
and the pumpkin turns into a carriage ,control,42.85714285714285,3
and her ball  her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown  and her slippers into slippers of cut glass ,control,30.434782608695656,6
and you_know  none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling ,control,0.0,0
and she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen ,control,33.33333333333333,5
and Cinderella is just overcome with joy ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and she gets into the carriage ,control,50.0,3
and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says ,control,50.0,5
 unfortunately my magical power is limited ,control,28.57142857142857,2
 and at midnight when the  the chimes go  uh everything will turn back ,control,37.5,0
 so  make sure that you are well away from the ball and  and out of you_know an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens ,control,42.30769230769231,6
so  Cinderella says ,control,25.0,1
 I will  I will ,control,66.66666666666666,0
and she waves goodbye ,control,25.0,1
she goes off to the ball ,control,66.66666666666666,3
and she arrives ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and it's even more dazzling than she thought ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and she comes in ,control,25.0,1
and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming ,control,53.84615384615385,3
and uh in the midst of  of her being greeting by  by throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up ,control,50.0,9
and he sees her ,control,50.0,1
and he asks her to dance ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and they begin to dance ,control,20.0,2
and of_course they're both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together ,control,50.0,7
uh and the prince is  is about to propose to her there and then on the spot ,control,38.88888888888889,6
and the clock begins to strike twelve ,control,14.285714285714285,2
and she says ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 oh_no oh yeah  I need to go ,control,11.11111111111111,1
she  she runs off ,control,60.0,2
and the prince is kind_of stumped for a minute ,control,44.44444444444444,4
he's thinking ,control,66.66666666666666,1
 wait a minute ,control,25.0,2
 there's a lady running away from me ,control,44.44444444444444,5
 what is this about ,control,80.0,1
uh so  she gets a good head start ,control,22.22222222222222,2
even_though she's wearing heels of glass she runs out_of the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach  uh the prince chasing after her all the while ,control,55.172413793103445,4
on the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes ,control,58.333333333333336,8
she doesn't have time to stop and pick it up ,control,36.36363636363637,4
she leaps into the coach ,control,60.0,3
it starts racing out_of the palace grounds and  and down the road as the clock you_know slowly strikes midnight ,control,35.0,6
and um on the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and  and her clothes back into rags ,control,36.84210526315789,6
and she hasta run the rest of the way home ,control,40.0,4
the prince has been unable to catch up with her in time ,control,58.333333333333336,4
he did not have a coach at the ready  you_know being in his own palace and all ,control,50.0,4
uh but he has the shoe ,control,33.33333333333333,2
and he looks at the shoe ,control,50.0,3
and it's  it's very delicate and tiny ,control,40.0,3
and he thinks ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 I have a clue ,control,40.0,2
 and I shall not rest until I find this woman because truly she's the hottest lady I've ever seen ,control,50.0,0
um it's gotta be her ,control,57.14285714285714,2
nobody else ,control,50.0,1
so  he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest um but still a kingdom ,control,36.36363636363637,5
and uh goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person  every woman of eligible age ,control,36.84210526315789,5
and it doesn't fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason ,control,54.16666666666666,8
and uh finally he gets to  to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother ,control,40.0,7
and he tries the shoe on the first stepsister ,control,44.44444444444444,3
and it doesn't fit ,control,40.0,1
and he tries it on the second stepsister ,control,50.0,3
and it doesn't fit ,control,40.0,1
and he's about to leave um when he  he sees in the corner of the courtyard this  this little servant girl ,control,45.83333333333333,8
and she's  she's sweeping away all of the dust ,control,58.333333333333336,5
and he just has a sense ,control,33.33333333333333,2
he has a sense ,control,50.0,2
he says ,control,50.0,1
 I don't know ,control,40.0,1
 she's kind_of dirty but she looks kind_of hot ,control,30.0,2
 I don't remember if she's as hot as the lady I saw last night but let's give it a go ,control,45.83333333333333,7
so  he uh  he calls her over ,control,55.55555555555556,2
and the stepmother the whole time is like ,control,50.0,3
 no no  it couldn't be her ,control,55.55555555555556,3
 she's just a gutter wench ,control,42.85714285714285,2
 you don't want anything to do with her ,control,50.0,4
 she's dumb ,control,50.0,1
 she's ugly ,control,50.0,1
 she's infertile ,control,50.0,1
 why not consider one of my daughters ,control,37.5,0
 you_know  they're  they might not be your first choice but they're a pretty good second bet ,control,42.85714285714285,4
the prince continues to wave her away ,control,28.57142857142857,2
and he approaches Cinderella ,control,25.0,1
and he asks her to try on the shoe ,control,44.44444444444444,4
and she does ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and of_course it fits ,control,25.0,1
and he thinks ,control,33.33333333333333,1
 good enough for me ,control,40.0,0
and he whisks her away ,control,40.0,1
and they marry ,control,33.33333333333333,1
and depending on um your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters ,control,34.78260869565217,5
possibly they just feel really bad ,control,16.666666666666664,2
um supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after ,control,38.46153846153847,4
the end ,control,50.0,1
well  clears,control,0.0,1
let's assume that ,control,50.0,2
I'm not gonna make the bread from scratch or grow the peanuts ,control,35.714285714285715,4
you would uh go to the grocery store purchase bread whatever kind of bread that you like ,control,47.05882352941176,5
if it's not already been sliced you would need to slice it at home or have it sliced at the grocery store or bakery wherever you prefer ,control,50.0,5
uh take two slices of bread ,control,16.666666666666664,3
take a jar of peanut butter ,control,33.33333333333333,4
again if you wanna buy you_know your organic custom ground at Whole_Foods you can do that ,control,43.75,4
or you could just get you_know your jar of generic Jif from Giant ,control,38.46153846153847,4
uh also jelly or jam or preserves ,control,0.0,2
there's very little difference between the two ,control,37.5,4
I'm sure somebody could tell you ,control,71.42857142857143,3
grape is traditional ,control,33.33333333333333,1
also purchase that at a grocery store ,control,42.85714285714285,3
open both up both of those jars ,control,71.42857142857143,5
might need one of those assistant little clamper things if it's really on tight ,control,46.66666666666666,4
um you need a plate ,control,40.0,2
put one piece of bread on the plate ,control,37.5,3
take a knife ,control,33.33333333333333,2
spread first the peanut butter on the bread ,control,37.5,4
then in_order_to avoid cross contamination  clean the knife ,control,11.11111111111111,3
put it in the jelly ,control,60.0,3
spread the jelly on the other slice of bread ,control,44.44444444444444,4
put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing each_other ,control,31.25,5
not outward ,control,0.0,1
it's not a sticky sandwich ,control,50.0,2
and uh then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across ,control,45.0,3
and then stick it in your mouth then chew ,control,33.33333333333333,3
