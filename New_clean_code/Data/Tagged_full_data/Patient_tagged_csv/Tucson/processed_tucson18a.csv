text,diagnosis,lexical_density,tree_depth
it depends on what I'm talking about ,patient,75.0,4
um if it's pretty typical ges,patient,42.85714285714285,3
telling a story ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I'll put it that way ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
if I told you something about what happened ges it becomes   I  I  ges,patient,52.94117647058824,5
and um people will say ,patient,20.0,1
like even my mom will be like ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
 I don't know what you're saying ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
so  you know what I mean ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
my words ges,patient,33.33333333333333,2
yes  yes head,patient,0.0,3
mm mhm ,patient,0.0,1
and it  a a_lot_of times ges I can't come up with the words either ,patient,43.75,0
but what I've learned quickly to do is how to define ges  what the word is which then becomes ges part of telling a story ges in order to laughs point out what the word is ,patient,42.10526315789473,10
um you mean like once I'd been in the hospital ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
I  c I can ,patient,80.0,0
well  yeah  ges I  I can ges before they took me ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
basically what happened like two or three months in advance ges I couldn't  um I couldn't organize ,patient,35.0,6
I was running uh a business at a church bookstore ges ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
and um ges it was close to Christmas so there's more stuff ges,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and trying to figure out even how to ges,patient,22.22222222222222,4
and at one point when I realized points,patient,37.5,2
and um ges I couldn't figure out how to do it ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
i and things looked a different size ges,patient,25.0,3
so  I couldn't tell what fit ges,patient,44.44444444444444,2
um and it turns out I also ges ,patient,37.5,2
I remember specifically too ,patient,25.0,2
ges I'd ordered fifteen hundred dollars worth of books ,patient,30.0,4
Christmas time ,patient,0.0,1
and then  so  I've got the receipt ges,patient,27.27272727272727,2
and I couldn't get anything put together ges ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
like I didn't know where to ges,patient,50.0,3
I'm pretty focused ges,patient,40.0,3
couldn't figure that out ,patient,60.0,1
and then I saw another receipt ges because I got  ordered like ges seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books ,patient,28.57142857142857,8
and I remember looking at it going ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 I don't  ges what does this mean ,patient,50.0,0
and then I just was like ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 never_mind I can't think about it right now ges,patient,36.36363636363637,2
and ges in addition to that I was going to school ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
so  you_know all together ges,patient,33.33333333333333,2
well  at school I was  I'd been in digital arts classes ,patient,50.0,4
so  I was in a Flash class where  making movement ges,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and um it was the same kind of thing ges where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things ,patient,51.85185185185185,7
but our final project head,patient,20.0,1
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing ges that we'd done right before that it took  I put it in ges like seven or eight different programs ,patient,38.88888888888889,8
so  now I look back ges,patient,28.57142857142857,1
 oh  I wasn't stupid points,patient,25.0,2
 it was this thing points,patient,50.0,2
so  to s ,patient,50.0,0
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
and then the day that I went into the hospital um it was the first ges part of January ,patient,47.368421052631575,5
and ges I was at work ,patient,50.0,2
and  um and things had been ges being weird ,patient,30.0,2
and a girl was there ges ,patient,50.0,2
and  it's like I was  like I was ges,patient,66.66666666666666,3
I'm like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 woah  ges this is a weird feeling ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
my mom picks me up points,patient,50.0,2
well  actually drive points,patient,0.0,1
and I took a rest during that time ,patient,50.0,3
ges but I found out later that I wasn't even speaking well ,patient,38.46153846153847,0
that  then ges I go to the emergency room ,patient,40.0,0
it took them eight or nine hours to see me ,patient,30.0,3
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
and ges I didn't know that until later that points,patient,45.45454545454545,3
they were just like ,patient,75.0,1
 oh  head,patient,25.0,0
because they were nice ,patient,75.0,1
I remember points that part ,patient,40.0,2
and then I did get ges unconscious ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
um my mom tells me that they put me ges,patient,50.0,2
and uh  so I  I still don't have  I don't even go like ,patient,27.77777777777778,3
 oh ,patient,0.0,0
nothing like that ,patient,100.0,2
and  the way they discovered I had encephalitis  and this unusual one herpes encephalitis ,patient,25.0,0
the neurologist was saying ,patient,50.0,2
 no  it can't be ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and ges,patient,0.0,1
 yeah  I think it is ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  they gave me the medicine right away instead ges of waiting for the test results three or four days later ,patient,31.818181818181817,6
and that's when I see it's kind_of ges,patient,60.0,4
that's what even the neurologist has said ,patient,62.5,3
so  that's my story ,patient,50.0,2
so they say ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
um and um you_know it was tough to figure out how to walk ges,patient,28.57142857142857,3
it's not that it was um ges  where I couldn't walk ,patient,57.14285714285714,3

you_know things like that are still complicate ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
no  they're complex but they're not as complicated ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
I've just learned how to ges,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 and ,patient,0.0,0

I wrote ges a_lot ,patient,25.0,2
I_mean  I wrote pages and pages and pages ,patient,11.11111111111111,0
um just in general  I wrote a letter to  Pima_College um because of something ges that had happened the semester before ,patient,47.82608695652174,5
and I took three or four months to write it ,patient,20.0,3
I didn't want anyone to help me ,patient,50.0,2
so  and that was cool that I'm  I'm ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
you_know  I look back I'm like really glad I was the person that I was to not give up ,patient,47.61904761904761,6
um and so I also went to exercise ,patient,12.5,2

I can tell you the past because I've told a_lot_of stories from the past ,patient,60.0,5
so  um so  I'm doing it deliberately for  the current ges,patient,40.0,2
and it's sad ,patient,50.0,1
um my grandson just passed away a week ago ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
he's twenty ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and he passed away from cancer ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and he was sick for a year and a half ,patient,50.0,3
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer ,patient,40.0,2
so he was sick before ges,patient,50.0,2
um now  let's see how I can ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
I shouldn't try to think ges,patient,28.57142857142857,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um so   what happened is when he graduated from high_school he lived outside ges of Tucson close to Phoenix ,patient,45.0,5
and  a and um  so he was going to join the Marines ges,patient,26.666666666666668,3
but I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 don't join the Marines until you  find out ges what you wanna do really ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
because it had been tough ges in his family life ,patient,60.0,4
um so  I found uh a way to get ges him to move in with me ,patient,35.294117647058826,5
we didn't have a_lot_of money to make it happen ,patient,40.0,3
so  I found a way ges to get him here ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and after he'd been here a few months ges kept saying ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
 I'm sick ,patient,50.0,1
 I'm sick ,patient,50.0,1
they finally found out what it was ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
so  ges it was just a tough approach ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and um  exhales so they  f his parents finally moved him ges back in ,patient,31.25,2
and it's just been a tough path ges,patient,44.44444444444444,2
um I've learned how not to talk much ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  ges I haven't been able to participate in us  ges in language at all just in ges touchyfeely stuff ,patient,30.434782608695656,4
but um I've stayed up there um when he was in the hospital ,patient,50.0,4
well  a week before he passed away ges my man and I went up there for uh a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool ,patient,45.71428571428572,5
we got to spend time there ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and then the following ges,patient,20.0,1
ges and we went up there  for a day ,patient,30.0,0
we were right there when he passed along with other people ges and stuff ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
so  it was  uh it was very sad ,patient,50.0,3
and it was a good process too in the final moments ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
that's my story ,patient,75.0,2
