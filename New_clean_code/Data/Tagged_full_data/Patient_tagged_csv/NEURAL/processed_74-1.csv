um most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
but it s seems like when I get in a situation where I'm in a hurry is more uh when my speech or my  I lose some of the  the words that I want ,patient,59.45945945945946,7
and I found that the  going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know I'm hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my  my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it ,patient,45.90163934426229,11
so  that's what I do for you_know my help ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache ,patient,50.0,4
uh I normally in the morning go out get the paper  have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work ,patient,29.629629629629623,7
and um I went out and got the paper ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
I still had a splitting headache ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I took a couple of aspirin  came in and uh had a bowl of cereal for breakfast ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and uh while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
and I opened it up ,patient,60.0,1
and I could not read what was on the newspaper ,patient,60.0,4
I couldn't see a whole paragraph ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and blocks of characters were missing altogether ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
so  that's the first thing ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  I just  I set the uh paper aside and said ,patient,30.76923076923077,2
 okay  I'll read it when I get home ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and um got dressed and went to work ,patient,12.5,3
I w droving ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and um what I was seeing on the highway again on the uh dashboard of the car I couldn't see all of the inf ins instrumentation on the dash ,patient,53.333333333333336,11
but I was able to drive fine and go to work ,patient,18.181818181818183,5
uh no problem at all there ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
and I couldn't remember my login ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
didn't know how to log in ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and uh I still had the headache ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
I uh talked to my boss and  and told her what was going on ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
she said ,patient,50.0,1
 just take it easy for awhile and see if you can later ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
remember  I took probably a half hour  forty five minutes and still couldn't ,patient,18.75,4
so  I said ,patient,50.0,1
 I  I just can't do it ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
 I'm going to go home ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
I came home  took a_couple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day ,patient,31.57894736842105,7
that was on a Thursday ,patient,80.0,3
on Friday morning I got up ,patient,50.0,3
and I exercise on Friday  Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning ,patient,36.84210526315789,6
so  I went to exercise class ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and um I exercised ,patient,25.0,1
but when I was with the group I was talking ,patient,70.0,4
and what I was saying wasn't making sense to me ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
wasn't making sense to any of my friends ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
you_know they  the words were correct ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words ,patient,50.0,3
they didn't fit whiff ,patient,40.0,1
and so I said ,patient,25.0,1
 there's something wrong there ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  I came back home and uh had breakfast when I got back from uh exercise ,patient,29.411764705882355,5
and then I normally would go to work ,patient,25.0,2
but I couldn't go to work ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to uh see my doctor ,patient,28.57142857142857,5
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a  hear heart  col the oncolo uh heart doctor ,patient,34.78260869565217,4
and she s talked me instead to go to the emergency room ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
went to the emergency room ,patient,40.0,3
and they discovered that I'd had a stroke ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and so they put me in the hospital ,patient,50.0,3
and uh I was there three days ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
they were trying  basically my heart was out_of rhythm and uh was beating too fast and lots_of different things ,patient,25.0,3
so  they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized ,patient,31.25,4
and then three more days basically discovering that uh I'd had uh a stroke and aphasia ,patient,23.52941176470588,3
and um then I was  went home after the  trying to think what day of the week it was ,patient,42.85714285714285,9
Wednesday  Wednesday I went home ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and uh Thursday I drove back to the  drove then because I could drive ,patient,40.0,4
I could s everything  do everything I needed to do except talk laughs ,patient,42.85714285714285,7
so  I went to make a appointment with the uh uh speech therapy at that point ,patient,41.17647058823529,5
and that's where it started ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
well  it started out with something simple because basically I could look at  at anything and know what it was ,patient,59.09090909090909,4
but I couldn't pull the words out ,patient,50.0,2
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example ,patient,50.0,4
looking around the room ,patient,50.0,3
looking at each object in the room ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
naming it ,patient,50.0,1
trying to find the  the word and say the word out loud ,patient,23.07692307692308,5
you_know so  that's where it first started ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and it built from there ,patient,40.0,2
you_know just  and some of the things we sa looked at just a few minutes ago you_know like with the pictures ,patient,40.909090909090914,0
you_know look at the picture ,patient,40.0,3
name the picture ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and over time that gradually got better and better ,patient,22.22222222222222,4
but uh that's where I think the start with the therapy was ,patient,61.53846153846154,6
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and I found when writing I  taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldn't spell properly anymore ,patient,30.0,6
and you_know that was something I had to work at ,patient,50.0,4
so  I found that with my uh keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and with a notebood ,patient,50.0,2
it  it has a spellchecker and a  spell ,patient,40.0,0
uh not  I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
a checker ,patient,50.0,1
but it starts out  you_know if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work ,patient,41.66666666666667,8
so  that sometimes helped a_lot as_well writing ,patient,25.0,0
so  uh I've done a_lot_of that ,patient,62.5,2
but it's mainly uh uh working with seeing what uf  seeing the words and then saying it out loud ,patient,28.57142857142857,6
that's done more I think better than anything else ,patient,50.0,5
and I worked hard at it for a long time ,patient,50.0,3
and then I took  got kind_of  st afterwards I've kinda gotten a_little slow about it ,patient,27.77777777777778,4
or not slow but just haven't done it as diligently as I used to ,patient,26.666666666666668,4
but uh for the first months after the stroke I was  I worked hard at it ,patient,52.94117647058824,5
trying to pull those pictures back ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and I found that you  it's  it's like learning in school again grade school ,patient,50.0,6
you look at a word ,patient,60.0,3
and you learn that word ,patient,40.0,2
and  and oh that's that word ,patient,37.5,2
and it comes back and stays back ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
but with aphasia it doesn't stay there ,patient,37.5,2
it's  it's more like having uh an electronic dictionary that is  occasionally gets scrambled ,patient,50.0,6
you_know it's like ,patient,50.0,1
 okay  I know that word ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
 it's not in the dictionary where it should be ,patient,72.72727272727273,3
 it's over there instead ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
you_know that type of thing ,patient,40.0,3
so ,patient,0.0,0
happy ,patient,0.0,0
I think when my grandson was born ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
he was a joy to be around ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and uh I got to spend a_lot_of time with him when he was little and an infant ,patient,41.17647058823529,5
and uh watching him grow ,patient,20.0,2
and just  that was special ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
he's ten now ,patient,50.0,1
and he's doesn't spend as much crime ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and he's off doing other things ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
so ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
boy's out kicking a soccer ball ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
kicked it ,patient,50.0,1
got a_little too close ,patient,0.0,2
kicked it through the window ,patient,60.0,3
I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad ,patient,58.333333333333336,5
but the window  s,patient,20.0,1
and a  uh I'd say his dad saw it ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
opened looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
okay ,patient,0.0,0
in the beginning the mom sent little boy out to go to school ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
she ,patient,100.0,0
and he didn't want to take his umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  he said ,patient,50.0,2
 I'll be fine without it  mom ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and he went out  and he went out ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and the rain started raining ,patient,20.0,2
and so he ran back to the house ,patient,37.5,4
and his mom was upset with him and  hu for going out without the umbrella ,patient,50.0,6
and so he got a r umbrella ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and went back out with an umbrella the next time ,patient,40.0,3
alright ,patient,0.0,0
well  it looks like the beginning the little girl was riding her bicycle  or tricycle ,patient,35.294117647058826,3
and the dog or ,patient,25.0,1
and the dog chased the cat up the tree ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and so she called back to her dad and said ,patient,30.0,4
 the cat's stuck in the tree ,patient,37.5,3
and he got out a ladder ,patient,50.0,2
went out to climb up to get the cat down ,patient,40.0,4
and the ladder fell ,patient,25.0,2
and so they hadta call the fire to help him and the cat get down the tree ,patient,35.294117647058826,5
so  that's pretty much the story ,patient,37.5,2
alright ,patient,0.0,0
Cinderella ,patient,0.0,0
well  originally apparently her mother died ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and um sh her and her family were comfortably welloff ,patient,30.0,5
and uh that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters as_well that moved in with her ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and they were not very friendly with her ,patient,50.0,3
and over time  her father must be out_of the picture for some reason because she  the change of the  Cinderella and the family changed dramatically ,patient,50.0,7
and she became more of a slave than a  s a sister and the girl and the mother ,patient,42.10526315789473,5
and uh things got worse and worse as she got older ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
and uh one point in time she got acquainted ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
or how do I say it ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
she uh learned to live with the animals in the home  in the family or  in the house and uh outside the home as_well ,patient,42.30769230769231,8
and uh they became her friends instead of uh her s stepsisters ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh that developed over time ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his  the princess ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
so  he  they planned on a uh ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the  the kingdom ,patient,50.0,5
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave  not take sepmother ,patient,12.5,4
and uh Cinderella had a gown somewhere  I think ,patient,20.0,2
from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but  a trunk someplace ,patient,50.0,5
and she got it out ,patient,60.0,1
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and they ended up tearing it up ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and she didn't have anything ,patient,50.0,1
and then uh the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to uh redo her dress ,patient,26.31578947368421,3
her stairy ,patient,50.0,1
there we go ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I got a word laughs ,patient,40.0,3
fairy godmother stepped in as_well ,patient,20.0,2
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into uh horses ,patient,40.0,6
and uh s anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball ,patient,28.57142857142857,6
and uh stepmother  the  the prince fell in love with uh Cinderella ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening ,patient,46.15384615384615,6
and they  uh Cinderella hadta  hadta leave at midnight ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
and as she was leaving she left her  one slipper got left behind ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and uh they couldn't find her ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
they had to looked all over for Cinderella or  for the girl ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
and they couldn't find her until they finally came to her home ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
and uh her stepmothers couldn't  stepsisters couldn't fit the slipper ,patient,30.76923076923077,0
but Cinderella could ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
so  that's where they ended it ,patient,62.5,0
oh that's easy ,patient,50.0,1
get two pieces of bread ,patient,20.0,3
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife ,patient,30.76923076923077,6
um put the peanut butter on one side of the bread ,patient,36.36363636363637,5
jelly on the other ,patient,50.0,3
put them together ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient,25.0,3
