pretty good ,patient,0.0,1
yes ,patient,0.0,0
no ,patient,0.0,0
um I went to bed on a Monday night ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
uh I worked all day ,patient,40.0,2
and I went to sleep ,patient,20.0,2
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back,patient,33.33333333333333,4
about uh one o'clock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and uh that's typical for me ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and uh I had trouble getting the covers off ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
uh I was laying on my left side ,patient,50.0,3
uh I remember that because uh I had right side weakness ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and the blankets just felt really heavy ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and uh so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
as  uh it was like they were full of bricks or something ,patient,61.53846153846154,5
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the,patient,38.46153846153847,3
I was exhausted ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and uh so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed ,patient,50.0,5
and uh I laid there for about a half an hour ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and um I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and then I got up and uh thought ,patient,25.0,2
 I'll try again ,patient,40.0,1
but as soon as I stood up I realized ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 no I'm still just too tired ,patient,25.0,2
so  I crawled back in bed ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and uh about uh seven thirty or eight o'clock I'd decided to,patient,15.384615384615383,2
I  my boss was a creep ,patient,57.14285714285714,0
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible ,patient,50.0,3
and so  but this guy was uh kind_of uh the boss's pet ,patient,21.428571428571427,0
and uh so I thought ,patient,20.0,1
 I'd  I'll just call him ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and uh when I used my cellphone ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I had that guy's cellphone number and desk number ,patient,20.0,3
but I thought sure I selected the desk number because I was,patient,50.0,4
but I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I'll just leave him a message ,patient,50.0,2
well  he answered the phone ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and  uh so it hadta be before eight o'clock because I was,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and I said to him ,patient,60.0,2
 FirstnameB  uh you're at work already ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 no you called me on my cellphone ,patient,50.0,3
 well  what's up ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 well  um my  my brain's not working right today ,patient,23.07692307692308,2
 so  I'm not gonna come in ,patient,30.0,2
and uh I chose those words carefully ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
I didn't want them to know there was a health issue ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
um but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not,patient,50.0,6
and I certainly needed to make that call ,patient,25.0,3
and uh so uh he took it as uh humorous ,patient,30.0,2
and I was fine with that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
that was kind_of why I said it the way I did ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
um and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that,patient,46.66666666666666,4
he said ,patient,50.0,1
 I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 no  FirstnameB ,patient,25.0,0
 I wasn't trying to tell you anything ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
 I was  I was not  this was not a call for help ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
 uh I already had in my mind what I was gonna do ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 but I just needed to let you guys I  know I wasn't gonna be,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and uh so he was real relieved to hear that ,patient,30.0,3
and uh so I felt bad when he said that ,patient,40.0,2
I was like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 oh_gosh the guilt this guy's carrying around for nothing,patient,54.54545454545454,0
and uh anyway  so  um I called either before him or,patient,23.07692307692308,4
and uh I never call him ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
we've been going together for about six years ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and I  for me to call him is  that's a big deal because,patient,56.25,3
and  uh but I called him that morning ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he picked up ,patient,50.0,1
and um I told him  I said ,patient,37.5,2
 something's wrong ,patient,50.0,1
 um my brain's not operating right ,patient,25.0,0
 I'm not sure what's wrong ,patient,50.0,3
 but something's wrong ,patient,40.0,2
and uh he  I think he suggested I go to the hospital or see a,patient,43.75,5
or uh he might even try to help work it through and try to figure,patient,26.666666666666668,4
um finally I said ,patient,25.0,1
 tell you what ,patient,50.0,1
 um let's just see how I'm doing ,patient,40.0,3
 I'll call you back in a half an hour ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
and if I don't then uh I think I said ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
 call for an ambulance or help ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
I don't remember what I did ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
but there was some kind of a plan if I didn't  he didn't hear,patient,52.94117647058824,4
and uh so um I think before I called him back I decided ,patient,38.46153846153847,2
 let me call my nextdoor neighbor and ask her to take me ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
and I didn't want to freak her out ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
so  I didn't wanna say hospital or emergency ,patient,30.0,2
so  I just said ,patient,40.0,1
 uh something's not right with me ,patient,50.0,3
 and so I need to see a doctor ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
 and I should probably see somebody pretty soon ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh so she said ,patient,20.0,1
 okay I'll be over in about ten minutes ,patient,40.0,4
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 that's fine ,patient,50.0,1
and so I called him and told him you_know I was gonna go uh to,patient,37.5,2
so  um later he told me that he almost uh called an ambulance,patient,42.85714285714285,3
but he  he's the kind of person he's afraid to make a mistake ,patient,50.0,0
I'm sure there's some  some psychology there to  to delve in,patient,46.66666666666666,5
but  uh but uh I told him  I said ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
 if you make a mistake because you love me and you're trying to,patient,53.333333333333336,3
uh maybe initially I might be not happy with you for making that,patient,53.84615384615385,4
but later I would understand that you did it out_of love ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
so  it's okay ,patient,60.0,1
so um anyway  so then uh my neighbor came over ,patient,18.181818181818183,4
and I wasn't dressed yet ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and uh so I was in my bedroom getting dressed ,patient,50.0,3
and um I don't remember taking a long time to get dressed or,patient,21.428571428571427,3
I wasn't experiencing the exhaustion anymore ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and  um but I noticed at one point she came around the corner,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and  uh so then  but I finished getting dressed ,patient,18.181818181818183,0
and just  uh I kind_of planned out some things to do to,patient,30.76923076923077,3
if I made sure I'd let the dog out and let her back in ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
and uh I grabbed my purse and my phone ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh kinda made a mental note ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
yes  I've got my health insurance card ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
I've got money ,patient,50.0,1
uh got my driver's license ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
I'm good to go ,patient,40.0,2
and then we went out the door and um or  I went out the,patient,40.0,3
she said ,patient,50.0,1
 I'll tell you what ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 I'll go get my car and bring it to you ,patient,50.0,4
because she's just next door ,patient,50.0,2
but I think she afraid for me to walk ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
so  she was in my driveway ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
and I'm coming out the door ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and I've got a deadbolt and a knob lock ,patient,40.0,2
and I  n uh the dog is in ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and I'm trying to lock the door and xxx the knob ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
I could feel it ,patient,75.0,1
and it's right ,patient,50.0,1
but I'm sitting here looking with my keys ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and they weren't fitting ,patient,40.0,1
so  I was having trouble ,patient,50.0,1
I don't carry a_lot_of keys on my ring ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
but I couldn't figure out which key went into the lock ,patient,50.0,4
uh so  finally I thought ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 well  I got the  the knob locked ,patient,30.0,3
 it's good enough ,patient,40.0,2
and we  when we went down the road I don't remember who or,patient,53.333333333333336,4
but I think I went to the best possible one ,patient,40.0,5
um and when we got there  um it was like uh four of,patient,35.714285714285715,2
we call this hospital row ,patient,40.0,2
so  um my street is always the first in the city to get paved ,patient,40.0,4
well  maybe the governor's and then mine ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
so  um then she didn't understand where to go exactly ,patient,25.0,2
she  I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didn't,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and I saw the red lettering ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I couldn't read it ,patient,50.0,1
uh that was so significant to me because I remember I could not,patient,61.53846153846154,3
I knew what the word was ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
but I couldn't s say it to  to save my life ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
um but  well  I could say it ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I just couldn't read it ,patient,50.0,1
and uh so I pointed ,patient,20.0,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 emergency ,patient,0.0,1
and so I wasn't reading it you_know ,patient,37.5,1
it was like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 it's red ,patient,50.0,1
 and I just know what that word was because it's red ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
and uh so we got to the entrance ,patient,37.5,3
and there was like uh I wanna say  a canopy but not,patient,23.07692307692308,4
um and I caught the eye of a policeman that was uh sitting or,patient,42.85714285714285,5
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the,patient,53.84615384615385,4
and uh I waved at him and motioned for him to come ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and he did ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I told him ,patient,50.0,1
 uh I think I've had a stroke ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility ,patient,61.53846153846154,4
don't even remember ,patient,25.0,1
but  but  uh and I said ,patient,12.5,1
 but I'm afraid to walk ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and I was walking fine ,patient,40.0,1
but I just never had a stroke before ,patient,37.5,2
so  I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now ,patient,46.15384615384615,2
and all_of_a_sudden I can't you_know ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I didn't know ,patient,50.0,1
so  I was afraid to walk ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and uh so he said ,patient,20.0,1
 hold on ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I'm gonna get someone ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and a nurse came out real fast ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and uh she brought out uh ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
she came out first ,patient,50.0,1
and then uh I told the same thing to her ,patient,40.0,2
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair ,patient,37.5,3
I think it was just inside the door ,patient,62.5,4
then  so  she got me in the wheelchair ,patient,40.0,3
and we went in ,patient,25.0,1
and uh I remember looking at the people in the waiting room ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
it was pretty full ,patient,50.0,2
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and I almost wanted to say ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 sorry  but I think I had a stroke ,patient,30.0,3
but uh you_know just not appropriate to really say anything ,patient,10.0,3
I just felt bad ,patient,25.0,1
and uh so then uh the intake person wanted my health insurance,patient,16.666666666666664,2
so  I gave her that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and uh th she asked me ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 am I on any medications ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and I remembered uh the uh Metformin ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
but I called it Glucophage ,patient,40.0,1
I think Glucophage is  I think that's the name brand for it ,patient,57.14285714285714,6
but I couldn't think of Metformin ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and uh there were a_lot_of uh supplements I useta take and uh,patient,16.666666666666664,3
but I couldn't remember the name of them for the life of me ,patient,64.28571428571429,4
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if,patient,61.53846153846154,4
and  uh but I just  uh was just uh struggling ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
I couldn't remember um the name of them ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and I  it surprised me that I couldn't remember them ,patient,58.333333333333336,0
and uh then uh I got put in a room right away and just waited,patient,26.666666666666668,3
and that same nurse came back ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and she asked me ,patient,50.0,1
 has anyone been in here yet ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 no ,patient,0.0,0
but I didn't think a long time had passed ,patient,40.0,3
um and so she was a_little irritated with that and went back and,patient,30.76923076923077,3
and they were back there very quickly ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and um they had one test where they were gonna need to put me,patient,33.33333333333333,5
uh they're trying to find uh the origin of the stroke ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
I think at this point they know what happened ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
they just can't figure out ,patient,50.0,1
 well  how_come  why ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
and they never figured it out ,patient,50.0,1
um but  uh so  they put me to sleep for that ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to,patient,61.53846153846154,2
I don't like to be put under ,patient,50.0,2
I like to know what's going on ,patient,50.0,3
and uh then they're gonna put this thing down my throat ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and I know that there is the possibility ,patient,50.0,3
it's so slim ,patient,50.0,2
but possibility that um something could go wrong there ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
or would  some permanent damage could happen ,patient,37.5,2
so  I  I was pretty freaked out about it ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
but I thought I  I  I gotta submit to this ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
so  they did that ,patient,60.0,1
and  um and when they did either a c_t scan or the m_r_i ,patient,35.714285714285715,0
I don't remember which when they ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
I've had those done before uh not on the brain though ,patient,50.0,4
um and they told me it was really important that I  s that,patient,50.0,3
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it,patient,38.46153846153847,3
 I want them to get the best possible image of my brain right now,patient,33.33333333333333,5
so  I'm not gonna flinch ,patient,37.5,2
and so anyway then  then began nine days of in hospital stay ,patient,15.384615384615383,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um a speech uh therapist told me either that day or the next,patient,30.76923076923077,3
and uh for a moment I thought ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 you're making that up ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 it's  never heard of fu such a word ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and uh then she explained what it was ,patient,50.0,2
I was like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 huh  well  okay  I guess it explains why I'm struggling here,patient,31.25,3
um and uh so while I was in the hospital she provided a_lot_of,patient,53.84615384615385,4
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and uh it was like really important to me ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I was just super motivated ,patient,40.0,2
and  um and then when I was released it was gonna be a month,patient,43.75,3
and so I contacted her again ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 uh can you email me some stuff because I just ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
 okay  so  I can't see anybody for a month ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
 but I don't wanna let up here ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and uh so she um sent me a_lot ,patient,25.0,1
and um she  just like in the hospital she was willing to send,patient,42.85714285714285,6
and I was so thankful for that ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and uh so I just worked on it ,patient,37.5,2
and then  and so I'm not in the hospital ,patient,36.36363636363637,0
so  I didn't give it to her to check it now ,patient,53.84615384615385,2
I just figured ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 it's not right ,patient,40.0,1
 but  but it's stuff to keep doing ,patient,20.0,3
and um I got adult coloring books uh because_of a high fine,patient,16.666666666666664,4
and uh I went to a teacher supply store and uh got some kids',patient,26.666666666666668,3
that's where I estimated my level was at at the time ,patient,75.0,5
and so  um because when I looked at higher grades like,patient,41.66666666666667,0
 I can't begin to even do this stuff ,patient,30.0,3
but third or fourth it was like ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 okay this is a little bit of a reach for me ,patient,58.333333333333336,1
 let me start here ,patient,20.0,2
and uh so I did that ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and um I got puzzle books for kids um to do ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
and so I did those ,patient,40.0,1
and um I always did like to cook before ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but now I had a um special interest in cooking healthy food ,patient,25.0,5
and I want it to be food that tasted good ,patient,40.0,4
and uh so um I got some healthy uh recipes ,patient,20.0,2
and uh worked on those ,patient,40.0,2
and I s s was surprised to see that I struggled with um uh,patient,35.714285714285715,6
like a jar of garlic ,patient,60.0,3
half a teaspoon is one clove ,patient,50.0,2
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that ,patient,50.0,4
I was like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
so  I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
um and uh so  and I learned to highlight in the cookbook,patient,23.07692307692308,0
uh everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would,patient,57.14285714285714,5
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would,patient,57.14285714285714,5
and  um and uh so I did really well with the cooking ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
and uh just as time went on uh it was no longer a struggle ,patient,35.714285714285715,2
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like,patient,54.54545454545454,3
I never did figure it out ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
but I was like ,patient,50.0,1
 you know what ,patient,50.0,1
 don't worry about it ,patient,50.0,2
 I'm tired ,patient,50.0,1
 and hey I'll figure it out another time ,patient,50.0,0
but um I went to therapy ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I went to two different therapists ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I,patient,46.15384615384615,5
and so I thought ,patient,25.0,1
 well  I'm gonna just go whole hog on this and get as much,patient,23.52941176470588,4
so  both therapists would see me twice a week ,patient,60.0,2
and uh so  um and there was uh two different locations,patient,8.333333333333332,0
and uh so I  I went to them ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and it was uh exhausting ,patient,40.0,1
um I went back to work at about seven  eight  seven weeks,patient,21.428571428571427,7
and uh it took me eight weeks ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
but I took seven off ,patient,20.0,1
um and uh so you_know I was leaving work to go to therapy ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
or I would go um ,patient,40.0,1
no  I didn't do it xxx ,patient,50.0,0
I would  did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and my employer bless his heart said ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
 you're  you're gonna have to make up any time you miss for,patient,47.05882352941176,6
and I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 you're full of crap ,patient,50.0,3
 uh you_know this is uh too many hours in a week you_know in,patient,35.714285714285715,3
I can't  I was exhausted as it was ,patient,70.0,2
and I was like ,patient,50.0,1
 there's no way ,patient,40.0,2
but I just agreed to it ,patient,50.0,2
I know he didn't have time to check up on me ,patient,50.0,5
so  I said ,patient,50.0,1
 okay ,patient,0.0,0
so  um uh so  then I just uh did all this therapy ,patient,35.714285714285715,2
and my  um there was one uh therapist ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
well  first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was,patient,46.66666666666666,0
and I think I'd been seeing her for maybe you_know two weeks to a,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and um when she was there one evening she recognized me ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and she called me by name ,patient,50.0,2
and I just politely acknowledged her ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but I had no clue who she was ,patient,62.5,3
um and now I've learned that uh since my stroke there's some,patient,50.0,4
um now if the person has something very different about them I'll,patient,53.84615384615385,6
um you_know somebody's got a huge nose or a big old wart at the,patient,40.0,3
just uh something that would uh make me remember them uh then,patient,41.66666666666667,3
but just uh yeah it's very easy for me to forget uh who I just,patient,37.5,3
and so I remember uh her s pointing that out at the next,patient,53.84615384615385,4
she says ,patient,50.0,1
 you didn't know who I was  did you ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 honestly no  I had no clue who was talking to me until you told,patient,56.25,4
and uh so  but anyway uh she worked with me for maybe two,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and then she moved ,patient,25.0,1
and then  so another person took her place ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and um wasn't real crazy about that person ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
um but  um and in hindsight she probably didn't do anything,patient,30.76923076923077,2
it was just  I was just struggling with my confidence,patient,54.54545454545454,4
um and it  but then I went to another therapist ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
um and that lady was young ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and she was very um upbeat and very positive and uh encouraging,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and so um that was helpful to me ,patient,50.0,3
and so we did a_lot_of uh focusing on uh short term memory and,patient,30.76923076923077,4
I did that with her ,patient,80.0,2
um she taught me some card tricks to do that I've since,patient,53.84615384615385,3
um like uh five and two ,patient,0.0,3
I don't remember what it was ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
but anyway  so  I was uh practicing with my cards on my,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and um uh she didn't give me homework ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
uh neither one of them did because I worked ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and uh they felt like ,patient,40.0,1
 you  you got enough going with coming to therapy and work ,patient,30.76923076923077,6
 I don't feel like you needta have homework too ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and I was actually kind_of relieved because I was just  I,patient,50.0,3
the fatigue was k just crazy ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because uh I,patient,50.0,4
and uh so um think I just about covered it ,patient,20.0,3
hm uh something important that happened to me ,patient,50.0,3
um my grandbabies ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
uh my daughter and I we struggled a_lot in her teen years ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and uh she met this uh guy when she was uh thirteen or,patient,38.46153846153847,2
and uh you_know when I first met him I'm just seeing this skinny,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and I'm thinking ,patient,50.0,1
 he's like  I  this is the last thing I want around my,patient,62.5,5
 I got enough trouble with her ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and  uh well  anyway uh they eventually got married ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
and then  uh but she was determined she didn't want any,patient,38.46153846153847,3
she was so sure she would screw them up ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and uh it's just too hard ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and so me and my husband we'll just  you_know we'll just see,patient,40.0,3
and they did ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
they did a_lot_of traveling and everything ,patient,50.0,2
and  um and I had a  dis and I have a son too ,patient,26.666666666666668,2
but he didn't seem to have any uh interest in getting married or,patient,28.57142857142857,5
and so I just thought ,patient,20.0,1
 I sure would love them ,patient,50.0,1
 but if not then okay ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
so  I just worked in the church nursery and  and kinda helped,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and uh then uh my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and um by this time you_know I realized uh through some,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and I was always super protective of my kids ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
uh uh and I realized he was just as protective of her if not,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and so I thought ,patient,25.0,1
 he's gonna cart her off to Florida ,patient,50.0,3
 and I don't want her to be so far ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
 but at least I won't worry about her because he would die for,patient,60.0,2
and uh so um then uh I don't remember how long they'd been,patient,40.0,3
maybe a year or so ,patient,20.0,2
and uh she  uh she came back to town ,patient,30.0,3
and a relative on his side had a baby ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and she wanted to hold that baby ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby ,patient,40.0,5
and she just  whenever I took a picture of her with that baby,patient,57.14285714285714,0
and I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 she just looks so natural with that baby ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 like she's held him all her life ,patient,66.66666666666666,0
and uh she told me ,patient,40.0,1
 I really want one now ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing,patient,38.46153846153847,3
she lost uh two or three ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and um then when she had this one um ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh maybe about six months in uh I'm in Indiana ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and she's in Florida ,patient,60.0,2
and I'm nesting ,patient,50.0,1
and then my house is reasonably clean anyway ,patient,25.0,2
but  uh but I cleaned my whole living room once ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
and I just said  you_know it  it had been a recently,patient,46.15384615384615,3
uh and uh so there wasn't a_lot_of junk in there ,patient,9.090909090909092,3
but I started uh pulling uh items out and going through them ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and I uh cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows ,patient,30.0,3
and just you_know every crevice I cleaned in that living room ,patient,36.36363636363637,5
and I asked her  I said ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
 are you going through nesting ,patient,50.0,2
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 no ,patient,0.0,0
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 well  okay  well  I'm doing it for both of us because,patient,50.0,4
but once I sɛltu ,patient,25.0,1
I don't remember exactly which room it was ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
it might've been my bedroom ,patient,83.33333333333334,2
I don't remember ,patient,50.0,1
but anyway then when uh the baby was here um he had uh some,patient,35.714285714285715,3
uh I don't remember what it was ,patient,62.5,2
but it  uh it was  they wanted him to be in the uh not,patient,50.0,4
intensive care ,patient,0.0,1
they wanted him there  NICU  I guess ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and so he was there for uh a few days ,patient,40.0,4
but my daughter called me ,patient,40.0,2
and she said  um told me what was going on ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and uh I was  she said ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
 you_know we're  h we're  we're okay you_know ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
but I could tell her voice ,patient,50.0,2
she was scared ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and I wasn't really worried so much for the baby because what she,patient,50.0,4
 you_know I don't want anything to happen to him ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
 but I think he's okay ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
but I was really frightened for her ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
just her uh mental her emotional being  wellbeing ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and um after that phone call I hop on the airplane ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
I hadta be with her ,patient,60.0,2
I was compelled to be with her ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
and uh I show up in that hospital ,patient,50.0,3
and she was just shocked to see me ,patient,37.5,2
like I was the last person in the world she expected to see ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and I remember thinking ,patient,25.0,1
 how could you not know I'd be here ,patient,60.0,2
and uh so anyway I  I saw the baby ,patient,30.0,2
and uh uh couldn't touch him ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
uh and that was okay ,patient,40.0,1
um but I took a couple of pictures of him ,patient,50.0,5
and um then I came back home shortly after that ,patient,30.0,2
and later I learned that she thought I was coming to see the baby ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and she was kinda mad because she wanted to um decide when she,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and uh she thought that's why I got on a plane like I did to try,patient,52.94117647058824,5
and I just explained to her that I said ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
 honey  I couldn't help myself ,patient,37.5,2
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 it wasn't to see the baby ,patient,37.5,3
 yes  I was glad to see him ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 he's a beautiful baby ,patient,50.0,2
 and I just uh look forward to many many years with him ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
but I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 it was you ,patient,75.0,1
and uh s I think she uh was taken back by that ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 someday you'll understand ,patient,40.0,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 your heart just tugs you sometimes ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 and you just gotta act on it ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 you can't just sit back and just wait ,patient,20.0,2
and uh so um anyway  but that little guy he's uh so,patient,21.428571428571427,3
and uh he  um as I listen to him and his language,patient,46.15384615384615,0
 gosh that's  that's uh like my progression ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
it was really interesting ,patient,50.0,2
and uh s he's uh almost four now ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
but when he was about two he  s he loved dinosaurs ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
I think he still kinda likes them ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
but I kinda feel like he's maybe sorta outgrown them ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and he's onto other things ,patient,50.0,3
but I was making him videos and  uh because I didn't feel,patient,42.85714285714285,2
but this little guy he doesn't know what normal sounds like ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and so I made him these goofy little videos with these little,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and they would get into trouble you_know ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and I had a box of toys here for him ,patient,50.0,3
and  and so I had a dinosaur ,patient,25.0,0
I'd  we'd call them saursq because that's why he called them,patient,73.33333333333333,0
and I put a  dino a saur ,patient,37.5,2
and I put a saur ,patient,40.0,2
and it was just  and so I would uh make sill ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I would tell him ,patient,60.0,1
 you're gonna hafta come and see granny ,patient,20.0,3
 help me with these saurs ,patient,50.0,3
 they're out_of control ,patient,60.0,2
 they're  they're into my computer ,patient,66.66666666666666,4
 and they're gonna mess up my work ,patient,40.0,0
 and they're into my re freezer ,patient,50.0,3
 and I'm not gonna be able to cook because they're messing with,patient,43.75,0
and he thought those little  stupid little videos ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
maybe two minutes long each ,patient,20.0,2
he thought those were hilarious ,patient,60.0,2
and he would watch them over and over and over and over again,patient,23.07692307692308,4
you_know they just  a hundred times you_know ,patient,25.0,0
and then  and then uh his uh baby brother came along ,patient,8.333333333333332,2
uh and I think there's a two years difference ,patient,30.0,4
yeah two years ,patient,0.0,1
and so the baby um he's uh just uh cute as he can be ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and so he's right about almost two ,patient,37.5,2
and um so much difference between the two and their personalities,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and  uh uh but the  the first one he's uh super smart,patient,26.666666666666668,0
he's also very manipulative you_know ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and  and uh so he  he works that cuteness angle you_know ,patient,23.07692307692308,2
and uh then uh the second one he was a_lot more agreeable ,patient,25.0,3
and he was plenty smart ,patient,40.0,2
but I could tell not to the level his brother is you_know ,patient,50.0,5
it's like he didn't get stuff quite as quickly as like ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
you  you hadta work with him awhile ,patient,50.0,3
and  but  but then he'd get it ,patient,30.0,1
he was fine ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
um I think he just likes to analyze maybe more you_know and just,patient,15.384615384615383,4
so  the second one um just uh super long eyelashes ,patient,18.181818181818183,0
so  any girl would love to have and just as  just as cute as,patient,31.25,3
and um I went to go see them um last Thanksgiving I think it,patient,28.57142857142857,5
it was last Christmas ,patient,50.0,2
I went to go see them Christmas ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and um I facetime with them a_lot ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and so the older one he's thrilled to see me ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and he just runs to me and you_know says granny you_know and wants,patient,23.07692307692308,3
but the baby even_though he'd seen my face a_lot on the screen ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
and he  of_course I'd seen him in person too but not real often,patient,33.33333333333333,2
it took him a minute ,patient,60.0,2
and he had to watch his older brother ,patient,25.0,3
like I guess it's okay to go sit near her ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
it was like  it seemed like uh at some point uh a light,patient,50.0,4
and he was like ,patient,50.0,1
 she's fine ,patient,50.0,1
so  then had both on my lap ,patient,50.0,3
and they just  for about an hour or two I was enjoying,patient,38.46153846153847,0
it was just  it was uh just so cool ,patient,40.0,3
so  I  yeah I always heard how f much fun grandbabies are ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
but um oh_my_gosh instant celebrity is so much fun laughs ,patient,10.0,3
so  that's the  probably about the best thing that's ever,patient,50.0,5
okay ,patient,0.0,0
uh there's a boy outside ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
he's kicking a soccer ball up in the air ,patient,60.0,3
and um the ball winds up inside of a  shattering somebody's,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and the ball lands inside this man's house ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and this man is just sitting on a couch and um was surprised to,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and uh so the man picks up the ball and uh looks out the window,patient,33.33333333333333,3

um there's a little boy ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh mom is uh strongly advising him to take this umbrella,patient,25.0,3
and uh he is uh not open to that advice ,patient,40.0,4
and uh so he leaves without it ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and uh he waves goodbye to his mom ,patient,37.5,3
and she's still got that umbrella in hand and uh asking him to,patient,42.85714285714285,2
but no he's good while he  uh he gets outside ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and it's raining he's noticing ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and  uh and not only is it raining it's becoming t this,patient,35.714285714285715,2
and he's walking through puddles ,patient,50.0,2
and he's trying to keep his head dry um with just his hands ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and he gets to the house ,patient,50.0,3
and he sees his mother with this uh I told you so attitude ,patient,46.15384615384615,2
and uh she's looking at him where he is drenched ,patient,63.63636363636363,2
and  um but the next scene is he's going on his way in the,patient,50.0,5
but this time he's got the umbrella ,patient,50.0,2
and it's open and is keeping him dry ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um this little girl has a cat ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and the cat is on a tree and the branch ,patient,50.0,4
and the little girl can't reach it ,patient,37.5,2
and the cat is just hanging out on that branch ,patient,50.0,3
uh so  um somebody apparently called the pol fire department,patient,18.181818181818183,3
and uh so these two firemen are um coming towards the scene,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um the little girl  it looks like she had gotten there ,patient,38.46153846153847,2
and um i sh there's a dog uh at the tree trunk ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
uh and it's barking up ,patient,50.0,1
uh there's a man up on the branch of the tree ,patient,58.333333333333336,6
um and the dog is probably barking at him ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and there's another tree ,patient,40.0,2
there's a bird ,patient,50.0,2
looks like it's singing ,patient,60.0,2
and uh there's a ladder on the ground ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
um possibly the ladder was used by the man ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and he looks uh kind_of uh not uh kind_of  discour he,patient,16.666666666666664,4
and so it's probably his ladder that fell ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and so he's just kinda sitting there taking all that in ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and uh so with the firemen on the way uh looks like it's gonna,patient,43.75,5
mkay ,patient,0.0,0
um the evil stepmother and uh two stepsisters uh met the,patient,18.181818181818183,3
and um then later as the stepsisters are older ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
now they're not little kids anymore ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
they're like uh teenage girls ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
uh they're really not nice to Cinderella and expects ,patient,30.0,3
and uh they're preoccupied with themselves ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
uh one especially s shown uh powdering her nose or something,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and um uh Cinderella notices  looks out the window ,patient,20.0,2
and she sees the palace ,patient,40.0,2
and uh she's looking at that kind_of uh fondly ,patient,40.0,3
and uh she fantasizes about wearing a dress uh to this uh,patient,41.66666666666667,4
um and so she puts it on ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and um sh her stepmother witnesses one of the stepdaught uh,patient,27.27272727272727,5
um then Cinderella was talking to her fairy godmother ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um this uh fairy godmother um made a driver and a,patient,25.0,2
um the mice became horses ,patient,20.0,2
and think the dog might've been the driver ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
um then she gets the palace ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and she dances with the prince ,patient,50.0,3
and uh the fairy godmother had given her a uh beautiful dress,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and her hair was done nice ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
um and uh she has a great time Cinderella does at the dance ,patient,30.76923076923077,5
and then she notices it's almost midnight ,patient,37.5,3
and uh so she explains to the prince that she hasta go ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and the prince is  doesn't really want her to go ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and so  but she leaves ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
and in her rush down the steps she drops uh a glass slipper ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
but I should back up ,patient,60.0,1
there was two workers that worked in the palace ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
and they were planning this uh event earlier on ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
we saw s slide of them talking about something probably this,patient,54.54545454545454,4
and he was  so  she rushes down the steps and loses her,patient,50.0,3
and one of those same workers that had planned this event uh was,patient,46.15384615384615,6
and uh so she rushes on home not even know where she dropped it ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and uh then  then uh one of those  the same worker,patient,23.07692307692308,0
and uh then  so  he takes it to Cinderella's house ,patient,23.07692307692308,4
and uh the evil stepmother um ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
oh back at  back at the dance uh the stepmother and the,patient,38.46153846153847,5
but she was forbidden to even go to this dance ,patient,40.0,4
so  now she's there dancing with the prince of all things ,patient,61.53846153846154,5
and the  um anyway the  uh the one worker that xxx had,patient,28.57142857142857,0
that way they'll know uh who it is exactly that the prince had,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and um the evil stepmother she knew about the slipper who it,patient,50.0,3
so  she was hoping that since it was glass it would  she,patient,71.42857142857143,3
so  she tried to trip the guy who was carrying it carefully on a,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and  but apparently he didn't  uh he was able to keep,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and it fits perfectly ,patient,25.0,1
and uh so then uh next scene is uh she's at the palace with,patient,40.0,4
and they're married now ,patient,40.0,1
um I would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by gathering,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  I gather the bread and uh the peanut butter and the jelly,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and so then I would spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and uh then uh I would use the spoon to get the jelly and,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and uh then I'd put them both together ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and I'd put them on a plate ,patient,62.5,3
and uh um put the peanut butter and jelly and bread away ,patient,8.333333333333332,3
