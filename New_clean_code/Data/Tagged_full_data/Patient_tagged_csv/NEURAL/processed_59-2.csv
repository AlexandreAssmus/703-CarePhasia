well  you_know the one thing that has been awesome this l last year was um I couldn't drive after my stroke ,patient,43.47826086956522,4
and um so it was nine months that I would hafta ask someone to help me to go somewhere ,patient,36.84210526315789,4
or I would have to get a jubɚu ,patient,37.5,3
and sometimes I would hafta go to Boise ,patient,37.5,2
and I would hafta get a jubɚu ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and that would be fifty dollars one way ,patient,37.5,2
it was crazy ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and um my h sister would help me out sometimes ,patient,40.0,2
and my um mother inlaw would help me out and when my husband would too ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
but I really wanted to drive ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and there's only one lady from Twin Falls that is like two hours away from me to Oregon kin  s,patient,31.818181818181817,6
she's the only lady that will help people that had strokes or brain ændʒɚiz ,patient,40.0,7
so  I was on the list for three months ,patient,60.0,3
so  uh when I was able to um go to the class I had to do a_lot_of mɛmbɚizu ,patient,36.84210526315789,0
and y you_know a_lot_of people that have strokes they can only see out_of one eye ,patient,26.666666666666668,5

I had do a_lot_of s tests ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
um there was like a big board ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and it would have um uh lights that would come up ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and I would hafta smack them ,patient,50.0,1
and I had to be really fast ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and when I was able to pass that then I had to go to drivers' ed ,patient,35.294117647058826,5

so  I don't  I can't have it go down ,patient,46.15384615384615,2
and then I'm able  they put another pedal over on my left foot ,patient,40.0,4
so  I can drive with uh my left fʊktu ,patient,50.0,3
so  it was kinda weird to figure that out when you've been on your l right hand all the time ,patient,59.09090909090909,4
so  it took me about two months after I was  went to the class and everything ,patient,50.0,4
and then I had the doctor make sure that I was okay and I was able to drive ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
and I felt like I was like sixteen again because I was like ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
 freedom ,patient,0.0,1
and um the only thing they my hus or  my doctor doesn't want me to go on the freeways in  ca unless is ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
but I can get to everything on the back rows ,patient,60.0,5
it just takes me a little bit longer ,patient,37.5,3
but I can drive ,patient,50.0,1
so  that's really cool ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
right ,patient,0.0,0

and he started to go to school ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and it's starting to rain a little bit ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and then it really was raining ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
so  he went back home and told his mom ,patient,30.0,3

and a cat went up in the tree ,patient,50.0,3
and the dog was barking ,patient,40.0,2
and she couldn't get him ,patient,50.0,1
so  there was a nice guy that came along ,patient,40.0,3

and um she was beɪsəlɪu ,patient,40.0,1
and her  the stɛkmɑmu ,patient,40.0,0
so  Cinderella had a_lot_of æmɪnəlzu ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
she had a horse and a dog and mice ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and h she would make little um clothes for the mice ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
oh  and I think there was  m burrs ,patient,20.0,2
and um she was always deɪdrinɪŋu ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and there would be something better for her ,patient,75.0,3
and um the king had a prince ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and he wanna ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
so  he wanted to have a ball ,patient,37.5,3
and he invited everyone in the kingdom ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and when the s stɛkmɑmu ,patient,40.0,3
 well  it says that everyone in the kɪŋdʌbu ,patient,50.0,4
she's like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1

and she had a um dress that was her mom's that she need ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
but the stepmom and her sɛksɪstɚzu ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  she was never gonna be able to get the dress done ,patient,35.714285714285715,6
so  the mice saw that they  that sɪkɪndrɛlrɛləu ,patient,50.0,3
so  they snuck downstairs and looked at stuff that the stɛpsistɚzu ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and they got a ribbon and some pearls ,patient,37.5,3

and  um and then she was able to get home without the prince knowing that she was  um looked like she was before her  her fairy godmother helped her out ,patient,45.45454545454545,6
so  the next day um Cinderella was having such a good day ,patient,38.46153846153847,0
and then there was about another announcement that the girl that  that  that was dancing with the prince had a s shoe ,patient,45.83333333333333,10

and they live happily ever after ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
