my speech ,patient,50.0,1
I think it's a_lot better than what it  what it was ,patient,69.23076923076923,6
and I'm hoping that it gets better ,patient,50.0,2
actually I'm hoping that it  that it gets back to where it was ,patient,66.66666666666666,6
yes um but to be honest with you I  if  if  if what you're asking is I think that I didn't exactly understand what had all happened you_know ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
um and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and a_lot of it ,patient,29.411764705882355,6
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were  were  were kind_of funny or weren't making sense ,patient,48.14814814814815,5
so  I  I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would r remember everything ,patient,56.52173913043478,7
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
there  I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset  not upset  sad  sad ,patient,26.08695652173913,5
and then  but then ,patient,0.0,0
anyway sorry ,patient,0.0,1
well  most of the time I've been pretty happy sorry  because um I'm very fortunate that I'm still here and have a s second time to be alive and be with people that I  I care about ,patient,44.18604651162791,0
but it's just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
I was  I was home when it happened ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and um I  it just really hurt ,patient,25.0,2
for me it was on my left side ,patient,75.0,3
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
but right away I could tell something wasn't right ,patient,40.0,2
and um then I  my wife realized more stuff that was going on ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and she was able to ask me ques quite a few questions ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
and after a few questions she could realize I wasn't making sense ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
so  I guess that's the answer ,patient,62.5,0
um sure um a_lot ,patient,0.0,1
um um I'm trying to think where to start ,patient,30.0,3
from the time that I was at the um ,patient,77.77777777777779,3
I can't even think what it's called ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
where was I at ,patient,100.0,1
after the stroke happened at first CAR,patient,42.85714285714285,3
yeah i_c_u and then the ,patient,20.0,2
did it ,patient,50.0,1
where I was for awhile ,patient,80.0,1
um yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me CAR,patient,33.33333333333333,5
yeah rehab that's the one ,patient,50.0,2
it's hard for me to answer when I can't think how to say it ,patient,56.25,4
rehab ,patient,0.0,0
and they were helping me ,patient,60.0,1
and they  they were very kind ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
and my wife was wonderful ,patient,40.0,2
and they were just telling me things that gave  g i i me  it gave me a_lot_of hope that they realized I was pretty much  I was a_little weak ,patient,43.75,3
but I was physically able to walk around and do a_lot ,patient,18.181818181818183,4
and that  remember I told yesterday I could remember a_lot_of like well  uh um how to play a guitar and um kind_of singing ,patient,24.0,6
although I guess you would know how this stuff means ,patient,60.0,4
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was ,patient,53.84615384615385,6
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something ,patient,37.5,7
but that gave me a_lot_of hope ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and then um I got back home ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and I've worked with a whole lot of things ,patient,50.0,4
I'll show you one of them ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
xxx ,patient,0.0,0
here it is ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
one of these things ges,patient,40.0,4
so  not every day but for a_lot_of days I just go back ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
and I look at this ,patient,60.0,2
and I started going backwards i just uh to try to read it ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
you_know dog and cat ,patient,0.0,1
so  th there's a whole bunch of these things that they had ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and then uh some of those in the other room that I can't always get a hold of but I  I managed to get a hold of these ,patient,50.0,6
I usually  I can usually get them ,patient,50.0,2
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something ,patient,61.90476190476191,8
and when I started playing ,patient,40.0,2
is it okay i if I keep blabbing for a minute ,patient,63.63636363636363,1
this is actually  I guess my wife can tell me I  I kinda blab ,patient,50.0,5
so  uh I don't mean to be that way ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
but um um you_know sh I guess she realized soon ,patient,20.0,2
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing ,patient,22.22222222222222,6
and um after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with um older people ,patient,46.15384615384615,7
and then it made me think more about that after so something I was going through ,patient,62.5,4
and uh I really wanted to  to just sing ,patient,10.0,2
I  I  I realized that I missed that ,patient,60.0,2
so  we were talking about me doing that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened ,patient,41.935483870967744,8
um somehow one of them got  got missed ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and so it was about a month I guess  later ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
um yeah  yeah July ,patient,0.0,1
one  uh well  I'm forgot to say it ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
uh w bottom line is one of them called not long before ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
oh_my_gosh you_know w we didn't tell him   s,patient,30.0,2
and so I still said ,patient,20.0,1
 yeah I want to try it ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs ,patient,50.0,6
and I  I did it ,patient,50.0,2
and I was nervous ,patient,50.0,1
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to  to start doing it again ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and I did a whole lot of shows again ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and I think that really helped me because it  it started r remembering and a_lot_of that ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
so  I guess that's the answer to a_lot_of it ,patient,63.63636363636363,0
yeah and I was feeling so good ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
I  m I musta done a hundred shows at least ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
she could tell you ,patient,75.0,1
there was a ton of them I did ,patient,62.5,3
and uh pretty much not having any problems ,patient,12.5,2
um but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing ,patient,26.08695652173913,4
and I was singing all not making sense ,patient,37.5,2
and that just destroyed me ,patient,40.0,1
I_mean I just  that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I  I was back ,patient,52.63157894736842,6
and then that happened and the next thing I knew we're going to the hospital ,patient,43.75,6
and I just couldn't believe it ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
I just  I just said ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 oh_my_god no ,patient,0.0,0
and that was  that was probably the worst ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
um but then came back around again ,patient,0.0,1
so  I was doing better again ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and then all_of_a_sudden Covid came in ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
so  since it's been so many weird things in my life because_of just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything ,patient,37.142857142857146,4
and then that's come along ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and it's just every  we're all going through that ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
kind_of figure out what's  h what's all gonna happen ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and how are people and etcetera and ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  yeah it's been really really crazy ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
oh_my_gosh so many ,patient,0.0,1
I don't know where to start with that ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
I  I can only tell just  just the one  huh ,patient,30.76923076923077,2
well  I would talk about my wife and I getting  getting  getting married ,patient,31.25,3
um I guess that's pretty obvious that I would say that ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
um gosh I_mean I'm trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more ,patient,47.61904761904761,6
um I got  I forgot a little what you asked me ,patient,50.0,3
but this might be part of it too ,patient,62.5,3
um we got to go to where we useta go every year ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
up  to up north from us which is up b by Wisconsin ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
um FirstnameT my wife ,patient,25.0,1
you_know I wasn't able to actually  I used to always be the one that kind_of was the like main like uh driver ,patient,33.33333333333333,8
and so of_course she  you_know I knew that I couldn't  we weren't going to do that especially with our kids with me driving ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
so  she  she did ,patient,50.0,2
but going there again was a really wonderful time ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
it really uh reminded me of a_lot of places ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
because we  we usually would go in the same places ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and uh so that sort_of is a long thinking about ,patient,50.0,2
I just felt kind_of ,patient,25.0,1
we  we married there ,patient,40.0,0
so  I guess I don't know ,patient,50.0,2
I don't think I'm really answering what you asked me ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
just like happy times of just one happy time ,patient,22.22222222222222,5
yes I would  uh I would uh love to ,patient,40.0,2
um well  first of all we're just friends ,patient,40.0,4
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
and I was really interested in her ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
but I took a long time ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
um and finally I mentioned about if we could g go out ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
and she said yes which is wonderful ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
we went out ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
one of the happiest ,patient,50.0,3
the  that first date was just amazing ,patient,37.5,0
I felt like I was this younger g person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of ,patient,37.5,6
and we just went out to see a movie ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and then we just talked for a long time ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and I told her good night and drove home ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and that was incredible ,patient,50.0,1
and so we started going out ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and when we got married it was such a happy time ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
um I remember I went  t t t it didn't right away go ,patient,26.666666666666668,5
be before we got married that last night for ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
but I did ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I woke up ,patient,50.0,1
and I was really happy ,patient,40.0,2
and uh I uh was looking fairly forward to it ,patient,40.0,3
felt a_lot_of peace ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and so um we had a pretty special wedding that we had done ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and um the way we did it was that you_know I didn't get to see her how she was looking when h she walked out ,patient,50.0,5
and I was standing way back ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I saw her coming ,patient,40.0,2
sorry ,patient,0.0,0
it's no nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda ,patient,69.23076923076923,4
but I cried because she was coming w w w wsorry  with her dad ,patient,40.0,4
and uh that was amazing ,patient,40.0,1
and uh we had uh uh a fantastic uh w wedding there ,patient,25.0,3
and uh anyway the whole time it was happy ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I don't know why I cried  sorry ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
I think I might have thought of c because_of FirstnameT's  FirstnameT's like  FirstnameT's like uh mom who  who had passed away a year and a half ago ,patient,39.39393939393939,7
so  I think that kinda got me ,patient,50.0,2
but everything else w was  was really happy ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
oh_boy ,patient,0.0,0
well  in this case it's a  it's a  it's a guy a young bo boy ,patient,57.14285714285714,5
and he's got a uh ,patient,50.0,2
oh what do you call those things ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
things that you ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
see now I get stuck on ,patient,50.0,2
I  I  n I owe ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
totally I can't think what that's called ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
uh bouncing go ,patient,0.0,1
oh_no ,patient,0.0,0
uh uh I  I'll get that ,patient,50.0,2
do I have much time because  because I can think of that ,patient,61.53846153846154,3
is there a timing on it ,patient,83.33333333333334,3
okay  I hope that's okay and that's doesn't drive you crazy ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
you're like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 okay come_on  FirstnameJ ,patient,0.0,0
uh I've got this ,patient,60.0,1
it's  um oh what do you call that ,patient,60.0,1
mom  the moms go with ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
oh  I'm stuck on something really obvious ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
but anyway he's gonna  he's taking it and um using his foot ,patient,37.5,4
and as he does hits it a_little too hard into the r I guess  the right ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
and it's going right toward a person's house ,patient,40.0,4
and oops looks like in number three you can see that it  it actually broke there ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
and there's this person's probably somebody's dad just sitting there ,patient,23.07692307692308,4
it looks like he mighta been reading or something ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
I'm  I'm not sure about that ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
like oh_my_gosh got a_little startled ,patient,0.0,2
now he's looking down at the fourth one ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and he can look back there and see what happened ,patient,30.0,3
and then probably can see behind wh who that probably was I would assume back there ,patient,43.75,4
so  that's my answer to that question ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
on the first one xxx  on the first one uh there is uh a person ,patient,37.5,5
this is a xxx  I guess ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and uh yes which is like  um sorry  which is like um um mother ,patient,31.25,7
and it looks like to me like she is telling him that he should take a um ,patient,70.58823529411765,4
uh it's going to be the hard when we hadta think what that's called ,patient,56.25,4
uh to k not get wet ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
um like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
stuck on what that's called ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
but I know what it is ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
um and so she  it looks like he's going like ,patient,50.0,2
 no ,patient,0.0,0
and the  though the  the second one it looks like he's  oh like she's ,patient,52.63157894736842,1
oh I see what happened ,patient,40.0,2
she's looking a little bit upset like ,patient,50.0,3
 what ,patient,50.0,0
 you're not gonna leave ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and then the third one he's now outside ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and boyco guess what happened ,patient,20.0,2
now it's  it's  he's getting soaked ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
yes and she does look a little bit upset ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and he's looking kind_of like ,patient,50.0,1
 yeah  mom  y y you were right ,patient,20.0,1
and he's soaked ,patient,50.0,1
and now she has the other thing I can't think of what it's called  around him to keep not getting wet ,patient,41.66666666666667,7
that's pretty much what I have ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
okay  so  first  first I'm going to look at what I see ,patient,37.5,4
um and then there's a_lot going on there in there ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
there is a um ,patient,50.0,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
ks I see it's a tree ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
there is a man uh standing outside or  up high with the tree ,patient,28.57142857142857,6
there's a dog ,patient,50.0,2
can't help it ,patient,50.0,1
I always notice like dogs and cats ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
there's a dog at the bottom u u under there looking up ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
kind_of looks like it's barking ,patient,50.0,2
probably saying something like ,patient,50.0,2
 what are you doing up there ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and there's a cat just sort_of hanging out ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
oh I see ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and then are both under the cator   at the bottom of the cat or whatever uh uh is a young girl who's probably trying to help with  th with the  with the cat ,patient,48.64864864864865,9
um interesting enough there  there is a uh ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
uh what is that called ,patient,60.0,1
oh_no ,patient,0.0,0
I can point to it ,patient,80.0,2
but I can't say it ,patient,50.0,1
um there is a thing that  which the young girl could take with the  with the man ,patient,52.63157894736842,6
and he could  uh he could walk down there ,patient,40.0,0
can't think of what it's called ,patient,62.5,3
um okay ,patient,0.0,1
on the right uh uh uh see is a  uh is a um ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
crud  I forgot what that's called ,patient,50.0,2
I'll skip that one ,patient,60.0,2
at the bottom there we do see there is a  uh a_couple guys  a person  people who are um gonna probably help him ,patient,37.03703703703704,6
um uh the  which forgot what that's called too ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
uh uh f like a  f like a f ,patient,40.0,4
I can't say it ,patient,60.0,1
with a f ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
I  I got it ,patient,60.0,2
with a fire person who's gonna come and probably help him up there ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
that's what I've got ,patient,83.33333333333334,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella ,patient,46.66666666666666,8
but um Cinderella starts with uh she was  had a wonderful mom a and also dad  father and mother ,patient,23.809523809523807,4
and they were loving and  and kind ,patient,25.0,2
and she was too ,patient,50.0,1
and um something happened which a_lot  lot of ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and that was her  um her  sorry  her like mother ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
so  h her dad  her father um met this other woman and decided to  uh he'd like to m m have h him and her get married ,patient,35.483870967741936,5
and uh as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
 oh_no don't be marrying this particular person ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but he did ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and that person had a couple  uh a couple like  sorry  a_couple like daughters that she owned ,patient,35.0,5
and it's showing that they're all very very mean not only to  to Cinderella but even to themself ,patient,38.095238095238095,5
they just  they're just very  all they think about is uh themself ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
and the  m the mother is just interested in trying to make a_lot_of money when she gets married ,patient,31.57894736842105,6
so  they realize that Cinderella is just  is a very beautiful person ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
I_mean she's  she's very  she's very pretty and beautiful ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
but she's  inside she's just a really sweet person who  who cares about people ,patient,50.0,4
so the  uh s oh  I think it's called stepmother ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
I think that's what it's called ,patient,75.0,3
um realizes they need to  she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters ,patient,27.77777777777778,8
and so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that she's  m,patient,48.27586206896552,7
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy um at least for the most part and just doing a_lot_of lovely things in taking care of them ,patient,31.03448275862069,7
and so around that time the  uh p the prince ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
uh let me see ,patient,25.0,2
his dad ,patient,50.0,1
I can't think of what that's called ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
um wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all ,patient,52.38095238095239,10
who would be uh just a lovely like a girl ,patient,60.0,4
and so they have  have this like  this like ball ,patient,50.0,2
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that um Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that you_know ,patient,46.42857142857143,3
but they showed that the other two stepmothers ,patient,37.5,2
and that their mom ,patient,50.0,1
and they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen ,patient,64.28571428571429,5
woo this is hard ,patient,50.0,1
but the um mom realizes ,patient,20.0,2
 uhoh better not have with Cinderella because it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen ,patient,50.0,5
so  Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready ,patient,30.0,4
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little uh animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful ,patient,50.0,6
so  they made is  made her beautiful thing ,patient,40.0,2
but then the stepmother got where she  she  she couldn't go ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and so then Cinderella was really crying ,patient,14.285714285714285,1
as I remember that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken ,patient,50.0,6
and you_know how could they not even let me do anything ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and then there's s fairy godmother person pops out_of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be uh driven ,patient,36.36363636363637,7
she gets there ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and she can dance ,patient,50.0,1
and he sees her and wants to dance with her ,patient,40.0,4
and uh he's captivated by her ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and um all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes oh_no it's by this  i midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
so  Cinderella gets home ,patient,20.0,1
and she's still kinda happy ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
um which is  I thought that was always amazing ,patient,50.0,3
she was still  she just happy a and so honest about ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
 wow I got to actually do something like that ,patient,40.0,4
and she thinks that's the end that would ever be ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
but she was still happy ,patient,40.0,1
and so then with the prince he is like ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 I hafta find out who  who  who that  who that was ,patient,60.0,4
which I  I wouldn't really blame him ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
of_course he's gonna wanna meet her ,patient,37.5,3
and goes he wants to  he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her ,patient,30.434782608695656,6
so  um he hasta go  has a decree I guess that popped in  decree to every single unmarried person ,patient,31.818181818181817,7
hasta be  uh figure out who that was because ,patient,60.0,3
oh  yeah  I forgot when  when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things ,patient,38.88888888888889,1
I can't think what it's called ,patient,62.5,2
behind your foot thing ,patient,50.0,2
uh so  they know that if they can go to each person they'll find out who that was  h who that fits ,patient,60.0,5
so  th they go ,patient,40.0,2
and at the end Cinderella  it's obvious that she's the  the correct one ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
so  they get married ,patient,60.0,2
and then she's happily ever after ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
that's it ,patient,100.0,1
my  my brain is like ,patient,66.66666666666666,2

lay them down ,patient,66.66666666666666,1

under the jelly ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and go in there ,patient,0.0,2
and take one and put it around the peanut butter ,patient,30.0,4
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three three or four ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
and that's how I would say ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
I don't know what to call that  sorry ,patient,40.0,3
