um when I met him he just got out_of a relationship ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and me and him were deɪfɪŋu ,patient,50.0,2
and this lady said that she was prɛdjɪntu ,patient,50.0,2
and um my husband I ,patient,40.0,1
this was new ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
so  it's like ,patient,60.0,1
 we'll see what happens you_know ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and um we just never left each other's side ,patient,20.0,3
and the lady that he was in um um she got ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
after she had my son ,patient,60.0,2
because I say my son ,patient,60.0,2
um she got really into drugs really bad ,patient,25.0,2
and um so my husband and I took him when he was probably two months old ,patient,37.5,2
and he's always known me as mom ,patient,50.0,2
and  um and he lived with us ,patient,37.5,0
and he n didn't really see the other mom for awhile ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and when he was seven um I wanted to um ədɑpu ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
and it  groans and then the girl wanna come back and make sure she was a mom ,patient,27.77777777777778,0
but she really wasn't ,patient,40.0,1
so  we hadta go through all the  um to the course ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
and it was a_lot_of cheers ,patient,40.0,1
um and ill ,patient,0.0,1

and we had to go t in front of the dʒʌdzu ,patient,36.36363636363637,6
and it was  t even my uh son was so happy ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
it was like the best day ever ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and um sometimes he's a little butthead ,patient,37.5,2
but I would never ever do it  anything different ever because_of it's really good for us ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
so ,patient,0.0,0
okay  so  there's um a kid again ,patient,30.0,2
um um he's playing soccer ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and it went through a neighbor's window ,patient,37.5,4
um and it's ,patient,50.0,1
oh it goes through the window ,patient,50.0,3
and it breaks a lamp ,patient,40.0,2
and the neighbor has the ball looking outside to see what's going on ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and that's all I have ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
so  um th the mom told the son ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
 you probably need to have a ʌmbɚɛləu ,patient,25.0,3
and he was like ,patient,50.0,1
 yeah I don't need it ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
 I  I'll be okay ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and um so then the boy went outside ,patient,12.5,2
it was  it was raining ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and then it was really raining ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and he had to turn around and go back to home and tell his mom ,patient,26.666666666666668,5
 yeah you're right ,patient,40.0,1
and she went ahead and gave him the ʌnbrɛlələu ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and then he was able to go for a walk just fine ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
um okay so um ,patient,0.0,1
okay  I'm gonna say there  this little girl was riding her bike ,patient,31.25,4
and  um and her dog was with her ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and they came across a cat ,patient,50.0,3
and the dog was trying to get the cat ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and it was up in the tree ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and shoe ,patient,0.0,1
and a  um maybe it's a neighbor saw the cat in the tree ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
and he tried to put a ladder up so he could get the cat ,patient,50.0,3
and um the ladder fell down ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he couldn't get the cat ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  then the fire ,patient,40.0,0
uh wha what are they called ,patient,50.0,2
um firefighters can see it ,patient,40.0,1
so  they came over to get everyone down from the tree um and the cat ,patient,50.0,4
I guess that would be it ,patient,83.33333333333334,2
okay sounds good ,patient,0.0,1
um so  there  w y there was a guy um that had a doctor ,patient,31.25,4
and her um mother was um not there any more ,patient,30.0,2
and he wanted her to have a new stepmom ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
