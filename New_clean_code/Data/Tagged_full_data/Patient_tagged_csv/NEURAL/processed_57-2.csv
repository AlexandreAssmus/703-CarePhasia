my speech um I think they're not too bad ,patient,40.0,3
better than it was  uh it was before ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
yeah doing very well ,patient,0.0,2
not a hundred percent but you_know good enough  right ,patient,10.0,3
um yes it's been um a little bit more than um three years ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
yeah um right  be about a week before my birthday ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
yes had my stroke ,patient,25.0,2
um I had been having headaches ,patient,50.0,1
um and I was  I was a teacher working at a school and um working ,patient,43.75,6
and during that day my headache was getting more worse ,patient,40.0,3
and I went to the nurse that day um at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile ,patient,50.0,5
and as we were talking she looked at me funny ,patient,60.0,2
and she said that um ,patient,40.0,1
 are you doing okay ,patient,40.0,1
and I thought I was talking fine ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that ,patient,50.0,4
and um she knew that I was having a stroke from that ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
and they called five six seven eight  nineoneone ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
and um I don't remember ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
right after that when they ,patient,80.0,2
I remember being in the  um uh what do you call it  in the ,patient,62.5,5
it's not a car you_know ,patient,50.0,2
it's not a truck ,patient,60.0,2
it's  is being in there laying down you_know ,patient,50.0,3
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
but I could not think ,patient,40.0,1
at that point it was getting worse as it goes ,patient,60.0,3
and um they ended up taking me ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and one of the guys who does um brains he found a spot ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
w they made it a picture ,patient,50.0,2
they said that you're having  you have a s clot in your brain in the back ,patient,55.55555555555556,6
and it's starting to blood ,patient,50.0,2
and it starts to uh take um part of your uh what do you call it  uh like cells in a way that die ,patient,44.0,5
and so he  he ended up giving me surgery at that point and um fixed it pretty much yeah ,patient,35.0,4
so  um I'm still here today ,patient,25.0,1
but the um clot is still here ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
it hasn't left ,patient,50.0,1
so  um that's why I'm taking the medicine I am ,patient,61.53846153846154,4
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I  t it happened again ,patient,47.05882352941176,3
they said I was taking um medicine that um əræktɪdu ,patient,40.0,2
it  um most people don't have trouble with it ,patient,36.36363636363637,0
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think ,patient,50.0,4
they're hoping that they ,patient,80.0,1
yeah it's one of those things ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
yup ,patient,0.0,0
um I think at the beginning um the first thing they were helping me to stand up um to be able to walk again ,patient,37.5,9
they were more into that at the very beginning than other like um aphasia type stuff ,patient,50.0,6
they wanted to make sure I was able to  to walk again and  because my one side of my um body was starting to have trouble they said ,patient,30.0,7
so  they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning ,patient,40.0,9
they started doing some little task for me ,patient,50.0,3
like um we played cards to see how many cards I can find  looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that ,patient,39.130434782608695,6
but we were doing that just here and there feeling ,patient,30.0,2
um I was also very sad very um emotional feeling ,patient,20.0,3
didn't  I couldn't even remember who I was ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
and so um getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff ,patient,48.0,5
um once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year ,patient,43.47826086956522,6
so  um said ,patient,25.0,2
 let's go for our therapy now ,patient,37.5,4
 let's start walking around and stuff ,patient,12.5,3
so  once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit um we started working on therapy ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and um they said ,patient,25.0,1
 you have aphasia ,patient,25.0,1
um and my talking I couldn't say pretty much any  I couldn't say anything ,patient,41.17647058823529,2
they were saying like ,patient,75.0,1
 do you want something to eat ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
I didn't understand what that meant ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
so  they'd give me like a cup ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
 do you want something to drink ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
they'd sh take the cup and show me ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and I'd go yesq or noq ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
it took me a  lil even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it ges,patient,45.0,5
if you don't want it it goes this way ges,patient,54.54545454545454,2
took that long to figure that out ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
little things like that that I didn't remember ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
um then once I was able to at_least think a little bit more we started with um uh pictures like that bird and the  and the boy and the banana ,patient,35.483870967741936,10
and uh we start  that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words ,patient,40.0,8
and um my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else ,patient,27.27272727272727,7
so  still working on therapy myself ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
I have uh a book at home that I still do my homework everyday ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
so  still going ,patient,25.0,1
it's  I  I'm  um the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write ,patient,39.130434782608695,5
and I said  but I told myself that I'm going to do it ,patient,46.66666666666666,1
so  I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up s you_know ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
I'm going to read someday ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I will write ,patient,50.0,1
and I will have numbers at some point ,patient,50.0,3
so  yeah ,patient,0.0,0
um let's see ,patient,25.0,2
um um let's  let's see ,patient,25.0,3
I  oh one of my um from a long time ago um when I was I don't know  ten fifteen right in there you_know teens in a way um we had  my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage ,patient,37.2093023255814,6
and we  on the weekends you went to the cottage ,patient,54.54545454545454,0
and um we wouldn't go every weekend ,patient,37.5,2
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools you_know ,patient,35.714285714285715,6
we would um take that time ,patient,50.0,2
and um I think that was one my favorite places to go ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
we could um fish ,patient,50.0,1
we could swim ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
we could ,patient,100.0,1
and it wasn't very deep ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
there was a_lot ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
now it was deep in the middle ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
but right now  y I_mean you could  didn't really hafta swim ,patient,21.428571428571427,3
you could just walk around a little bit ,patient,37.5,2
um there were frogs ,patient,25.0,1
there was um um turtles at ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  I_mean it was  we got up in the morning ,patient,50.0,4
and I think we ate as fast as we could to be  to go outside ,patient,37.5,5
and I think you're pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed ,patient,43.75,6
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that uh um all the fun things that we were able to do ,patient,52.17391304347826,5
like my dad let me ,patient,40.0,2
um we useta have a rowboat that had paddles ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
but we also had one that had the um motor in the back ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
and it  now you're  you were not allowed to go fast ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
it was like two what do you call it  like fi no  five fast ,patient,50.0,4
so  it wasn't very fast ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
you could almost swim as fast as you can the  you_know the boat ,patient,50.0,3
but um they let me actually m mow  s,patient,20.0,3
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that  that paddle boat and stuff like that ,patient,42.85714285714285,6
I loved to  r um to drive ,patient,25.0,3
I just thought that was really cool ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
I'm not sure why now it was like  it was such a big thing ,patient,62.5,4
but it was you_know ,patient,50.0,1
and I was by myself on the boat you_know ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and I thought I was something else you_know and all that ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
we forgot the gas one time ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
but I think that was ,patient,60.0,2
and at night um we had  uh we had like a  uh a place to lay down outside ,patient,30.0,4
and we would um go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty ,patient,43.75,3
and I  I think um when I have my  if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage ,patient,46.42857142857143,5
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
I think about that place ,patient,60.0,3
I don't know why laughs ,patient,50.0,2
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
um there's uha boy outside that was um hitting the ball around and having fun  I'm sure ,patient,35.0,6
and  um but as he was going by um he hit the ball on the window ,patient,41.17647058823529,3
and it broke ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and it actually went in the house with it ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
so  the  um that um ball fell into someone else's house ,patient,35.714285714285715,0
and I'm sure the guy ,patient,50.0,2
I can't see that he has a picture ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
but um it even hit the lamp and everything ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and so um he was looking to see you_know what happened ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
so  he's looking for the  the kid ,patient,60.0,4
so  we don't know if he took off or if uh he was uh going oops feeling or what ,patient,47.61904761904761,3
we don't see him in the picture now ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
so  at the end all we know is that the  there's a guy with the ball looking for  to  outside to see what's happening ,patient,53.333333333333336,6
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
we don't know what happens this time ,patient,50.0,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um in the morning the  l the little boy are ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and mom had looked at the weather and said ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 I think there's a chance for rain ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and said ,patient,0.0,1
 bring your umbrella ,patient,25.0,2
and the boy said ,patient,25.0,2
 no I  I don't need it ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and so mom said ,patient,0.0,1
 are you sure you're gonna do that ,patient,50.0,4
and okay ,patient,0.0,1
and so he said bye mom and went to school started walking ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
and here comes the rain ,patient,20.0,2
and it started probably even more rain as it looked ,patient,30.0,3
and so he ran to come home the other way ,patient,20.0,3
and let's see ,patient,25.0,2
so  he went back in the house probably and said ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
 uh mom  um you're right ,patient,25.0,2
 there was rain ,patient,25.0,1
and so she said ,patient,25.0,1
 well  go get your b brɛləu ,patient,12.5,4
and so he put it on the brɛləu ,patient,50.0,3
done ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um there's a cat that um was going up this tree on that bird ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
and um I think it was up there and stuck ,patient,30.0,3
and so this little girl was watching and thought ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
 oh_my_goodness how do I get it down ,patient,62.5,1
and um there was probably a guy walking by ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and he thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I can help that little girl to get the cat on the tree ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and uh but he got up there ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and now he's stuck too  it looks like ,patient,40.0,2
and um someone saw the guy up there ,patient,25.0,2
and the firetruck called and said ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 we have a guy and a cat stuck in the tree ,patient,41.66666666666667,6
and so they um brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down ,patient,26.666666666666668,4
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
alright ,patient,0.0,0
um so  let's see ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
um she  um she ,patient,40.0,0
I think her mom must've died because dad is finding a new  um a very bad lady ,patient,42.10526315789473,6
and um now she's here um s stepmom in a way now right and with two girls ,patient,27.77777777777778,5
and they come to their really nice place ,patient,37.5,4
and um she hasta um do all the dishes and the laundry and everything ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and the other girls actually they were even doing um um like either singing ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
or they do their little um mɛstrəmɛntsu ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
they're doing all of that during the day and um having their fun ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and um they found out that there's going to be a  um a ball you_know kind of thing ,patient,40.0,5
and everyone can go and everything ,patient,50.0,1
and um the  so she goes to get a dress ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
and um it was new in my head on the fact that  um the  the birds I think and um maybe see others l a little fu friends um helped her to make even brɪɾɪu ,patient,32.432432432432435,8
it's one of those things that they lock ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
and they got out_of there ,patient,20.0,1
it looks really pretty ,patient,25.0,1
but she's like ,patient,50.0,1
 well  it wasn't a hundred percent ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
but it's gonna look pretty ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
but then the birds said ,patient,20.0,2
 ooh ,patient,0.0,0
and they um maybe even some of the little mice or something whoever they are you_know were helping to put her  her dress look even better ,patient,40.74074074074074,4
and they got it done ,patient,40.0,2
and um she's gonna go too ,patient,25.0,2
and  um but uh she also can't have a ride because they're going  you_know the  uh the mom and the two girls get to go together ,patient,29.03225806451613,2
so  she had to find a way to  to go ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and  um and as  as they were leaving they said ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
 oh yours  I want this ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
I want this and this that you have ,patient,62.5,2
and so that was  um they took all of her beads and everything that was pretty ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
and so now she doesn't have ride to get  to be there ,patient,21.428571428571427,3
and also her dress was co torn and everything ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and um she found the ,patient,40.0,1
I can't remember what her name is ,patient,62.5,3
um she's like a fairy ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
I don't  I don't remember what they call those little guys ,patient,50.0,0
but anyway you_know she's just sitting here and there ,patient,20.0,1
she's there to  s to help you ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and um she said ,patient,25.0,1
 I can help you and to make your um dress beautiful ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and so they get that done ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and all of the little um mice become you_know like guys ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
oh and the  um so as one of the  do I think their dog goes and you_know as one of  as one of the guys that doing the um driving and all that ,patient,44.44444444444444,9
and um so that  that's how she gets there ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and once gets here I'm sure that they're gonna be like ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
 gasps she's there too ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and they won't be very excited about that the fact that she made it here ,patient,56.25,3
and she looks really good ,patient,20.0,2
and so then the  um here is the uh new ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
he's not a king yet ,patient,50.0,2
he's a princess ,patient,75.0,2
n no  that's a  that's a guy  that's a girl um not a king ,patient,55.00000000000001,0
see  I don't remember whose is whose ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
but you_know it's one of the  the  ki the  it's the king's kid in a way  right ,patient,45.83333333333333,5
and um he finds her and says ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
 ooh you_know she's beautiful ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and so they're dancing and everything ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and then she  she looked at the clock which I  now I forget to tell you ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
but you_know she's only allowed  she's only  she is only allowed to be there until midnight ,patient,40.0,4
and so she's kept looking at the clock ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
she's good at that ,patient,80.0,2
she's watching ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and um so as they were dancing and everything she thought ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
 oops I gotta go ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and so um of_course he probably said ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
 can't we just stay longer ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 no I gotta go ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
so  she's running ,patient,60.0,1
and um I'm sure even the  one of the guys who worked there even had uh a question ,patient,35.0,5
and she  I think she said ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
 I got to go ,patient,20.0,2
and um so as she went one of her shoes fall ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and um she gets all the way home ,patient,37.5,3
and of_course you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for you_know back ,patient,50.0,6
and there's the dog and everybody's sitting there ,patient,40.0,2
and I'm sure she's thinking ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
 that was the most beautiful day I've ever had you_know ,patient,41.66666666666667,0
and um I don't know if she's even a know she ever see her  ag him again ,patient,45.0,4
but at least she had a real beautiful day  night you_know ,patient,25.0,3
and then  um but there's  um there's a guy coming back t at all the houses I think you_know to see where that  um that shoe came from ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
and I think that the mom  that new mom said ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
 uhoh I think it was her ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
which they probably knew it was her at the beginning you_know because she looked way too good ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
and so they locked her in the like  in her room or in the palace or who knows she is ,patient,52.38095238095239,6
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
it's always bad over there you_know that ,patient,37.5,2
she's  they stuck her in there ,patient,50.0,3
