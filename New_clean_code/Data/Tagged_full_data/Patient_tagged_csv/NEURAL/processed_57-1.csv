and I was a teacher ,patient,60.0,2
and I had had um headaches for about a week or so and still working laughs during the day ,patient,31.57894736842105,4
and um they said um all_of_a_sudden I said ,patient,25.0,2
 can I lay down for a half an hour ,patient,70.0,3
and all_of_a_sudden I  st I was talking to the  the nurse that's at the school ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 FirstnameK  are you okay ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I kept  I was trying  I was talking ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
I thought what I was saying was right ,patient,62.5,3
and I kept saying ,patient,25.0,1
 I'm fine ,patient,50.0,1
 I'm fine ,patient,50.0,1
and she kept saying ,patient,25.0,1
 FirstnameK ,patient,0.0,0
and um obviously my talking was not even all there ,patient,30.0,2
and I don't remember anything from that point to um I was  um I had this tube in there ,patient,47.61904761904761,4
I got my brain done ,patient,40.0,3
I got  I wa had a tube going ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I was out ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
it breathes you and everything ,patient,60.0,2
um I don't rimɛmbvɚu ,patient,40.0,1
um I didn't even know my name ,patient,37.5,2
I didn't know who I was ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
they gave me a mirror to know who I was ,patient,60.0,4
and I didn't know it was me ,patient,62.5,2
I thought it was a picture of someone else ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
so  yeah  for that long laughs ,patient,25.0,0
so  I had about two weeks of not here laughs ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
yes ,patient,0.0,0
um let's see ,patient,25.0,2
at the beginning um I had  I could not walk yet ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
so  they were helping me to um stand up s at the beginning um not walking anywhere but able to stand up ,patient,34.78260869565217,6
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side ,patient,50.0,4
um so  I had one therapist that  bet ,patient,30.0,3
this one arm was not always going ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  weights trying to get that going ,patient,12.5,0
um then I had another um therapist um was trying to get me to start uh talking ,patient,23.52941176470588,4
um I couldn't really talk of anything ,patient,50.0,2
so  they were showing me like um yesq or noq a_lot ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
um I  we had to start with that ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
sometimes I didn't really even understand if they said ,patient,40.0,2
 do you wanna drink something ,patient,50.0,2
usually they would show me that ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 what are they doing ,patient,60.0,1
I'd  so  that was hard ,patient,50.0,0
um even at the beginning I didn't even understand cups ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and um they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere ,patient,40.0,4
and um they showed me how to  they hadta show me how to eat again ,patient,43.75,3
um to  um at the beginning I was very  um very scared by myself in a room ,patient,47.368421052631575,4
um I also thought we had  I  I thought someone had took me like  um like a bad person taking me ,patient,45.83333333333333,6
so  I was trying to run to help myself ,patient,40.0,3
I had those thoughts too of scared um uh to the point where I was trying to um hit people in a way because I thought they were trying to help no  I thought they were bad people ,patient,46.15384615384615,8
so  I  I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
that was even that part for me ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way ,patient,33.33333333333333,7
um didn't  my mom and dad were there ,patient,30.0,2
didn't know who they were ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
um my kids were here ,patient,40.0,2
didn't know them ,patient,50.0,1
um like I said they showed me a mirror ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and they said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 do you know who you are ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
and I  di I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
 who is this person ,patient,60.0,0
and it was me ,patient,75.0,1
so  that's when it got started ,patient,62.5,2
um then therapy started with even very small like um saying my name  saying yesq or noq ,patient,16.666666666666664,5
um went from that point to we played some games t for numbers like um dice ,patient,43.75,6
um we played some games that were cards like uh p play cards in a way  put  sort all the cards together  what colors matching ,patient,35.714285714285715,7
suh little things ,patient,0.0,1
it gives me um focus ,patient,40.0,2
and also I would əlæksu ,patient,40.0,1
if we're playing a game I was okay ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
so  we did that ,patient,60.0,1
um then they started giving me cards ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
what  the first one I ever saw was a baby ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
there's a baby card ,patient,40.0,2
and there was a bird ,patient,40.0,2
and they said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 what is this ,patient,75.0,1
is it a bird or um a baby ,patient,50.0,2
and it took ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I didn't know ,patient,50.0,1
but I knew it a little bit in my brain ,patient,50.0,3
but not really on what they were you_know ,patient,50.0,2
it was happy thoughts ,patient,50.0,2
but I don't know  I wasn't sure what that was ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
that's when it started ,patient,80.0,2
um then I was able to start not walking very well ,patient,18.181818181818183,5
but I could stand up  pivot  sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself ,patient,42.10526315789473,5
that's when all that started during ,patient,85.71428571428571,3
um once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well  not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning ,patient,29.166666666666668,5
I still do have to watch my um uh dizzy s feelings ,patient,25.0,4
but um therapy  that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better  stuff like that ,patient,35.0,5
and other therapy was still doing the talking  started at the beginning ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
um so  it's  that was about uh a year of just talking  working on all those words and all that you_know ,patient,48.0,8
um then after two years didn't have to worry about the other therapy because now I'm starting to walk uh very well now ,patient,28.000000000000004,5
so  only just therapy for  um um for speech ,patient,27.27272727272727,0
um then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years um we started working on these numbers which I still not good at laughs ,patient,37.93103448275862,5
um I went from um one to now I know one and two to one two three ,patient,23.52941176470588,5
I'm not  higher than that not very good so you_know ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and one plus one  not sure there yet ,patient,0.0,3
but  um so  was working on numbers um and trying to start reading of any kind ,patient,27.77777777777778,6
um reading  it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading ,patient,26.666666666666668,3
I'm still not all there ,patient,50.0,1
now it's been three years ,patient,50.0,2
um I can  I really can't read  I say ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
um sentences  maybe ,patient,0.0,1
it depends on what we're talking about ,patient,75.0,4
I'm starting to read um books from like little kids books ,patient,33.33333333333333,7
um now I can do some of that ,patient,62.5,3
writing is not as good ,patient,20.0,2
so  I use my phone ,patient,50.0,2
but um therapy people was showing me like apps  stuff like that ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
because someday if you can't write again there's other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that ,patient,45.0,7
so  well  I can't remember the first thing we're talking about ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
sorry about that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
see  this is me laughs ,patient,50.0,3
okay  kʊzu ,patient,0.0,0
um let's see ,patient,25.0,2
um I  th does it have to  so  what ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
are you talking about just um a story are you saying ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
or are you saying like something about something like that ,patient,80.0,6
okay  um I think um is  is new stuff ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
I  I think um since  since I'm i a teacher ,patient,61.53846153846154,3
and I was before ,patient,75.0,1
um but now I hafta um be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school  right ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
so  one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke ,patient,35.294117647058826,5
they have aphasia ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and we  um when there's a new patient here um I  I like to help them ,patient,36.84210526315789,3
they're gonna have the  sa the same struggles most of the time that I had ,patient,44.44444444444444,7
and so um now we  we are now friends ,patient,30.0,2
I can help them to have her ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
um and um tips I can give them ,patient,37.5,2
um and so now when I do that kind of stuff I'm now a teacher again ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
so  I  I like that ,patient,57.14285714285714,0
and they're also now my friends ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I  when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
so  I haven't seen some of them now for years ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
they don't call me back ,patient,50.0,1
they don't understand me now ,patient,50.0,1
um so  my new friends are kinda like me ,patient,40.0,3
we're very  uh we talk a_lot which is good ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
but um I think that we have bad days ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
um therapy is hard some days ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
um um some days our brain  mine  my  I would say my brain doesn't always work some days ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
um my eyes don't always work ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
um my foot  now that we're talking my foot's not working right now ,patient,37.5,4
um things like that ,patient,50.0,2
but um my life being a teacher and a friend is  uh is an awesome thing to me ,patient,47.368421052631575,4
yeah  yeah ,patient,0.0,1
okay ,patient,0.0,0
I can't see us on the last one because we're in the middle ourselves ,patient,68.75,4
so  I'm not sure what's under the last one ,patient,58.333333333333336,5
um looks like there's a boy that's been um hitting the ball round ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
probably a ,patient,50.0,1
I remember the name of those little guys ,patient,50.0,4
but um they're playing that ball ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and it looks  he hit the window ,patient,37.5,3
and uh um it hit the window and went in ,patient,20.0,2
so  it crashed the window ,patient,50.0,2
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
and I don't know if it's his house or not ,patient,50.0,3
it could be someone else's house ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
but  um and he also hit the lamp also ,patient,20.0,2
and the guy ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I'm gonna move this again just a minute and I'll ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
um so the guy is  well  he has the ball ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
but I don't know if he ,patient,57.14285714285714,1
yeah  he's just looking ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
so  I don't know if that kid decided to leave ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
or if he's gone growls ,patient,50.0,1
so  that  that must be  there should be more story line on that one ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
I don't know if he  r he ran or if the  da if the guy's just going ,patient,47.61904761904761,4
 where'd he go ,patient,60.0,1
okay  laughs okay ,patient,0.0,1
um one of the kids have ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and mom said ,patient,0.0,1
 there's probably gonna be a rain today ,patient,30.0,3
 and so bring your that's my word  bɚɛləu ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and the kid said ,patient,25.0,2
 nah I don't need it ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and I'm sure mom said ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 okay ,patient,0.0,0
and so  but he went outside ,patient,14.285714285714285,0
and here comes the rain um going faster even maybe more raindrops ,patient,8.333333333333332,5
and so then d um he said ,patient,14.285714285714285,1
 okay ,patient,0.0,0
he went the other way home and said ,patient,25.0,2
 you're right mom ,patient,40.0,2
 I should've had it ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and so mom gave it to him ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and then he went back outside for school with the bɚɛləu ,patient,36.36363636363637,6
yes  that's a funny one laughs ,patient,37.5,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um it  it looks like there's uh a cat s stuck in the tree ,patient,43.75,3
and so dad said ,patient,0.0,1
 I think I can help and had a ladder and got up there ,patient,28.57142857142857,5
and the um ladder fell down ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and so someone must've called the uh fire people ,patient,40.0,2
and they're going to get him out_of the  uh the tree and h maybe even the cat ,patient,36.84210526315789,5
um let's see ,patient,25.0,2
there ,patient,100.0,0
yeah I don't know if it's really dad  I guess ,patient,46.15384615384615,0
maybe it's just someone who is helping for the cat ,patient,63.63636363636363,5
or if it's you_know the little girl's dad that did that ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
I'm not sure ,patient,50.0,1
I don't see any houses around ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
so  it's hard to tell ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
um she had her bike  I guess ,patient,37.5,2
but  uh and there's a dog obviously that's barking because there's a guy up there in the  in the tree ,patient,44.0,7
so  yep ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
I don't remember her name  sorry ,patient,37.5,2
it's hard ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
um okay ,patient,0.0,1
she um ,patient,50.0,1
let's see ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I don't remember where she comes from ,patient,62.5,3
but um she's in the  um the house with um the ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
it's not her mom ,patient,60.0,2
it's um ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I don't remember what calls that ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
but it's not her mom_momnn you_know ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and  but s there's two other sisters ,patient,11.11111111111111,2
and they get to do whatever they want during the day ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
but the other girl hasta clean and  um and do all the stuff that who wants to do  right ,patient,23.809523809523807,5
and um I'm sure she's  uh but she's  yeah she watches the  um the castle the big one ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and I'm sure that she watches and thinks ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 oh I wish I was over there ,patient,37.5,3
and um then th they  um we get a letter that says they're gonna do a ,patient,36.84210526315789,5
let's see what ,patient,50.0,2
it's not a party ,patient,60.0,2
there's a word but I don't have it ,patient,50.0,2
the ball ,patient,50.0,1
that's what they call it  yeah ,patient,62.5,2
so  like uh a party in a way ,patient,44.44444444444444,0
but you ba dance and look beautiful ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and um everyone could go ,patient,40.0,1
and I think they're going to do that because they want the um prince ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
I think he's a prince ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and he finds  he needs to find a lady ,patient,30.0,4
and so there's a way to do it  I think ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  um they said ,patient,20.0,2
 let's do this ball and find some cute ones for him ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and um so when they got their paper um I think she even gets to go ,patient,31.25,3
she didn't say she couldn't go ,patient,50.0,2
but she had a beautiful dress in her um ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I say it's not  it's not a  a box ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
it's something pretty ,patient,75.0,2
but I don't know what they call those things ,patient,50.0,3
and um but she was looking at the dress ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and oh I'm gonna look so good ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and the other girls um they don't look as cute ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
but they  um they  s she  l they looked her stuff ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
and they wanted this and that and dress  and h um tore her dress and everything ,patient,29.411764705882355,3
and so they were gonna go ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and she looked  she didn't have thing ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and so she was sad ,patient,40.0,1
and the fairy um ,patient,25.0,1
I think that's what she is ,patient,85.71428571428571,3
I don't remember ,patient,50.0,1
right now she's different than the one you watch her another way ,patient,53.84615384615385,6
laughs useta be a small one ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
now she's a  l a real lady ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
but um she was there ,patient,40.0,1
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I can help you ,patient,60.0,1
and so she takes the  um the rats and  and the dog and everything become people ,patient,27.77777777777778,3
and the pumpkin they make it pretty for her to go in there ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
and they gave her a dress that looks beautiful ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 but you can only stay until midnight ,patient,37.5,2
and so she may forget that part at the beginning ,patient,50.0,3
she's just  she's so excited ,patient,50.0,3
she doesn't think about the time very well really  laughs ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and so  um so  then ,patient,14.285714285714285,0
let's see ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
um she gets in there ,patient,20.0,2
and I'm sure that everyone says ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
 ooh she's here ,patient,40.0,1
and  um but the uh ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
he's not a king yet ,patient,50.0,2
the prince sees her and said ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 whoo she's cute ,patient,40.0,1
and so they dance and  and everything ,patient,25.0,1
and um all_of_a_sudden she does figure out the time ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and she looks at that and says ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
 uhoh I gotta go ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
