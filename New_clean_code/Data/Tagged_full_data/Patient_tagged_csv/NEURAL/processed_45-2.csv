well for the most part or  or  I guess I'd hafta say m most of the time I think it's doing a_lot better than it  it  it had done ,patient,42.85714285714285,9
and  and we're talking of_course a after my stroke  right ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
hopefully I wouldn't have ,patient,40.0,1
yeah  so  I think I  I'm doing better ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
have a way I hafta like go ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
but I think I'm doing better ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I've been trying really hard to think ,patient,37.5,2
and  and I don't mean to keep blabbing ,patient,20.0,0
I'm sorry but ,patient,50.0,1
I'm just talking ,patient,50.0,1
earlier um I think it was  yeah this morning I was telling somebody here my wife or my kids or something about how sometimes I feel like a person that's just not born but whatever ,patient,48.64864864864865,2
what I mean is there's things I've just forgotten all about ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
we  we got to eat a couple of things and I just forgot ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
oh I forgot what that even is ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and so in a way that's kind_of exciting ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
but then you feel like ,patient,40.0,1
 oh_my_god what's happened to me that I couldn't remember xxx ,patient,53.84615384615385,2
so but  yeah but overall better  better hopefully ,patient,0.0,2
I'm hoping ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
yes ,patient,0.0,0
absolutely ,patient,0.0,0
um no  I  I probably feel like I blabbed too much about that last time ,patient,41.17647058823529,3
so  it ,patient,66.66666666666666,0
I had come home ,patient,50.0,1
and uh it wasn't very late in the day ,patient,40.0,3
I think it was maybe twelve or one o'clock  I think ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and uh I had uh decided to look outside to see if we got any  um yeah any like  I'm sorry  any like  um uh any  I'm sorry  any mail ,patient,39.47368421052632,5
and um I walked back in the house and said hi and gave them the mail  I think ,patient,31.57894736842105,5
and anyway I um just started feeling really weird ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
and I can't even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it ,patient,43.75,3
but I uh decided I wanted to just to sit down with our  with my like bedroom ,patient,38.88888888888889,5
and I did ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and right away it just started getting worse ,patient,12.5,2
and it really hurt ,patient,25.0,1
and for me it was you_know my left side  I guess ,patient,50.0,2
but it was probably other ones ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but I think I felt more here ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and um something  I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really  very very different and strange ,patient,21.73913043478261,0
and something was  was kind_of scary ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and um she started talking with me ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and realized  she asked me a few questions ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um she could tell after several things she'd asked me that I wasn't making enough sense ,patient,47.368421052631575,4
and then I started feeling almost sick ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
and she got me a thing in case I did ,patient,50.0,2
and I did getting sick ,patient,40.0,1
and she right away knew to get me to uh a  a hospital ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
and uh I think that  well  my wife and my kids knew  they probably figured some things out because with  um my wife's mom had passed away uh about s six months or something I guess it was before that ,patient,37.77777777777778,7
I think that's about right ,patient,50.0,3
and I think  last thing I'm saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit ,patient,59.375,7
and um so I was thinking about that and praying about that ,patient,50.0,3
and that's the last thing I can tell you ,patient,60.0,3
we were going to the hospital ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and I was trying  she was asking me a_lot_of questions as she was driving ,patient,60.0,3
and I was doing the best I could ,patient,62.5,3
but I  I couldn't really explain very well ,patient,30.0,2
so  it was a pretty uh whew wow pretty intense thing that happened ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
that is a fantastic question ,patient,60.0,2
um and if you asked my that before I'm not even thinking of that ,patient,60.0,3
so  I'm just saying that's a really excellent question ,patient,50.0,4
um well  my wife and my kids came from church ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
friends had been all so wonderful ,patient,50.0,2
and especially as a wife and kids they um asked me a_lot_of questions ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and part of the whole thing I don't know how to say it  um is they've had to figure out what I'm trying to say ,patient,44.82758620689656,5
and uh they've been very patient about this when I get stuck on something ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and every now and then I get a little bit upset ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
but not upset like crazy scary something ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
y I just  I just get frustrated because I know what I'm trying to say but I can't think how to say it ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
but anyway so they've  um also  also with them I should have said um my sister ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
my sister is always  always one of my best friends ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
she's a couple years younger than me ,patient,62.5,4
and  a and her husband too ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
um they've all gotten back ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and they showed me a_lot_of photos and remembrances you_know ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
things that I remember ,patient,50.0,2
and s…õnu ,patient,0.0,1
I don't have it here ,patient,50.0,1
but like they'd gaven ,patient,40.0,1
like if it says like uh um dogq a picture of a dog ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
they give me tons of those ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
but my wife's is the main one ,patient,37.5,2
she's helped me out so much ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and like I say they've had to guess what I'm trying to say ,patient,40.0,5
or like I'll say ,patient,40.0,1
 oh it's like this ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and then they're all trying to ge imit,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and then finally someone will figure ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I'll say ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 yeah that's it ,patient,60.0,1
that  that's it ,patient,80.0,2
you_know but it's getting to the point where um hopefully as I'm getting better I hope um they'll sometimes say ,patient,47.82608695652174,4
 you_know FirstnameJ now y y y you know what that  what that  that  that means ,patient,36.84210526315789,1
 so  you just keep trying ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
you_know  so  that's been a_lot_of  a_lot_of it ,patient,36.36363636363637,0
and then I think also with me  with me playing music um my wife's realized that so much of that seems to have come back which is amazing because for a long time I didn't do music for a long time in my life ,patient,44.680851063829785,6
I started again awhile back ,patient,20.0,2
but stuff's back there from when I was a kid ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
it's just back you_know ,patient,40.0,1
oh  and one more thing ,patient,0.0,3
we really love certain tv shows and um sometimes movies ,patient,10.0,2
and a_lot_of those have  have helped me too ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
there's certain ones that we just really like ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
that I don't know it just helps me you_know with anyway ,patient,50.0,3
so  that helps at all ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
so  uh it was gonna get something else but I can't think what to say ,patient,38.88888888888889,3
um um sorry  I'm stuck on what the name of the show is ,patient,53.333333333333336,7
I guess that  that's probably not very im important  sorry ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
we  I liked  I watch a_lot_of older shows ,patient,30.0,2
and some of those are just great ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
they're just great ,patient,50.0,2
anyway  so  that's what I've got ,patient,50.0,2
cool  yeah  there are just certain ones ,patient,11.11111111111111,2
and some of the especially  I'm not trying to uh say anything whatever bad about newer shows because there's certainly some good new ones I'm sure ,patient,43.333333333333336,6
but some of those older ones are just  just so great ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
sometimes they're so th well thought out or just so funny ,patient,25.0,3
y the  a and so even when I was a kid there were certain shows that everybody remembered ,patient,47.368421052631575,3
you_know it's just I'll say something that's kind_of probably silly ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
but they're showing with tv now um uh the guy with the Fonzi going heyq ,patient,37.5,5
you_know it's just one little  that's not a very deep thing ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
but something like that back then that was everybody knew w who that was ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
anyway it's the best I've got ,patient,62.5,3
sorry  sorry  that I'm  I'm  I'm taking a second ,patient,50.0,4
I'm trying to decide which one I had mentioned ,patient,50.0,4
my wife um and that's a very  very vital one ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
I thought I'd try to think of uh something else too ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
and every one I'm thinking of i isn't much to say in there ,patient,40.0,4
so  and there's a_lot I just  just  just think of it ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
um I thought of one that would be very hard for me explain that ,patient,57.14285714285714,5
I just  I wouldn't be able to get all in my head ,patient,50.0,5
um well  okay ,patient,0.0,0
with my wife again when we got married  w when we were married ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
I mentioned that ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
but I don't think I mentioned this ,patient,50.0,2
um after we'd been married for a couple days we went up north up to Wisconsin and no  yeah ,patient,47.61904761904761,5
and no yeah  and then we went ,patient,12.5,2
uh sorry  Wisconsin ,patient,0.0,1
als s what I meant to say was actually  actually next to that which is like  which sorry  which  which is Michigan ,patient,46.15384615384615,12
and we went up to Michigan to stay ,patient,37.5,2
oh_brother  it uh ,patient,25.0,1
how could I not think of that ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
I could draw a picture of it ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
I could drive where to get there ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I can't think what it's called ,patient,62.5,2
oh Mackinaw ,patient,0.0,1
and we stayed at uh Mackinaw ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and that was fantastic ,patient,50.0,1
we had a few days ,patient,40.0,2
and um we stayed at a beautiful place ,patient,37.5,3
and um it was just so peaceful and just beautiful ,patient,20.0,3
and at  at that place I had mentioned which took me while to get out as k…îku ,patient,55.55555555555556,6
well  up in Mackinaw uh they can't have any vehicles and cars ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
so  you just hear this little clip clip clip clip clip of  of  of  sorry  of a horse  horses going imit,patient,29.629629629629623,12
and uh we just were out there ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
we had a s suite I guess you'd call it  o our third floor ,patient,43.75,2
and we could open it up and look down there and just see these  these horses ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
and it was just so peaceful and so beautiful ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and um that was uh a wonderful time ,patient,37.5,2
um just being married and having a life together with each other ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and looking back at that and seeing there's a_lot_of other all around that whole place ,patient,31.25,5
but I remember that particular part of it ,patient,50.0,3
um and there's another one that's close to it ,patient,54.54545454545454,5
uh I guess it was ,patient,60.0,2
I forgot if it's before or after ,patient,75.0,3
right around there we went to a place called the Sleeping Bear Dune that this guy that I knew years ago had just told me ,patient,40.0,5
 oh you should go there ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and so we went there not even knowing how to  how to get there because back then we didn't have like uh our  um our interuhnet ,patient,31.03448275862069,6
we had to just figure out how to get there ,patient,30.0,3
but we found this place ,patient,40.0,2
well  you  you  you  you go up real high ,patient,38.46153846153847,2
and then when you finish you can just run down ,patient,50.0,2
that was one of the neatest things ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
when I went up all the way high and we could look down there it was just beyond beautiful just unbelievable ,patient,47.61904761904761,4
and so when I think about that too I just  I just  I just get  just get happy ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  that's my little stories ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
um on number  on one um there's a guy  a boy whatever ,patient,40.0,4
and he's got a soccer ,patient,50.0,2
and he's hitting the soccer ,patient,50.0,2
and on the second one looks like he is ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
oh I see it now ,patient,40.0,1
he's hit it ,patient,75.0,1
and you can see actually where it's actually  where they have it showing w where exactly went ,patient,52.63157894736842,4
and he hit by mistake I'm sure but hit one of the um ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
oh  let's see here ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
let me think what it's called ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
one of the um houses ,patient,40.0,3
and it got crashed ,patient,50.0,1
and on number three ,patient,25.0,2
oh_boy  there's the  the man that probably owns the house there who was sitting down probably just trying to just relax and all_of_a_sudden probably got oh_my_gosh what was that scared but realized what happened ,patient,32.432432432432435,11
then um that just crashed and  and  and broke ,patient,9.090909090909092,2
and so again I missed you on that but I think ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
because I can't see him ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
but it looks like he's probably angry ,patient,50.0,2
a but he's  he's like holding it ,patient,70.0,4
and he can see what made it get broken ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and I think that's end of the story  I think ,patient,50.0,5
how much time ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
d d do you hafta s make me start right away or ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
I've got it  okay ,patient,50.0,1
I got stuck on that one thing ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
there is a thing called a  god crud  called an  called  wait a minute  called an  an umbrella ,patient,29.166666666666668,5
and there is uh a  uh looks like a boy um who's younger and his mom who looks like she is telling him ,patient,48.0,7
 you need to wear or I_mean  you need to have th that ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
I'm sorry ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
yeah I said it again ,patient,40.0,0
 that  um th need to have that  that umbrella in_case it starts to rain ,patient,23.52941176470588,5
so  he just kind_of is ,patient,50.0,2
 oh  no  mom ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
I  I  do I don't  I don't need that or I don't want it or something ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
and she looks like she's a_little concerned ,patient,50.0,4
and  and that was on  on number two ,patient,40.0,0
on number three um looks like he's now outside ,patient,40.0,2
and it's starting to rain ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he now realizes he needs to ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
a and can  now I'm on four ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
um he turned around to the left to run back ,patient,40.0,3
and he's realizing he really made  made a  uh a goofy mistake and should've listen to  to h his mom ,patient,40.0,6
yes and number five he's like back to see her ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
he must be in the house because now I don't see all the rain coming ,patient,62.5,4
but he's like soaked ,patient,40.0,2
and she looks understandably kind_of upset ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
don't want to say angry but kind_of upset ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
and so now he's going ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
this is number sev six ,patient,40.0,2
he's going back outside ,patient,40.0,2
and he now has what he should have had for the dang it  for the dang it  for the  the umbrella ,patient,58.333333333333336,7
and oh as he's going now he's not getting soaked because he is wearing  having an umbrella ,patient,50.0,4
that's it ,patient,100.0,1
uh this is hard because I hafta ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
okay uh I understand what's going on ,patient,50.0,2
I gotta think of all the different  what they're all called ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
well  okay  I'm just gonna put it the way I would say it ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
uh there is a dad ,patient,40.0,2
and  ris oh I see what happened ,patient,25.0,2
it looks like he might have tried to ,patient,62.5,2
uh could be two  two possibilities ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
okay um he has a very tall like tree ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he's  he's  he's up there ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and he's like stuck ,patient,40.0,1
it looks like the ,patient,75.0,2
what is that called ,patient,75.0,1
web ,patient,0.0,0
what is that thing called ,patient,60.0,2
um I guess that's what makes it what I have  what's happened to me ,patient,64.70588235294117,6
I can't think how to call a certain thing ,patient,40.0,3
a thing that he normally could have s stuck in front of ,patient,58.333333333333336,5
oh I just touched something  sorry ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
touch something thank_you  sorry ,patient,40.0,3
and that looks like that had like fallen down ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
looks like he was going up there to get a  um to try to help to get  to get yeah to  to get a  uh a cat ,patient,22.58064516129032,8
and looks like his I guess  daughter is looking up at the cat ,patient,50.0,5
probably she's um ,patient,50.0,1
 oh  k kitty  get on down  cat ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
like she's concerned about the kitty ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
um there's a little um ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh it's hard to explain  isn't it ,patient,40.0,3
there's a little thing that she could have been maybe ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
uh what do you call those things ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
as a kid you can  you can get there ,patient,60.0,5
and you can drive ,patient,50.0,1
um it could have even have fallen down the  fallen down what he needs to not be stuck ,patient,52.63157894736842,6
I'm not sure ,patient,50.0,1
anyway on the other side behind him uh that's a dog ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
dog's up there woofing woof woof woof probably wants I don't know  saying ,patient,12.5,5
 get on down ,patient,25.0,1
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
and then on the last part here uh there are two s responders  pers people coming trying to help ,patient,15.0,5
and there is a um ,patient,40.0,2
something else I forgot what it's called ,patient,62.5,3
oh what is that called ,patient,60.0,1
we see that um where they would use to have gotten around there ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
I can't think what it's called ,patient,62.5,2
and the last thing on the very top of that is a  um a bird ,patient,50.0,5
that's the best I can do right now ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
um the story of Cinderella ,patient,40.0,2
um I guess it starts off ,patient,50.0,2
leas at least the way I remember ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very  um v very good people ,patient,35.294117647058826,6
and they treated her as they should very  very  very kind and with  with a_lot_of love ,patient,36.84210526315789,4
and um that would  would of_course have been great except um her  her like mother died ,patient,50.0,4
and I guess a_lot of those like Disney shows do that sometimes ,patient,41.66666666666667,6
and um so the dad was a good man ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but um like a_lot_of people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else ,patient,30.0,4
and so that ends up happening ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and really messed up by marrying this other woman ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
who ends up  she's just so cruel and so selfish ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um oh okay what I should say before t also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life ,patient,48.0,6
and so what I mean now is that the ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
uh what is it called ,patient,60.0,1
the other woman um she now has uh the power I guess where she's really being awful with  um with  s with Cinderella ,patient,42.30769230769231,6
a and I guess maybe even the  her d dad might've died ,patient,35.714285714285715,0
I don't remember about that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
anyway  so  they're showing  they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed ,patient,37.5,4
she went through um a really nice life which was deserving to her because she was a very  very  very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
so  now that the other mother is now there um the other mother uh makes Cinderella do everything ,patient,31.57894736842105,4
all the washing and uh everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do ,patient,52.94117647058824,5
and these  those two sisters  the  sek fes the other s sighs ,patient,26.666666666666668,3
what are those called ,patient,75.0,1
those two other girls um are just so mean to her and so just very s like very snotty horrible ,patient,25.0,4
don't even care about Cinderella at all ,patient,25.0,2
only that they can get whatever they want ,patient,62.5,2
they make her do everything ,patient,60.0,2
but even so she still  seems to still have an amazing way to be uh lovely and sweet and caring ,patient,14.285714285714285,6
and so um I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place ,patient,39.39393939393939,10
I can't think what it's called ,patient,62.5,2
um beautiful place ,patient,0.0,1
so  sorry  somebody's walking back here and I'm  I'm getting this for um ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
s okay so  um okay  I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the  um that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman ,patient,41.02564102564102,0
I guess ,patient,50.0,1
so  oh  this is hard ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  the  um the like ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
s how's that  I'm in track where they are ,patient,75.0,4
so the  so  it's made by decree that they should have  uh they should have this like  th yeah okay this like  this like ball ,patient,51.61290322580645,4
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta  hasta come there ,patient,40.0,5
and then they'll be able to  dec to figure out who's the best one that he should  he should marry ,patient,50.0,7
so  then they showed in the picture if I remember right uh his ,patient,50.0,3
 oh  good  we all get to go to the ball ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
and sh s she's excited because she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will  will be  uh that they will want one of th them ,patient,54.83870967741935,6
so  they're all excited including Cinderella was excited ,patient,40.0,3
but lo_and_behold um I think it showed that the other mother says ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
 oh  no  you're not going there ,patient,30.0,3
seems to me like I remember like the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear  I think ,patient,57.14285714285714,7
anyway  so  Cinderella part of her  part of how she's just so lovely and kind um even the little  um a little like um sorry like √¶n…ôb…ôlu ,patient,31.25,0
um so  they even do what  help to try to make her what she can wear ,patient,38.88888888888889,5
and I think I'm  what happened with that ,patient,60.0,4
anyway  yeah  then it gets messed up ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think that's where it shows Cinderella really  for the first time really crying ,patient,44.44444444444444,6
really just destroyed because it's like ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
 come_on I can't even you_know do anything ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 I can't even d d go to this ball ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
I'm being  it's like they think she's just nothing ,patient,76.92307692307693,4
and um she doesn't deserve any of that ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother pops out_of nowhere ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
and she makes a beautiful outfit ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh then she uh ,patient,20.0,1
oh_boy the  the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where um ,patient,47.05882352941176,6
uh yeah with  with  with  it's like a pumpkin ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
and the animals are made to look like they're uh people ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
uh um and just  the fairy godmother has told her ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
 you can go back ,patient,40.0,1
 you can have a  have a  have a great time ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
 but by the stroke of midnight it's all gonna go back the other way again ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
so  I think it showed Cinderella arrives ,patient,37.5,2
and they can see that um the other  uh the other  the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like ,patient,41.66666666666667,6
 oh_no Cinderella's here ,patient,0.0,0
and uh then the um ,patient,20.0,2
why this is really hard to explain this ,patient,50.0,2
then the um guy ,patient,25.0,1
I can't think what he's even called now ,patient,50.0,2
uh oh how embarrassing ,patient,25.0,3
um I can't think of the name of the guy ,patient,54.54545454545454,5
the young man who's gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her ,patient,31.25,6
and he is  is very interested in her of_course ,patient,50.0,5
and uh he seemed like a nice man like a good man ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
and  and she of_course is a absolutely very wonderful and very very good um um girl ,patient,17.647058823529413,4
and they get to dance ,patient,20.0,2
and it's just almost magical ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
they're just obvious those two are meant to be like in love ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
so  then Cinderella leaves or  sees ,patient,12.5,2
 oh_no it's almost midnight ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  she has to suddenly run ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
he's thinking ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 wait wait ,patient,0.0,1
 come back ,patient,0.0,1
 come back ,patient,0.0,1
and as she's running down her slipper  a grass ,patient,54.54545454545454,0
and she hasta keep running ,patient,20.0,2
so  then I think the pictures show that she's back home ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and she's  she's just happy that she got to do something ,patient,50.0,4
um and then they find out that ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
uh boyco my brain ,patient,25.0,2
that there was a s grass ,patient,50.0,2
or they're  they're gonna find who was that woman who we actually  would of_course have been cin cin cin Cinderella ,patient,48.0,9
and so they go to every unmarried young woman ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and none of them  it doesn't fit right w with any of them with the slipper grass ,patient,52.63157894736842,4
I can't talk right ,patient,40.0,1
with the slipper ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and um it does for  s for Cinderella ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and so she becomes married ,patient,20.0,1
and I think I missed one thing in there ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
seems like the  the mom ends up breaking that or something first ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
I don't remember that ,patient,60.0,1
but anyway they find the other one  like I say ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
and  and that fits ,patient,20.0,0
that's the only one that  that fits right ,patient,50.0,4
and it's obviously she's  she's the one ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
and then it shows that they get married ,patient,50.0,3
and they're happily ever after ,patient,50.0,2
I think that's it ,patient,80.0,2
uh yeah you'd open up each of the  each of the like sorry  each of the like jellies ,patient,57.14285714285714,7
excuse_me let me let me start over again ,patient,37.5,3
peanut butters ,patient,0.0,1
oh  wait a minute ,patient,20.0,2
I'm saying that backwards ,patient,60.0,1
peanut butters ,patient,0.0,1
oh yeah okay ,patient,0.0,1
first I have to get out ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I can't think what to call it ,patient,50.0,2
what I would made hot ,patient,60.0,1
I'd take probably two of those ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and then get peanut butter ,patient,0.0,2
and go inside it ,patient,50.0,2
and take one ,patient,0.0,1
and put it around ,patient,50.0,1
right  both maybe  maybe ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
and then get the jelly ,patient,20.0,2
put it around there ,patient,25.0,2
that's the best I've got ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
