it's pretty good ,patient,50.0,2
but it's pretty good ,patient,40.0,2
understandable ,patient,0.0,0
yes I do ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
well  no  I don't remember the stroke ,patient,40.0,3
I remember the first one that I had ,patient,50.0,3
and I remember the third one that I had ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I do not remember the second one ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
okay uh I can tell you about the first one ,patient,50.0,3
I'll tell you that one ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
um the first one um I was home alone ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh FirstnameS had gone to get her uh hair cut about twenty five miles away ,patient,13.333333333333334,6
and I was working here at the house ,patient,50.0,3
I was  uh I was  I was  I'd been working on  uh on doing some carpenter work in the house ,patient,56.00000000000001,8
and uh I started to feel  um I started to feel kind_of numb in my right hand ,patient,22.22222222222222,6
um I didn't feel too bad ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
but I knew from what people had told me what I'd heard uh many times the  one of the signs of a stroke is uh numbness ,patient,50.0,7
in_fact I remember I was  uh uh a fellow that w I used to work with had a stroke at work ,patient,40.909090909090914,5
and I remember going through that and um kinda recognize from that how it looked ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
um so  I  I  I  I knew what was going on ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
I knew I was having a stroke ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
um against my  well  I probably  sh I shouldn't have done it ,patient,43.75,1
but I  I called FirstnameS ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 uh you prolly ,patient,25.0,0
 um I'm gonna head  I'm gonna go to the hospital ,patient,37.5,5
 I don't feel right now ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 I'm not sure what's going on ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
 but I'm  I  you better  y just come on home ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and uh I'd said ,patient,40.0,1
 I'm  I'm gonna start  I'm gonna head to the hospital ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
 just come on down there to the emergency room when  when you get here ,patient,37.5,3
so  I  I did ,patient,50.0,3
I went out ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and I got in my truck ,patient,50.0,3
and I headed for the  went to the hospital which isn't very far away ,patient,43.75,7
it's you_know six or eight blocks away from here ,patient,30.0,4
and um I drove to the hospital and uh drove into the emergency room parking and uh walked into the  uh walked into the hospital ,patient,34.61538461538461,5
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 um I'm  I think I'm having a stroke ,patient,50.0,4
and they d you_know didn't waste any time ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
said okay ,patient,0.0,1
somebody you_know ,patient,50.0,1
 we're  come on  come on back ,patient,40.0,3
 we'll  we're gonna take you and have someone look at you right away which they did ,patient,47.61904761904761,0
they  they took me put me in one of the examination rooms ,patient,53.84615384615385,0
and uh they started to examine me ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
uh FirstnameS uh she'd  b it was about a half hour away ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
so  she got there after this had started that  uh the ex um z questions ,patient,41.17647058823529,2
I think I  w I think I  they'd uh already taken me to  uh to get a c_t scan or whatever it was um while  before she got there ,patient,44.11764705882353,2
so  they  they when  when  when she got there I was  already had gone in to  uh to get a scan ,patient,48.14814814814815,3
and um so when they had  when I was done with that they took me um uh back into the waiting  back into the room where I was  the treatment room whatever you call it at  at their  in their j emergency room ,patient,52.083333333333336,14
and um I  I remember pretty well that uh you_know FirstnameS was there ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and  and uh I remembered  I knew what was going on uh I  that I was  that I had a stroke ,patient,48.0,1
but it felt like it was probably  it wasn't getting any worse ,patient,50.0,4
it was just stroke ,patient,50.0,1
uh so  I wasn't too worried about it ,patient,40.0,3
but  and at that time it was only still in my  in my um right arm ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
it wad'nt ,patient,50.0,1
I  I could walk  I could walk fine ,patient,50.0,3
there's no  no problem there ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
it was uh in my  in my arm that  that was affected ,patient,64.28571428571429,3
uh didn't affect my vision or anything like that  that I know of ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
uh I was able to drive you_know to the  as I said to the hospital and walk into the hospital and  and  and  and tell them what  what I thought was going on ,patient,42.10526315789473,6
so  uh yeah  so  they looked at me ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
they  they then they  they  um I was there for awhile in the  in the emergency room ,patient,52.38095238095239,0
and then they took me uh and  took  took me to a  um you_know to the um neuro i_c uh uh i_c_u ,patient,28.000000000000004,5
yeah i_c_u ,patient,0.0,1
took me to the neuro i_c_u ,patient,50.0,3
and uh you_know then of_course people came in and examined me ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
and the doctor came in ,patient,40.0,2
and  um and of_course FirstnameS  FirstnameS was there ,patient,20.0,3
and uh I remember the  remember the room real well ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
um I think I was hungry by that time ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
uh uh I don't know how far  how much more you want me to talk  to say ,patient,30.0,5
I can  I can go on talk for awhile if you want ,patient,61.53846153846154,3
but that's  that pretty much the story of the  of the time as  when I had the stroke ,patient,54.54545454545454,8
okay ,patient,0.0,0
uh yes I can ,patient,50.0,1
um my recovery from that initial stoke ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
um I went  uh you_know I was in the hospital for about three or four days ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
and  uh and then uh I went home ,patient,11.11111111111111,1
uh I went home ,patient,25.0,1
and uh we called a  um a neurosurgeon to um take a look at me and so_forth ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
but  uh so  um but I went home ,patient,20.0,1
and um I  actually within a few days uh I was  you_know I said ,patient,37.5,4
 FirstnameS  let's  I wanna try driving ,patient,20.0,3
and  and  and so we did ,patient,12.5,1
we  nice cat ,patient,25.0,0
um so  uh we  we went out to the country ,patient,50.0,3
we live in Wichita and went out to the country and  on some of the country road ,patient,50.0,6
and I did a little driving around ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and I felt like I was pretty good you_know ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and then I did that again a_couple more times other days ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
and uh it seemed like things were going pretty well ,patient,30.0,3
and then I  and then we  uh we  as I said  w made an appointment to go see the n uh neurosurgeon ,patient,26.923076923076923,5
and we went to see the neurosurgeon ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and um uh his name was Doctor LastnameM ,patient,25.0,2
and um he was in a building right there by the hospital ,patient,50.0,3
and um so went to see him and  you_know in his office ,patient,23.07692307692308,4
and he  he explained to me what he thought I had ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
well  you_know he had seen the  seen the xrays and  and the scans and all that ,patient,36.84210526315789,5
so  he knew what was going on you_know ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and he told me what  told me what  what I had ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
and it was a  uh it was a um ,patient,60.0,2
see if I can remember the word ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
um it's probably gonna get away from me ,patient,40.0,4
it's a ,patient,100.0,1
it's on the tip my tongue ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
it's a um ,patient,75.0,1
I don't know if you can  you can help me with this ɑu ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
it's a um ,patient,75.0,1
you can't ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I see you're shaking your house ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
okay uh I have a hard time some sorta remembering what this was ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
it's not a regular stroke ,patient,50.0,2
it's not a regular stroke ,patient,50.0,2
it's  uh it's a uh situation that I've had probably since birth ,patient,56.25,5
and it  the situation is that there is a  um uh a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the um artery ,patient,51.85185185185185,0
and instead of going th through the little capillaries and everything it doesn't go through the capillaries ,patient,50.0,8
it goes directly into a  a vein ,patient,50.0,3
so  there's no  no filter there to  to slow it down or  you_know ,patient,38.88888888888889,3
and so that  that con ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and it  I said it probably was there from birth ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
and it  it didn't blow ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
it just  there was  and it was not a very big  um uh very big spot ,patient,26.31578947368421,0
uh maybe size of a quarter that  where it had bled into my brain ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
but it stopped bleeding ,patient,25.0,1
it stopped ,patient,50.0,1
and  er and everything was going okay ,patient,25.0,2
it stopped ,patient,50.0,1
and there wasn't really much damage ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
so  um so  Doctor LastnameM then said ,patient,11.11111111111111,2
 uh we can  we can fix that pretty easily ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
 we'll take you and put you in the hospital ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
 take four or five days ,patient,0.0,3
 I hafta cut into your  cut into your skull and  uh and go in there ,patient,27.77777777777778,5
 and we'll take that  you_know fix that well  uh actually seal it off ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
 and  uh and then you'd be goo as good as new you_know ,patient,26.666666666666668,3
 it  everything will be okay ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
 and uh you'd be in the hospital four or five days ,patient,38.46153846153847,0
 and then you'll go home ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 and everything will be fine ,patient,50.0,2
uh so  I went home from that appointment feeling pretty good ,patient,25.0,5
um FirstnameS I guess both felt pretty good ,patient,25.0,2
I continue practicing my driving and so_forth ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and uh I went  uh went back and made an appointment to go into surgery uh on  uh on May the first ,patient,25.0,6
that had it ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I'm sorry ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
May the sixth ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
that had all happened on April Fools Day on April first of uh two thousand fifteen ,patient,37.5,5
and um so I went in for the surgery on  uh on uh May the sixth of that year two thousand fifteen ,patient,39.130434782608695,4
and uh little did I know I wasn't gonna come home for quite awhile ,patient,31.25,4
I wouldn't be home for s another six months ,patient,50.0,2
and in the meantime ,patient,50.0,3
excuse the  uh the French ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
the  the shit hit the fan ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
and it did big time ,patient,20.0,2
I'm sorry did I  I'm  I don't mean to um offend you ,patient,52.94117647058824,3
okay  so  um that was  that was  that was  that was my second stoke ,patient,47.368421052631575,0
and um didn't  I  uh then  uh then uh that was  that was ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
well  okay  so  what happened was when I went into the hospital then to have the  that surgery that  that  uh that um ,patient,37.93103448275862,6
uh t and again it's on the tip my tongue ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
that I wanna say what it is ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
maybe I'll think of it yeah ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
so  when I went in to have that taken care of while I  when I was in the hospital then um they did the surgery ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
and the surgery was a suc success ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
uh the problem was that when I went back  when  when I was in recovery from that surgery I was in recovery and um ,patient,57.692307692307686,7
I'll  l ignore that if you can ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
um sorry uh make  make sure it's not ,patient,20.0,4
no  it's not ,patient,60.0,2
okay  no ,patient,0.0,0
um so  um when I ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
the  b let it ring a time or two and go  it'll go away ,patient,29.411764705882355,4
I'm sorry ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
okay  so  I  I  um while I was in recovery um my bla brain for whatever reason ,patient,47.61904761904761,0
and not in the area where the surgery was done but in another area far away from the  that spot ,patient,47.61904761904761,6
it started bleeding ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and nobody knows why it started bleeding ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
but it did ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and uh even_though FirstnameS kept trying to say ,patient,0.0,3
 there's something wrong ,patient,40.0,2
 there's something wrong ,patient,40.0,2
 I know it's something wrong ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
uh because I  I  I  I don't remember it of_course ,patient,50.0,3
I d didn't see it ,patient,50.0,2
my  ha my head was very sw fs sw swollen ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
and  uh and she could tell that ,patient,37.5,1
you_know they tried to say ,patient,20.0,2
 uh well  he's have ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
they  they  they tried to say ,patient,37.5,0
 well  he's having a little stroke and that ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
uh not a stroke ,patient,25.0,1
a  um uh having a uh uh ,patient,25.0,0
I cant remember the word now ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
he's having a uh um whatever it is that they said ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
well  it happens sometimes after surgery ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
it's no big deal ,patient,60.0,2
it'll  it  it is go away ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and uh she kept trying to tell them ,patient,25.0,3
 there's something wrong ,patient,40.0,2
 there's something wrong ,patient,40.0,2
 you need to you_know call the doctor ,patient,25.0,3
well they didn't  well  they didn't get hold of the doctor until number of hours later ,patient,40.0,0
that was at one  about one o'clock  one o'clock one thirty when I came back out_of surgery the first time ,patient,31.818181818181817,4
and at finally about ten o'clock that evening they took me back into surgery ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and uh you_know by that time they'd had done scans and so_forth ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and they could see that the brain was bleeding badly ,patient,50.0,3
in_fact uh about the blood  uh the blood was about three quarters of my brain ,patient,37.5,4
it was so bad that they didn't know if I would be ɛbɚu ,patient,64.28571428571429,4
uh and if I did come out_of it didn't know for sure if I would ever talk walk ,patient,47.368421052631575,1
if I'd even know anything ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
if I'd just hafta be spending the rest my life in a care home ,patient,53.333333333333336,3
they didn't know ,patient,50.0,1
and uh so um I didn't know if you'd me to go on some more about this ,patient,47.368421052631575,5
I_mean I can talk for a long time about this if you want me to ,patient,60.0,4
so  you ready to go on ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
I'm sorry I can't even hear you ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
yes  um yes ,patient,0.0,0
um of_course I when I was  when I was in the hospital um um I don't remember ,patient,57.89473684210527,6
you_know for about two months I don't remember anything ,patient,40.0,4
and I wasn't doing anything ,patient,50.0,1
I  as far as I know I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not but probably not because there wasn't anything to work with ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
um I  you_know I couldn't talk ,patient,37.5,2
um I couldn't um do anything ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and interestingly in July ,patient,25.0,1
so  that was  that was  that was May ,patient,63.63636363636363,0
in July  middle of July somewhere I had another stroke ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and they ,patient,50.0,1
I was at that point  I was in the  uh I was in uh a rehabilitation center  a rehab hospital ,patient,56.52173913043478,5
and they  uh they took me uh by ambulance because I  I felt  I could feel that something was going on ,patient,54.16666666666666,0
and I was afraid it was stroke ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
but I couldn't say it was a stroke ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
but I knew there was something going on ,patient,50.0,4
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
they took me to the hospital and um did the scans and so_forth ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and sure enough I'd had another  s I'd had another stroke ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
um while I was there in the hospital ,patient,62.5,4
um up until that time I could not move my legs at all ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
my hands I had  I was no  I couldn't do anything with it ,patient,62.5,4
I you_know was just  that's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
but while I was in the hospital um I started being able to move ,patient,50.0,4
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost um my ability to focus my eyes together ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
so  I can only see out_of one eye at a time ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
so  I was wearing an eye patch over one side ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
then I'd wear it for a while over this side then w you_know ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see um with both eyes ,patient,45.0,4
I can steer with both eyes ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
but I'd see different  different things ,patient,25.0,2
and so um when I had the second stroke or well  this third stroke in the hospital uh I  the vision started clearing up ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
and I remember telling me  telling FirstnameS ,patient,37.5,2
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 my visions are getting better ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 I can see better ,patient,40.0,1
 I can focus ,patient,50.0,1
 I can focus with my eyes ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and  um and I  uh sure enough I could ,patient,27.27272727272727,0
and then I also told her that  that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit ,patient,45.0,7
and uh you_know because when you're  when you're paralyzed you're not sure whether it's moving or not ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
you think you're moving it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
but y it really isn't ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 you_know look at my leg and see if it's moving and  uh because I really felt like it was ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and indeed it was moving ,patient,40.0,1
it was moving ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
so  whenever happened in this second stroke was  was good for me because I was able to start moving my uh uh uh muscle ,patient,42.30769230769231,6
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
uh and I was able to um see with both eyes together ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
so  uh I was there two or three days ,patient,30.0,3
and uh they took me back to the  uh to the rehab hospital ,patient,42.85714285714285,6
and um at that point I was able to  um up until that point I'd permy primarily been doing rehab in terms of uh mental stuff ,patient,42.85714285714285,6
and uh at that point then I was t able to start doing sʌmpɪŋu ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
um and you_know as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to you_know start uh make myself move my muscles ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
my arm  I can move my arm ,patient,50.0,3
my hand still wouldn't move ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
we just numbed it ,patient,50.0,1
I couldn't do  anyth couldn't move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that ,patient,42.10526315789473,6
and uh so I  I do remember that when at that  at that point ,patient,56.25,4
and you  you  I don't know ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
are you saying  your question was ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
 do you mame remember anything that helped you ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
um was that the question ,patient,60.0,2
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
and so I started working really hard ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
I started working really hard because at that point I knew that  I knew that ,patient,50.0,4
well  actually you_know I knew it before that ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
that I was some  at some point I was gonna get better ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
I just couldn't do it ,patient,50.0,1
but at that point when fi I was steɪbəlɪu ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and if I work at it hard enough I'll be able to get better ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
so  I  I was in that rehab hospital for  two rehab hospitals for awhile ,patient,47.05882352941176,5
and then I went to a  uh a long term uh uh care facility ,patient,26.666666666666668,5
and I was there for a hundred days ,patient,50.0,4
and they worked with me with a speech therapist a um physical therapist and a occupational therapist ,patient,41.17647058823529,5
uh and the hundred days ,patient,20.0,1
I could've used more but that was the r limit for  because_of Medicare ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
but that was  that was total of six months that I was  um I was um not able to um come  come home ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
men ,patient,0.0,0
so  we put a  put a  put a lift on the back on the port ,patient,50.0,6
and put one  uh put a lift going upstairs because our is  we have two story house ,patient,26.31578947368421,5
and um so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
I hadta  I  I'd had some more rehab along ,patient,50.0,4
I had rehab at home for about another six weeks of  uh of rehab ,patient,40.0,4
and uh he was very very good rehab  rehab specialist ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
I did some uh other um you_know uh occupational and  uh and  and  and  uh occupational and physical and ,patient,8.695652173913043,6
what's the third kind ,patient,60.0,2
uh anyway I'll come  I'll coming up with in a minute  in a minute ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
so  I did that ,patient,60.0,1
and  but I  I never did  I  I never did give up ,patient,37.5,3
I always continued to work as hard as I could ,patient,40.0,3
um you_know I  I had  had a very good physical therapist to help me ,patient,25.0,3
and uh so we worked hard on that ,patient,37.5,2
and that took me until ,patient,60.0,1
and it  a actually and then I got uh when I was  when I was uh still at ,patient,50.0,0
then I went to  uh we had uh therapy on an outpatient basis for awhile at a rehab hospital here on outpatient basis for several months ,patient,37.03703703703704,6
and um during that time I met uh uh a um ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
I don't really know how to describe him ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
he's a  he's kind_of a  um he's  he's kind_of a um ,patient,61.11111111111112,4
he does not have a  um he's not  he's not a p_h_d ,patient,50.0,3
but he is a  a doctor of education or something like that ,patient,61.53846153846154,5
but he is very very good at um working with stroke people um in  in  in terms of  um in terms of cognitive ability ,patient,37.03703703703704,5
and  and I worked with him for about almost four years ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and um in_fact I've just got work when  I quit working with him maybe in the last six months ,patient,38.095238095238095,4
um we were  went to his office  went to uh ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
well  he had an office ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
it  it  it  it  he didn't have an office there ,patient,46.66666666666666,0
he had a  um he came to a  he came to uh a university here ,patient,47.05882352941176,5
and he would meet with people there at the university ,patient,50.0,3
and I  I was still in a wheelchair at that time ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
and um I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was  when I was actually in  in a walker for another  s another year ,patient,57.49999999999999,10
and then when  when I went to uh uh walking with  uh with a cane I continued working at  with him ,patient,45.83333333333333,6
but it  his  his  his ,patient,50.0,0
I witch ,patient,50.0,1
but he works with  with the cognitive abilities ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and he helped me a_lot you_know ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
in_fact some of the things that we've done here is  reminded me of some of the stuff that he's done  that he did with me ,patient,65.51724137931035,7
you_know t nell telling stories and  and  um and a_lot different tests that  um that I'm sure you're very familiar with ,patient,26.923076923076923,7
um but he was  he was able to work with me and just pull stuff outta me and make it work ,patient,36.36363636363637,5
and maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was  was kind_of inspire me to keep going and working working working ,patient,29.166666666666668,5
um so  I did that ,patient,50.0,2
and I worked hard on that ,patient,50.0,2
and I  I worked hard ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh when I  when I actually  when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me um I went to the YMCA ,patient,50.0,8
and I got a membership in the yl and  and hired at the yl a uh personal trainer who  who didn't really know anything about strokes ,patient,41.37931034482759,7
but she learned ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
she was very good at studying and learning ,patient,37.5,3
the first day that she saw me uh and I  I was so stiff that  sh that I couldn't move ,patient,47.82608695652174,4
I  I couldn't move any ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
my arm was just ,patient,50.0,2
I don't know if you can see it here ,patient,60.0,2
it's  you_know your arm is just like this ,patient,60.0,3
and it has clenched fist and everything ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
 holy_cow I  I can't move it you_know ,patient,40.0,3
and it wouldn't move ,patient,40.0,1
she worked with me ,patient,75.0,2
uh I went twice a week to go with her ,patient,50.0,3
uh and then in addition to that uh ,patient,37.5,3
buh but after a while I went  started  I'd say ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
 FirstnameS take me down to the yl and let me uh ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
I was  I was still using my walker ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
I'd say ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 let me  just take me down the yl and let me walk around the track with my walker ,patient,45.0,6
and I'm sure people probably thought stupid dumb ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
here's this  this old guy walking around with his  you_know very very slowly ,patient,31.25,5
it'd take me  you_know it'd take me ,patient,60.0,2
it  it's uh six  six times arounds ,patient,30.0,0
and it would take me uh probably half hour to walk around that lap ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
uh but I was  I was determined to do it ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and I did it ,patient,50.0,1
I did it ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and um then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
I still go very slowly ,patient,20.0,2
um but I'm doing it ,patient,50.0,1
so  I'm gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself ,patient,42.10526315789473,7
and I'm not trying to pat  pat myself on the back ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
and I'm sorry for them ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
they don't ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
but  and I think  I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive ,patient,37.5,0
I did not lose my drive ,patient,50.0,2
always  I've always been kinda driven anyway ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
you_know I've always been driven ,patient,50.0,1
but I was driven to  hur to improve and get better ,patient,25.0,3
and I'm still  go I'm still doing that ,patient,45.45454545454545,1
and I'm getting there ,patient,40.0,1
and it will never come to an end ,patient,50.0,3
but it  I will keep working at it ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um well  when I ,patient,40.0,0
okay  I tell you about my wife ,patient,50.0,3
how's that ,patient,100.0,1
at my wife ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
I  uh I'd been married before ,patient,62.5,0
my first wife had Huntington's disease ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
I don't  n don't know if you're familiar with it ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
but she had Huntington's disease for many many years ,patient,20.0,4
and she passed away um oh about twenty years ago ,patient,10.0,4
um I had a  uh uh I had a friend ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
now uh uh how do I go into this ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
um when she passed away  before she passed away ,patient,60.0,2
um this gets complicated ,patient,25.0,1
okay my  my wife's  my wife's brother  um my wife's brother um had moved to Texas ,patient,27.27272727272727,5
um in the  in the nineties they  they moved to Texas ,patient,53.84615384615385,6
and uh sh in Texas she met and became very close friends with uh someone in  in Texas there that  that she didn't know ,patient,37.03703703703704,6
uh but they  she met ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
they  bec you_know they worked together ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and they became very very close friends ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
um are you in for a long story ,patient,62.5,3
uh so  so  uh my sister  my sister inlaw  uh sister inlaw her name is FirstnameD  okay ,patient,22.727272727272727,6
and uh so they moved to Texas ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and at some point they moved back to Wichita ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and he went to work for  for Boeing  okay ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
so  um at some point this friend of  friend of hers was going through a divorce ,patient,50.0,5
she  she'd been married for almost twenty years ,patient,50.0,4
and  and  and it end  didn't end up very well ,patient,21.428571428571427,3
so  she was going through a divorce ,patient,62.5,3
and so um FirstnameD who is my sister inlaw invited her to come to Wichita uh just because she needed somebody to  you_know she  wa she  she needed to  needed to get away from the si situation that she was ,patient,40.909090909090914,9
and so she  she moved to Wichi Wichita ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh because_of the friendship that my sister inlaw had with her um we got to know  know them ,patient,35.0,4
my  my wife and I got to know them ,patient,40.0,3
but not very well because my wife had Hunting's ,patient,20.0,3
and you don't socialize very much when you have that exist ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
so  I really did not know her  them  their friend very well ,patient,40.0,3
but we did see them once in awhile when we'd go  like go to uh a family gathering or go to their house because FirstnameD would be there ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
and her friend would be there and  and so_forth ,patient,30.0,2
and so that was  that was like nineteen ninety one or something like that ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
well  uh to make a long story long um uh FirstnameD's friend then moved to get  got married  got  got married  remarried and uh went to  went and moved to California ,patient,13.157894736842104,5
uh she was out there for about a year ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and she came back to Wichita ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and her  hu and her husband he came back to Wichita ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh he had his  her husband had a uh heart transplant ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
if  if he  you having a hard time following  following this that's okay ,patient,47.05882352941176,6
I'll  it  I'll try to bring it all together ,patient,53.84615384615385,0
she ,patient,100.0,0
and uh it  uh it didn't take very well you_know ,patient,25.0,2
heart transplants they're long drawn out ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and s she ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and finally he gave out ,patient,40.0,1
in the meantime my  my wife uh with Huntington's disease um was moved to a uh ,patient,44.44444444444444,6
w uh we had her at a uh nursing home ,patient,40.0,3
she spent five years in a nursing home ,patient,37.5,3
um now then  and her nursing home was the same town about four or five blocks away from FirstnameS's friend ,patient,18.181818181818183,5
I had no idea they  that she lived there ,patient,50.0,3
you_know I had no idea that she lived in that  in that town or anywhere ,patient,50.0,5
um so  um so  at one point my wife finally you_know she went downhill and went downhill and  and  and passed away in uh two thousand two ,patient,19.35483870967742,5
uh I called FirstnameD my sister inlaw to tell her that  that FirstnameJ had passed away ,patient,41.17647058823529,1
and uh FirstnameS uh and  and no  and uh FirstnameD said ,patient,7.6923076923076925,4
 I can't believe it ,patient,50.0,1
uh FirstnameC just died yesterday ,patient,0.0,1
and FirstnameC is FirstnameS's husband ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
I say ,patient,50.0,1
 they  they both died within one day of each other ,patient,50.0,0
 um strange coincidence ,patient,0.0,1
um over  over time um I  it  and not right away but over time I uh ,patient,31.57894736842105,2
FirstnameS was living up there in the  in  in  in Sedrick  the town of Sedrick where the nursing home was ,patient,45.83333333333333,7
and at some point FirstnameS said or  um uh FirstnameD said ,patient,16.666666666666664,4
 you_know what ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
 denay FirstnameD ,patient,0.0,0
 did you_know that ,patient,50.0,1
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 no  I had no idea ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
so  uh you_know after  after  y after you lose a spouse um it's very difficult to  for people to understand where you're going through when you lose a spouse ,patient,48.57142857142857,5
and uh I  uh uh I went  I was in this little town where FirstnameS lived ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
didn't really have any  any  uh didn't have any uh limits on fireworks ,patient,35.294117647058826,5
okay  that's only important because uh my kids wanted to have  fire wanted to have some fireworks ,patient,25.0,6
and uh uh you_know oh  oh my kids wanted to have some fireworks ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
so  I said ,patient,50.0,1
 well  I'll tell you what ,patient,50.0,2
well  not my kids my grandkids ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 I'll tell you what ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 we'll  g we'll call FirstnameS and ask her if we can go up there in Sedrick wh where they have no limits on what you can shoot off ,patient,53.125,9
so  went up there  went up there ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
and  and uh you_know I just said ,patient,12.5,2
 FirstnameS  can we come up there and shoot off some fireworks ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 sure  come ahead ,patient,0.0,2
so  we did ,patient,50.0,1
and then we started  started kind_of getting to know each other at that point ,patient,26.666666666666668,6
because like I say you don't  you  you  if  unless you've lost a spouse you don't realize what it's like ,patient,60.71428571428571,7
and so FirstnameS I kind_of had an immediate bond there because we had both lost  v recently lost our spouses ,patient,38.095238095238095,4
and both of us had spouses that add ,patient,50.0,3
it took years before he passed  passed away and  and my sh my wife ,patient,31.25,3
and so you_know we started  we  s you_know it's  it was a  it was a  nat kinda a natural bond ,patient,46.15384615384615,2
and so we ɑtu ,patient,25.0,1
and um here we are ,patient,40.0,1
and uh so FirstnameD is still  FirstnameD is still FirstnameS's best friend ,patient,14.285714285714285,4
in_fact she was here just d yesterday or day before ,patient,30.0,2
um they're still best friends ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh that's what happened to me was uh you_know my we me wet ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and uh that was fifteen years ago  fifteen years ago that we got married almost fifteen ,patient,29.411764705882355,4

and he kicks it  ri uh ha kicks it really hard ,patient,25.0,1
raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and then it goes to um it  uh then you see the  um the soccer ball travels through the air and hits a window ,patient,34.61538461538461,2
uh there's shutters on the window ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
um it's  um it's a nice size picture  not a picture window  good one  good size window ,patient,26.08695652173913,4

but uh he um gets up  picks up the s soccer ball  walks over to the window ,patient,36.84210526315789,5
and um uh you_know the  the window ,patient,25.0,3
I think we talked about this last time ,patient,50.0,3
the window is there ,patient,50.0,2
the  uh the lamp where the  w where the  where the um soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore ,patient,48.0,0
it's  the lamp is gone ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
the curtains are  are  are little bit different ,patient,40.0,3
um there's  um I'm not sure what  what  I'm not sure what the uh ,patient,45.0,5
yeah it's  there's  there  I'm not sure what some of the s something is there the ,patient,59.09090909090909,7
anyway though there's a lady ,patient,50.0,2
um and  but the  the lamp and the chair are no longer there ,patient,26.666666666666668,4
um and I think the  uh I'm gonna say that the  uh the window ledge is  is lower than it was ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
it just  it looks different ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
um but the guy he looks out the window ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and I think  uh I think he doesn't know where it came from ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
but I am sure he's probably going to find out ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and he's probably going to uh make somebody's pay for the window ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
so  the moral of that story is if you're gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesn't go through the window ,patient,48.14814814814815,8
the end ,patient,50.0,1
oh  I forgot the beginning and the end last time  didn't I ,patient,26.666666666666668,3
okay  the beginning is that they  uh uh the  the  the  the  the little kid ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
I think it's a boy ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
is going off to school ,patient,60.0,2
and the mom tries to hand him a  uh an umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and he says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 mom  I don't need an umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 I'm a big kid ,patient,50.0,2
 I don't need umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 it's not gonna rain ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 I'll walk ,patient,50.0,1
 I'll be okay ,patient,60.0,1
so  he waves goodbye to the mom ,patient,50.0,3
he's got his backpack on ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
head for school ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
waves bye  tell  tells  uh tells mom goodbye ,patient,0.0,3
and she's standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesn't wanna take with him ,patient,47.05882352941176,5
so  he starts walking off to school ,patient,50.0,3
and um there's some  some raindrops coming down  not a_lot but just a few raindrops here and there ,patient,23.809523809523807,4
and uh he looks up at the sky ,patient,50.0,3
and he's like ,patient,50.0,1
 oh_no what did I do ,patient,50.0,2
 I didn't  br I didn't bring the umbrella ,patient,41.66666666666667,0
so  he said ,patient,50.0,2
 I think I'll  I think I'll go home and get the umbrella ,patient,43.75,5
and he turns around ,patient,50.0,1
and he  and it's raining harder ,patient,37.5,2
and now the wind's kinda blowing because the rain's coming at an angle ,patient,40.0,4
and uh it's  it's quite a bit of rain because as he  as he runs he's  he's uh splashing ,patient,61.53846153846154,6
so  there's enough rain that's making  making little splashes ,patient,30.76923076923077,5
and he's uh kinda holding his hand up over his head like  as_though he's gonna be able to stop the water off his head ,patient,46.42857142857143,7
but he runs home ,patient,25.0,1
and uh you can tell the  say the mom is a little  a_little um perturbed but he get  because he wouldn't take the umbrella ,patient,39.285714285714285,6
so  there  there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the mom just kinda looks at him like ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
 you  you  you_know y you  you shoulda listened to what I said ,patient,43.75,3
he said ,patient,50.0,1
 okay  I'm  I'll  okay ,patient,40.0,2
 so  give me the umbrella ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  she gives him ber uh umbrella ,patient,37.5,2
and he head  heads back to school ,patient,25.0,3
and uh it's still raining ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
it's still raining pretty hard ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh it's coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was ,patient,62.5,4
so  it must be belo blowing pretty hard at a forty five degree angle ,patient,40.0,7
and uh he's walk  he's got his backpack ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and he's walking h off to school ,patient,50.0,3
and uh I  the  uh the moral of the story is listen to your mom ,patient,47.05882352941176,7
she knows best ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
the end ,patient,50.0,1
oh  yeah  I've seen this one before  okay ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
okay ,patient,0.0,0
so  the beginning is  the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and the little girl is upset because the cat's up the tree ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and she can't get her down ,patient,57.14285714285714,1
I think she's calling the cat to come down ,patient,50.0,3
but the cat won't come down ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  uh either cat won't or can't ,patient,30.0,0
but it looks like the cat really doesn't care to come down ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
he's like ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
 I'm here on this branch ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
 and I'm happy ,patient,40.0,2
 so  yall can worry about it all you want ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
 but I'm not coming down ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
so  the little girl says you_know ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 daddy daddy daddy ,patient,0.0,1
uh and she's  uh the little girl is probably ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
she's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and she got pigtails and little black sandals ,patient,12.5,3
um like I said she's riding  riding that little trik tricycle ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
the cat won't  the cat won't come down ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
so  apparently the  uh uh the  the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and uh he  he leaned the ladder against the tree uh to crawl up there ,patient,31.25,3
and um something happened ,patient,25.0,1
I'm gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree uh ran into the ladder or something ,patient,47.61904761904761,6
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
the dad's stuck in the tree ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and um I don't know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone ,patient,43.75,4
maybe it's  maybe uh uh ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
that's  he musta had a cellphone ,patient,50.0,2
he calls the fire department ,patient,40.0,2
and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and they're carrying their ladder ,patient,50.0,2
and they're running over to get the man down outta  outta the tree ,patient,40.0,4
um meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
I don't know if he's  I don't think  I don't think he's mad ,patient,55.00000000000001,4
I think he's just ba barking up the kriu ,patient,50.0,4
so  the  um the firemen are on their way ,patient,54.54545454545454,0
they've got their ladder ,patient,60.0,2
um truck's sitting out and set on the  setting out on the street ,patient,40.0,5
um there's a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
um and um yeah then that's  that's pretty much it ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
it's a  it's a  it's a big tree  big tree ,patient,56.25,4
um yeah both ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and it is  it's summertime because the trees have leaves on  on ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
uh yeah  okay  well  that's  that's about good ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
alright  well  at the beginning I  I don't know if this is true or not ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
I don't know if this is really what  what happened in the story ,patient,60.0,5
but looks like  um it looks like that for some reason um maybe somebody took  somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else ,patient,42.30769230769231,6
and um I don't know the story behind that ,patient,50.0,3
but that's what it looks like ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
and then  um so  she says ,patient,25.0,2
 great  you_know I've got my two dollar ,patient,30.0,3
 and she can be  you_know they can all be friends ,patient,58.333333333333336,2
well  when  when she's gone it turns out that um Cinderella actually became more of uh a servant than a friend ,patient,45.83333333333333,7
um uh she musta  she musta been sleeping in the  um uh out in the stable with the animals  I guess ,patient,41.66666666666667,7
um she  in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
um she was doing their laundry ,patient,50.0,2
she was doing all the work ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and um like I said she had become more of a slave than  than anything else ,patient,47.05882352941176,6
so  um they lived in the  in the shadow of  of the castle ,patient,50.0,7
and  um I think she dreamt about the castle ,patient,40.0,4
um looks like she was in the one picture  it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that ,patient,65.625,4
that's what it looks like anyway ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
and um so it turns out that the  that the king  little short fat king ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
I don't know why the little short  why the king is always short and fat but he is ,patient,45.0,4
uh is looking for somebody to marry his  his daughter ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and uh he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom so_that the  uh the  the  the girls can have their  their pick of uh ,patient,45.71428571428572,8
they can't have their pick ,patient,50.0,2
but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball ,patient,60.0,7
and uh they'll have a chance to show off to  to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him ,patient,46.15384615384615,6
so  um he sent out this invitation ,patient,37.5,0
and of_course the  um the  the  the wicked stepmother or the  whatever she is  the mother  she um of_course doesn't let  doesn't want Cinderella to go to the ball ,patient,36.84210526315789,7
so  uh um the other girls go off to the ball ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and Cinderella stays home ,patient,0.0,1
and  and she's go gotta tend to the animals or whatever ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
um so  the uh fairy godmother came along ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and I'm not sure how she got into the story ,patient,54.54545454545454,5
but she came along ,patient,25.0,1
the fairy godmother um showed up and al a with a  uh with a carriage a pumpkin ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
uh it was that  um the I guess fairy godmother turned the  turned the  turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a  for the  gir for Cinderella to ride in ,patient,45.71428571428572,6
they went to the  uh went to the ball with the two horses and  and the footman and the  and the driver and all that ,patient,42.85714285714285,6
they went to the  went to the ball  they went to the ball  but uh they went to the ball ,patient,47.82608695652174,4
and the  uh nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
so  she uh the  uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the uh pumpkin ,patient,45.83333333333333,6
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
they  uh up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see it's about a minute before midnight ,patient,52.38095238095239,5
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the  uh before the  the um pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while it's still a carriage ,patient,44.0,5
runs ho or  runs and g dʒɛnu ,patient,0.0,2
but uh in the way she lost her slipper ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
she was running down the stairs ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
the slipper fell off ,patient,50.0,2
and uh she didn't have time to go back and pick it up  I guess ,patient,29.411764705882355,4
so  she went on  got in the carriage with you_know the carriage and went home ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
the  uh the prince was heartbroken because he and  and me  because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the  who had come to the ball ,patient,55.55555555555556,12
and nobody knew who she was ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
but he had fallen in love with her ,patient,62.5,2
and so he sent  uh he sent  everyb he sent his um man or servants or whatever out to find this  uh the person whose foot would fit in the slipper ,patient,35.294117647058826,10
and so they went to Cinderella's house ,patient,25.0,4
and um of_course the  uh the two sisters there uh they tried it on ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and of_course it didn't fit ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and uh so the  uh Cinderella was there as a servant ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh I think the  uh I think the uh fairy godmother or something said  made  um worked it out somehow that  so_that the  uh the  the prince would try the slipper on Cinderella's foot ,patient,33.33333333333333,11
and sure enough it fit perfectly ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
it was perfectly obvious whose  whose foot it was ,patient,60.0,3
and it was Cinderella's ,patient,40.0,2
and so um everybody was happy ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
all the animals were happy ,patient,60.0,2
the  l the animals were  cel the  the little rats ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
everyone was celebrating uh as the  uh as Cinderella gets in the  uh the  the carriage with the prince ,patient,50.0,7
and they ride off into the distance and live happily ever after ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
you get  uh you  you get some  you got some bread ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
that's the first thing  I guess ,patient,50.0,3
get  get  get the bread out_of the  uh out_of the  out_of the refrigerator because I  we keep our bread in the refrigerator ,patient,40.74074074074074,5
so  you get the bread out ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
then you go to the pantry ,patient,50.0,3
and you uh get out the  uh the peanut butter ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
open the peanut butter ,patient,25.0,2
and is  is this a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
I  g I think it is ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
so  then I  uh then uh I go back to the refrigerator and uh take out the  uh take out the jelly ,patient,36.0,4
and uh open up the bread sack ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and open up the uh peanut butter jar ,patient,25.0,3
and open up the  uh open up the uh jar of jelly ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
uh I go to the uh knife drawer near the drawer where we keep the silverware ,patient,50.0,7
and I take out a knife and uh take out two pieces of bread ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and I spread the peanut butter on  on one of the pieces of bread ,patient,46.66666666666666,6
and then I uh take another piece of bread and spread peanut  um jelly on the  on that one ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
I put them together ,patient,50.0,1
and um I uh go put the  uh the  wo the knife in the dishwasher so it gets cleaned up ,patient,50.0,5
and uh put the jar  jelly jar back in the uh refrigerator ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
and put the uh uh bread back in the refrigerator ,patient,30.0,4
and then I go over and put the uh uh peanut butter back in the pantry ,patient,31.25,5
and then I uh sit down and eat my peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient,21.428571428571427,4
and that's it ,patient,75.0,1
