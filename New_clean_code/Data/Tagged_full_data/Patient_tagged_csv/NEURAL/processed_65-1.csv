the eighty four incident last I remember is five days before that ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
let's see ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
it happened on a Thursday March the eighth of eight four ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
I remember we were at some friends' house having supper the previous Saturday night ,patient,40.0,5
and I remember nothing  nothing after that until  until  until after outta i_c_u and started  re started remembering things slowly about uh three days after I was moved out  moved out_of i_c_u ,patient,37.83783783783784,4
and the  the  the eight  nineteen ninety uh ,patient,27.27272727272727,0
let's see the ,patient,50.0,2
uh I was crossing tenth street Indianapolis ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and I remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk ,patient,37.5,4
crossing with the light and seeing  getting up close in the quarter panel on the car going from west to east ,patient,40.909090909090914,8
and then I have the sensation being spun around ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
that's the last  last I remember thing from  last thing I remember for probably I don't know twenty  twenty minutes or so ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
eighty four  INV,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
it was very  that was really troubling uh because  uh really troubling because um didn't know where I was ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
and there were visitors in the hospital room  in  in my hospital room ,patient,40.0,5
and these guys were saying  the  the  z the visit ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
I  I knew who they were  knew  knew these  these people ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
but there's a_lots  lots_of them there ,patient,25.0,3
I didn't know where I was ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
there were lots_of  pe there were several people visiting me ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and  and there uh several of them asked ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
 well  when  when is his voice gonna come back ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
 when is his voice gonna come back ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I thought was perfectly fine ,patient,40.0,3
uh and  but what I didn't know uh was that the  I'd spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat uh in a  in a coma ,patient,47.05882352941176,6
and  and it looked like I wasn't gonna come out anytime soon ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
they gave me a tracheotomy ,patient,60.0,2
uh and  uh I  and so the  the  s what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords uh changed my voice pretty radically where  where my wife had  had told me ,patient,37.5,7
she said  she said that the  uh uh said that you  you  you had the ,patient,47.368421052631575,5
so  I said ,patient,50.0,1
 actually there it  there it was ,patient,37.5,3
 the one thing she liked about me ,patient,50.0,3
 and that was gone ,patient,40.0,0
uh s uh so  but that was  that was extraordinarily troubling because I  d I  like I said didn't know where I was ,patient,46.42857142857143,6
my  and people I rec recognize  it's  recognize saying ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
 when does  when does voice gonna come back ,patient,36.36363636363637,0
and it was rea really really troubling to me ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
really troubling ,patient,0.0,1
that was  that was one of the first of my  mem first of my memories ,patient,58.82352941176471,12
well  it's  what  what it ended up being was that the  the uh ,patient,61.11111111111112,4
in terms of my brain injury if you will uh certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling ,patient,42.10526315789473,5
um um and you_know just when  when  when I happen to get  get focus on something I didn't par particularly understand or  or  or approve of I get  get or  it  it didn't show up ,patient,31.11111111111111,12
but it was xxx extraordinarily angry ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and did  never did lash  did  never did lash out ,patient,38.46153846153847,2
uh but just but real  really angry ,patient,0.0,3
and  and I kept it all internal ,patient,37.5,0
it was very  very  very troubling really troubling for a  lon for  for quite a while ,patient,40.0,5
and  and  and  and I don't want you to ever to relate to that ,patient,27.77777777777778,3
I wouldn't  w I wouldn't wish that in  I wouldn't  wouldn't wish that on anybody ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
the  almost  nine  uh nineteen ninety was almost a what ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
again ,patient,0.0,0
th that's always say ,patient,40.0,1
it was like just  just a  just a  just a rerun but not near  not nearly as severe ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
but the  the eighty four incident was  uh uh was  was most interesting because  because uh uh an engineer for my  the company that I was employed by uh uh ,patient,42.85714285714285,7
I was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning I had a wonderful career ahead of me ,patient,47.61904761904761,7
was gonna go far in the organization ,patient,37.5,4
and  and  uh and my  one of my supervisors told me ,patient,28.57142857142857,6
and he wasn't supposed to do this ,patient,37.5,2
told me  told me I was  I was on the highpotnn list which meant again in my  I was going far ,patient,54.16666666666666,9
my career was laid out in front of me ,patient,66.66666666666666,4
uh there was  there was nothing stopping me ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and then uh after the eighty four incident a personality change which I find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
which I find out twenty years later is endemic ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
uh and the  uh and  and I sound different ,patient,18.181818181818183,0
uh I was slower to comprehend things ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
uh but finally did after bit  taking  taking more time would comprehend things ,patient,20.0,5
and  and  uh uh and  and I couldn't do my engineering job to  to  to suit me ,patient,26.08695652173913,2
and I didn't  didn't tell anybody that ,patient,50.0,2
I didn't tell anybody that ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
tried  I faked it ,patient,40.0,2
I faked it and spent my lunch hours for months I was um by myself in a  in a conference room uh relearning aspects of my job and not telling a  not telling a soul because I just knew ,patient,43.90243902439025,7
this was before  before eighty eight ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
nineteen eight  nineteen eighty four again ,patient,0.0,0
actually before the American of Disabilities Act ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
eighty eight ,patient,0.0,1
and  and I was on  on the accident in eighty four ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
I was on company business ,patient,60.0,3
and I knew  I  I just knew that  that uh m…ëtu ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired ,patient,40.0,3
I knew I was ,patient,75.0,2
had three kids a wife and spouse uh just a l lovely  lovely  lovely  lovely woman uh there at home with the three kids ,patient,18.51851851851852,4
and I was the  f I was  I was the income ,patient,61.53846153846154,2
and I couldn't  I couldn't stand the thought of being fired ,patient,50.0,4
uh and  and so like I say  like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and it took me  but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that  that uh I was no longer on  on the fast track ,patient,43.75,5
no  no  no longer ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
it took  I wasn't  it wasn't obvious at first ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
but I  I was no longer on the fast track ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and  and  uh uh and the b b biggest most difficult part of that was the  was the short term memory  just short term memory difficulties ,patient,23.33333333333333,6
uh and so uh I ended up with uh a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my  help my short term memory ,patient,31.03448275862069,4
uh so  it was  it was uh uh uh uh largely the  the um aphasia and  and people seeing me differently at work ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and of_course I'm  of_course I look on back  look back  look back on it a few years after that ,patient,39.130434782608695,6
and  and I did not deserve a  to be on the fast track ,patient,40.0,0
I  it  wa it  it  it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me ,patient,58.82352941176471,0
but it wasn't obvious to me ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
uh and that the uh writing everything down was  was uh the biggest  uh as uh biggest assistant  as assis assistant  assistance to me that uh helped  helped me do my job ,patient,37.83783783783784,8
the  basically it was being the  the  the ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
I  I  I call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident ,patient,26.666666666666668,5
uh that's  that's how my  my  my life has been defined ,patient,62.5,6
uh and uh I  it's  I just  it  um that  that  that is  that is what I call my  my  my defining moment the  the  the  the defining event ,patient,47.61904761904761,7
because I've struggled with the  the uh aphasia obviously and memory issues uh ever since then ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
and  and  uh uh and  and  uh I_mean like for example uh the  the  um the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was out_of engineering school at Purdue ,patient,22.857142857142858,0
had a job in Indianapolis ,patient,40.0,3
and so uh the  ec as economic viability I  I  I paid rent to my folks  lived in the  lived in their house ,patient,39.285714285714285,5
and that winter my dad and I put the  uh put an Oldmobile vl eight in a Chevrolet Vega a little small car ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
a and uh it was quite an interesting  interesting project ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and  and in interestingly enough I can probably ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
the  the  the engine had a Rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties ,patient,42.10526315789473,0
and I could probably still today ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven ,patient,25.0,2
I could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and  but  but  but I  prob but I could  ask me what I had for supper last night head,patient,29.166666666666668,3
can't tell ya ,patient,50.0,1
so  yup ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
short  short term memory issues ,patient,0.0,3
but  uh but then things from  from  from long ago  and uh do  uh do  uh do  do som something long ago I  c I can  I can reconstruct like it was yesterday ,patient,33.33333333333333,8
uh no  actually I was  uh I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering ,patient,37.5,3
uh and  and I got out_of school the spring of seventy six ,patient,23.07692307692308,4
had a job at a company named Shwitzer ,patient,37.5,5
uh they're in Indianapolis ,patient,60.0,2
and Shwitzer no  sh Shwitzer no longer exists ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
but uh I was in engine cooling engineering at  at coughs with uh Shwitzer ,patient,40.0,6
and so  so uh I  uh my  my customers were we'll  we'll call it  for engine cooling fans for Shwitzer were uh Ford light truck  Ford heavy truck ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
uh uh the Ford  uh one of the small Ford Pats cars had uh a Cadillac excuse_me  Pontiac ,patient,20.0,5
um and the uh uh Chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  I was already doing that kind of stuff as my  as  as a job ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
but then uh my  my father found this  uh this article on engine conversion on the Chevrolet Vega ,patient,35.0,6
uh and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and I to  to  to build together that winter uh while  while  uh while I was working the automotive industry's field ,patient,45.0,6
and  and uh it  uh um it  xxx it's kinda how I  hap kinda how I gravitated ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
well  it was  it was real  it was a real sleeper ,patient,50.0,3
meaning that  uh the  the hot car at the time was the  the Datsun two forty zl ,patient,40.0,5
uh it was a real  it was uh the first of the t Datsun uh uh zl cars ,patient,42.10526315789473,5
uh and  and uh uh I useta uh from a stoplight dust those guys off ,patient,31.25,0
and they couldn't  they  and those  the  the other guys the drivers of Datsun's zl cars couldn't figure out how in the hell this Vega beat the shit out_of them ,patient,43.24324324324324,0
it was  it was  it was  it was  it was a_lot_of fun seeing looks in their faces as it  in my rearview mirror ,patient,57.14285714285714,8
uh okay ,patient,0.0,1
this story is there's a  a  a young lad ,patient,50.0,5
looks like uh uh maybe  maybe teenager like a sixth grader or seventh grader kicking a soccer ball ,patient,21.052631578947366,6
and then  and here it kick xxx puts the soccer ball through a  through a  a house's window ,patient,31.818181818181817,5
and the soccer ball comes through the house's window and  and lands on a  on a  a  on a  an adult male  uh male's lap in the house ,patient,36.11111111111111,7
and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the  through the hole in the window and says  trying to figure out what's going on ,patient,40.625,6
and done ,patient,0.0,1
uh looks like a  a  a  a young  a young boy is leaving ,patient,41.17647058823529,6
and his  his  we're gonna say it was mother says ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
 he here's  here's your umbrella ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
uh and he says ,patient,25.0,1
 no  I don't need that ,patient,50.0,3
uh and then  then he  he  he  he leaves saying goodbye and everythings ,patient,23.52941176470588,5
and the mom holding the umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the  the  the young lad is out and about walking around ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and it starts to rain ,patient,20.0,2
then it starts to rain heavier ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and he's running ,patient,50.0,1
and he gets back to his  to his mom so soaking wet ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and he's not happy ,patient,40.0,1
nor  neither is she happy ,patient,50.0,2
and then he goes out finally with a  with an umbrella ,patient,50.0,5
and  and  and uh it looks like all is well ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
well  the beginning it looks like a cat  a pet cat had climbed up a tree ,patient,44.44444444444444,6
uh and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
got stuck up in the tree ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
uh a little girl who was probably her owner uh rode over there on her tricycle uh and  and c wants her cat down ,patient,32.0,5
and looks like uh an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is  and is  and is  and is caught up there by this barking dog ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
also  and now then there's also a  a  a bird uh on the other side of this tree singing away ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and there's also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the  the cat and the  and the  and the  and the male  f the  uh the male figure ,patient,36.36363636363637,8
there's  that's  that's a tree by the dog ,patient,61.53846153846154,7
okay ,patient,0.0,0
thank_you ,patient,0.0,0
Cinderella uh was  uh uh her mother passed away ,patient,30.0,3
uh father uh remarried ,patient,0.0,1
and uh uh the  wick there's the  the wicked stepmother had  uh uh brought with her two  two rather mean spirited daughters ,patient,22.22222222222222,7
uh and they  and  and in their  in their home life uh the  uh uh Cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which I always say by the  by the stepdaughters ,patient,39.47368421052632,5
uh uh and  uh um and so just  uh just worked  worked very  worked a_lot ,patient,0.0,3
uh and then uh in the kingdom the king had a  uh had a  a  a unmarried son ,patient,38.095238095238095,5
and one of z…™dv…ë…™zu ,patient,25.0,2
uh and the  and so Cinderella uh with the help of  of the um mice and  uh uh there in the  in the  in the  in the house uh they sewed up a  a really lovely gown for Cinderella to go to  uh to wear to this  to wear  to this dance  uh wear  wear to this ball ,patient,37.142857142857146,12
and  uh uh and the  s the stepmother uh uh was intent on getting one of her  her  her  her daughters married off uh and  and then so would not allow Cinderella to go to the ball ,patient,30.23255813953488,7
uh uh her uh stepsisters went ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and the  uh uh and a  a carriage which looked like a  a pumpkin and then mice who ended up uh turned into horses ,patient,37.03703703703704,6
and I think that the  uh the horse from the house ended up as the  as the  the driver of the  s of the  of the pumpkin carriage ,patient,54.54545454545454,11
and uh uh she  she  uh she ended up going to the ball ,patient,40.0,4
also um the  the  the prince uh danced the night away with uh Cinderella ,patient,31.25,0
and  but the stipulation uh buh from the  uh Cinderella's fella fair fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight ,patient,39.47368421052632,9
so  it was late ,patient,60.0,1
so  she hurried out_of there and left a glass slipper behind ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
uh uh and then  uh and then after the  and the  uh after the  the ball was over the  uh the  the  the prince said there was only  only one person interested in ,patient,34.14634146341464,9
it was the  the gal that left the  left the glass slipper behind ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
uh and  and so the  the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that  that lady who left the glass slipper behind ,patient,41.935483870967744,0
uh and  and it was the  it was the one  it was the  it was the  it was the  the lady whose  whose foot would fit this  uh this small  the small glass slipper ,patient,51.16279069767442,8
and uh the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
Cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper ,patient,37.5,3
and so she was identified as the one that the  that the prince uh uh wanted to  wanted to  uh wanted to marry ,patient,30.76923076923077,8
and  and so the  so  then the  the  the  Cinderella married the prince ,patient,31.57894736842105,0
and they all lived happily  and they lived happily ever after ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
oh  prefer  uh preferably uh uh on  on a wheat bread ,patient,21.428571428571427,4
you would use a knife and  and uh get the  spread the  spread the peanut butter on uh one side of the bread ,patient,34.61538461538461,7
aha but then the  on the other  s other side of the other  other  other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly ,patient,26.923076923076923,6
and then  so  you take a spoon ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
not  not knife because uh you  you cut up  you cut up the  the  the  the jelly and the  and the jar ,patient,41.37931034482759,3
but  uh but you take your spoon and  and spoon out the  the  the uh uh grape jelly on the other piece of bread ,patient,32.142857142857146,6
use that  use the knife to spread out  spread it out ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
then  then put the two halves together ,patient,12.5,2
and you got the ultimate  the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient,23.07692307692308,4
