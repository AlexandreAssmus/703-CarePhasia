uh it's pretty good ,patient,40.0,2
I know I s struggle when I get overly tired ,patient,40.0,3
I  I'm told that people wouldn't know I have trouble unless I,patient,53.333333333333336,3
my hesitation to them I'm told is  sounds like I'm thoughtful ,patient,64.28571428571429,4
they don't understand it ,patient,60.0,1
my hesitation is because I'm struggling laughs ,patient,62.5,2
yes ,patient,0.0,0
sure ,patient,0.0,0
um I went to bed on a Monday night after work ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and uh just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and,patient,26.666666666666668,3
um about uh one or two in the morning uh I hadta go to the,patient,40.0,4
and I was struggling to get the covers off ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I was laying on my left side ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
so  I trying to get the covers off with the right ,patient,50.0,4
and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were ,patient,50.0,3
and uh that was my first sign something was wrong ,patient,50.0,2
I  at first I thought because I had the two cats ,patient,50.0,3
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
but uh they  I  you_know the room was dark ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and finally they came off ,patient,40.0,1
and then I um tried to take some steps ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
the bathroom was the next room over ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and I was um finding that I was exhausted ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed ,patient,56.25,6
uh I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed ,patient,37.5,5
but I just laid on the floor ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
uh I laid there for about thirty minutes ,patient,25.0,4
um my Garmin told me what was going on  the timeline ,patient,50.0,3
and uh so when I got back up I still didn't feel like I could,patient,50.0,3
so  I did and just crawled back into bed ,patient,30.0,4
and uh then about  um I was awake asleep back and forth,patient,15.384615384615383,3
and I was trying to figure out ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
something's wrong with me ,patient,80.0,3
but I don't know if this is major ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and I was trying to decide ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
and um I didn't want to go to the emergency room ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and there'd be nothing wrong ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
uh but I called uh a guy from work ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
I used my phone ,patient,50.0,2
and I thought I was dialing his work number ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
but I got his cellphone number ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  I want to leave him a voicemail message ,patient,40.0,3
and I was surprised to hear him answer ,patient,37.5,4
and that's when he told me ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
 you called my cell number ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  I worked for a very difficult company to work for ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
so  I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh,patient,53.84615384615385,4
but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day ,patient,64.28571428571429,4
and I said uh ,patient,25.0,1
 pass the word on ,patient,40.0,2
 m my brain's not working right today ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
 I won't be in ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and so he just chuckled and said ,patient,14.285714285714285,1
 well  okay  I'll pass that on ,patient,40.0,1
and then I called a friend and uh told him what was going on ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and uh then uh between two of us uh we decided ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
um um well  my  my idea ,patient,25.0,0
 I will call him in a half hour ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
 if you don't hear from me call me ,patient,60.0,3
 if you can't reach me call for help ,patient,50.0,2
so  a half hour later I called him ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and uh I decided I'm going to call my neighbor ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
take me to the hospital ,patient,60.0,3
so  I did ,patient,50.0,1
and my neighbor next door came and got me ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and um w we went to the hospital ,patient,37.5,3
I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did ,patient,60.0,4
it was a great one ,patient,60.0,2
we've got uh four hospitals to choose from ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  I don't re know why  or remember why we went to that,patient,50.0,4
but um she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and uh she was struggling trying to figure out where the,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and at that point I couldn't read ,patient,50.0,3
but I saw the red lettering ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I knew that must be emergency ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and so I pointed to that ,patient,50.0,2
and then  um sh then she didn't know what to do with me once,patient,31.25,3
again she was someone with a brain injury ,patient,62.5,4
so  she was having trouble thinking her way through this ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
and so here  me  I just had a stroke ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
and I'm having to do the thinking laughs ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  uh when we pulled up under the awning there was a,patient,61.53846153846154,4
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital ,patient,40.0,6
and I caught his eye ,patient,40.0,2
and he came out ,patient,50.0,1
and I told him ,patient,50.0,1
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
and I told him ,patient,50.0,1
 I think I had a stroke ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 and I'm afraid to walk ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
um at this point I was not having trouble walking ,patient,40.0,3
but I was afraid I might ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
um earlier in the day in wee hours I was um having a real,patient,42.85714285714285,5
but now I was okay with it ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
um so  he said ,patient,40.0,2
 hold on ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I'll go get someone ,patient,50.0,2
and he got a nurse ,patient,40.0,2
and uh she came out ,patient,40.0,1
and I told her the same thing ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and then she went back and got a wheelchair ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and they got me in ,patient,60.0,1
mhm um I had a_lot_of speech therapy ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
um I went to two different um organizations for therapy because,patient,36.36363636363637,4
so  I wanted more therapy than that ,patient,50.0,3
and uh so I went to both ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  for maybe about I don't know  six or eight months I got,patient,37.5,4
um each uh session is about an hour ,patient,37.5,3
um uh I also did some physical therapy ,patient,25.0,2
but I didn't stick with it ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and so I can still feel like my right leg drag a little bit ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
um and I also have trouble writing ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
so  I have uh some occupational therapy I did as_well ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
um and it  it helped a little bit but not a_lot ,patient,25.0,3
um uh but the speech therapy uh ,patient,14.285714285714285,1
I found uh some therapists I just connected with better than,patient,45.45454545454545,5
and uh the one I spent the most time with I really liked her,patient,42.85714285714285,4
she was very good and very positive ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and as she explained it something important to me ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
she said  um in the beginning she said ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 I'm going to test you right now to see where you're at right now,patient,41.17647058823529,5
then after we work together awhile I'll test you again to gauge,patient,38.46153846153847,2
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that,patient,54.54545454545454,3
so  when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was,patient,64.28571428571429,3
I felt so stupid because I couldn't do them ,patient,50.0,2
but if I'd have known earlier that that's what they were doing it,patient,73.33333333333333,2
but you_know they didn't think to tell me that ,patient,40.0,2
but um I did uh games on my phone ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
um I went to a local college that had uh meetings on uh,patient,38.46153846153847,6
and so the first hour everybody's in the same room ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and then the second hour we're split up into groups ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into ,patient,53.84615384615385,6
so  you go into a group with about four or five other people who,patient,40.0,4
um I bought books uh grade school books for math and reading,patient,16.666666666666664,3
um and I did that on my own ,patient,50.0,3
and I did uh puzzle books ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and then uh I went back to work ,patient,25.0,3
I went back to work very quickly ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
way before I really was able to do much ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
but I just thought ,patient,25.0,1
 I've just got to get in there and do it ,patient,25.0,3
so  I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
um there was something ,patient,50.0,1
oh uh I always liked to cook ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
but now I really kicked it up ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
um I found uh about healthy eating ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and I've always liked junk food ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and I decide to eat really healthy ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
I felt like that would help me recover ,patient,62.5,3
and uh so I  uh I got this ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh learning to understand measurements again was difficult at,patient,20.0,3
but I learned ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I still struggle with it sometimes ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
making conversions is not so easy for me ,patient,37.5,3
but  um but I see the ingredient list ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and then you've got like a paragraph of everythings,patient,40.0,4
so  I've learned to  if it's the first uh two things you do,patient,52.94117647058824,4
and then maybe the next three things you've gotta do something else,patient,28.57142857142857,3
then I color those other three with another color ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
that kind of thing ,patient,50.0,2
and so um then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods ,patient,15.384615384615383,4
and that was motivating for me ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and then I also  uh I was working near a mall ,patient,41.66666666666667,0
and uh so at lunch time I would go walk every day ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
well  the job that I had that was so stressful ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
uh about two years ago now uh they laid me off ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and uh I was happy about that ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
I hated that place ,patient,50.0,2
I loved the work ,patient,50.0,2
but the people were just insane ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh bullying people to get things done ,patient,0.0,3
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over,patient,50.0,7
but I was afraid to look for another job um because if the next,patient,50.0,5
so  I was really afraid to move ,patient,37.5,3
and there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work ,patient,30.76923076923077,5
so  I felt really trapped ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but I was looking ,patient,50.0,1
but it was just  you_know there really wasn't a_lot to pick,patient,38.46153846153847,2
and  well  anyway  the day  three months or so before,patient,21.428571428571427,0
so  I started collecting my information that I was gonna need,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and I put my notes in a notebook ,patient,50.0,3
and I took them out to my car ,patient,62.5,3
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and,patient,50.0,4
I didn't keep them at my desk ,patient,62.5,3
I took everything out_of my office except for things that belonged,patient,63.63636363636363,5
uh I saved off programs I had written  everything ,patient,50.0,3
and so then when the boss and the h_r guy came to my office and,patient,33.33333333333333,3
I tried not to look so happy about it ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
but I was really happy ,patient,40.0,2
and then uh I was out_of work for ten months ,patient,30.0,3
and it was okay because I had unemployment ,patient,50.0,2
I had money in savings ,patient,40.0,2
and I was doing alright with that ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and now I work from home fulltime for a company that's uh in,patient,50.0,4
and uh so uh my boss that's ,patient,37.5,2
uh he's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice,patient,23.07692307692308,3
and I still do the same kind of work I useta do ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
but now it's for nice people ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um this boy is kicking a soccer ball ,patient,37.5,2
and he kicked it right into somebody's living room window ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and it went in and knocked over the lamp ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and the man saw the damage as it happened ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
he got up with the ball in his hand ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
um the mom is uh trying to hand the son a umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
uh but he doesn't want it ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and so she still holds onto it ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
um so  now the boy is walking ,patient,37.5,2
and it's raining on him ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and uh the rain is getting heavier ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and he uh shows up in front of his mom all wet ,patient,50.0,5
and he's not happy about it ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and she's not happy about it either ,patient,50.0,3
um but now he's got the umbrella ,patient,37.5,2
and he's continuing on his walk now with the umbrella ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
um the little girl wants her cat that climbed up in the tree ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
and so the man got up the tree to retrieve the cat ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
um and the ladder fell out behind him ,patient,50.0,2
and the dog is barking at all the excitement ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and the firemen are coming to rescue uh I assume the cat and the,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and uh there's a bird on another branch that's singing ,patient,50.0,5
um the  Cinderella's dad met the woman with the two ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um then um the daughters uh were mistreating Cinderella ,patient,20.0,2
um they are planning to go to the b ball ,patient,40.0,4
um and uh they took a necklace off of Cinderella ,patient,40.0,3
um Cinderella was locked in a room ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and uh some m mice came and  with a key and got her out ,patient,40.0,4
and uh then the fairy godmother provided a horse and a driver ,patient,25.0,3
and Cinderella danced at the ball with the prince ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and um then it was almost midnight ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and Cinderella hadta leave ,patient,0.0,2
and uh as she left she was going down the stairs ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and she dropped her slipper ,patient,40.0,2
and uh then um think it was two men came to her house with the,patient,40.0,4
and it fit Cinderella's foot ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
then uh they knew it was Cinderella was the one who had danced,patient,53.84615384615385,4
and uh then  uh then uh Cinderella and the prince got,patient,8.333333333333332,4
um I would get uh two pieces of bread ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and a jar of peanut butter ,patient,33.33333333333333,3

and then you would uh put those pieces of bread together and put,patient,30.76923076923077,3
