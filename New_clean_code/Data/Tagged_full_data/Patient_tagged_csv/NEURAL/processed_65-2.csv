speech is adequate ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
much improved ,patient,0.0,1
the  uh the halting of  w halting of  of speech ,patient,38.46153846153847,0
um the  what  what happens is that the  uh um if I,patient,53.333333333333336,3
 well  I  sho I shoulda said this ,patient,30.0,4
 I coulda said that ,patient,40.0,2
 why  why didn't I say that ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
uh for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics uh,patient,33.33333333333333,4
uh it helps immensely if I think about it for about a  about,patient,64.28571428571429,4
unle unless I've seen it before uh the  uh the  the ,patient,57.14285714285714,5
and uh it  it is  uh uh uh well  I'll ,patient,35.714285714285715,2
 wh why didn't  why didn't I think of that before ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
I  I  I  be before  before my eighty four accident I,patient,46.66666666666666,4
but uh it's much more difficult and  and uh takes longer,patient,15.384615384615383,3
and that's  it's like I say ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
been that way for thirty six years ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
um the first one was a  where I was tl boned at an,patient,64.28571428571429,3
uh and uh ended up being a ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I  I caught the  uh the uh old International Harvester,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh had a shattered pelvis  broken hip  five broken ribs ,patient,7.6923076923076925,3
did I  did I say punctured lung ,patient,50.0,0
uh seventeen units of blood ,patient,20.0,2
uh three and a half weeks in a coma ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and  uh and uh I  uh in a coma for three and a half,patient,31.25,6
um hospital probably  probably about two and a half months ,patient,9.090909090909092,0
and our third child was born uh three days after I was uh moved,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and the second one uh was uh February of nineteen ninety where,patient,33.33333333333333,4
there was a shared ,patient,50.0,2
uh and  uh and what  uh I believe that I was,patient,38.46153846153847,3
well  I  I guess I don't know how long ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
but uh uh I recall walking across the street starting across,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and then I had the  sen the sensation being spun around ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and then  and then uh uh later like I say I  I  d,patient,18.75,2
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
twenty minutes later ,patient,0.0,2
and  and I  I was  I was in a great mood ,patient,50.0,4
I was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last,patient,53.84615384615385,4
and  uh uh and this one is fe ma uh February nineteen,patient,15.384615384615383,2
and I was  I was  I was  I was in a really great,patient,62.5,6
and then I say a  b a brain injury because uh uh um I,patient,33.33333333333333,4
uh and uh I had  that was  that was  that,patient,46.15384615384615,2
um it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
finally went away ,patient,0.0,1
but I don't  I recall maybe three  four  five days,patient,21.428571428571427,0
something  something like that ,patient,80.0,3
but it lasted a significant amount of time ,patient,37.5,3
uh and  and the  the doctors could not tell me whether the,patient,42.85714285714285,3
it was extraordinary painful ,patient,50.0,2
and  and uh um I recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a,patient,35.714285714285715,3
uh oh uh after  after three or four months when  when,patient,30.76923076923077,7
 oh uh you_know that's probably the most painful injury known,patient,25.0,3
oh okay ,patient,0.0,1
yeah wasn't just me being a big baby then  right ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh he  he  he chuckled ,patient,37.5,3
that  that's kind_of uh it  it ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
th those are the two accidents in  in a  in a  at,patient,66.66666666666666,5
uh West Tenth going into  West  uh Tenth and ,patient,9.090909090909092,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um the  uh um after the first the eighty four incident,patient,33.33333333333333,5
uh wh what had happened was that the eighty four uh laptops,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and  uh um and uh uh uh my  my boss at that time,patient,26.666666666666668,0
I'll call it uh ,patient,60.0,1
I won't say leisure work play with ,patient,37.5,3
but  but uh learn how to use there  there at home ,patient,15.384615384615383,3
and of_course this is before the  this is before the web,patient,66.66666666666666,4
but uh I had been doing a  a Nastran which is Nasa structural,patient,50.0,5
and  uh but that was all that  was all on uh IBM uh,patient,40.0,3
um and  uh uh and so here is just a  a simple little,patient,20.0,3
oughta be able to know how to use that ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and  and so they brought this  uh uh my boss brought,patient,23.07692307692308,0
and  and in those years there was a  a user manual that came,patient,40.0,4
uh and so tried to use a  c a computer  an  op a,patient,25.0,4
uh if you've ever read  uh if you've ever read a Microsoft,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and uh one of  one of the  one  th one thing in,patient,26.666666666666668,6
selectq ,patient,0.0,0
well  had we never had any training in  in a  uh in uh,patient,43.75,3
and  and after several days of trying to figure out what,patient,33.33333333333333,0
th there's one æfeɪʒəu ,patient,20.0,2
select meat ,patient,0.0,1
an aphasia ,patient,50.0,1
uh selectq meant  uh what  what they meant by,patient,36.36363636363637,3
I just could not ,patient,50.0,1
there was no way ,patient,50.0,2
I'm extraordinary troubled really troubled by that ,patient,50.0,3
and so  so finally I called a coworker and uh uh said ,patient,15.384615384615383,2
 what  what  what did the  what does this mean to me,patient,60.0,4
and it described the uh uh tapping the cursor and moving the,patient,33.33333333333333,3
that's what they meant by selectq ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
well  hell  that was never described in the manual at all ,patient,30.76923076923077,5
and that  that  that really  that threw me for a loop,patient,50.0,7
and so uh I became  became uh very questioning as to whether,patient,30.76923076923077,5
uh and  and so  so finally the  the  like I say the,patient,25.0,6
 oh okay ,patient,0.0,1
the most  most s basic of terms which the  the uh um,patient,35.714285714285715,0
or my  uh no  no  this is DOS not Microsoft ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
this is before Microsoft existed ,patient,60.0,2
this DOS manual it did not  did not uh uh uh comprehend,patient,30.76923076923077,3
but they did not ,patient,25.0,1
DOS manual did not describe that anywhere ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and so  so the  and uh so I went back to work and uh,patient,25.0,0
and  and finally uh my  my  after a couple years uh,patient,28.57142857142857,0
 you might  might have it  you take those  take,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and so wow that was  that was a godsend ,patient,50.0,4
I_mean just being able to  to write  write things down ,patient,16.666666666666664,4
so  I  I carry a small ,patient,50.0,2
don't have with me right now ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
but I still  I carry a small  like a small notecard,patient,38.46153846153847,0
because that  that was  that was  writing  when,patient,58.333333333333336,3
holy_mackerel that was  uh that  that was uh um a,patient,50.0,5
um tha that  that in particular ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and  and also I ended up uh uh as a later  as a um,patient,37.5,5
uh I developed uh uh tricks where I when I meet somebody new,patient,46.15384615384615,2
use their name in any kind_of verbal  verbal conversation with,patient,36.36363636363637,3
use name  e use their name every time first or last name or,patient,14.285714285714285,3
and  and then uh after the  after the  after the,patient,46.15384615384615,0
uh and  and  and that  that has been a  uh,patient,35.714285714285715,2
for example I met a  uh in our neighborhood met a ,patient,50.0,4
I'm at  I'm at  I'm at home now ,patient,69.23076923076923,4
not down the farm ,patient,50.0,2
but uh met a fellow in  in the  in the uh neighborhood,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and I got his name ,patient,40.0,2
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told,patient,13.333333333333334,3
and uh this morning I was  I saw him out for a walk and ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and then fine finally the name came to xxx ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
so  but  but the  the discipline on  on um recalling,patient,35.714285714285715,0
yes  yes ,patient,0.0,0
the  uh um I think I mentioned to you last week ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
may may uh possibly I didn't ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
but the time  I'd spent some time as a  at the rehab,patient,53.333333333333336,6
uh and  uh uh because I  I started oh ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
and it became rather troubling to me because having  they just,patient,41.66666666666667,3
so  there was no therapy ,patient,50.0,2
you just  you're able to survive ,patient,37.5,3
just a  the thing you're able to just  could just check,patient,35.714285714285715,4
uh and uh um because they just did not do therapy in those,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and  and over the course the next twenty years uh wife and I,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five,patient,33.33333333333333,4
that's what they're telling people even uh fifteen years ago ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
uh and so I wanted to  to  wanted to share that with ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
but it is  takes a long time ,patient,37.5,3
and in oh ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 yup  a year to year and a half recovery ,patient,27.27272727272727,5
 year to year and a half recovery ,patient,25.0,3
 year to year and a half recovery ,patient,25.0,3
hey  you don't stop recovering ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly,patient,53.84615384615385,4
but you never never stop recovering ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
uh I had a  in the eight  the eighty  eighty four,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and it was just something that I accepted ,patient,62.5,3
and it was  I could function without it ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
no  no big deal ,patient,40.0,0
but uh to stick a pin there and I don't  wouldn't ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
uh no  no big deal ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and then it was probably five years ago or ma twenty  twenty,patient,15.384615384615383,3
I think it was  yeah ,patient,50.0,2
I think it was oh ,patient,60.0,2
twenty five years after the eighty four incident I was in the ,patient,50.0,4
and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five,patient,42.85714285714285,8
so  what I'm  what I'm telling you actually is that the,patient,73.33333333333333,4
but  s but still you never stop recovering ,patient,11.11111111111111,2
you just don't stop recovering ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
you don't ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
yes  it's uh not  not rocket science ,patient,20.0,2
it  it ti ti time  time is  time is the best ,patient,35.714285714285715,0
because you  you  the feeling that  the feeling that,patient,58.333333333333336,0
and  and you'll notice one day it'll  it'll ,patient,46.15384615384615,1
 oh  oh crap I  I  I have feeling there that I didn't,patient,35.294117647058826,3
it  actually it will happen ,patient,50.0,0
you will experience it ,patient,75.0,1
um uh actually  actually n no ,patient,0.0,0
it was  it was  uh it just  I_mean I was used to,patient,46.66666666666666,2
but  uh but I  I don't  I don't know if I got used to,patient,47.368421052631575,3
but  but uh like I say twenty five years later I just put on,patient,20.0,0
 hey wait a minute ,patient,20.0,2
 I've got feeling there ,patient,50.0,2
and had  had  had none before ,patient,37.5,3
I  I don't know when it happened ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
have  have no idea ,patient,40.0,2
they will  it will  they will ,patient,75.0,0
the nerves will work again ,patient,40.0,2
they  they will actually ,patient,60.0,1
they will ,patient,100.0,1
uh when  when I  when I  when I  I  first,patient,53.333333333333336,0
when  when she and  when I  she and I first met uh,patient,46.66666666666666,1
uh we went to  we went to different high_schools together ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
uh her from uh in near Washington Indiana  in Washington,patient,45.45454545454545,7
and myself from uh Plainfield ,patient,40.0,2
uh and it was before classes started at Purdue ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
August of nineteen seventy two ,patient,20.0,3
uh it was uh uh her first day on campus ,patient,40.0,3
my first day on campus ,patient,40.0,2
um there was to be a  a dance at uh  the  the dorm I,patient,47.05882352941176,6
again  again each is our first  first day on campus ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and  uh uh and  uh and  and so I was a little bit,patient,18.75,0
which I  I will arrive but place a little bit early given ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and uh uh so I ended up being just a little bit early for the,patient,40.0,4
and  uh and uh my wife and  uh and her  her  her,patient,25.0,0
guy  girl  girls  girls go with  with body guards ,patient,15.384615384615383,4
I get that ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I think it's a ,patient,80.0,2
her and her  her and her wife and uh uh her and uh,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and  uh uh and uh FirstnameS's wife has never met a,patient,15.384615384615383,3
the  she's the  a  a true extrovert ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
matter of fact if you look up in Webster extrovert and it said ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
uh but anyway  so  so  uh she and a girlfriend that,patient,28.57142857142857,4
 oh hey is the  uh is the  the dance here ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and  and wellco I answered ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 well  it's supposta be ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 uh that's why I'm here ,patient,62.5,2
and  and uh then we  I just  uh I hung around ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
I  I  I hu hung around her that  that  that  that,patient,56.25,4
and uh that's where we started dating ,patient,50.0,2
and  and uh oh it's  we  we dated probably three,patient,28.57142857142857,3
dated around about three years or so ,patient,0.0,3
and after about uh four years I figured out that wellco maybe,patient,41.66666666666667,5
and I oughta get more serious about this ,patient,37.5,3
so  it was just like I  k I accused her of  of uh,patient,56.25,2
that's w where  where we first met is she picked me up at a,patient,68.75,4
a young  a young boy it's look like a  s a um grade,patient,43.75,5
is kicking it ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and he  k he  it ends up going through a house window ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
uh a gentleman on a couch uh there in the window uh sitting,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and then he  he  he gets the ball  s stands by the broken,patient,37.5,4
in the beginning this  this mother it appears uh is  had,patient,46.15384615384615,3
uh and uh he  he says ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
 ah ,patient,0.0,0
he says no and says ,patient,20.0,1
 no  no  mom  I don't need that ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and then  then leaves ,patient,0.0,2
and then in the middle it starts raining on him ,patient,50.0,3
and then rains heavier on him ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and then  and then uh uh he goes back home just uh,patient,7.6923076923076925,2
and then the last  the end of the story was he learned his,patient,50.0,5
the way this started was that the  it looks like uh that,patient,61.53846153846154,3
that the dog is barking at  a dog is barking at this guy ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and uh on the  on the  on a tree limb there's a cat,patient,50.0,5
and it would appear that uh uh a cat climbed up the tree ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
the  uh a little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck,patient,33.33333333333333,0
they  they  they  uh a male  a man uh uh uh,patient,33.33333333333333,0
there's also a  a firetruck and a fire engine ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder ,patient,37.5,5
and it looks like the  lad the  the ladder is being used by,patient,53.333333333333336,6
uh and  uh and the  and a songbird is over on a  a,patient,37.5,3
okay done ,patient,0.0,1
Cinderella was a  a daughter of a  uh uh a subject of,patient,50.0,6
she  her mother had passed  uh her mother passed away ,patient,41.66666666666667,0
and her father remarried ,patient,25.0,2
and the stepmother had uh uh two  two daughters uh who,patient,16.666666666666664,2
uh and as they  after they were married uh the uh uh,patient,46.15384615384615,0
and uh so  so s Cinderella spent her time working cleaning,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and  and uh uh in that  in the kingdom there was uh,patient,35.714285714285715,4
um an advisor to the king suggested a  a  a ball be held,patient,46.66666666666666,4
uh so  the word was put out about the ball coming up ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
uh Cinderella was real happy about the  ba about the ball,patient,41.66666666666667,6
uh and so the  the  the  f um the farm animals,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and  uh uh and then at the last minute uh the stepmother,patient,23.07692307692308,0
and  and the  uh and then also the  the  the,patient,28.57142857142857,0
uh and so  so the stepdaughters went to the ball ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
and  but in the meantime while  b before  uh before,patient,38.46153846153847,0
and so it  it um made for her a  just a  a lovely gown,patient,41.17647058823529,4
and they  then turned a  a pumpkin into a coach uh pulled,patient,35.714285714285715,3
um and uh uh so  and so she ended up going to the ball ,patient,26.666666666666668,0
uh and uh um the prince uh was acquainted with the ,patient,36.36363636363637,2

but the fairy godmother told Cinderella that  that uh you,patient,36.36363636363637,2
and so the  the  the  the prince and Cinderella were,patient,38.46153846153847,5
and  and  and Cinderella said ,patient,0.0,2
 oh_no ,patient,0.0,0
