uh it's pretty good ,patient,40.0,2
um I have problems sometimes especially with uh numbers still uh ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
and sometimes I don't know if it's because I don't hear the  the  the  what I'm uh saying correctly ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
it's something like if I was to say ,patient,77.77777777777779,3
 uh I had to take care of my uh income tax ,patient,25.0,4
uh I might say uh my incomeq taxedq or uh my incomeq texa or  Texas ,patient,25.0,3
you_know s stuff like that where I  I kinda think twice of what the  uh the real or  the  um the word that I was trying to say ,patient,43.75,6
uh something like that ,patient,75.0,2
but other than that I'm thinking I can talk pretty good as long as uh uh people give me time and slow down uh you_know because normally people speak faster than I can ,patient,38.23529411764706,7
so  uh usually if I'm in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I  I have some kind of problem speaking ,patient,46.42857142857143,5
so  they understand ,patient,50.0,1
so  it  it  it's pretty good ,patient,50.0,2
I_mean like I  I've gone uh to a bunch of doctors ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
and you_know they might repeat something for me or you_know uh ask what I had really said stuff like that you_know if I uh say it wrong ,patient,48.14814814814815,5
but other_than that I'm feeling okay speaking ,patient,37.5,2
oh I  I  I don't really too much about it ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
uh I knew that uh I had been having uh physical therapy because I'd had had a hip replacement  the other hip replacement ,patient,44.0,4
uh so  uh that morning my wife unders or she said that she understood or  she knew that I was having some kind of uh problems speaking ,patient,37.93103448275862,7
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular uh session ,patient,43.75,3
and he also noticed that I uh was speaking differently ,patient,40.0,2
and uh he took my vitals and stuff like that ,patient,40.0,3
and he said that I should go to the emergency room ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
and after that uh we're only ah maybe three miles from the hospital ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
so  my brother came over and took uh my wife and uh him over there ,patient,31.25,5
and they sat there while I went through the uh emergency room and stuff like that ,patient,43.75,4
so  it  it took about uh uh maybe three or four hours to have  you_know go through ,patient,25.0,3
uh they did some task ,patient,40.0,2
and I think they have a good uh stroke uh thing ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
so  they  actually in the uh emergency room they had a c_t scan uh were I could do ,patient,45.0,4
and then they  they found where I had uh a room ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
you_know and they  they had found that I had had the stroke through the c_t  c_t scan ,patient,47.368421052631575,0
and then by the time I  I went up to the room probably three or four other uh doctors came from you_know the  the hospital doctor uh uh neurologist ,patient,32.25806451612903,5
uh they actually had uh a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to uh stop the blood or anything ,patient,30.0,6
but it looks like after it  it  the clot burst I was okay ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and there was no xxx uh more um bleeding ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
so  that  that's about what I remember ,patient,70.0,3
and I  I know um when I saw the doctors at the uh uh room they all had the  they have the same type of test that they do to see if it was really uh a stroke and what kind of damage it might've been ,patient,51.02040816326531,10
and I knew that I um had some memory loss ,patient,40.0,3
uh I recognized my uh brother and my uh wife ,patient,30.0,3
but my uh brother's wife came later because sh she was a nurse ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and even_though I know her for thirty five forty years I couldn't remember her name ,patient,37.5,4
so  I  I did have some uh small  or what do you call it  short memory uh loss ,patient,40.909090909090914,4
but that  that's about it ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
well  at the hospital I  I stayed there for three days ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
and they did a_lot tests ,patient,20.0,2
uh they did uh m_r_is uh uh echocardiograms uh to make sure you_know I didn't have it ,patient,27.77777777777778,3
they did uh things uh measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything ,patient,36.84210526315789,5
uh they did  like the last day that I was there they brought a uh speech therapist there because they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital ,patient,53.125,6
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my  my speech xxx a affected ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and it turned out that you_know the next day they uh dis distarged ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and I never saw her again ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and uh because_of my  uh my medical insurance uh when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before uh they could start my speech therapy ,patient,37.5,4
so  I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house ,patient,43.333333333333336,8
and that  that was about it ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
um I'm trying to think ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I  I know last session I think I talked about uh my daughter being uh pregnant nowadays ,patient,38.88888888888889,2
but if I was to think younger uh maybe a good time a thing that I liked uh was in my  when I was twenty uh I was in the airforce ,patient,53.125,4
and I was stationed in Italy uh in the Alps ,patient,50.0,3
it was a radio station on top of a  uh a mountain actually ,patient,50.0,6
so  uh having never uh learned how to play or  how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn how to play or  how to uh ski uh because our  uh our sight was on the top of the mountain ,patient,36.17021276595745,7
and they had a uh uh ski slopes there ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
so  I had a good time uh in Germany ,patient,40.0,3
and the guy was a very old uh German guy that gave uh several of us uh skiing lesson ,patient,31.57894736842105,5
and uh after that uh because our  uh our location uh wa where I would uh work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didn't xxx ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
so  I got to be pretty good at uh ski  playing ski ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
er I keep on saying playq playingq skiq ,patient,25.0,3
uh skiing is skiing ,patient,25.0,1
it's not playing ski ,patient,40.0,1
and that  that was a good time ,patient,50.0,2
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
yeah I_mean it  it  it was a very small village where we lived when we were at  when we were off the sight ,patient,61.53846153846154,7
so  there was a_lot_of places to ski ,patient,25.0,3
and it was only like uh forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
so  we  we'd ski in a_lot a places around the Alps ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um there's a boy in the yard playing with the sco er uh soccer ball ,patient,37.5,6
uh he kicks the ball ,patient,40.0,2
and it hits the window and breaks the window ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
uh the window gets broken and comes through into the house and knocks the  uh the lamb ,patient,38.88888888888889,5
and then the man goes over to the window to see who had uh broke the window ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
uh the story starts with the mother telling the young boy that he should take a umbrella ,patient,47.05882352941176,5
but the uh child kinda waved it off saying that I don't need the uh umbrella ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
and he starts walking to school ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the uh rain starts to fall ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
it starts getting a_lot heavier ,patient,20.0,3
so  he runs back to his  off or not his office  to his house ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
and uh he gets all wet ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and his mother is a_little mad at him because he didn't bring the uh umbrella like he told him ,patient,55.00000000000001,3
so  and then he went got the umbrella and started to walk back to school ,patient,25.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um I think I'm pretty good ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
uh you want me to tell you what I okay ,patient,50.0,3
what I'm seeing at  is uh a cat that is uh on top or  on top of the tree ,patient,54.54545454545454,7
and the young girl wants to bring him down ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and her father uh tried to go up the tree to uh get the cat out ,patient,31.25,4
and the dog is barking at the man ,patient,50.0,3
and apparently the father got stuck in the tree himself with ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and after that uh two firemen came to bring him a  lat a ladder to probably take both the father and the cat out_of the tree ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
no  I  I think I  I have them as as good as I'll be able to remember ,patient,52.38095238095239,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
okay uh the story starts when a man brings uh his  maybe his youngest  her ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
uh they start when they were earlier ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
but uh after several years it turns out that uh uh Cinderella has  has made  hasta do all of the work to uh take care of the  the  the family there ,patient,37.142857142857146,6

but uh uh Cinderella was not invited ,patient,14.285714285714285,1
so  she started to look around or she was reading something ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
and she saw a uh godfather ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh and she had  she made up a beautiful gown for Cinderella ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and she turned the animals into a couch ,patient,50.0,3

uh put a little bit of uh jam around it ,patient,40.0,5
and then put the top uh slice ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
