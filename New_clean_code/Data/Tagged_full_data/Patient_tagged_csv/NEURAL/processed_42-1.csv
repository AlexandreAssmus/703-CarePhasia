it's been a_lot better than it was  yeah ,patient,60.0,3
ten years  you_know ten  ten years  right ,patient,0.0,4
I had um encephalitis um ten years before ,patient,37.5,3
and I hadta remember everything ,patient,40.0,2
so  it's in my head ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
but it's how when you get it out_of there  so ,patient,50.0,3
um I had  um I had like um encephalitis for it was  about a month ,patient,47.05882352941176,3
I don't even remember anything about it ,patient,62.5,3
but um I was in the  but when I remember they got me to start up another time ,patient,52.63157894736842,5
um hadta remember  how to remember how I'll talking about abck one two three um noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff ,patient,30.76923076923077,6
just remember how do you rewrite everything ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
um just taking your time ,patient,20.0,2
but it's still in there ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and you can't just get it on there ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
you might talk a_couple times about it ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
then you're talking about the decks ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and then you forgot about that one ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
so  it's always kind_of like that ,patient,62.5,3
but you can still do it ,patient,50.0,1
so  I'm still writing and um preposition and all that kind of stuff ,patient,40.0,4
just sort of thing you can do ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
just keep  make sure it's still doing than  better than it was ,patient,40.0,5
yeah  oh  it's unbelievable  yeah ,patient,22.22222222222222,0
um um mostly hadta remember how to um ,patient,12.5,2
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
it's funny how uh my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that ,patient,58.82352941176471,4
I could go in the kitchen first ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
the name ,patient,50.0,1
I don't remember anything about it with my head ,patient,70.0,3
I could sit there and making um breakfast and stuff like that ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and she'd say ,patient,50.0,1
 um don't know ,patient,20.0,1
she'd put toast and I'd say ,patient,50.0,1
but eggs ,patient,0.0,1
 that's right  okay ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but it takes time to get everything out_of your head outta there  so ,patient,21.428571428571427,5
um a_lot_of it's there ,patient,40.0,1
but most of it's just you can't get it out_of my head on there ,patient,43.75,4
um it's hard to come back around everything like that ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
and also  it's also because when you talk to me doesn't get the same way coming back to me ,patient,50.0,5
um and it's also kind_of weird because if you talk to one person and me it kind_of kills me ,patient,45.0,5
but if you have another person here I can understand a_lot better with that ,patient,50.0,3
but it's depends  depends on how it's coming on to me yeah ,patient,60.0,5
um like I said I hadta remember doing abck one two three everything like that ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
um they took me at um oh  to uh um books for the first year ,patient,31.25,5
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
um just trying to get back where it was ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
um I yu just write trying to re just getting everything on there ,patient,23.07692307692308,5
so  it's  um it's like that ,patient,70.0,3
it's just hard ,patient,50.0,2
you start getting little things starting through there ,patient,25.0,5
but then I went to um ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I don't know if you go to Chicago ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
there's five weeks ,patient,25.0,2
there we got back how to do different things around there ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
how you're kind_of think you're on this place I think then maybe a different one ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
it's like you had different places you get around there helped around ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
but  um so  it does get out_of there more than you can ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
I_mean the first time you're just going straight ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and it's hard to get anything out_of there ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
but um I don't know ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
is that  did I tell you anything ,patient,75.0,2
when I was little first time ,patient,50.0,2
well  it also can be that too for  like I said for ten years it's kind_of  I really hadta remember start everything ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
so  I did get a remember ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
I did start up another time ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
so  it did help ,patient,60.0,1
um I_mean uh my mom helped me ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and um different places they've  they help everything about it ,patient,50.0,3
but it is nice to get back up um where you can go ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
the bottom ,patient,50.0,1
I_mean it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
I hadta go up ,patient,25.0,2
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
um so  it's been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that ,patient,41.66666666666667,7
it helps um a_lot better ,patient,20.0,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
the boy was out outside with a  with a soccer ball ,patient,50.0,3
and he was kicking around ,patient,60.0,1
and he kicked one really good ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
um but it hit right in the middle of the window on the  on the house there ,patient,50.0,5
um so  the next one over there her ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
gotta  might have been s sleeping and jumped out ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and the lamp broke down there too ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
um but you really can't tell on number four ,patient,30.0,3
um it looks like he is not very happy ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
because he got his um soccer ball ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
um but he's still looking out there ,patient,25.0,2
and I think the  the boy musta ran away ,patient,30.0,3
he ran away ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
so  uh because he's still looking to see what he's doing ,patient,50.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um looks like mom told ,patient,20.0,2
and he said wellco he doesn't really want that ,patient,40.0,2
so  um he's moving onto the next ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
he says no big deal with the  he doesn't  the umbrella ,patient,50.0,4
so  he got outside ,patient,40.0,1
and it rained ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
um that was on number three ,patient,50.0,3
he's over there raining on him ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
number four ,patient,0.0,1
and it's really raining him ,patient,50.0,1
he's gotten water all over the place ,patient,50.0,3
um number five ,patient,0.0,1
he finally came back ,patient,25.0,1
and  and he didn't look that very good ,patient,30.0,0
and she didn't  she told him it's not very good and probably smarter that he didn't take it ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
um so  next time he's gonna take the umbrella when it rains ,patient,40.0,3
um it looks like her dad ,patient,50.0,3
um well  mostly the  the girl who's looking to find her cat up on top on the tree ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
she wanted to get it there ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
but it fell down ,patient,50.0,1
so  he's stuck up there the whole time ,patient,40.0,2
um the dog's kinda barking at him xxx ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
really helping there ,patient,0.0,1
but um the um firemen are coming over there ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
they've got another ladder ,patient,60.0,2
they're gonna help him back up ,patient,50.0,3
um but I don't understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree ,patient,47.05882352941176,7
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat ,patient,30.0,4
um and the cat gets by itself anyway ,patient,37.5,2
um it's just kind_of ,patient,40.0,1
yeah I don't know ,patient,40.0,0
it's probably about what it is  I think ,patient,70.0,4
so  I'm ready huh ,patient,50.0,1
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um what it was um she has  um she's not actually with the  the people ,patient,50.0,4
but there's two um ,patient,20.0,2
it's not like they're um cousins or something like that ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
there's two girls ,patient,25.0,2
and were next by him and their mom ,patient,50.0,5
they're really bad ones and stuff like that or not very  um very  not very haÉªsu ,patient,21.052631578947366,7
of_course she's not very good  very good to her ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
um then she always hadta work outside and do all the  the hard things ,patient,26.666666666666668,3
um and they dune ,patient,25.0,1
they've got enough money and doing whatever they could ,patient,50.0,3
so  they gave a time that um they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the  the money  p the ,patient,48.27586206896552,10
I'm trying to say something ,patient,50.0,2
trying to say all the good people there ,patient,25.0,3
they had to go see them ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um there's  uh they got to play and music and stuff like that ,patient,25.0,4
um so  she would never get to go there ,patient,30.0,2
but um s I forget how ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
somehow she got in here ,patient,40.0,1
but um she got to go ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
um say exactly um ,patient,0.0,1
it came that she had a very unbelievable great um clothes and stuff like ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
they took her so_that one  one night where they got to see everyone ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
um and  and actually it was the  um the guy who came to see her ,patient,35.294117647058826,0
he was probably the best one there ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
he was very nice and very  the best thing he could ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
um and he really liked to see her ,patient,25.0,2
but when it was done that time he ,patient,62.5,2
so  he ,patient,66.66666666666666,0
and um so it was all done ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
but the next day someone actually brought those to him ,patient,50.0,2
because it was his ,patient,100.0,1
because the only ones that are big enough for him ,patient,60.0,4
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
so  it didn't work for them ,patient,62.5,2
so  it came to him ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
they just told him ,patient,50.0,1
so  it came on to him ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
it goes to that ,patient,75.0,2
I'm not done yet ,patient,40.0,1
um laughs the guy  he's the  the one guy that I saw ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
the two um sing with him and play and stuff like that ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
that's where he was that night ,patient,85.71428571428571,3
so  he came back to make sure it was her ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
so  since it's her he's taken with her ,patient,72.72727272727273,2
so  it's going to be with her for all this  all the time and stuff like that um as much as it could be for him ,patient,65.51724137931035,5
that tell you anything ,patient,75.0,1
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um you should take a bread ,patient,50.0,2
um get some um butter out_of the refrigerator with a knife ,patient,36.36363636363637,5
um put some of those on the bread and also some of the um um ,patient,53.333333333333336,6
they're not peanuts exactly ,patient,40.0,1
pee close_by the peanuts ,patient,25.0,2
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
so  everything feels pretty good ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
except for your hand probably gets all over the place ,patient,50.0,4
um but it's a real easy one ,patient,37.5,3
you can do it for about two minutes ,patient,50.0,4
and that's a good one to eat if you  if you you need to get something to eat ,patient,45.0,5
um got enough ,patient,0.0,1
pretty much ,patient,0.0,1
something  probably something to xxx ,patient,50.0,0
um I think you just  you_know you just take the  you took the butters ,patient,37.5,4
the  the um peanuts ,patient,40.0,0
that's not the same thing ,patient,50.0,2
they sit in the  it's in the um kitchen ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
put on a bread ,patient,50.0,2
and put it on a  probably put it on a plate ,patient,50.0,4
go over sit down on the on the table ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
and um have something to eat ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
I guess that's it ,patient,80.0,2
