um I can be confused a couple of times ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
uh sometimes I get the wrong words ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
um it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say ,patient,60.0,5
uh su sometimes it's like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that I'm trying to say ,patient,41.66666666666667,7
um I do have problems on  sometimes on the relationship between words ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
like I know that I'm wanna talk about a female relative ,patient,50.0,5
and I might say the wrong one ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
like I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
stuff like that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
um but um I do have problems with um numbers too ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
um I know if I'm talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number uh even how many times she hasta uh repell ,patient,40.47619047619048,7
so  and just like that I  I said repealq instead_of repeatq ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
that  that's some of the things that I have problems with ,patient,69.23076923076923,6
but other_than that I_mean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow  slowly I usually can get through it ,patient,40.0,4
uh I don't know about it actually ,patient,50.0,2
um laughs I was sposta be having um a physical uh s therapy at home ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
um and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kind_of crazy she said ,patient,43.75,3
um I wasn't making sense ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and later that morning the physical therapist came ,patient,25.0,3
and he had all  all the  um uh he had all the equipment ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and he took my  um he took my uh vitals ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and he said that I should go to the emergency room ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
and that's  that's  th that I remember ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
I didn't remember ,patient,50.0,1
so  my uh brother and my wife took me to the emergency room ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and luckily at the hospital that um I went to has a good uh stroke um thing ,patient,29.411764705882355,6
so  they took me right in there ,patient,37.5,3
they took a  even in the emergency room they had uh a c_k ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
so  so  that's about what I remember ,patient,50.0,3
well  when I  when they took me back to the um uh hospital room there um I saw like five different doctors ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and they all did the same type of stuff ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
so  I could probably you_know do the  the what a doctor would see to check about a  about a stroke ,patient,52.17391304347826,7
but I remember um I had um some memory loss ,patient,30.0,3
like uh by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and although I've know my brother's wife for you_know thirty five forty years I could not remember her name ,patient,38.095238095238095,5
like one  I said ,patient,40.0,3
 who is that ,patient,75.0,0
you_know stuff like that ,patient,50.0,2
but it  by the time I was um discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the  knowing that I did have some um apha ,patient,46.66666666666666,6
I didn't know at the time that it was aphasia ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
but I  I knew the symptoms that I uh pro pro pro protest ,patient,35.714285714285715,2
but that  that's all I remember ,patient,62.5,3
uh w well with the  I didn't have any physical problems with the streak ,patient,43.75,4
uh so when I did get  uh well  at the hospital they brought a speech therapist ,patient,38.88888888888889,5
uh they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital ,patient,61.53846153846154,4
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged ,patient,60.0,4
so  uh I had hoped  I  I knew I had problem speeching  p,patient,35.294117647058826,6
so  I had asked if I could um forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
I  I was walking and all that ,patient,62.5,2
but they said that ,patient,50.0,1
 no you have to finish your physical uh therapy before you can start the speech uh therapy ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
so  I  I had uh home speech therapy ,patient,30.0,2
um it was very good ,patient,40.0,2
I  I  the  the therapist was very good ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and she was actually the one that ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
uh after they let me have I think it's a Medicare type thing that you can use uh ten sessions ,patient,47.61904761904761,5
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the uh speech clinic at Buffalo State in uh New York ,patient,54.16666666666666,8
and uh a_lot_of that was uh to get my memory back ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
uh a_lot_of the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories ,patient,31.25,5
uh uh i it's hard to explain how it took ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
uh I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist ,patient,50.0,5
and after a couple of um sessions with the neurologist he said you_know there's pretty much nothing else that he can do about it ,patient,52.0,7
but if I had any other problems um um you_know they could call me ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
um one of the things they did  uh they did probably one of those uh cognitive uh test ,patient,31.57894736842105,5
I  I did them ,patient,60.0,2
and I did okay I guess ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
uh probably sound uh like the stuff that they  they said that uh President Trump uh aced you_know ,patient,31.57894736842105,5
I had some problems with it ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
but uh laughs I had brain damage ,patient,14.285714285714285,3
so  I guess I had uh a reason ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
but uh that's about it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
um well  uh probably one of the  the  the nicest things that I have recently was uh my daughter uh on this  uh this Mother's Day she stopped over with the card for my wife ,patient,45.0,10
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant ,patient,43.75,6
so  on father ,patient,50.0,0
and then on Father's Day we went over to her house with uh my oh son inlaw's parents ,patient,35.0,5
and they did a uh review ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  they had a uh car ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and we saw that we're going to have a grandson ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
so that  that is probably one of the um um  you_know that period between there has been exciting for us ,patient,59.09090909090909,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the uh clears_throat window ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
the ball breaks the window and startles the uh man who grabs the  uh grabs the ball and looks out the window to see what's going on ,patient,37.93103448275862,7
okay ,patient,0.0,0
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and he wanted to take or  uh she wanted him to take an umbrella ,patient,26.666666666666668,4
but he did not do that ,patient,50.0,1
he started to walk back to school ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
and the rain started to come ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
so  he ran back ,patient,40.0,1
and the mother was a_little angry because he had not pulled it or  he had not put the uh umbrella with him ,patient,47.82608695652174,4
so  he went back  put the umbrella on and walked back to school ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
okay ,patient,0.0,0
well  it looks like the cat was stuck in the uh tree ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and the man had tried to get to ,patient,37.5,2
but he was not able to do that ,patient,37.5,3
so  the firemen came to  um to help him ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
I don't know if they're there to get the cat or the  fa or get the man ,patient,40.0,5
and the cat ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
okay uh the story starts when uh a woman ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  cirren Cinderella goes to the  step the man or  the bad stepmother ,patient,25.0,4
and the two children the  the  the stepmother's daughters were bad ,patient,35.714285714285715,6
well  they aren't bad ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
but they make Cinderella do all of the uh work around the house ,patient,46.15384615384615,7
uh and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her ,patient,42.85714285714285,7
and apparently they can talk with her ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
uh and then at after awhile  after several years it looks like after the  Cinderella got uh a_little older there was a  um a invitation to go to the um ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for uh Cinderella ,patient,39.53488372093023,9
but then uh Cinderella's uh godfather ,patient,0.0,2
and a  she turns the animals into uh people that work for the uh stage not the stage  the coach ,patient,40.909090909090914,0
um so  they go to the uh ball where Cinderella meets the prince ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
but because_of the  um the godmother only could do the spell until midnight um everything turned back to normal where uh her gown was gone ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and the coach were  m,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and the animals were back ,patient,40.0,2
but then there was a man that worked for the princess ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
um at the end uh they  they put the glass slip slipper on Cinderitta ,patient,40.0,3
and um it fit per perfectly ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and they found that that was the uh woman that the prince was looking for ,patient,60.0,5
and they went happy  they went happy to the  to the end ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and that's about it ,patient,80.0,2
oh okay ,patient,0.0,1
uh I would open up the bag of the bread ,patient,60.0,4
uh put a piece of  of  slice of bread ,patient,36.36363636363637,7
I would push ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and then put the second uh top of the slice of bread ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and I guess that's it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
