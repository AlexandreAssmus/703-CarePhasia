uh vocabulary I miss some words ,patient,33.33333333333333,2

uh sometimes I think I don't enunciate real clearly ,patient,30.0,3
um other times it's better ,patient,33.33333333333333,2

sʌmzətɑɪmu ,patient,0.0,0
um oh let's see ,patient,20.0,2
yeah sometimes I say things backwards ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
does it  does it  is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching ,patient,50.0,3
I said some things backwards ,patient,40.0,2
so  if I'll say ,patient,66.66666666666666,0
 um uh if it's  if it  if it's big I'd say small and so_forth ,patient,50.0,3
um I think those are the main issues I have ,patient,50.0,4
no I don't remember anything for about six weeks ,patient,40.0,4
the first memories that I had after my stroke are  were very cloudy ,patient,50.0,5
uh and they were not accurate  uh they were not accurate ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
for example I  I remember being in a wheelchair ,patient,60.0,4
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair ,patient,60.0,4
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the weɪrtʃeɪru ,patient,50.0,4
and I was strapped in because I couldn't sit up on my own ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
uh those  um for about two months I  I  I really didn't  I couldn't remember  I remembered  al remembered almost nothing ,patient,34.48275862068966,7
um and some of the things I had were um very much um incorrect ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
um I found out later things I thought ,patient,37.5,3
and then uh when I first started remembering things um I was mooz was at that point I was moved to a uh rɪləbɪləteɪʃɪnu ,patient,45.83333333333333,3
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct uh somewhat accurate ,patient,37.5,5
uh and that was probably um month and a half or two months in ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
then I  uh I started remembering things but  but it was slow coming back very slow coming back ,patient,20.0,3
um one thing that  that I didn't know was that uh as I was  as it was coming and waking up I guess I was getting  getting around to being able to talk ,patient,48.64864864864865,4
I thought I was talking ,patient,60.0,2
but I found out later that I wasn't  that I couldn't talk clearly ,patient,50.0,3
I couldn't say anything ,patient,60.0,1
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
and so I don't remember when I started talking because in my mind I was always talking just  just fine ,patient,40.909090909090914,5
and I felt like  uh feel like  you feel like maybe I was uh a baby tried to talk ,patient,38.095238095238095,6
and I thought everybody should understand me ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
but apparently in_fact nobody did ,patient,20.0,2
and um that happened for a long that ,patient,50.0,3
well  in my mind I've always been able to talk right ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
now um maybe in the last year or so I'm much more aware of the fact that I don't talk plainly ,patient,39.130434782608695,5
um th that  that's  that's kind_of the um the story of my memories that I  that I have ,patient,60.86956521739131,5
well  it was laugh ,patient,40.0,1
still is ,patient,50.0,1
well  I was  I spent six months in uh um first of all in some oh I guess critical care places ,patient,39.130434782608695,4
and then uh went to  went to  after about two months I went  went into um the um long term ,patient,26.08695652173913,8
well  I went to  went to a couple of rehab hospitals for awhile for two or three weeks each ,patient,38.095238095238095,6
and uh then I started remembering ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
and I started doing some  some therapy of that sort at that time ,patient,50.0,5
um I couldn't do much of anything ,patient,50.0,3
um I thought I could do more than I really could ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
um but I really couldn't do much ,patient,25.0,1
I  uh after six months I got  got home ,patient,27.27272727272727,0
and I did some  uh I had somebody come uh on outpatient basis and work with me for about six weeks ,patient,40.909090909090914,7
uh a physical therapist was  uh a speech therapist and  um and um occupational therapist ,patient,17.647058823529413,3
uh at that point I really d wasn't doing much by myself because I really didn't know what to do ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
uh probably after about  um oh maybe after about a year I started kind_of figuring out on my own stuff I needed to do ,patient,36.0,6
I started  you_know um I did  I did have somebody that I worked with ,patient,50.0,1
he was  uh he was kind_of a cognitive um specialist is about west ,patient,50.0,3
he worked with me for about three years ,patient,50.0,4
and I really felt like he did quite a bit of good to  in terms of my cognition ,patient,52.63157894736842,6
and uh I worked  uh worked on um ,patient,22.22222222222222,2

um of_course I've  I've done  I've  I've worked  I've  when I finished  um when I finished the time that I had for uh physical therapy ,patient,50.0,7
you_know there's a limit  limit on how much you can do in physical therapy according to Medicare ,patient,47.368421052631575,7
um I  s I started going to the  um to the YMCA uh twice a week ,patient,44.44444444444444,6
and I worked with a  uh worked with a uh trainer there who was really good at helping me uh do some things I needed to do ,patient,39.285714285714285,11
uh and then I also started going sometimes to the YMCA on my own um just to get more  more time in of w working at stuff like that ,patient,33.33333333333333,9
um I  wor are you familiar with  um with um FitMi ,patient,38.46153846153847,3

so  let's see ,patient,40.0,2
the kid is out kicking the soccer ball ,patient,50.0,3
uh yeah he kicks it pretty hard ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
goes up  uh up pretty high ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and it goes pretty far ,patient,20.0,2
and it goes through somebody's window ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and uh then it goes through  it goes through the window ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and the  this guy is  the guy is sitting there in the  in the chair as the  as the  uh as the ball comes crashing through the window and hits the lamp  knocks the lamp off and uh scares him  I guess ,patient,44.89795918367347,1
and then I'm not sure exactly what happens after that ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
but yeah there's a hole in the window then ,patient,40.0,4
there's a hole in the window ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and he  the guy is holding the soccer ball looking out the window ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
uh so  not sure what he's gonna do about the  uh about the kid who kicked the soccer ball through the window ,patient,42.30769230769231,0
that's about it ,patient,100.0,2
now  yeah ,patient,0.0,0
I'm not sure ,patient,50.0,1
well  let's see here ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
yeah it w hit the window with the shutters on that ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
um th there's a  there's a problem here because when the  when the ball comes through the window there's a lamp there ,patient,51.85185185185185,5
and in  in the final picture the  the lamp is gone ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
uh yeah the chair is gone  the chair he was sitting in is gone ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
um and the guy's standing there and next to the window  I guess ,patient,26.666666666666668,4
but the chair and the lamp are gone ,patient,37.5,3
so  not sure what happened there ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
okay that's about it ,patient,80.0,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um well  the  the  the  the little kid is going off to school ,patient,41.17647058823529,6
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
but he's kinda waving it off saying ,patient,50.0,2
 no I don't need umbrella ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
 um yeah I'm going off to school ,patient,44.44444444444444,0
 I'll be okay ,patient,60.0,1
so  he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and um he gets out there going on his way to school ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and it starts raining ,patient,25.0,1
and you can see he's kinda a_little worried there and worry it rains more and more ,patient,29.411764705882355,6
and s now it's  uh it's a downpour ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and it's raining pretty hard ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he's kinda running to get outta the rain ,patient,30.0,4
and um he ran back home ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and uh he  he did uh see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the uh umbrella ,patient,42.30769230769231,8
so  then he uh gets the umbrella to go off to school ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and he's happy going off to school with his umbrella ,patient,54.54545454545454,5
okay ,patient,0.0,0
well  the story is that um this little girl's cat got up in the tree ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
and the  uh the dad went up to get the  get the cat down ,patient,37.5,4
and he's got stuck in the tree ,patient,62.5,3
and uh the  the dog is standing there barking up the tree ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
I don't know if he's barking because he's trying to get that guy down or what ,patient,52.63157894736842,4
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and in the process somehow the ladder ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
maybe the dog hit the ladder ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but it  uh the ladder got knocked down ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
so  the guy couldn't get  couldn't climb down the ladder ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
so  they hadta call a fire department ,patient,37.5,3
and they came ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and uh they're going to uh get the  get the  get the guy down from the tree ,patient,40.0,7
now the cat in the meantime is sitting up in the tree ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
and um I don't know if he's taking a nap or just ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
but he doesn't really care ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
he's not bothering him ,patient,60.0,1
uh the little girl probably was  musta been riding her tricycle because it's sitting there ,patient,41.17647058823529,3
uh but she is now trying to coax the cat down ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
uh there's a bird there in the tree ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and he's just kinda singing away and probably i is oblivious to everything else that's going on ,patient,47.368421052631575,6
um that's pretty much it ,patient,50.0,2
the girl's got pigtails and all of that ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
so  maybe she's a tomboy or something ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
that's about it ,patient,100.0,2
that's it ,patient,100.0,1
okay ,patient,0.0,0
well  Cinderella was a  uh Cinderella was I guess ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
I think there was a  I think that uh Cinderella was actually had to work for the uh who's the  the got evil sisters ,patient,44.44444444444444,11
and they weren't very nice to her ,patient,50.0,3
they made her do the laundry ,patient,50.0,3
um obviously in the story here all the  uh all the animals loved Cinderella because they're all in  they're all around whenever she is ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and they  they found that they  they like her a_lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her thing ,patient,56.00000000000001,4
um so the  um the  um the  the king has a son ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
he's looking for a  uh looking for a bride for his  his son ,patient,56.25,7
I didn't say that right did I ,patient,50.0,2
yeah he was looking for a bride for his son ,patient,60.0,5
and uh uh they  they were  he had  they were gonna have a ball ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
so  they could all come and  and uh see who  who she ,patient,40.0,3
and uh she was looking out the window in this one picture ,patient,50.0,3
she was looking out the window kinda dreaming about it ,patient,60.0,3
but uh she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
so  um they all went to the ball ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and  well  the  uh uh I don't remember exactly how it was that she ended up ,patient,45.0,3
I guess the  the fairy godmother came while she was at  while they were at the ball ,patient,63.1578947368421,6
the fairy godmother took a  told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that she'd uh take her to the ball in ,patient,48.14814814814815,6
and it was a  a pumpkin carriage and uh gonna take them to the ball ,patient,41.17647058823529,5
and uh I remember this one picture there that seemed a_little weird ,patient,25.0,4
the horses were sitting on their hind legs with their  kinda with their feet up something like you_know ,patient,57.89473684210527,3
they were  they were standing there on four legs ,patient,50.0,4
uh it was kinda weird ,patient,40.0,2
and uh so uh the fairy godmother took her to the ball ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh she at the ball and uh went in ,patient,30.0,4
and nobody knew this  knew who it was uh because she was so  uh so beautiful ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
nobody knew who she was ,patient,80.0,2
and they had the ball ,patient,40.0,2
and the  and the prince  the prince liked her ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and  um and then the  um the  the um chimes went off in the clock  big clock  Big_Ben or whatever ,patient,28.000000000000004,4
and  uh and  w and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before or  back home before midnight ,patient,21.73913043478261,5
and it was after midnight ,patient,60.0,2
and uh so she got up ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
she ran out ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and uh her slipper fell off ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and she went on ,patient,50.0,1
she got home um without the slipper ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and then uh the  uh the prince started looking for whoever it was that had the  sl the slipper ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
and he was trying  t he was uh trying the slipper on  er on everybody in the kingdom ,patient,50.0,6
and um finally the  um the  um the  um they wanted to  he wanted to try it onto Cinderella ,patient,30.434782608695656,0
but I think they  they the  the  the bad th th evil sisters didn't want her  didn't want him to ,patient,42.30769230769231,8
but he did anyway ,patient,25.0,1
he ,patient,100.0,0
and it fit ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and  uh and the end uh Cinderella married the prince and uh lived happily ever after I guess ,patient,21.052631578947366,3
okay ,patient,0.0,0
well  I guess uh first thing I do is go to the pantry ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
and I get out the peanut butter ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and uh then I go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and um I'd get some bread out_of the freezer  uh the refrigerator because that's where we keep the bread ,patient,50.0,4
