and uh they said ,patient,25.0,1
 w we're  go we're going to get the um hospital  the hospital come ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
they came outside with the  b ges with the peep  s,patient,38.46153846153847,5

and um when I arrived um ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
because I have been there many times for other things ,patient,50.0,3
and um when I went there they put me immediately into the hʌbskulu ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and uh to  uh they thought that I'd had a um uh stroke which I guess that's what they accomplished ,patient,52.17391304347826,6
and um so they were  um they gave me um a nice room by myself ,patient,43.75,4
and I  I guess I just sort_of didn't say much ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and I was there for two  two weeks ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and they had many people coming in s suh wʊdnɛksu ,patient,20.0,4
what  I'm trying to think ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
d d æpɹiəlu ,patient,0.0,2
some of them I knew and some I did not ,patient,60.0,2
and um so the  and  th and they walked me a_lot ,patient,23.07692307692308,1
they told me to  w they helped me walking ,patient,50.0,3
and  and I was doing things like that ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I feel fine ,patient,25.0,1
and um uh I  d I didn't ,patient,22.22222222222222,4

 when I do go home I wanna be by myself ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
ɪksɑɪdu ,patient,0.0,0

and that's when they did a_lot_of um th th what  applications points right in there ,patient,35.294117647058826,5
and what was going to happen ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and um uh so that's uh the way it is ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and  and fortunately nothing else came a great bɪfrɪntsu ,patient,20.0,2
but  um but it was  uh I uh assume it was something in my  points,patient,44.44444444444444,6
what  what a_lot_of people that I talk here in this group of people um I will say um ,patient,47.368421052631575,4
 I hear one side and I can speak and the other side is different ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and they've told me about  many have told me about it ,patient,61.53846153846154,3

and uh I  I have walked  uh for years I have  w have the every morning at six o'clock get the New_York_Times to me at the door ,patient,43.333333333333336,4
and um so then they continue do that now ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
