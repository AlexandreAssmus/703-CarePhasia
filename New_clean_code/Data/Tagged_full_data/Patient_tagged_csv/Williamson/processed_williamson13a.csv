head,patient,0.0,0
uh  I was uh at the breakfast table ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 and uh ges,patient,0.0,0
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1

 and I called my wife ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 yeah I'm gonna call nineoneone ,patient,25.0,2
so  they immediately took me to the Restin_General Hospital enrolled me and  and ,patient,40.0,3
head,patient,0.0,0
ges,patient,0.0,0
I'm thinking about the uh  uh t_i_a ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 I went in to have hip joint replacement surgery ,patient,20.0,4
 and I was a healthy ,patient,50.0,2
I just had points,patient,25.0,1
so  I went to have that replaced ,patient,37.5,2
and uh the following  the surgery went fine ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
following morning they got me up for the first time to  to walk ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and when I got up I collapsed ges  suddenly ,patient,40.0,2
 and they did the usual m_r_is and the cat ,patient,30.0,0
and uh  they would ask me the battery of questions ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and I had difficulties knowing when I was born what year I was born uh  etcetera ,patient,41.17647058823529,6
uh,patient,0.0,0
I had head,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 never did ,patient,0.0,1
uh lips_smack by the time I,patient,50.0,3
 I could listen to the news  and understand what I was hearing ,patient,50.0,3
ges but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do  head,patient,44.44444444444444,5
so  I tried to cope with it  by asking my wife grabs,patient,42.85714285714285,6
and I started trying to work one line at a time in  in one ges column ,patient,29.411764705882355,6
 that was difficult ,patient,50.0,0
but when I f felt I ges could repeat that and say it then I would try to get  head,patient,38.095238095238095,5
 maybe one  sent  one sentence ,patient,0.0,0
and it was difficult ,patient,50.0,1
but  ges,patient,0.0,1
and after several days I got to where I could maybe  read and comprehend a short paragraph ,patient,38.88888888888889,5
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down  mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was ,patient,48.0,3
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  good ,patient,0.0,0
 I can get to my computer now ,patient,50.0,3
 so  I got downstairs sat down at my computer  and sighs  I hadta call my wife ,patient,35.0,4
 how do I turn it on ,patient,71.42857142857143,1
she showed me ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and it came up ,patient,50.0,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 now what do I do ,patient,50.0,2
 and I said ,patient,25.0,1
 oh  sighs ,patient,0.0,2
 and I got something in front of me ,patient,55.55555555555556,0
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 I wanna send an email to my  some of my friends ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
head,patient,0.0,0
and said ,patient,0.0,1
 ges,patient,0.0,1
but it took me awhile to get that ,patient,37.5,2
and I had ges jumbled head,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and I even saved it  because it ges was very jumbled ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
ges,patient,0.0,0
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after ges it was very jumbled ,patient,60.0,6
head,patient,0.0,0
and uh so that's when I heard about the Stroke_Comeback_Center from uh the traveling nurse that came by to attend me ,patient,50.0,6
head,patient,0.0,0
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 you'd be a very good candidate for your  our class ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 ges well sign me up ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and so uh uh I  I came here and was uh starting on a once a week schedule ,patient,31.57894736842105,6
 and I felt  it was a very good experience because I started making  progress ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
and what I  fel I've always said about with FirstnameM and p the center as a general is they seem to have a very good k way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge  but not over  not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it ,patient,44.642857142857146,2
so  if it was points,patient,66.66666666666666,0
head,patient,0.0,0
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and ges,patient,37.5,7
ges and this sorta ,patient,25.0,1
so  it was a ges,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and then she  s  she said  um FirstnameM said ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 you might be a very candidate to enroll in our  one of our online penpal classes that we have with aphasia students  points at Oklahoma_City_University or  one of the Oklahoma universities  ,patient,38.88888888888889,10
so  I  b I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students ,patient,46.66666666666666,6
and after ges,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I decided I would start to write a   maybe a little journal  of my experiences from the day  as I recalled it from the day  I had my first uh stroke and  and ges to the recovery period ,patient,41.86046511627907,9
and I ended up sighs doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester ,patient,45.45454545454545,6
and I ended up labelling it as Firstname's aphasia journal ,patient,36.36363636363637,5
and uh I would s ges write a   a little section each week ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
ges and then she would kind_of react  respond back to me ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
but I would  I would ges build on it and finally ended that up ,patient,53.333333333333336,2
and she turned it in as her   as her theme  p her project for the   for the  seme for the semester ,patient,56.00000000000001,7
and hadta give a presentation on   on this interaction ,patient,40.0,3
so  ges all that  all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this ,patient,52.94117647058824,0
head,patient,0.0,0
but a I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again ,patient,36.0,6
and that's when xxx sent me in and dɑɪəgmostu ,patient,50.0,2
but they went ahead and sent me to John_Hopkins points uh Stroke_Rehabilitation_Center ,patient,25.0,4
and I became a patient there subject and uh worked with them ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh  they diagnosed that I had had ges a previously undisclosed  uh ges flap on my heart ,patient,35.0,5
 that uh  is congenital ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
but that is ges probably why I caught the clot ,patient,50.0,3
and xxx ,patient,0.0,1
head,patient,0.0,0
but that's  uh  uh yeah I participated in that ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
and uh sighs  part of my therapy building along was  after going through wr writing my  ges weekly Firstname's journal I met with a couple of retired army officers who contacted me that said they were  the y US Department_of_Agriculture was wanting to write a  uh  a history of nutrition research that had been performed by the military after the  Department_of_Agriculture became involved ,patient,38.0281690140845,12
and they said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 Firstname I understand you understand what happened ,patient,37.5,3
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 oh  yeah ,patient,0.0,0
 I was  involved in that when they closed the program down and had it rebuilt ,patient,58.82352941176471,4
 and I  have kept all of the old files ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
 and he said ,patient,25.0,0
 well  you oughta write that up ,patient,37.5,2
 and so I started another project to  uh uh still working on it writing a history of nutrition research performed by the military from the seventeen thirties to the present day ,patient,39.39393939393939,11
you_know and I  I  I  and I'm  s  you_know I'm still working at that ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and uh  I continue to uh come here to  the Center once or twice a  a week and  uh because I have a buddy ,patient,32.142857142857146,5
name is FirstnameK ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and uh she was  uh p ges had had a stroke not too long before I did ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and we were here in the first class together ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and she's   she's about forty  I think ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
but we kind_of  we're buddies ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 and uh I feel like  maybe I can contribute to her recovery ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
 at the same time ges interacting and working with other folks ,patient,25.0,4
so  it uh ,patient,50.0,0
 yes  yep head,patient,0.0,2
I would think it's ,patient,80.0,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
head,patient,0.0,0
surely ,patient,0.0,0
I will use one that I actually used in my uh  penpal stories ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
one of the things that came was I   I was a farm boy growing up in Missouri ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
and uh  I had a grandmother which I thought very much of ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and uh she had  was a single lady by this time ,patient,50.0,3
her f husband had passed away ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
my grandfather passed away ,patient,50.0,2
but I was out uh getting starting in college or no  head,patient,30.76923076923077,6
and dad uh  decided that I should uh  maybe buy a or  I'd decided I wanted to buy a   a uh p Hereford heifer to start a  b a,patient,31.428571428571427,6
I had my Four_h  uh FFA activities ,patient,25.0,2
I told my grandma about it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 well  I'd like to  I need one ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
 I'd like to have a heifer too to come on our little pasture ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
to keep the weeds down out on her place ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
so  I went together and dad and I ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and we purchased  two heifers  Susie and Stella ,patient,10.0,3
well  I took  Susie ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and we stayed on  at my dad's place ,patient,40.0,4
and Stella was at my  gr my  gr my grandma's place ,patient,35.714285714285715,6
the  uh  uh  but on one occasion   we brought them back home in the winter time ,patient,30.0,4
we bring them all back to the  points to the  to the barn to where the  you_know to get them off the pastures were already gone up and to uh give them hay ,patient,47.22222222222222,9
inhales well sighs  I was going out one day down to bring  try to get the cattle to come up including Susie and Stella to get them up to the barn ,patient,27.27272727272727,10
and they were running around head,patient,50.0,2
and I got aggravated xxx I decided I'd throw a rock at one of them to get them to go back ,patient,45.45454545454545,1
well  I ended up ges,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I picked up this ges boulder and gave it a heave ges,patient,38.46153846153847,3
unfortunately it ran headlong points,patient,20.0,2
knocked the thing flat on its ges,patient,42.85714285714285,3
so  I was scared as the dickens ,patient,62.5,4
I ran up to dad ,patient,60.0,2
 help me come ,patient,25.0,2
dad came down the barn immediately and got his old dull pocket knife out ges,patient,26.666666666666668,4
thought maybe he'd be able to  uh figured it was probably dying but at_least wanted to preserve the meat to let it bleed it out ,patient,33.33333333333333,9
well  the ges,patient,25.0,2
 imit,patient,0.0,0
laughs Stella b blared laughs and belted ,patient,0.0,3
and so it wasn't dead it was just knocked out ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
so  uh that taught me a lesson not to be throwing rocks and st ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
Stella became fine xxx head,patient,0.0,2
head,patient,0.0,0

well  this young boy is playing soccer ,patient,25.0,2
and he's just kicked the ball up in the air and uhoh ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
it just hit the window in the house and I guess  broke in the window ,patient,43.75,5
it not only went th,patient,40.0,2
and then dad is  uh picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window and figured out  trying to find out where did that come from ,patient,37.93103448275862,8
sure ,patient,0.0,0
 well  the  sighs ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
let's see ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
the young boy is uh with a mother ,patient,50.0,3
mother's got an umbrella ,patient,20.0,2
he's  seemingly reaching for the umbrella ,patient,50.0,3
the next panel  looks like uh mother's trying to encourage the boy to take the umbrella and go outside ,patient,23.809523809523807,5
but the boy apparently decided to go outside without the umbrella ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and now it's raining ,patient,40.0,1
and now it's starting to pour down rain ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he's running back to the house ,patient,50.0,4
and now his   his head's all wet ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and his mother looks sort_of upset ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and  he goes back outside but now he's using the  he's wearing the umbrella ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
 well  I think we had a problem where  oc  occurred where a cat decided to crawl up into the tree and go out on f small limb on the outside ,patient,38.23529411764706,11
it looks like the uh yeah   young girl got upset and had called  her dad probably to  maybe try to get the cat down ,patient,29.629629629629623,4
 uh she'd been points,patient,50.0,1
dad had apparently gotten a ladder and had uh started up the tree and got up there but  for some reason it looks like the ladder has fallen down ,patient,40.0,6
the dog is now upset and barking ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
dad's stuck in the tree ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the cat's still there ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
well  there seems to be a bird chirping for one unknown reason but enough that somebody decided to call the fire department ,patient,30.434782608695656,5
and the fire department with two men are carrying a ladder apparently there to try to rescue to get the ma man down and possibly get the cat out_of the tree ,patient,29.03225806451613,7
think that found all of the  characters that were in the ,patient,66.66666666666666,7
 scene ,patient,0.0,1

 Walt_Disney's movie ,patient,0.0,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
look through it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
 s story is about Cinderella who was a younger sister of  with two older sisters I believe ,patient,42.10526315789473,6
and she seemed to be the prettier of the three ,patient,50.0,5
and her mother was um a little bit of a domineering lady ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
uh,patient,0.0,0
 and they were all excited becau,patient,28.57142857142857,2
well  the  li the older sisters were getting themselves well dressed and ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
well  at first it was sure whether younger sister Cinderella was gonna get to go to her nɑɾəu ,patient,35.0,6
but there were some animals around ,patient,50.0,2
and head,patient,0.0,1
but anyhow  they all finally got dressed mother and the three daughters ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
and they went to,patient,50.0,1
and sighs there was a handsome prince probably with the  t the son of the  shrugs whoever was a main character th or the head,patient,40.74074074074074,7
and there was a number,patient,40.0,2
and apparently Cinderella may have got to dance with  one of the young men ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
but somewhere in the process she lost a slipper ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
after the ball when they'd all gotten home  I think she must have noticed that she was missing her slipper ,patient,59.09090909090909,4
and much to her surprise Prince_Charming came riding up to the house in his carriage and was looking for who  does the slipper  belong to which one of the ladies ,patient,53.125,4
and probably they must have tried it on ,patient,62.5,1
and the two older sisters their   slipper was too small to fit on the feet  of them ,patient,36.84210526315789,7
so  he  then Prince_Charming tried it on Cinderella ,patient,40.0,2
and it  slips the uh  s shoe fit perfectly on the slipper  s,patient,25.0,4
and so Cinderella then got to go back with Prince_Charming and go t back to shrugs another ball or something ,patient,20.0,5
that seems to be what ,patient,60.0,2
there's animals ges in this  watching the process but I don't know how they were  s exactly were involved in the story ,patient,50.0,5
but that's what I remember I think  of that story ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
okay ,patient,0.0,0
 well  sighs if we were s making  thinking of the process of the last class I had with points FirstnameM in which we were trying to hafta ges work out steps to do things you needta stop and think about it ,patient,40.909090909090914,8
well  the first thing you hafta go ,patient,25.0,0
 and if we were having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would hafta go in the  into the uh refrigerator and pull out the peanut  butter and the bar ,patient,39.39393939393939,4
uh I would get out a plate ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
put my bread on the plate ,patient,50.0,3
and I would go to the  uh  uh get a knife out_of the uh drawer ,patient,35.294117647058826,5
and I would use a knife to spread first the peanut butter on one side of the bread ,patient,38.88888888888889,6
then I would uh  use the knife uh to uh spread the jelly on the bread ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
and I would close  uh  put the other t piece of bread on the  uh  join it with the others ,patient,37.5,5
now I've got myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and I can take it to the table and eat it ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
