when she was young she useta did ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
this and anyway head,patient,25.0,2
so  I know  I knew her ,patient,50.0,0
so  I talk to a_lot of these people ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
and uh I was doing very well except I got to a word ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
and I told them ,patient,50.0,1
 you_know I have a  s I have  I have the  I had a speech ,patient,38.88888888888889,5
 and it's difficult for me to talk ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and she said nobody had any idea there was wrong with me talking until that  until that time ,patient,52.63157894736842,9
and uh so they were getting  re you_know it was  it was uh eight  it was six o'clock ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
they were all ready to  uh everybody was all  all done ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and I bought  I bought the book ,patient,37.5,3
and I was outside talking to this other man ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and he was probably uh our age ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I was  I_mean  I was his age head,patient,50.0,3
and he was  he was  muh he was slender ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
and he said that he had migraine headaches every two or three days ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
 and  uh and he had  uh he was worried that he'd have a stroke himself ,patient,42.10526315789473,5
and he said that uh he had extremely bad um maɪgrɛnu ,patient,27.27272727272727,4
and he  you_know and but he said ,patient,25.0,1
 uh you_know we don't know how you_know ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I_mean  we shook hands and everything ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and he talked quite about what his problems that he has ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
 because I talked about the stroke that I had ,patient,60.0,0
and he told me how he has  he  sus he suffered from that ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
and uh I had read recently that there were some new uh drugs that might help out people that have that ,patient,47.61904761904761,6
and he said that uh he  he saw a doctor ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and the doctor told him that  uh it  they gave him some of his drugs ,patient,52.94117647058824,5
and it didn't do him any good what's  what  not xxx head,patient,43.75,2
so that was  so  that was that ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
uh so I  so  I guess my little bit of story is  is I said this quite a bit before anybody knew there was anything wrong with me you_know ,patient,53.125,0
I guess the  and I  my feeling is  is that I don't think I'm doing much better ,patient,50.0,5
um people will say boy Firstname sounds  he's a_lot better ,patient,25.0,4
and uh but uh I'm afraid that I'm not getting much better head,patient,33.33333333333333,5
that's  that's one of my  head,patient,60.0,5
I think I'm probably a little bit better than I was ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
um but I still don't think I'm really  really well ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
you_know  and I'm always surprised when people tell me ,patient,36.36363636363637,0
 gee we had no idea there was anything wrong with you talking ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
you_know  because to me it sounds horrible to me ,patient,60.0,3
this is how I feel about it ges head,patient,66.66666666666666,3
is that  uh uh because I  I think that I was very good at  at speaking ,patient,52.63157894736842,4
uh and I knew  I knew so many different things ,patient,18.181818181818183,4
and I was witty and things like that ,patient,50.0,3
and uh so I'm not  duh I'm not depressed or anything like that ,patient,43.75,1
and I'm hoping I'm going to do better ,patient,40.0,3
it's just that I don't think I'm doing that head,patient,61.53846153846154,4
you_know  okay  head,patient,0.0,0
um actually I don't think I've had any problems ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
uh I think that I remember everything wonderfully ,patient,50.0,2
and as a matter of fact I wanted to tell you about  uh about ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
I was with FirstnameG ,patient,75.0,1
and I was driving ,patient,50.0,1
I was driving a van ,patient,60.0,2
and we were going at uh the Home_Depot ,patient,50.0,3
you_know  and for year  for a long time I could not say Home_Depot ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  I  I admit that I'm  a_lot of the words I'm doing a_lot better than I  than I was head,patient,57.692307692307686,9
like it took me m maybe a month before I could say uh Baldwin_Hill_Road which is where I  you_know where I live head,patient,54.16666666666666,5
and I  actually I was probably  uh since I was like one year old I lived in the same  in the same house ,patient,42.30769230769231,4
so  I actually knew  uh knew how to say it ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  uh when I was with  uh it was like uh our  it was our  it was uh eight sixteen two thousand thirteen August ,patient,46.42857142857143,4
and I was driving ,patient,50.0,1
it was about nine o'clock at night ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and we had just left Home_Depot to buy ges uh ,patient,20.0,2
I was actually  she had an apartment in her  in her um ,patient,57.14285714285714,5
the  this lady who had lived there for twenty four years had died recently ,patient,40.0,6
and we were fixing up her apartment ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and one of the things was that her  um the  the bath uh had an old steel tub ,patient,40.0,5
and we just bought a ,patient,40.0,1
and I'm good at finding deals ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and I found a nice  uh a nice new tug ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
and uh we were just bought it in my van ,patient,50.0,3
a and  and so then we were gonna have a supper  we were gonna go suppering now ,patient,28.57142857142857,6
so  I was on route  te r uh I was on uh Boston_Road ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and uh I was driving ,patient,40.0,1
and uh this is about nine o'clock at night ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 you sh should turn  you should turn right ,patient,40.0,2
she said ,patient,50.0,1
 turn right ,patient,0.0,1
and apparently what happened is that I had paralyzed ges,patient,50.0,4
I was  dri head,patient,40.0,3
and uh on the  she said that one of my eyes  you_know I  my  ee I couldn't see on this side ges,patient,44.44444444444444,5
it's like this whole whole side ges,patient,50.0,4
and uh I was driving ,patient,40.0,1
I managed to get the van on the side of the road ,patient,50.0,6
and it was right where we were going to uh the restaurant ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
and  uh and then I would just hold onto the steel ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and  uh and I was so  I was really lucky uh that FirstnameG was with me you_know ,patient,42.10526315789473,2
 and actually I've  I've always felt that FirstnameG saved my  saved my life basically ,patient,36.84210526315789,4
um and  and the other thing that was  that worked out well is that there were  there were  there were doctors ,patient,40.0,4
and uh uh there were  there was two nurses and a doctor that just happened to be driving their cars ,patient,28.57142857142857,7
and they saw it  what happened ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and everybody got out ,patient,50.0,1
and they all got me  op we opened up the door ,patient,50.0,3
and they got me down on the ground ,patient,62.5,3
and  um and they called up  ges,patient,22.22222222222222,0
what do you got that say it right ,patient,62.5,2
it starts with uh the truck ,patient,50.0,3
it's  it's  um it's not the right term for  for the truck but they took her to  um and they took it to Baystate ,patient,51.61290322580645,5
and while it  when I was there ,patient,62.5,3
and during this time I started losing the color ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I could  s I could still see my vision but it was like black and white ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
 that you_know the  c the  the color head,patient,36.36363636363637,0
we got to  we got to Baystate and their emergency ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
is it emergency ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
well  anyway um e kay it  it all came back to me ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
the color all came back ,patient,40.0,2
I_mean  I was on a ɡɝdiu ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
what do you call it ,patient,80.0,1
they carry people ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
ɡɝdizu ,patient,0.0,0
ɡɝdizu ,patient,0.0,0
I was on that head,patient,80.0,3
and uh they were taking me in on  uh upstairs ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
uh I think I probably took  uh s I don't know if I xrays or something like that ,patient,45.0,5
or maybe it was like  uh could've been an m_r_i or something perhaps ,patient,53.333333333333336,3
and then  uh then I finally made  head,patient,10.0,2
it was almost like one o'clock in the morning ges ,patient,50.0,5
I was in  uh you_know there was like uh a nurse  a young nurse ,patient,37.5,5
and FirstnameG was here ,patient,25.0,1
and uh I wanted to  I knew everything was happening ges ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
you_know  I was saying to myself ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
 boy something's really happening me that's really not doing well you_know ,patient,35.714285714285715,2
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 uh you_know they're sending me to a hospital so obviously something's wrong with me ,patient,58.82352941176471,4
and uh so I wanted to  s so then I wanted to  I kept on trying to talk to FirstnameG about what was happening ,patient,30.76923076923077,2
and I couldn't say anything ,patient,50.0,1
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 if I can't say anything to FirstnameG then she's gonna think I can't tell her what's wrong with me ,patient,52.0,6
so  they think that there's probably something a_lot worse than me ,patient,53.84615384615385,5
because I think I understood everything that was happening during  during this whole thing ges that was happening ,patient,57.89473684210527,5
and uh so that's  that's pretty good head,patient,36.36363636363637,4
okay  well  I was  I was at  um I was at um Baystate ,patient,47.05882352941176,3
and I was there for like um I think it was  eight days ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and then it was very  not very far away ,patient,20.0,3
we went to Mercy ,patient,50.0,2
and I was there for ten days ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
um and then I  I was talking  I was there  um they tried to seem ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
they  I said to her head,patient,57.14285714285714,3
 some uh physical therapy work ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
and I could do everything ,patient,60.0,1
I had no trouble ,patient,50.0,2
you_know  they  they started off you_know trying to move my  you_know  you_know uh how I can move and stuff like that ,patient,36.0,4
and  and they  actually after like two days they said ,patient,25.0,5
 he doesn't need any physical problems ,patient,37.5,2
so  I was actually talking  I talked to this  this  this woman that was uh the speech therapist ,patient,50.0,5
and um I talked with her for  mo for like nine  nine days I think ,patient,35.294117647058826,3
and then the last day  last day I was there  uh I think the ninth day I think I  they  they had this group of people ,patient,36.66666666666666,6
they had  s they had uh ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
that you would  you would  this one  this one woman had  uh I think you probably  you probably knew her uh because she was from Umass ,patient,48.38709677419355,5
and she was going at that time ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
she's still going at_least m almost a year ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
she was going to uh be th you_know helping uh at Umass ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
uh so  we had this group of people that suffered from  from  uh from speaking well ,patient,42.10526315789473,6
and I listened to  you_know I listened to what she was saying ,patient,53.84615384615385,2
uh z actually the whole group uh of  pee of people ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and apparently they do that every ,patient,50.0,1
I don't know if they come every month or something ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and they  they talk to people about that ,patient,55.55555555555556,0
so  uh and then  and then after ten days I was there ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
we dec uh decided that we went to  uh in Amherst ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and it was like um um rust ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
and you_know what happened is that the speech therapist would come ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and she was there for like fifteen minutes ,patient,37.5,4
and she'd do the same kind of testing that you've been doing ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and uh is  is like the same thing head,patient,40.0,5
and you_know it was like I had seen it ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and  and uh the next day another speech therapist ,patient,20.0,0
I think there was only a couple  t a couple of people ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
and she started the whole thing all over again ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
right ,patient,0.0,0
and she wasn't here that long ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and then uh the next day this other person came again ,patient,18.181818181818183,2
and uh we were doing the same thing ,patient,37.5,2
but none of them ,patient,50.0,2
it was only very short period of time you_know maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving ,patient,40.0,4
and uh so I think uh FirstnameG and I we actually  we actually points went for a walk you_know because where she was isn't really that far away ,patient,36.66666666666666,1
so  in the center of town points we went to uh dinner ,patient,46.15384615384615,6
and uh we were talking ,patient,40.0,1
and she was saying ,patient,50.0,1
oh the other thing is the speech therapist had been there for like thirteen years in the same place ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
and she was  qu and she was  she's getting a new job ,patient,46.66666666666666,1
she was gonna lo lose  she was gonna leave ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks ,patient,40.0,6
and um now it's getting  uh you_know it's the middle  it's the beginning ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
so  I when would  it was  I just had  I had a birthday there that week head,patient,47.61904761904761,4
and um we were thinking that maybe we would stay ,patient,50.0,2
and I was gonna stay with uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
I was gonna stay there ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh because I think what happened is that uh we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse ,patient,59.09090909090909,8
the nurse ,patient,50.0,1
and the thing is that  that uh this ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and this is what um ,patient,60.0,1
they wanted to  ha to you_know if I wanted to go to the  um to have my  uh my bath and stuff like that ,patient,37.03703703703704,7
they wanted to take me ,patient,40.0,2
all of the people that worked there ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
they  you_know and when I was in  in  I was in um Mercy all of the  they let me do it all by myself ,patient,64.28571428571429,6
and some of the nurses would let me do it at four o'clock in the morning ,patient,56.25,6
I could  I could go all by myself ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
I could  ov I could  wa they had like a room ges ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
I could  I could take all my clothes off ,patient,70.0,2
I would  I'd take a nice bath ,patient,55.55555555555556,0
I'd put everything back ,patient,60.0,1
and then I would even  I  I would like  uh with my razor I would  I would  um you_know I would  I would touches,patient,50.0,4
what would you call that ,patient,80.0,1
not my beard but I would cut my beard and things like that head,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and I didn't have any problems um when I was at Mercy ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
no problems whatsoever head,patient,25.0,2
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the New_York_Times ,patient,37.5,4
that's basically the only thing I hadta try to read ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and I would say if I read something like um um one section of the New_York_Times it would probably take me  um maybe it would take me an hour just to read one  one ,patient,38.88888888888889,8
and then I'd only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read you_know ,patient,31.57894736842105,6
of_course if it was  maybe if it was an uh newspaper that was easier to read I might do better ,patient,52.38095238095239,7
but uh it was still the New_York_Times and uh the edi editorials and things like that ,patient,37.5,2
I was having a hard time understanding it ,patient,50.0,3
but I had an ideara ,patient,40.0,2
so  um so  a so  FirstnameG and I were going  we were  s we were at  we were having supper ges ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and she  s and  and she said ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
 well  what do you think ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
what she should do ,patient,75.0,1
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 I'd just as soon go home head,patient,22.22222222222222,2
 I should go home ,patient,40.0,1
so  then she tried to find people um in  uh in that area that would  they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist ,patient,37.5,7
and um this one woman came ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and uh I really  I really  I thought she was quite good head,patient,33.33333333333333,4
but you_know what happened ,patient,25.0,1
I think they found one in Athol ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and then I started to drive too ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and if I could drive then you see you  c you couldn't have a person that would come to my house ,patient,52.17391304347826,6
right ,patient,0.0,0
so  um so  what happened ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
I really liked this woman the speech therapist head,patient,33.33333333333333,3
but I hadta give her ,patient,40.0,2
and she had all of the  um she had all of this  she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could  uh I could probably learn with this ,patient,58.333333333333336,9
how do you say the right term ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
um we  um I started doing that ,patient,37.5,2
you_know  she would do things like writing a picture ,patient,40.0,4
there'd be pictures or something like that ,patient,75.0,4
and we'd be like ,patient,60.0,1
 uh the  uh  the clock ,patient,25.0,0
you_know  and the clock would be  um we'd be on like a twelve ,patient,50.0,4
and it'd be on six ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and it'd be on three ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
it would be on  uh um you_know it would be on uh eight or something ,patient,56.25,3
and I would hafta write  write it down which one it was head,patient,50.0,3
so  um that was how I started doing with the  th with the speech therapist head,patient,44.44444444444444,6
but then I couldn't  you_know I  I couldn't drive ,patient,38.46153846153847,2
you_know  I'd  we  we can't let her keep on coming ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
and  and she knew I could drive ,patient,37.5,0
 so  um so  then I  I  we found that we could go to  um to Athol ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and it's  and I'm gonna still  I'm gonna go  I'm going three times a week to see FirstnameE ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and um ,patient,0.0,1
yeah  okay  so  that's basically it ,patient,30.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
oh ,patient,0.0,0
 oh I think  well  actually meeting you at  uh at  s at uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's ,patient,27.27272727272727,0
and you  remember you started  you  you_know you were starting to do some of the work with me ,patient,47.61904761904761,7
and you had like pictures ,patient,20.0,1
and I hadta like uh try to say what the words were and stuff like that ,patient,37.5,6
yeah  I remember that ,patient,40.0,0
I was remembering that ,patient,75.0,1
and I was  and I remembered that I was having a hard time to say what the words were ,patient,50.0,7
and uh you_know and you  in the beginning it was pretty easy ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and then of_course the words got more difficult ,patient,12.5,2
and uh so  I_mean  that was a_lot of the work that you did ,patient,40.0,0
and I think the reason why uh y you were involved  that you were involved with that is that uh we were worried that we couldn't even find a speech therapist ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
and I think that's how FirstnameY found you you_know ,patient,50.0,3
and then we finally  then we  then we did find someone to go down to Athol ,patient,38.88888888888889,0
so  and then you were also telling  telling me that uh because I had recently had that problem uh having uh trouble with  with the  uh what had happened in that part  that my  b then I needed  uh I needed everybody to  like uh to become ges ,patient,39.285714285714285,0
what do you  c um what did I hafta say what it ,patient,61.53846153846154,2
my  my brain was  was  still um um needed to be  uh get better ,patient,27.77777777777778,4
I hadta get better before I could  I could come over here to have  to have you help ,patient,45.0,4
so  we waited ,patient,50.0,1
we hadta wait ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
so  do I wanna tell ,patient,50.0,2
you said you wanted uh another story ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
this is just uh a story about how I met you ,patient,63.63636363636363,4
how I met you ,patient,75.0,1
I thought that was pretty  I thought that was pretty  I thought that was very important that this was gonna help me ,patient,52.0,6
 you_know yeah  yeah ,patient,0.0,1
okay ,patient,0.0,0
yup ,patient,0.0,0
um well  this is a  this is a boy ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
and he's  um he's kicking a s um ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and I know what kind of like uh ,patient,25.0,2
it's uh a ball ,patient,60.0,2
it's a sɑkəlu ,patient,75.0,2
and she ,patient,50.0,1
and of_course what happened here is he  he  uh he kicked the  uh the ball ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
and he hit the  uh uh um a window ,patient,30.0,3
maybe it's his neighbor ,patient,60.0,2
and  um or maybe it was his father ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I can call it his father ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
his father is uh in the living room ,patient,50.0,3
and he's sitting there ,patient,40.0,1
and he actually kicked the ball ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and it went  uh it went uh on the other side ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and it fruu ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and it actually hit  um I guess it hit the lamp  the lamp too next to his  uh perhaps to his father  or a  ner a neighbor ,patient,34.375,7
or maybe it was like um uh a young man ,patient,30.0,2
I don't know who it is that's here ,patient,70.0,3
and you_know the problem over here is  is that um he  he looks like he's standing up ,patient,50.0,4
and this  la this fourth one is hard to tell exactly what this is ,patient,40.0,4
whether uh ,patient,50.0,1
this looks like this could be  uh this could be um ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
whether this is like a  um a ball or whether this is his brain that got knocked out_of it ,patient,70.0,7
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
this looks like it's opened here ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
I don't know what this is ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
this doesn't  this isn't very uh ,patient,44.44444444444444,0
it's hard to tell very much of this other_than there's somebody standing up ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
I don't know what s that person is holding  is holding onto ,patient,50.0,5
if it's sposta be um that it could be this ,patient,72.72727272727273,2
I don't know what it is ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
that's all I can say ,patient,83.33333333333334,3
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
I guess he wanted the uh ,patient,50.0,3
this that's what the ,patient,100.0,2
you_know  I  I n ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
the umbrella ,patient,50.0,1
okay  the umbrella head,patient,20.0,2
finally I got to say umbrella ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
the little boy wanted the umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and his mother had it ,patient,40.0,2
the mother doesn't look very happy ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
she doesn't  actually it's hard to tell anything about how she looks ges,patient,50.0,0
she changes over here ,patient,25.0,2
uh so or he  either that or he tried to grab it from her ,patient,40.0,0
I'm not sure ,patient,50.0,1
because it looked like something happened ges ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
um the second uh he looks like well  he's going to leave ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and uh she's gonna  she still has the umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  here's the  s the little boy ,patient,40.0,2
he's actually getting wet ,patient,40.0,1
he's walking ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and um he's getting wet ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and now he's really getting wet because it's probably really coming out a_lot ,patient,40.0,2
you can see right here ,patient,40.0,2
it's like  um this in pʌltu ,patient,62.5,3
head,patient,0.0,0
well  he's a pool  s,patient,37.5,2
pool  s,patient,0.0,1
he's on  this  this pools on his um shoes and stuff like that ,patient,56.25,4
so  he's back in his house ,patient,62.5,4
and he's all covered with water ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and his mother she doesn't look like sh this was a great decision on her part ,patient,52.94117647058824,5
she doesn't look happy ,patient,40.0,1
it's hard to tell really but it's kind_of like uh the cartoon is ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
it's hard to tell what she really looks ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
uh so  I guess that she decided she'll let him use the umbrella ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
and it's still really raining ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
but he  at_least he's dry with the umbrella ,patient,50.0,4
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
laughs well this is pretty funny ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
well  this is a little girl who has a cat ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and the cat is up the tree ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and um I don't know if she was driving ,patient,50.0,2
she had her  bici she was on a tricycle ,patient,60.0,2
so  and here's a little  the dog is up to  is at the tree too ,patient,52.63157894736842,5
and he's barking ,patient,50.0,1
maybe that's what caused  the  uh the cat was afraid or something and went up there ,patient,36.84210526315789,5
either that or they're afraid of the sun ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
I've always said that as a joke ,patient,62.5,3
so  so  here's the ladder ,patient,37.5,2
now what it looks like the  the um maybe the ladder was up there ,patient,46.66666666666666,6
and it fell over ,patient,50.0,1
and so now the  uh this is funny because now the  this man maybe it's  maybe it's her  um her father ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
because he's  he's up there too ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
he's  he's lost ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
he can't get down ,patient,60.0,1
and uh so what happened over here ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
uh a fireman's over here ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and he's gonna  perhaps he's gonna save both the  um his ,patient,35.294117647058826,4
and then there's a  uh a bird up here uh who probably enjoys this whole thing ,patient,27.77777777777778,5
it's not gonna run ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
now I'm xxx ,patient,50.0,1
 I was gonna say this looks like  uh this  the  uh this is almost like a  g looks like a dog one ,patient,42.85714285714285,8
looks like it's some  looks like somebody draw a picture of a dog on here ,patient,58.82352941176471,8
k yeah not years and years ago ,patient,0.0,0
nah I don't remember it ,patient,50.0,1
sure ,patient,0.0,0
well  the first page is  it's on the lefthand side ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
it looks like um maybe it's uh could be  it could be their mother and uh their two daughters ,patient,52.38095238095239,4
and they had like a little  they had a little cat ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the little cat ,patient,25.0,1
they all look kind_of like nervous ges to me ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
they  they didn't look like they were  the little girl was  the two little girls they look like they were dangerous people ,patient,50.0,0
and the cat looked like it was somebody that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
the  the cat was like a funny looking cat too ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
and on this side there was a like  a little girl ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and uh she was very nice looking ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and uh I'm not sure who this guy's sposta be ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
he's  he's uh a man ges ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
and he's got like um a beard ,patient,37.5,2
not a beard but what would you call that ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
mustache touches,patient,0.0,1
and he seems like a nice person ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and he was inviting them to come into their house ,patient,50.0,4
um I don't know exactly what I could say about this whole thing ,patient,50.0,4
if I was a little girl I bet you I could remember all the details on this a_lot better than I could right laughs ,patient,62.5,5
so  um so  then I think what you  you get to see this  um this castle ges from the distance ,patient,37.5,5
and I think there's this young  young woman ,patient,30.0,3
and she looks like she works there ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
she probably works at the  at the  somebody's house ,patient,50.0,4
and she probably hadta like  uh her job was to like um clean ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and she was  she was trying to help out ,patient,50.0,3
she probably wasn't rich ,patient,40.0,1
um but I think they were looking um ,patient,37.5,2
the  ma the major part of the story I think I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna continue with this  is that um they were looking for a  um for a young  for a young  a young man h handsome man who was gonna get married ,patient,45.76271186440678,7
uh and they were  and he was  he was probably in the  in the uh ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
what do you call that place again ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
I said it right but now I've forgotten what to call it ,patient,46.15384615384615,1
uh the castle ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
uh they were gonna have uh like a dance there with music ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
and  uh and they had this um glass um shoe that they found the right one that would fit ,patient,35.0,4
that would be his  that would be his  uh his wife ,patient,69.23076923076923,4
uh so  a_lot_of people came to the  to the uh castle ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and they had the  da they were dancing ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and  um and I think this  this young woman who was very good looking she was like  um she hadta work there ,patient,32.0,7
uh maybe it was her  maybe it was um the mother or something ges ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
but she had  her two daughters  older daughters weren't very attractive head,patient,20.0,5
um and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would  uh somebody  this handsome man was gonna marry her ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
so  um so she was  so  mainly I think they went ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
head,patient,0.0,0
I'm not calling it a dance ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
I know  I'm sorry head,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and I'm trying to think who the  uh who the  who this  this  gram this sweet lady who's like ,patient,48.0,7
she's a magical person ges,patient,50.0,3
and she's gonna like uh ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  this  this poor  g g this pyu poor girl she needed uh to have a beautiful dress ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
but um I don't think she had anything ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
but this um ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
what did they call it ,patient,80.0,1
this  this  that woman that could make things happen ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
I don't know what you call her ,patient,62.5,2
but um she wound up going to the  um going to the dance in this beautiful uh dress ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
and  um and what had happened is that she was gonna  at  at the head of  of twelve she hadta run back home again because she would  all of that  that magical uh dress and everything was gonna be  uh was all gonna be gone ,patient,47.27272727272727,9
and she's gonna have her  her uh clothes that she just worked down in the  uh in the cellar or in the floor or wherever she worked ,patient,48.38709677419355,7
to go back to work ,patient,20.0,3
so  she was trying to run away from uh this beautiful man ges that wanted to marry her ,patient,36.84210526315789,7
and uh she lost this  the glass  the glass um ch shoe ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
so  she managed to make it ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
you_know  she ran away ,patient,20.0,2
she lost  she lost that  that  that  um the magical shoe that she was wearing ,patient,47.368421052631575,8
and uh so they  what they did is they  they hadta find all the  points all the different women that perhaps um would wanna marry him ,patient,48.27586206896552,4
if they had  they hadta fit the uh right glass shoe ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and um I think they kind_of  they had it  uh they had that  they had the  um that  they had the shoe ,patient,40.74074074074074,5
and ev they hadta decide ,patient,40.0,2
everyone was gonna come and try to put it on ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and the only one that could put it on was the young woman that didn't have any money  was poor ,patient,50.0,4
and she put it on ,patient,60.0,1
and then they decided that she was the one that was gonna  that he's gonna  gonna marry her ,patient,50.0,5
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
that's kind_of like ,patient,75.0,1
um how would I would do it ,patient,71.42857142857143,1
uh well  the first thing I would have is uh a knife ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and I would have a  pla um a plate ,patient,40.0,3
and I would have some bread ,patient,50.0,2
and uh depends on what it is ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
if  uh if the bread was never  fluh if it was  uh it was whole you'd hafta take a knife ,patient,50.0,4
and you'd hafta make um two sights ,patient,25.0,2
I don't know what you'd call it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
when you  when you have bread and you cut it into two pieces what do you call that ,patient,57.89473684210527,0
anyway I have the  this um ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have  I'm gonna open up the  uh the um ,patient,45.83333333333333,7
see I'm forgetting what the names of things are ,patient,60.0,5
and then the uh peanuts ,patient,20.0,1
and the  f and the  f the other one starts with an ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
it's kind_of white ,patient,50.0,1
and it looks like ,patient,50.0,1
it starts with an fl ,patient,60.0,3
uh and what you do is you put them together laughs in the bread ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and then you could cut it in the half or something like that ,patient,61.53846153846154,5
and that would be your sandwich ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
but I can't think of what you call uh that funny name ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
uh that white thing that taste is probably  uh tastes really good shrugs with the peanuts laughs ,patient,27.77777777777778,4
I'm sorry laughs ,patient,50.0,2
yeah  I was trying  I'm trying to think of what you ,patient,50.0,0
slights ,patient,0.0,0
is that  I'm close to it ,patient,75.0,4
the slight ,patient,50.0,1
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
