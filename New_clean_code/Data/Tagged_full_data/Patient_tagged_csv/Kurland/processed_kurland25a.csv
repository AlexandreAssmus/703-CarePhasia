at that  it cl ,patient,60.0,3

uh at that point it became clear that midnight was over and the magical uh creatures that were riding in her  uh in her  uh in her castle disappeared ,patient,45.16129032258064,6
and uh then  uh the  the  the horrible creatures that were living in the place looked around and said ,patient,31.818181818181817,8

the  the courtiers wanted to find Cinderella but they could not find her ,patient,35.714285714285715,0
so  uh eventually the  the two scabrous and hein heinous creatures who looked  uh looked around the  uh the palace uh discovered that there  that noone was available to them ,patient,37.142857142857146,6
they said ,patient,50.0,1
 why don't we try Cinderella and see if she might just happen to fit the magical  uh s uh uh the magical ,patient,32.0,6
what  what's that thing called ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
the magical um Versace that she's in ,patient,62.5,2

 that's her altogether ,patient,60.0,1
you_know  that she is the one that we were all looking for ,patient,69.23076923076923,4
and of_course the  the scabrous and nasty creatures were uh horrified that Cinderella would  would've been the other person that they were  that they were uh looking for ,patient,50.0,6
at that point the courtier brou brought Cinderella over ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and  uh and she  uh she just  she was  um she got mah massive amounts of money for the  for the rest of her life because she got to stay with the prince ,patient,42.10526315789473,5
