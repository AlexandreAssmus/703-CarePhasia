and uh he must be f too close to the house because uh he put the ball right through the window laughs ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
and uh as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed ,patient,50.0,4
and he knocked the window ,patient,40.0,2
so  he did ks considerable damage  I guess ,patient,40.0,2
and uh the last p uh picture shows the homeowner you_know holding the soccer ball and looking out the  at the guy ,patient,30.434782608695656,5
so  I can only imagine what happened on the fi fi f if the  fifth f picture if there was one ,patient,43.47826086956522,5
 well  I guess it shows a woman and uh probably her son ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and he wants to go outside  I guess ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and she says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 take your br umbrella you_know before you go ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and he's  he didn't wanna take it ,patient,50.0,3

and as cats are prone to do it couldn't get down from the tree ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
and uh a homeowner or somebody you_know uh a male tried to get up the tree and he couldn't get s the cat down either ,patient,34.61538461538461,4
the girl's crying for her cat ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
uh oh  the reason the guy can't g get down is because his ladder fell down laughs ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
so  he's stuck in the tree ,patient,62.5,3
and the dog uh you_know bark ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
so  I guess we know why the cat is up in the tree ,patient,57.14285714285714,6
and anyways uh way to the right it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy ,patient,37.5,6
