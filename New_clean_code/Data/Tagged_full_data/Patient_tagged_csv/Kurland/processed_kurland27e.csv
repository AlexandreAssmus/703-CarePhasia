um then my sister met me ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and after that I me remember very little ,patient,50.0,2
um I do reme remember but I think it's because they told me that um they instead of  they admitted me but did not do anything at all to um work on my leg which is what they should've done immediately ,patient,50.0,1
um they told  they told me or  they told my sister that um they were gonna let me you_know rest for twenty  f you_know for twenty four hours and evaluate it which was laughs the most asinine decision they ever made because by waiting um and I don't know remember the medical terms but basically I was out ,patient,36.507936507936506,8
um and um my  sis they had sent my sister home ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and she came back up the hospital the next morning ,patient,40.0,2
and um she had a fit because she knew there was something wrong ,patient,46.15384615384615,4
um and I guess that by then I didn't know but she had  she called the doctors and had had a f s f screaming fit ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
and they ended me in to do  to operate on me which was like twenty hours late ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
and by that time I'd lost all use of my right leg ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
um and I remember  I sort_of remember going in and out ,patient,16.666666666666664,4
um I kept thinking ,patient,25.0,1
 I hafta get up ,patient,40.0,1
 I hafta do something ,patient,40.0,1
um and like s uh to me in my head I was yelling at the nurse saying ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
 you_know  why are you doing this to me ,patient,60.0,2
um I didn't come out of it ,patient,62.5,3
you'd hafta ask my sister but at_least three or four days ,patient,25.0,3
um and I gather from my  my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious ,patient,47.05882352941176,5
um and I woke up and was in a blitz uh blank out ges ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
um I came out_of the hospital like after six days I think  seven days ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and they immediately put in  put me in ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
um and it took me another ten  twelve days ,patient,30.0,2

I wanna say Mount  s oh Saint  Mount_St_Vincent ,patient,10.0,3
and um they kept me there for let's see  four five six weeks ,patient,26.666666666666668,5

um and then they let me out ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and um the time in the hospital I ,patient,50.0,3
and I hope  I'm hoping  may I'm changing my mind now ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
but um for the month  for the twelve  six months that I spent there I've had a_lot_of doubt as to whether I should have left it or not ,patient,51.61290322580645,5
