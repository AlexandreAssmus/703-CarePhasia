and FirstnameP was there ,patient,25.0,1
and uh I  I  we had things we were gonna do later in the day ,patient,38.88888888888889,6
but all_of_a_sudden as I was driving I heard uh some chaos and commotion going off in the  by the radio ,patient,47.61904761904761,6
and I went down and  uh and sat there and said ,patient,8.333333333333332,2
 what's going on here ,patient,50.0,1
and  and then I went up to  uh to uh FirstnameP who was getting dressed ,patient,41.17647058823529,0
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 uh FirstnameP  I think some kind of disaster has fall  befallen the world ,patient,31.25,4
 and uh you should come down and look at it ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
so  I went out and we had a  to the tv and  and started looking at it ,patient,45.0,5
once it  once it started it was like you just hadta stop and look at it ,patient,58.82352941176471,5
there was nʌsɪŋu ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and uh my uh uh managing editor at the Review uh who at that  at that time was  was uh uh living nearby came over too ,patient,39.285714285714285,5
so  the three of us just sat around and  and watched ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
but I think a nothing else happened that day ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I think we just shut it all down and  and just s sat there and began to try to deal with it a little bit ,patient,34.61538461538461,6
but it was an extraordinary day because that was when the  uh the two towers uh fell down one after another ,patient,54.54545454545454,5
and it was  it was amazing to just sit there ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
then one of them the  the smoke would go over it and imit,patient,50.0,3
 I  I just couldn't believe my eyes actually just you_know because uh you_know I'm  f I'm from New_York ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
and I've  I've spent  I know what all that stuff is like and uh shrugs ,patient,52.63157894736842,5
head,patient,0.0,0
that was pretty much it ,patient,60.0,2
I think we just sat there and  and  the three of us ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
 then I got my  then I got my daughter ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and we hadta just  we had  I hadta explain to her what  how  what happened ,patient,42.10526315789473,4
that was tough ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
uh Otto was playing soccer and kicked the ball much harder than he expected ,patient,28.57142857142857,4
the  uh the ball uh broke the  the  the glass of uh Mister_McGregor's house and kicked his  and bumped his own  his uh ball  s,patient,28.125,5
at this point Mister_McGregor came out uh very angry and upset by the destruction of his property ,patient,41.17647058823529,7
okay ,patient,0.0,0
 Patricia told her daughter to ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
uh her  her son ,patient,40.0,0
I guess it's a son ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
Patricia told her son to uh make sure to get uh an umbrella today because it might very well rain ,patient,25.0,5
however  young Ants said ,patient,20.0,2
 no I really don't wanna have an umbrella with me today ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
 and I don't think it's going to be particularly rainy ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
so  Ants was on his way to school when eventually he began seeing the uh dribble drops of the  uh of the  uh the rain as it proceeded ,patient,48.38709677419355,6
in_fact  the rain got very heavy ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and  uh and uh he hadta return to his house where his  uh his  uh uh uh his ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
who's she  she ,patient,80.0,1
his  uh uh when his  uh dai when his daughter ,patient,41.66666666666667,0
 I told you before Ants ,patient,50.0,2
 you're sposta take care of your  your clothes and get  uh and be careful of the rain before the rain comes out ,patient,42.30769230769231,7
then young Ants carried  uh carried his  carried himself uh with a nice umbrella to  uh to get to school in the morning ,patient,30.76923076923077,5
you're right ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
yeah  yeah  that's it ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
it's true ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
oh yeah this ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
it was a terribly busy day here in  uh in Woodbrook ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
uh the cat was  uh had  had treedv itself in today  in the  uh in  in the early afternoon ,patient,45.83333333333333,4
and young uh Polly was uh trying very hard to  uh to  to get the cat uh treedv before uh it  it tried to get even farther into the  uh into the tree itself ,patient,31.57894736842105,5
uh dad uh uh attempted to get the tree ,patient,11.11111111111111,3
and he couldn't get out  get the  the  uh he couldn't get the  uh the  the  the tree ,patient,42.30769230769231,7
he couldn't get the tree together for himself ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
uh so  here  uh the  there  there was no point by  of trying to get the ladder because uh dad just couldn't get it up ,patient,35.483870967741936,6
and there it was ,patient,50.0,1
the dog was of_course as dogs always do began to  uh to bark and bark furiously which of_course made the cat even more perturbed ,patient,28.000000000000004,5
uh by this time they hadta actually call a fireman uh to get the cat back ,patient,31.25,4
and uh the  the  the thing had a  a happy ending with a twittering bird ,patient,38.88888888888889,0
oh yeah ,patient,0.0,1
hm,patient,0.0,0
laughs okay ,patient,0.0,1
once upon a time uh the children were astounded to see that there was a new child uh magically appearing from somewhere ,patient,36.36363636363637,7
uh though where she was  she  she came from noone seemed to know ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
uh mother was very  mom  her  her mother was very angry with that idea and thought well I suppose uh that Cinderella can simply be a servant uh this  for her  for herself and for her own two daughters ,patient,40.909090909090914,8
uh and sure enough that's what Cinderella mostly did ,patient,30.0,2
she  mos she mostly worked terribly ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and uh as she was  and  and uh the  uh the other three daughters were of_course uh hideous and  uh and  and vicious ,patient,21.428571428571427,4
and they  uh they were of  they were  uh they  they  uh they  they  they really  they didn't stay  in the  in the  uh in  they didn't sit  stay in the  in the uh uh ,patient,47.05882352941176,0
it's not the apartment ,patient,60.0,2
anyway they  they  they had uh a quiet  they had another spot a sort_of servant's quarters uh that they hadta  hadta keep ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
um it was a  it was a beautiful uh day ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
there was a  there was a  you could see the  uh the  uh the king's castle look  uh looking  uh uh kind_of twinkling in  in everybody's eyes as  uh as they looked besides ,patient,37.2093023255814,8
but luckily there was something that  that  uh that helped Cinderella during this time ,patient,43.75,5
mostly uh some rodents that  uh that appeared uh con constantly in  in  in  in what would've been I guess a very needed  would've needed  a  uh um a uh laughs uh ,patient,41.46341463414634,5
oops can't do it never mind ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
let's forget that part ,patient,40.0,3
uh and also there was a horse lying around and I think  maybe a dog as_well ,patient,23.52941176470588,3
at that point um the two uh other daughters of  s of  uh of their mother uh heard that there was going to be uh a special ball today uh presumably for the prince's uh birthday or something like that ,patient,37.2093023255814,7
and there um Cinderella thought ,patient,0.0,1
 oh  this is going to be fun ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and she got  she got the  a little  uh a little dress herself ,patient,37.5,4
and yet the two nasty daughters said ,patient,14.285714285714285,2
 no  she's not going to come ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
 she can't stay ,patient,40.0,1
she's a servant you_know ,patient,60.0,2
and they are  they were the hautesadj old bourgeoisiesn of the place ,patient,53.84615384615385,4
so  they said ,patient,50.0,2
 fine ,patient,0.0,0
and there was just no  no  uh no point in  in her being here ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
fortunately for Cinderella who would've been no doubt weeping uh in  for  uh for the  the misery of not being at the  uh at the castle uh uh s sin Cinderella had a fairy godmothmother ,patient,42.5,6
and uh she said ,patient,25.0,1
 wow fine ,patient,0.0,0
 I have a  uh I have uh a special uh place that you can do ,patient,41.17647058823529,5
y I will get your  uh I will get you a beautiful uh uh dress ,patient,43.75,3
 so  you can  you can  uh uh come  you can  f you can uh join with  with it  with me ,patient,50.0,3
 and uh then uh I have also uh c uh a uh magic uh uh ,patient,12.5,0
here comes trouble ,patient,0.0,1
um  coach ,patient,0.0,1
uh a magic coach that  uh that  that you can ride ,patient,46.15384615384615,2
and sure enough there were also two beautiful horses that were not like the mangy old horses that Cinderella knew ,patient,30.0,6
uh they move then to the  uh the  the beginning of the  of the  uh of the ball ,patient,50.0,9
and uh all_of_a_sudden uh the  uh the prince's ,patient,20.0,3
and she danced with him ,patient,60.0,2
and they danced the  the ball together uh happily for uh many time  many hours ,patient,23.52941176470588,3
however  Cinderella also hadta uh stop because uh the  uh i in the  in the  at the  cr at the  at the croak ,patient,48.27586206896552,0
laughs no xxx ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
at the  at the croak ,patient,66.66666666666666,4
and  uh and so she hadta walk back from  from the  uh the  the  uh the  the  the  she  she had t to walk  uh she hadta drive back ,patient,30.76923076923077,9
but all_of_a_sudden  uh but at that point she also no longer had her beautiful uh gown ,patient,23.52941176470588,3
at this point the  uh uh the king ,patient,44.44444444444444,0
 who is this beautiful ,patient,60.0,0
uh this  the  the  this  the prince said to the king ,patient,46.66666666666666,0
 who is this beautiful woman ,patient,50.0,0
 I must find her ,patient,60.0,1
and they looked all around uh to try to  to discover her but uh she  th they  they couldn't or not readily ,patient,26.923076923076923,3
eventually they came up to the  to the  uh the place where uh Cinderella uh ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
no  no  sorry ,patient,40.0,0
where the  the two nasty creatures that normally habat inhabited the place uh would  uh would have their  uh would have their  their missing uh slipper ,patient,36.66666666666666,4
uh and uh they tried each one ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and the  these  n these nasty creatures were unable to  uh to  uh to  to  s to fit with the  uh laughs were unable to  to  to  to fit the slipper ,patient,34.14634146341464,6
uh however Cinderella was ,patient,25.0,1
and uh they were uh delighted to be able to discover her ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
and they brought her back to the castle where she  uh she uh uh eventually uh  lived there and  uh and married with the king ,patient,32.142857142857146,8
that was sloppy work ,patient,50.0,2
I should've done better with that really ,patient,62.5,2
yes ,patient,0.0,0
first I would  I would get some bread ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
um and then I would probably um get some butter and slop the bread out ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and then I would  I would get some uh I would say uh uh probably jelly ,patient,41.17647058823529,2
I'd slop the  the jelly in ,patient,62.5,2
I'd  I'd bring it all back hands,patient,60.0,0
then I will  c would cut the other uh portions of it ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
then I'd eat it up ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
