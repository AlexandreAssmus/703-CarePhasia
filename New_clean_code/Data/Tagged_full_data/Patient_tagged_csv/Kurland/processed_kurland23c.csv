oh I  I definitely think uh because uh when I first met you at uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house you were doing the same kind of testing ,patient,37.93103448275862,5
and I think most of them I couldn't  I couldn't say anything ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
um I_mean  I'd  l I'd see the pictures ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
and I  I couldn't say an action thing like somebody's like um bending or something like that ,patient,50.0,5
I_mean  I'd just look at the pictures ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and uh and I'd see pictures of things ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
uh if I saw a peacock or an artichoke or something like that you_know it was  I probably  there was probably most things ,patient,44.0,4
maybe my  I could say my glasses maybe or banana ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
I don't know if I said that at the time but ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
 I could say something like that ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
but most everything else I'd just  you_know I'd just look at the  I would just look at the pictures you_know ,patient,45.83333333333333,5
and I'd  I would be trying to say something but you_know I couldn't do it ,patient,50.0,2
so  I think I'm a_lot better now ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and  um and I think I  I did better in uh well ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
I haven't seen uh Martha and Jacquie and  and  and you and myself were doing that for like a couple of weeks ,patient,36.0,5
and I think that I'm better now than I was then ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
that's  that's what I'm saying ,patient,77.77777777777779,3
that's  that's one of the uh ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
and then of_course that  you_know when you're not doing it for like ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
it's been  it's been uh awhile ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
um I hadn't been thinking about for  uh g up until recently a couple of uh days ago ,patient,40.0,3
and I started thinking about everything else together ,patient,37.5,4
now you_know the saying stuff again ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and uh a_lot_of it was coming back perfectly fine ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and then some of the  some of them uh I've added ,patient,61.53846153846154,4
I've added that I really couldn't  uh I wouldn't be able to do correctly ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
but I think I've done a little bit better ,patient,40.0,4
uh like something's planting you_know ,patient,50.0,2
it has uh planting uh in the ground or something like that ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
I don't know if there's anything else you'd like me to say ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
yes ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
a young man is um kicking a ball ,patient,37.5,2
and he's really not looking where he's going to do it ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and it comes over to a neighbor's window ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and the  uh and the ball goes right through the window ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the  uh it's hard to tell whether that's  it's an old  it's an older  p it's a ,patient,55.55555555555556,4
it could be a elder  uh a young  a old  an older man not an older man  uh that's sitting in the sofa ,patient,42.85714285714285,6
and the  uh the ball just knocked over the uh lamp ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
and  uh and probably  probably could hit the  uh the third  this third person here ,patient,21.052631578947366,4
they're sitting here ,patient,50.0,1
so  the  uh the man uh stands up ,patient,40.0,2
and he's picking up the ball ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and he's looking out the window to see who  who probably threw it ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
well  this is an umbrella ,patient,50.0,2
remember I couldn't even say umbrella ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
 before again I could say umbrella ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
so  uh the mother  mother is holding the uh umbrella ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and the little boy is  uh is looking ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and she probably saying  g um saying goodbye ,patient,11.11111111111111,2
and uh she thinks ,patient,25.0,1
 well  sure don't you think  you should take the umbrella with you ,patient,43.75,3
he said ,patient,50.0,1
 nah I'm ɡʌsu ,patient,40.0,2
but then he's out ,patient,40.0,1
uh and he's ,patient,50.0,1
 oh  look at this ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
 it's raining ,patient,50.0,1
 I should've like um taken that umbrella ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
you can see it's even  it's even getting worse over here ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and he  uh he's back ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
comes  so  he runs back to his house ,patient,40.0,5
and the mother's there ,patient,40.0,2
and she's saying ,patient,50.0,1
they're both looking ,patient,75.0,1
he's soaking wet ,patient,50.0,1
and the mother's looking at him ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and she's gonna probably give him the umbrella ,patient,40.0,3
um and he's going back ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I don't know where he's going ,patient,62.5,2
he's probably going to school ,patient,50.0,2
and he has an umbrella ,patient,40.0,2
and now he's going back to school ,patient,37.5,3
yup ,patient,0.0,0
and uh ,patient,0.0,1
yup ,patient,0.0,0
well  the little girl's looking at the  at the t ,patient,38.46153846153847,0
there's a tree here ,patient,40.0,2
and um now this thing probably was start  I think this was started that the dog was running after a cow ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and the cat ran up the tree into a  li a  le a la ,patient,37.5,4
how do I say this ges ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
oh a breach ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I'm doing two with and I'm not saying it right ,patient,50.0,2
anyway it's the  um it's part of the  it's part of the tree ,patient,61.11111111111112,6
so  this is where the cat eventually got up  was up here ,patient,50.0,4
so  the little girl could've been  could've been actually seeing the  uh the dog uh cha chasing the cat ,patient,45.83333333333333,6
and uh but anyway she  she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
she was probably riding a tric tricycle ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
um so  the  probably her father put the ladder up on the limb  limb  the limb and uh went up there ,patient,32.0,0
and the  l and the ladder fell ,patient,25.0,2
uh so  the  it's pretty high up ,patient,40.0,2
and the cat's up there ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and the  uh the man is way up high ,patient,30.0,3
and he doesn't have a ladder ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and his  uh and by the looks of it his  actually his daughter's more interested in the cat than  than her father ,patient,46.15384615384615,0
or that's  or it's a man perhaps ,patient,50.0,3
and uh there's a bird on the  tr in the tree also but I don't think they're involved in uh ,patient,45.83333333333333,5
yeah  and I don't think they're afraid the cat or anything like that ,patient,50.0,5
uh so  the uh firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going uh to first take the  the father down ,patient,24.0,6
and uh then they're gonna get the cat ,patient,30.0,3
and uh the little girl will be happy ,patient,37.5,2
and the  uh the dog ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
who knows what's gonna happen to the dog ,patient,50.0,5
it's gonna probably chase after her  the cat again and find another tree ,patient,37.5,5
I don't know laughs ,patient,40.0,1
Cinderella ,patient,0.0,0
oh yes ,patient,0.0,1
yup ,patient,0.0,0
okay ,patient,0.0,0
um on ,patient,50.0,1
and they're not very attractive ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and there's a  there's another girl who's a blonde and quite attractive ,patient,43.75,7
uh s same age ,patient,25.0,1
uh but she hasta do things to like do all the work ,patient,25.0,3
and the  um I think that the  uh the mother ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and I'm not sure whether that  the mother  the uh attractive uh one is part  is  she's  uh uh she's part of the family or one of uh a younger  a younger woman ,patient,40.47619047619048,6
well  with  with the  with this mother ,patient,50.0,0
I'm not sure how that works out ,patient,62.5,3
there's a handsome man too ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I'm not sure that that's her husband ,patient,66.66666666666666,4
and  you_know and maybe you_know that's the reason why he has those two  uh the two  the other two woman that aren't very attractive ,patient,34.48275862068966,8
uh so  uh he's  the  uh the young  the young lady um is looking  um looking over the  over the window out into the city and sees the  the uh cass castle which I'm sure that  who  um who's probably the king uh of the  uh of that area uh lives at the regular city ,patient,42.64705882352941,12
and the  the  uh the people live in a regular  in the the house  regular house uh with the mother and the  and the other  the other uh three uh young women ,patient,34.21052631578947,0
and two of them ,patient,50.0,2
I don't even remember if  if they're twins ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
I'm not sure the  the  uh they have like dark  dark hair and stuff like that ,patient,40.0,6
so  she's  um the  uh the king wants to have a party uh for his  his young  s his young son ,patient,37.03703703703704,9
and it'd be nice if uh he might  if everybody in the city that are  uh they get a letter ,patient,60.86956521739131,6
I'm not sure everybody's gonna get one but they're gonna have this dance ,patient,38.88888888888889,4
and um they'll  they could actually meet the  uh this young man uh coming up ,patient,38.88888888888889,3
so  the  uh the young  the young girl  the blonde lady is like down in the  has her own room ,patient,40.0,6
or maybe it could be uh in the ba basement or something ,patient,50.0,3
and she's looking at  uh at a  at the different  uh glah the uh ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
what do you call that ,patient,80.0,1
the dress  the dress is not  apparently it's not perfectly uh beautiful uh in the uh ,patient,36.84210526315789,3
and the other  uh the other uh ,patient,25.0,0
so  they're going  when they're going to the party ,patient,61.53846153846154,4
and uh actually three of the  three of the girls  the two twins um ,patient,31.25,5
and she's  she's going ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and um they're not ,patient,40.0,1
I think part of that I'm missing what's happened ,patient,63.63636363636363,3
well  anyway what  what happens is that the  uh the  uh the young  the young girl um talks to the uh magical grand  grandmother ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
I know I'm not using it correctly head,patient,44.44444444444444,3
uh and she  uh she has a magical f uh ,patient,27.27272727272727,2
I can't think what did I call it ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
anyway it turns her into a beautiful white uh dress ,patient,40.0,3
and she also has uh the  her shoes are made out_of glass ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and she's dancing with a young  with a h handsome man ,patient,46.15384615384615,3
and they seem like they're getting along ,patient,50.0,2
and uh of_course the  the women  the other  the other children uh they're probably adults now aren't really that happy about the fact that uh she has a beautiful gown and  and she's dancing and obviously the uh young gentleman prefers her ,patient,34.69387755102041,6
and uh they also know that  uh that  that all of that  the beautiful dress and everything like that that was given by the  uh this magical grandmother ,patient,50.0,12
I know I'm not using this right head,patient,44.44444444444444,2
uh knows that at twelve o'clock everything will  will change ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and she'll hafta like  uh she's gonna hafta run away ,patient,35.714285714285715,2
so  right  she realizes that it's almost twelve uh that  eve that evening ,patient,41.17647058823529,4
and she's running away down the stairs ,patient,50.0,3
and she lost w the glass um shoe ,patient,25.0,3
and  uh and all of the  she had uh uh uh a castle ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
not a castle ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
well  she uh ,patient,25.0,0
I'm having a difficult saying how this  this young woman was uh ri riding ,patient,43.75,3
but anyway at  at  noo at uh twelve o'clock everything goes back to its original  uh what it was ,patient,40.909090909090914,6
and uh so she's gone ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
she's back at the house ,patient,66.66666666666666,4
and uh the king found this beautiful glass shoe ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and he wants to go all the way around  around the city and try to find this  y this woman ,patient,36.36363636363637,5
and they  uh they came to that particular house ,patient,40.0,0
and they found  uh they had the  gra the uh grass ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
and the young woman  the uh blonde lady uh she actually  she's the only one that will  that can actually fit that glass uh shoe ,patient,37.93103448275862,4
and the  uh everybody's really pleased about it ,patient,50.0,3
and they realized that the  the king ,patient,50.0,3
I guess he's a prince ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
the prince and uh this young woman are gonna get married ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and that's how it ends ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
 no yeah ,patient,0.0,0
I forgot the part ,patient,50.0,2
you_know  how they  how she got to the uh party ,patient,50.0,0
was uh I think they have like  uh uh everything  everything is made out_of like uh ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
like the horses are really mice and stuff like that ,patient,50.0,3
I don't know if it doesn't say that in there but ,patient,46.15384615384615,3

and  um and I could eat it ,patient,37.5,1
and it would be delicious ,patient,60.0,1
