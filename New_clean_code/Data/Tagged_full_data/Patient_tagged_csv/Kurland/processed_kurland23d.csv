the what ,patient,100.0,1
excuse_me ,patient,0.0,0
what did I think of that ,patient,83.33333333333334,2
 well  I thought that uh for one thing in the beginning I would not know all of the  all of the actions and objects  you_know ,patient,44.82758620689656,6
and the more I did that the better I could get at it ,patient,61.53846153846154,3
and I would say really at the end I would do  if I was  if I would  uh if I would do twenty of each I would probably be nineteen or twenty  you_know ,patient,54.054054054054056,5
I thought I was very close  uh I was very good at that I thought ,patient,50.0,3
and  uh and then the last thing I did is I was doing  sens I was writing sensin sɛnsɪsɪz ,patient,33.33333333333333,5
I'm not saying it right head,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I was writing uh senses ,patient,40.0,1
I guess I can't say it  can I ,patient,60.0,2
yes  I was doing that ,patient,50.0,1
and uh I was trying to do  I was trying to do much  I was trying to do a better job ,patient,30.434782608695656,7
but I_mean that  and that would ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and I don't know if you noticed um uh in  in November and uh s January  in January and uh uh December I would  I would take a long time to try to like do a  a good job of doing  um doing ,patient,30.612244897959183,8
say if I was doing an object ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
if I was trying to write a sentence about it  you_know ,patient,50.0,4
I  I was trying very difficult ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
you_know ,patient,0.0,0
and I think the Ipad is the  really the thing that  that started me doing that  you_know ,patient,45.0,6
I don't know if what I'm  if  if  if that's fine ,patient,64.70588235294117,3
yeah  yeah ,patient,0.0,1
yeah ,patient,0.0,0
sure ,patient,0.0,0
yeah  I  I know what this one  this one points ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
 I can see that one coming ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
I just  aw I just walked in the door and I knew that ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
 I was hoping oh_no she's gonna have  somebody else is gonna do it ,patient,38.88888888888889,1
it's not gonna be me ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
well  I think in the beginning uh there was the uh little girl ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
uh she  uh she really loved her cat ,patient,33.33333333333333,0
and the cat went up the tree ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
no  it's not ,patient,60.0,2
so  she tried to get it down ,patient,50.0,2
so  then I think that was probably her father ,patient,50.0,3
um so  she'd say  she said to  uh the girl said to her father ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
 could you go up the brɛntu ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
so  um the  the  uh the father took uh a ladder ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
and he went up the tree ,patient,50.0,2
and uh maybe this is why the cat went up there though ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
I  I guess the dog  the dog caught the  uh the cat up  up  up the tree ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
so  anyway  the  uh the ladder fell down ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and the  uh the father was caught up there ,patient,30.0,2
so  and of_course years ago uh she would hafta go home and call  and call up the fire  the firemen to come but now she probably has a smartphone and she could call up the firemen ,patient,30.76923076923077,5
and they're gonna come back ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and they're gonna get  uh not only are they gonna get the  uh her father ,patient,30.0,6
they're  also they're gonna get the cat ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
and I think that uh there's a nice bird up here ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and the bird  the  the bird is  uh is  is just looking up there ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and it's kind_of like uh singing uh about uh ,patient,40.0,3
I don't know what it's gonna be singing about but uh she's gonna be happy about it ,patient,54.54545454545454,5
I don't know ,patient,50.0,1
something like that ,patient,100.0,2
I tried to start in the  in the beginning and you could see it p progress ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
sure ,patient,0.0,0
oh  okay ,patient,0.0,0
yup  and uh ,patient,0.0,0
I'm not good at telling this story ,patient,50.0,5
um in the beginning I guess it was like an old town probably in Europe ,patient,53.333333333333336,4
um and um there were  um there was a mother with uh little girls ,patient,26.666666666666668,4
and the  uh and then there was a blonde girl who uh when she was young um I don't know what she was doing um but she useta help  she was helping ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
she didn't really do great work ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
I_mean  she wasn't  uh she wasn't uh part of the family ,patient,40.0,4
and I think that the  uh um the mother with the  uh the two girls ,patient,41.17647058823529,6
and they had black hair ,patient,20.0,2
and they weren't very attractive and  when they were young ,patient,41.66666666666667,2
and the little girl when she was ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
I think they were probably nine or ten ,patient,37.5,3
and the uh little blonde girl looked  she looked basically the same ,patient,23.07692307692308,3
when she got older she still was very attractive but she did  uh me she was doing  um she was j just doing work down in  um you_know down in um ,patient,38.23529411764706,2
she was doing work like uh washing clothes and  and cleaning the house and things like that ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
so  anyway  I  I'm not sure whether that's the king or the mayor or something th uh that's gonna s ,patient,48.14814814814815,5
they're sending a letter to everyone that they were gonna have a dance or um ,patient,52.94117647058824,5
I guess there was a castle in the background ,patient,55.55555555555556,5
and uh they were invited to go to see the  uh her son  her  her son who uh ,patient,33.33333333333333,6
and I'm not of_course when I  even when I was young I don't remember this story you_know to be honest with you ,patient,52.0,5
but I think that the  uh the  the young man wanted to get married ,patient,37.5,6
whether he was  I don't know if he was going to be the king in the future or whether he was just an important person  young important person or something ,patient,51.51515151515152,6
so  they  uh they  they invited probably ,patient,40.0,0
I don't know if the people were probably  had uh more money or something like that ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
but the mother she was kind_of an evil person ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and I think that the older  those two little girls now that they're older they're  uh I don't think that they're  they're  uh they're not ,patient,51.42857142857142,6
you_know  they're not wonderful people either  I don't think ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
so  um the  um the little  the blonde  the blonde uh girl um she was looking at beautiful  uh a dress ,patient,30.76923076923077,4
dr no  that's not a dress ,patient,50.0,0
if I'm saying now xxx term dress ,patient,37.5,2
is that a dress ,patient,75.0,2
I guess it's a dress ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
uh pictures of it and stuff like that ,patient,50.0,3
and she was thinking about uh she has the three mice and the  the cat and the  and the  and the horse ,patient,40.0,5
that was part of her jobs down in the you_know maybe it's in a barn or something like that ,patient,65.0,6
and uh so I think what got things a_lot better is that the fairy godmother helped her out um when she went to the dance ,patient,44.0,6
and uh so the  uh there was a pumpkin uh turned into this ,patient,35.714285714285715,4
so  the  uh the fairy godmother turned the pumpkin into a uh ,patient,42.85714285714285,0
I don't know what I could call that ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
and the  uh and the  uh the  the horse  the  ho I think maybe the three  uh the three um mice became  they're gonna carry this uh c carri carriage ,patient,28.205128205128204,5
xxx it's a carriage ,patient,60.0,2
they  they  they went to  they went to the dance ,patient,53.84615384615385,0
and she looked gorgeous ,patient,25.0,1
she had  she had a beautiful dress and she was a blonde and everything ,patient,46.66666666666666,3
and she danced with the  the prince ,patient,50.0,3
and  uh but what would happen at  n at  at the  uh at noon  at the uh not noon  at  uh at twelve o'clock uh the  uh everything was gonna go  was gonna return ,patient,33.33333333333333,9
so  the  uh the three mice are gonna turn  are gonna turn into  they're gonna  they're gonna go back to like mices ,patient,33.33333333333333,7
and the  ho the  uh the other horse or something like that was ,patient,53.333333333333336,6
they're all gonna go back to the  uh to the barn or something like that ,patient,55.55555555555556,7
so  she says ,patient,50.0,2
 I hafta go ,patient,25.0,1
she runs away ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and she had like a glass slipper ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and she  and she was running away because it was gonna be right at  at  uh at uh ,patient,45.45454545454545,5
I keep on saying noontime but it's like twelve o'clock ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
she  so  so  anyway  the  uh uh the king and his  a pi ,patient,31.57894736842105,0
it  it  it was actually one of his  his like  his like lieutenant or something like that went all around the city or the large town ,patient,50.0,0
and she ,patient,50.0,1
and the  uh the prince was hoping if she ,patient,50.0,2
so  um she ,patient,25.0,0
and she actually found the  uh the  um the blonde  uh this ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
sh I don't know if she was a maid or something ,patient,58.333333333333336,3
she was doing that kind of work ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and she had a glass uh shoe that matches with the one that the  uh the king or the mare mayor something ,patient,43.47826086956522,5
and uh they said ,patient,25.0,1
 ah ,patient,0.0,0
and all the other women would try to put on the glass slipper ,patient,38.46153846153847,3
and of_course  you_know it would  it wouldn't fit ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and especially the  uh this evil mother and  uh and her two daughters were not happy about it at all ,patient,27.27272727272727,3
so  then at the end she had the uh glass slipper ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and at the end you could see that the uh prince and that the uh blonde woman are gonna get married ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
I was trying to do it ,patient,50.0,2
