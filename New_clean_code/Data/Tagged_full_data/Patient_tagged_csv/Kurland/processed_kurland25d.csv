that's an interesting question  isn't it ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
well um it seemed  it  it probably  presumably you could actually do this on  on a  on a uh uh less high tech ,patient,39.285714285714285,7
but it is nice to have ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and uh it  it  it has several different functions ,patient,27.27272727272727,0
one is the uh um ,patient,40.0,2
what do you call that thing ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
um know yourself ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
uh that  the  uh the thing we always talk to together ,patient,38.46153846153847,0
um the ,patient,50.0,1
 go to meeting  yeah ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
that's one  one thing ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
then there's uh t s the stɑprɑwɑtʃu ,patient,25.0,3
and there's the  uh the  uh the  the  the  the basic media of the  of the thing ,patient,45.83333333333333,8
so  it has a_lot_of different uh uses I think ,patient,50.0,3
so  it  I guess it's  it's probably exactly what you need for your ,patient,61.11111111111112,5
well  I_mean  sure ,patient,0.0,2
because you_know something got  bet got better here through the  through the whole operation uh  I think ,patient,35.0,4
you_know  it certainly seems that's  that seems to be the case because I was really flailing there at the beginning ,patient,47.82608695652174,6
and  um and then I flailed again when  when I was trying not to look at the  at the uh uh letters ,patient,36.0,5
you_know  just  I would  I would just push it ges,patient,38.46153846153847,3
so  uh that  and that seems to have been the second way to help  help myself here ,patient,35.0,0
is  uh because then I  I could get to the point where I could sort_of write these things a little bit ,patient,52.17391304347826,6
um and  and actually everyday this is getting a little better now ,patient,23.07692307692308,3

the king had  had  a  s had a party uh where the  uh all of the  the uh uh beautiful women could be  could be uh known to the  uh to the prince who would be  who  who would uh find himself uh uh a  uh um a  uh find himself a uh per person laughs ,patient,44.776119402985074,9
um  where the  the young prince could meet all of the other women that were around in the valley ,patient,52.38095238095239,0
Cinderella would gladly have taken  had  had uh gone to that party except she was not allowed ,patient,47.368421052631575,4
the two uh uh hideous women were all deck  decked up looking their very best ,patient,31.25,5
uh but Cinderella was not allowed to go ,patient,12.5,2
at that point a fairy godmomother ,patient,50.0,3
here uh the  uh the two uh women who lived in in  the house were  were not very attractive ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
uh and the prince was not much interested in them ,patient,40.0,3
but in turn  in time he discovered that Cinderella was uh really quite charming and delightful ,patient,29.411764705882355,3
and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit  a bit longer ,patient,43.75,4
but uh then came uh the stroke of midnight ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and she  uh she got back her  her  her  uh she got back to her  uh her  um to her  to her room and had a wonderful time ,patient,40.0,7
the prince there would  would s still had not found the  uh the  the  the  uh the perfect woman that he adored ,patient,48.14814814814815,6
so  uh several people started looking around to see them uh and to decide which one was really  Cinder was like  cin which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted ,patient,29.411764705882355,8
one after another several of these terrible creatures uh proved that she could not  f she could not f uh fill  fit the  the  uh the  uh she couldn't fit the  uh the portions  the  the  uh could not fit the um ,patient,38.46153846153847,6
