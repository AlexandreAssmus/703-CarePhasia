yep ,patient,0.0,0
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
 it  it  uh it's a good way ,patient,45.45454545454545,0
um I think it could've been extended with the expansion of the words more than just twenty on the object and twenty uh subject it's  uh subject ,patient,46.66666666666666,11
um after awhile that gets a lil ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
yeah  at_least to me it did ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
to others ges probably not ,patient,20.0,2
uh knowing the depth of the group that you have ,patient,50.0,4
uh but to me it got really  rep after awhile I got tireding ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
uh uh bɑltʃɪŋu ,patient,0.0,1
so  uh I like a small expansion with  with uh xxx words would've been nice ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
um I don't know if you could do that uh with the group or with the coming group ges ,patient,50.0,5
it  would it be əpɪkəbəlu ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
well  it depends on probably where the person is ,patient,50.0,3
where the  where the person sits in that  that group ,patient,58.333333333333336,0
uh if they  if they reach a certain mark then uh I'd  I'd  then I said  say ,patient,43.47826086956522,6
 okay expand that person ,patient,20.0,1
uh if they don't they stay on the same words ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
and they keep going through it you_know ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
 I don't know ,patient,40.0,1
 yeah you expanded mine ,patient,20.0,1
and I doubt that  that some of the people would  would uh be able to take that kind of expansion ,patient,50.0,8
it would've been putting an awful lot of pressure on them ,patient,66.66666666666666,5
um so  that was good ,patient,50.0,0
uh but it got a little boring towards the end ,patient,40.0,4
 well the word retrieval was severe at the beginning ,patient,40.0,3
uh uh I think it more severe at the beginning than it is now ,patient,50.0,4
uh but yeah when you say ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 well   I  I wouldn't quite meet that retrieval  wouldn't be at that retrieval level that the rest of the group is at ,patient,50.0,6
it was true ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I would agree that  that um I don't fit into uh that group along that  that ges line ,patient,52.38095238095239,4
so ,patient,0.0,0
oh yeah it definitely helped me ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
uh I can speak now a_lot more fluent than I could at the beginning ,patient,50.0,3
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
beginning middle and the end oh_boy ,patient,16.666666666666664,3

 oh_my_gosh how will this ever happen ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and she got in the house ,patient,50.0,3
and the next day there come a knock on the door ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
 what the heck is that ,patient,66.66666666666666,0
and it was the princess ,patient,60.0,2
and the princess ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 well  I wanna see if anyone has my shoes ,patient,36.36363636363637,3

 oh_my_gosh ,patient,0.0,0
and he looked at it ,patient,60.0,2
and the shoe was on ,patient,60.0,2
and because it was on he ,patient,83.33333333333334,3
and they went off and they got married ,patient,50.0,3
and they lived happy kɛvɚu ,patient,20.0,2
mhm ,patient,0.0,0
tell me how ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
well  I haven't done that lately ,patient,37.5,2
but it is uh really the best thing going ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
the what you do is you get the peanut butter and  and  and  and jelly all together ges ,patient,38.095238095238095,5
and you hafta kind_of look at it and say ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
hm okay I've got myself a loaf of bread ,patient,50.0,3
and I've got a  a firm and a  and a  a lighter loaf ,patient,41.17647058823529,3
and I'll choose the firm though because the peanut butter is gonna be sticky and when you spread it ,patient,47.61904761904761,3
especially with one hand  left hand ,patient,14.285714285714285,4
that's gonna tear the bread ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and so the lighter loaf can't do or you'll end up with  with your bread all ripped up ,patient,47.61904761904761,4
so  you take the thicker loaf and slice it down ges,patient,41.66666666666667,3
and slice it into two slices each about inch ges,patient,40.0,5
and uh took those ges and lay them down ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and take the peanut butter first points,patient,14.285714285714285,2
and bread ,patient,0.0,1
and the bread won't tear ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
that bread stays the same ,patient,40.0,2
then you take the  the  the tʃɛlɪu ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
oh i it's good tasting jelly ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  you dip ges,patient,40.0,1
and you spread ges,patient,25.0,1
and it is on top of the peanut butter because I guess  because if you put that on first the jelly and then the peanut butter it would splatter all over ,patient,50.0,7
so  you spread the peanut butter ges,patient,37.5,3
so  you got a loaf  s,patient,37.5,2
and you take your bare piece of bread that's  that's  that's  that's  that's not used ,patient,54.16666666666666,3
and you pick it up and put that on top of the whole thing ges,patient,46.66666666666666,6
and it'll  press it down just enough that it'll start the jelly falling of the edges ges ,patient,50.0,0
and then you pick it up ges,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and you chomp it down ,patient,60.0,1
