I think it's  um it's August ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and um it was a Friday ,patient,50.0,2
it was about uh eight fifty eight eight fifty nine ,patient,20.0,3
it was almost nine o'clock ,patient,40.0,3
I was driving on the Boston_Road ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
I was driving uh a nineteen ninety three Ford van ,patient,30.0,3
we had just gone to a Home_Depot ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and  and uh she brought ,patient,16.666666666666664,0
a bathroom  s,patient,25.0,1
a bathroom  s,patient,25.0,1
it was made out_of fiberglass ,patient,40.0,1
and then I showed her a thirty foot long uh ladder uh that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less ,patient,37.93103448275862,5
and uh then I started driving ,patient,16.666666666666664,1
like I said on Boston_Road ,patient,40.0,1
and I was going to um Yuno ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and um FirstnameG looked at me and she said ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 um turned right ,patient,0.0,1
 and then try to put on your brakes ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
and I wasn't going very fast anyway ,patient,25.0,2
so  I managed to like not hit anything ,patient,44.44444444444444,2
and I managed to turn right ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and uh I pulled off of the side of the road ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
and uh I put on the brakes ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that ges,patient,53.84615384615385,4
I was holding on to the wheel ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
and then  uh and that was  that was ,patient,40.0,0
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor ,patient,36.84210526315789,6
and they all could see something was happening ,patient,62.5,2
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground ,patient,46.15384615384615,5
and uh um then somebody  somebody uh with a smartphone called up uh an ambulance ,patient,37.5,0
and uh they said ,patient,25.0,1
 you're going to the hospital ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and uh after that I  d it took me a long time before I could say um Bay  uh Bay_State  or something like that ,patient,44.44444444444444,5
and um you_know I was saying to myself um I said ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
 obviously I feel pretty good ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 and they're taking me to  uh they're using an ambulance ,patient,50.0,3
 and they're taking me to the hospital at Bay_State ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
 and uh obviously there must be something wrong with me or else I wouldn't be going to uh a hospital in an ambulance ,patient,52.0,7
and uh then I tried to say something to FirstnameG ,patient,20.0,2
and then I couldn't say anything ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
and then I couldn't say the right words ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I_mean  I knew what I could say but I couldn't say it ,patient,50.0,2
and that's when I realized that  uh that I probably had a stroke ,patient,53.333333333333336,5
I think that's ges ,patient,60.0,2
have I said  said that before ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
oh  okay head,patient,0.0,1
 sure  okay ,patient,0.0,0
uhhuh ,patient,0.0,0
uhhuh ,patient,0.0,0
um well  in the beginning there's uh a little girl ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
and there's a cat ,patient,40.0,2
and um I think that the little girl loves the cat ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
it's a good friend ,patient,60.0,2
I don't know if it's male or female ,patient,50.0,3
and she'd like  she wanted to get  have the  uh the cat off of a tree ,patient,40.0,6
it's up on the  on the uh tr træntʃu ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
I can't say ,patient,50.0,1
bræntsu ,patient,0.0,0
bræntsɪzu ,patient,0.0,0
bræntsu ,patient,0.0,0
okay  uh so  she asked her father if he could use a ladder and to go up to the tree and get the cat ,patient,42.30769230769231,5
and then a ladder fell down ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get away to this  far away as possible ,patient,36.0,6
um either that or um the  the dog wished the father hadn't fallen down the ladder laughs ,patient,36.84210526315789,8
so  then there's a bird ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
um I don't know how  what the  the  the bird is involved ,patient,50.0,5
it's s s gonna  s it's  s it's making a song perhaps ,patient,38.88888888888889,3
and uh there's uh another uh ladder that's involved with the firemen ,patient,42.85714285714285,5
and they're trying to lift up the  uh they're gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his ,patient,44.0,5
uh if the  if the cat was more important of_course the  the uh firemen would get the cat first and then the dir the  uh and then  then  uh then get the  uh the father down ,patient,30.952380952380956,5
uh is there anything else ,patient,60.0,2
yup ,patient,0.0,0
yeah  you_know I  I uh ,patient,28.57142857142857,0
that thing about the grand  that  about the  uh the grandmother ,patient,50.0,5
I've forgotten what I should call  the right term to call the grandmother ,patient,46.66666666666666,5
yeah  yeah ,patient,0.0,1
oh  I can't look at it ,patient,50.0,2
okay ,patient,0.0,0
okay  the version ,patient,25.0,2

um in the very beginning there's um a mother ,patient,40.0,3
there are two  two daughters ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and uh I'm not sure ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
there's another woman  young girl ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and she's a blonde ,patient,60.0,2
and she has blue hi eyes ,patient,16.666666666666664,3
and uh the  uh the two  the two daughters have dark hair ,patient,21.428571428571427,0
and they're uh young then ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and then  uh then this continues in the future ,patient,30.0,3
time is going on ,patient,50.0,1
and the  uh the girls are much older ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and the two  uh two daughters are uh not very attractive ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
and the blonde lady has  her hair's now kind_of light brown but her  you can still see her blue eyes ,patient,30.434782608695656,4
and uh she's uh ,patient,40.0,1
in the beginning I have no idea why that young  the blonde girl is there ,patient,50.0,4
whether uh she's an  or she's like uh ,patient,54.54545454545454,2
something happened to their family and they're just taking you  they're gonna uh live ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
so  anyway I'm not sure about that ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
so  um so  anyway she's like  um her friends are all other mice ,patient,35.294117647058826,3
and uh the cat seems kind_of evil to me ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
the cat's a_little evil ,patient,20.0,2
there's a horse  there's a horse there ,patient,40.0,3

and uh the  um they realize that uh there's  that they're going to  um there's a  k there's a king ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
and he has a son ,patient,40.0,2
and um they  they  wan they'd like to have a dance uh because they would like to marry the  uh the son who's probably a prince ,patient,41.935483870967744,0
and uh so they invite everybody in the town ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
I think ,patient,50.0,1
or just people that have a_lot_of money and you_know the uh ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
so  uh there's a litter ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and uh they could  they could go to uh a prawn ,patient,50.0,3
not a prawn ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I'm not using the right xxx ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
