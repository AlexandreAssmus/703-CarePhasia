now try  work  work  I hafta work for it ,patient,25.0,3
um what I was doing that day ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
before ,patient,100.0,0
I was outside working in the garden ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
and it was hot ,patient,50.0,1
it was in the beginning of June ,patient,71.42857142857143,4
and it was three years ago when it was in the nineties ,patient,58.333333333333336,4
but I love to work in the garden ,patient,37.5,4
and I was working in the garden ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and all_of_a_sudden it was getting  you_know I was getting a little not dizzy but I just wasn't feeling right ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I think I better stop because it's getting too hot ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
so  I cleaned up ,patient,60.0,1
I had a shower ,patient,50.0,2
and um I went shopping ,patient,20.0,1
I was looking for curtains ,patient,60.0,2
and uh it was getting later because I always like to get home by three o'clock to watch my program laughs ,patient,28.57142857142857,5
so  uh on my way home I was passing another store whi which had curtains ,patient,43.75,3
so  I thought ,patient,50.0,1
 well  let me check it out in there ,patient,30.0,3
so  I went in there ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and as I'm walking around all of sudden I'm like  um the ges,patient,62.5,3
nothing hurt ,patient,50.0,1
nothing hurt ,patient,50.0,1
but it was just getting weird ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I thought ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 what is happening ,patient,50.0,1
so  I thought ,patient,50.0,1
 must be from the heat ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
so  uh I thought I better go home ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I'm driving and I'm by myself ,patient,75.0,3
so  I went home got clea uh cooled down and I had a uh something to n eat ,patient,36.84210526315789,3
and then I sat and my story came on ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
and uh I don't remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything ,patient,30.76923076923077,3
but all_of_a_sudden my son who lives with me he's calling me ,patient,58.333333333333336,5
and he comes home about five o'clock ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and uh clears,patient,0.0,1
and he says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 what are you doing ,patient,60.0,1
he says ,patient,50.0,1
 you should be cooking ,patient,60.0,1
he says it's ,patient,75.0,2
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 oh  you're home early ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
and he says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 no ,patient,0.0,0
he says ,patient,50.0,1
 it's five o'clock ,patient,40.0,2
so  between that time when the story was about to start and five o'clock I was out ,patient,44.44444444444444,8
but I could talk ,patient,50.0,1
I could walk ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I could  nothing  nothing bothered me ,patient,62.5,0
but I got in the kitchen and I stood there ,patient,40.0,3
and I said to him ,patient,60.0,2
 whadya ,patient,0.0,1
 what am I cooking ,patient,60.0,1
 supper ,patient,0.0,1
 okay ,patient,0.0,0
so  I took a  mo a few more steps and I says ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
 what do I have for supper ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
 what am I making for supper ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
he says ,patient,50.0,1

we were making lambchops on the grill ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and I had them marinated ,patient,40.0,2
and uh I says ,patient,25.0,1
 well  what was I making ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
so  he  he told me ,patient,57.14285714285714,2
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 where are ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I didn't even know where they were ,patient,62.5,2
he says ,patient,50.0,1
 in the refrigerator ,patient,50.0,0
and I didn't even know what a refrigerator was ,patient,50.0,3
and then I started to get not scared but I thought ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
 something's wrong with me ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
 because I'm talking ,patient,60.0,0
 I'm talking very clear and everything ,patient,37.5,2
but I didn't know anything that was going on ,patient,60.0,3
uh in my mind I did but I couldn't get them out ,patient,53.84615384615385,3
so  um he looked at me and uh he says ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
 what's wrong with you ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 I don't know ,patient,40.0,1
 something's wrong with me ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
so  I have a daughter who lives in uh Vernon ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
and uh I said to him I says ,patient,50.0,2
 call ,patient,0.0,1
and he looked ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 call s you know you know who ,patient,37.5,3
so  uh I couldn't get her name out ,patient,50.0,2
so  he called her ,patient,60.0,1
he realized what I was trying to get ,patient,50.0,3
so  I got her on ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and I told her ,patient,50.0,1
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 there is something wrong with me ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
 whadya ,patient,0.0,1
 he's  I don't know ,patient,50.0,2
 I know who you are but I don't  I can't get your name out ,patient,55.55555555555556,0
so  she says ,patient,50.0,2
 there's nothing wrong with you  mom ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
 it's hot and we told you ,patient,50.0,2
 don't work in the garden ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 there is something else wrong with me ,patient,50.0,3
so  then all_of_a_sudden her name came ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
because it's going through my mind ,patient,71.42857142857143,3
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 Donna there is something wrong ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I started to cry ,patient,20.0,2
so  she says ,patient,50.0,2
 mom stay on the phone ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
then she got her other phone and she called the doctor ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and the doctor said ,patient,25.0,2
 get her up to the hospital ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
so  they took me up to the hospital ,patient,66.66666666666666,3
she called her husband who worked down this end ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
and um he came and my son took me to the emergency room ,patient,38.46153846153847,4
and I was there for oh I guess  about oh twelve hours thirteen hours ,patient,26.666666666666668,1
and they didn't know what was wrong with me ,patient,60.0,4
because every question they asked me I said right off correct ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
um everything ,patient,50.0,1
and uh count backwards imit,patient,0.0,2
went right back ,patient,0.0,2
and uh we were you_know talking and I was walking around ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
and I hadta go to the bathroom ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
and I knew where the bathroom was  laughs in the hospital ,patient,50.0,6
and I went there ,patient,25.0,1
and uh we came out and we were talking and talking ,patient,36.36363636363637,2
and um the one doctor said ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 we're not sure what is wrong with you ,patient,60.0,5
 everything seems to be fine ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 everything is connecting with you ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
so  uh meantime I didn't realize that I didn't know the names of my  ho all my other family ,patient,47.82608695652174,5
so  they  um they just kept me there ,patient,40.0,0
and all_of_a_sudden one doctor says ,patient,0.0,2
 well  you've got a choice ,patient,37.5,2
 you can either ,patient,50.0,1
it was on a weekend which is a bad time ,patient,70.0,3
Februa  uh Fridays ,patient,0.0,1
and sh he says um ,patient,20.0,1
 you have a choice ,patient,40.0,2
 you can either can go home for the weekend and come back Monday ,patient,35.714285714285715,3
 or you can stay over the weekend ,patient,50.0,3
now when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything they're not gonna say ,patient,42.10526315789473,6
 oh  I'll stay at the hospital  laughs ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
especially on a weekend  laughs ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
so  we went home ,patient,40.0,1
so  my  my son inlaw took me home to her ,patient,50.0,4
and I was there for the weekend ,patient,57.14285714285714,3
and um they had gone away for uh the weekend ,patient,40.0,3
not the  the whole weekend just over  overnight that one night ,patient,30.76923076923077,0
because originally I was sposta babysit for them anyway ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
so  uh just by luck my daughter said to her husband ,patient,41.66666666666667,3
 bring your father up too ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
 I don't think mom should be by herself ,patient,60.0,3
so  because I had ges,patient,33.33333333333333,0
so  um the father came up ,patient,42.85714285714285,2
and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart ,patient,42.85714285714285,3
I cried snaps,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I just wouldn't stop crying ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
and then all_of_a_sudden I'd sleep ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
I'd sleep for hours ,patient,60.0,2
and I didn't realize it ,patient,50.0,1
and then uh we went the weekend we went to the doctors and uh ,patient,35.714285714285715,5
 well  she seems to be fine ,patient,25.0,2
 she's talking she's doing this and she's doing that ,patient,61.53846153846154,2
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 but there is something going on with my head ,patient,50.0,5
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 something's wrong there ,patient,40.0,1
so  I  arra I went home ,patient,37.5,1
I was head,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and about a week later uh they  s my doctors uh sent a neurologist to me ,patient,35.294117647058826,0
and when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me he says ,patient,58.82352941176471,5
 you had a stroke ,patient,40.0,2
he says ,patient,50.0,1
 it wasn't a big one but he says ,patient,40.0,2
 you had a stroke ,patient,40.0,2
so  that's how I knew I had a stroke laughs ,patient,50.0,3
it was really really weird ,patient,40.0,2
but uh I  I forgot so many things ,patient,22.22222222222222,3
like in the morning every morning after I got my breakfast ready I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper ,patient,47.82608695652174,4
and head,patient,0.0,1
I looked at it and I couldn't get the words ,patient,54.54545454545454,3
I  cou I knew what they were but I could not say any of those words ,patient,58.82352941176471,0
and I  t what I did get to read I didn't understand ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
so  I tried for a couple of days and like ,patient,45.45454545454545,4
 the  the heck with this ,patient,57.14285714285714,0
 I just won't read anymore ,patient,28.57142857142857,1
after a couple more days I'm sitting there and I thought ,patient,41.66666666666667,5
 you are gonna learn to read that paper ,patient,30.0,4
I started reading it ,patient,50.0,2
now I read a paper ,patient,40.0,2
and it didn't take me long but I worked hard at it ,patient,46.15384615384615,1
and every morning when I got up after I you_know into the bathroom and everything I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there ,patient,53.84615384615385,6
and I'd think of my daughter's family ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
there's four people in the family ,patient,42.85714285714285,4
there's two boys her husband and herself ,patient,37.5,3
I knew her name but I couldn't get his name out and the two boys ,patient,43.75,2
and I would just close my eyes and visualize it ,patient,40.0,2
and gradually all_of_a_sudden I'd see their names ,patient,37.5,3
and gradually it would come ,patient,40.0,1
then I went with my oldest son with his family ,patient,50.0,3
it was tiring ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
and I did that at night too when I went to bed before I went to sleep ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother were in all that ,patient,52.63157894736842,4
and it was a long time but it  it worked ,patient,45.45454545454545,2
it really really worked ,patient,25.0,1
and I said to my daughter one day I says ,patient,40.0,3
 you_know  I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me ,patient,46.66666666666666,4
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 I am so tired ,patient,40.0,2
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I don't do anything ,patient,50.0,1
she says ,patient,50.0,1
 Mom  you are doing a whole lot ,patient,33.33333333333333,3
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 such as what ,patient,50.0,0
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 all I'm do ,patient,60.0,4
 well  that's it ,patient,50.0,2
she says ,patient,50.0,1
 you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it ,patient,50.0,3
but um it all came ,patient,40.0,2
it's just now I  I have trouble every once in awhile to get my words out ,patient,44.44444444444444,4
and that and when I write ,patient,50.0,2
it's getting better ,patient,50.0,1
sometimes when I write ges,patient,40.0,1
and all_of_a_sudden I look at it and I thought ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
 no  that's not that word  laughs ,patient,40.0,3
and the first time I saw that was when I made my first  uh when I was going to the store ,patient,54.54545454545454,6
my little shopping thing ,patient,25.0,1
I needed uh mayonnaise ,patient,25.0,1
laughs so  laughs  I'm writing and writing ,patient,30.0,2
I get to the store and I came to that word ,patient,54.54545454545454,4
I couldn't figure out what it was ,patient,75.0,2
the  head,patient,33.33333333333333,1
and I couldn't remember what it was ,patient,62.5,2
and by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back ,patient,47.05882352941176,4
 now I hafta think ,patient,20.0,1
 what was I gonna do with this ,patient,55.55555555555556,3
then I knew what it was ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
it would come ,patient,66.66666666666666,1
I'd forget it again but then in it  but that's the way it goes ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
I know everything but um I still hafta  I forget a_lot_of things ,patient,38.46153846153847,2
but everybody says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 oh  I forget too ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
 I'm always forgetting ,patient,40.0,1
you_know  and it's fine because I  I laugh about it ,patient,53.84615384615385,0
because when I'm with my friends and out I see people having trouble ,patient,50.0,4
they can't remember ,patient,50.0,1
 I know what I wanna say but I can't say it ,patient,46.15384615384615,2
and there's nothing wrong with them ,patient,57.14285714285714,4
so  I think ,patient,50.0,1
 well  maybe you're not that bad laughs ,patient,30.0,2
but um I have had so much pleasure here and learning ,patient,18.181818181818183,3
and um so many people ,patient,0.0,2
 I don't know what you still go to there ,patient,45.45454545454545,3
I says ,patient,50.0,1
 I'll go there until I'm finished ,patient,55.55555555555556,2
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 points,patient,0.0,1
I said ,patient,50.0,1
 when I'm finished ,patient,60.0,0
and I said ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I know I'm not going to be a hundred percent ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
but I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I am still learning ,patient,40.0,1
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I  watch everybody here ,patient,33.33333333333333,2
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I have seen so many improvements ,patient,28.57142857142857,3
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 it's wonderful ,patient,50.0,1
and I says ,patient,33.33333333333333,1
 I'm just so fortunate that I'm not had the problem that most of them here have ,patient,47.368421052631575,7
nods yes  it has really helped ,patient,28.57142857142857,2
still helps laughs  yeah ,patient,0.0,2
it is ,patient,100.0,1
for each one ,patient,66.66666666666666,2
alright  the story is about a boy um playing soccer ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and he breaks a window  in a house ,patient,44.44444444444444,3
and then points,patient,0.0,1
and the soccer ball coming through the window to hit him ,patient,36.36363636363637,4
and then he gets up and um he's looking out the window holding the soccer ball ,patient,41.17647058823529,1
and uh  that's about what he has for the whole story ,patient,61.53846153846154,0
but um  it more or less is a lesson for him that you don't do that kind of ball playing so close to buildings to houses ,patient,42.85714285714285,6
and um ,patient,0.0,1
well  there's one thing that I have been always happy about what happened to me ,patient,52.94117647058824,7
like um the fortunate stroke that I had that wasn't too bad was  um it was in nineteen seventy five  I had cancer ,patient,38.46153846153847,5
and I had uh a mas um okay masectomy ,patient,22.22222222222222,2
and um I came through it very well ,patient,37.5,2
and there was a_lot that was in there ,patient,37.5,4
but um I got it through finally ,patient,42.85714285714285,1
so  that's what about thirty some odd years already ,patient,36.36363636363637,3
and uh I'm very proud of that ,patient,50.0,3
and I was the first one in the family to have cancer ,patient,41.66666666666667,4
and then all_of_a_sudden other members of my family ,patient,25.0,4
immediate you_know my living home family ,patient,16.666666666666664,2
um they have come down with it ,patient,71.42857142857143,2
and they're gone ,patient,50.0,1
and uh I have always been very thankful that I came through the way I did ,patient,50.0,6
and the doctors were amazed because it was so fast that I  I healed and everything ,patient,52.94117647058824,4
I didn't go home the way a_lot_of people who have masectomies ,patient,33.33333333333333,4
