I think it's [/] &-um it's August . 35050_37700
and &-um it was a Friday . 37826_40566
"it was about &-uh eight fifty eight, eight fifty nine . 41826_48856"
it was almost nine o'clock . 48907_50557
I was driving on the Boston_Road . 51228_54678
I was driving &-uh a nineteen ninety three Ford van . 55309_59939
we had just gone to a Home_Depot . 60675_63255
and [/] and &-uh she brought [
a bathroom [* s
a bathroom [* s
it was made out_of fiberglass . [+ cir] 74608_76418
and then I showed her a thirty foot long &-uh ladder &-uh that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less . [+ gram] 77114_91854
and &-uh then I started driving . 92909_95759
like I said on Boston_Road . 96289_97899
and I was going to &-um Yuno [
"and &-um FirstnameG looked at me and she said +""/. 107391_111441"
"+"" &-um turned right . [+ gram] 112726_114736"
"+"" and then try to put on your brakes . 116452_118122"
and I wasn't going very fast anyway . 118712_120512
so ‡ I managed to &-like not hit anything . 121535_125315
and I managed to turn right . 125412_127442
and &-uh I pulled off of the side of the road . 128238_131368
and &-uh I put on the brakes . 132279_134459
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that &=ges
I was holding on to the wheel . 138727_139277
<and then> [//] &-uh and <that was> [/] that wa(s) +... 140939_146449
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor . 146499_156239
and they all could see something was happening . 156724_158784
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground . 159769_163909
and &-uh &-um then somebody [/] somebody &-uh with a smartphone called up &-uh an ambulance . 164996_175186
"and &-uh they said +""/. 175687_176067"
"+"" you're going to the hospital . 178070_179380"
and &-uh after that I [//] &+d it took me a long time before I could say &-um Bay [//] &-uh Bay_State (..) or something like that . 179985_192805
"and &-um you_know I was saying to myself &-um I said +""/. 193189_199479"
"+"" obviously I feel pretty good . 199848_202668"

"+"" and they're taking me to the hospital at Bay_State . 206610_208760"
"+"" and &-uh obviously there must be something wrong with me or else I wouldn't be going to &-uh a hospital in an ambulance . 209681_217341"
and &-uh then I tried to say something to FirstnameG . 217805_220915
and then I couldn't say anything . 221638_222878
and then I couldn't say the right words . 223608_225808
I_mean ‡ I knew what I could say but I couldn't say it . 226147_228257
and that's when I realized that [/] &-uh that I probably had a stroke . 229095_233355
I think that's &=ges +... 234447_235187
have I said [/] said that before ? 236795_238315

&-um well ‡ in the beginning there's &-uh a little girl . 261416_268176
and there's a cat . 269820_271700
and &-um I think that the little girl loves the cat . 273290_280290
it's a good friend . 282056_282986
I don't know if it's male or female . 283447_284747
and <she'd like> [//] she wanted to get [//] have the [/] &-uh the cat off of a tree . 285729_290589

okay ‡ &-uh so ‡ she asked her father if he could use a ladder and to go up to the tree and get the cat . 301161_312691
and then a ladder fell down . 313970_316230
maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get <away to this> [//] far away as possible . 317541_327451
&-um either that or &-um the [/] the dog wished the father hadn't fallen down the ladder &=laughs . 328741_339031
so ‡ then there's a bird . 339853_341633
&-um I don't know how [//] what the [/] the [/] the bird is involved . [+ gram] 343132_347722
<it's &+s &+s gonna> [//] &+s it's [/] &+s it's making a song perhaps . 347868_354458
and &-uh there's &-uh another &-uh ladder that's involved with the firemen . 355716_361296
and <they're trying to lift up the> [//] &-uh they're gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his [
&-uh <if the> [//] if the cat was more important of_course the [/] the &-uh firemen would get the cat first <and then the &+dir the> [//] &-uh and then [/] then [/] &-uh then get the [/] &-uh the father down . 373506_388106
