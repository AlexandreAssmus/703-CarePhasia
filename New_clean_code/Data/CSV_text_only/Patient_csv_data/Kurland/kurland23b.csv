it hit the [/] &-uh the window on the outside . 238343_243263
and on the inside it went through the window . 243846_246616
and it hit the &-uh person that was sitting . 246666_249666
and [/] &-uh and look like the person got up . 250245_256565
and he &+hel <hold the> [//] held the [/] &-uh the ball . 256791_260361
and he was out looking at a big hole <in the> [/] in the window . 260428_265418

I don't know that's +... [+ exc] 268594_269794
this is funny . [+ exc] 285524_286174
I'm gonna call this a heavy carousel [

okay ‡ umbrella . [+ exc] 316323_317203
that's why I called it a heavy carousel [
I thought that was kind_of funny . [+ exc] 320895_322145
<I meant that> [/] I meant that to be funny &=head
okay ‡ &-um so ‡ anyway ‡ I've been talking about this and I haven't really been looking at this . [+ exc] 324714_333024
sorry . [+ exc] 333235_333555
I don't know what this means . [+ exc] 352594_359174
<is it> [//] &-um it's either the little boy was <going to> [/] going to use that . [+ exc] 360049_365219
or either that or his &-um +... [+ exc] 365690_367660
I guess +... [+ exc] 369358_369708
<is he headin(g)> [/] &-uh <is he> [/] <is he> [//] in the beginning of it is the little boy talking to his mother that he wanted to [/] to use this ? [+ exc] 371371_378701

I'm [/] I'm not sure exactly how this is . [+ exc] 386042_388172
&-uh so ‡ <the little> [/] the little boy is still looking &-uh at his mother . 388838_394958
and she's holding the [/] &-uh the heavy parasol [
and &-um anyway he's out the house . [+ gram] 401109_405139
and it's raining already . 405640_406950
and now it's really heavy rain . 407821_410141
and &-uh so he came back . 411958_414278
he's back to his house . 414924_416264
and he's covered with water . 416880_418880
and the rain was heavy . 420006_421296
and his mother didn't look like she's very happy . 422145_424735
and &-uh it doesn't say exactly what happened to the &-uh jusɛlə@u [
but he has it now . 439396_440336
<and he's back> [//] he's outside again . 440735_443385

and &-uh he [//] so he'll be drier . 453678_455378
I wasn't sure how [/] how that worked with the mother whether she really wanted him to use it or she wanted to keep it . [+ exc] 458081_463351
I'm not sure . [+ exc] 463565_464035

and she liked [/] liked the [/] the cat . 487405_489485
there's also a dog . 490843_492103
now the dog could belong [/] belong to [/] &-uh to the [/] &+f the [//] &+f their family perhaps . 492493_498253
or it could be &-uh somebody else's &-um neighbor . 498300_501880

&-uh <and there's like> [//] &-um and there's another girl . 882353_888333
it's possible <that they> [//] that the mother had [/] had three girls . 891690_897510

I'm not sure . [+ exc] 905600_906340

&-uh <and the> [/] &-uh and the cat looked like it was a_lot_of trouble too . 909401_915951
<it had a kind_of> [//] &-um &-um it was almost like &-um their mother . 916000_923220
their mother didn't look like she was a_lot_of fun either . 923423_925813
and maybe [//] perhaps it was her husband . 926323_928873
and they had like a dog . 929292_930002

and little blonde girl was [//] <she was> [/] she was nice too . 932916_937546
and <the husband> [//] perhaps it was the husband . 937600_939680
he seems like a nice person also . 939700_942630
and the mother and her two little twin girls <and that little> [//] and the cat are just trouble . 943016_948916

they're [//] &-um we can see that this happened in a much later period of time . 956714_964114

and two of them weren't very attractive . 970516_973486

and &-uh this would be a nice +... 1106871_1108991
that's the area . [+ es] 1109272_1109902

&-um they're gonna have music . 1136086_1138206
they're gonna have food perhaps . 1138570_1140360
it seems like a great time . 1140405_1141705
but the main reason was [//] is that <all those> [/] all those young girls all around the country &-uh they would decide which one &-uh the [/] &-uh the king's young son was gonna marry . 1142178_1157398
