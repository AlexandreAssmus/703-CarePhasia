I remember <going into the> [//] &+hos being admitted to the hospital . 49465_53265
I felt wide awake . 54594_56734
I was talking to the &-um guys in the ambulance . 57903_62353
&-um then my sister met me . 63856_71096
and after that I &+me remember very little . 73681_81731
&-um I do &+reme remember but I think it's because they told me that &-um <they instead of> [//] they admitted me but did not do anything at all to &-um work on my leg which is what they should've done immediately . 82692_102482
&-um <they told> [//] <they told me or> [//] they told my sister that &-um they were gonna let me you_know rest <for twenty> [//] &+f you_know for twenty four hours and evaluate it which was &=laughs the most asinine decision they ever made because by waiting &-um and I don't know remember the medical terms but basically I was out . 103178_131388
&-um and &-um my [//] &+sis they had sent my sister home . 132336_137016
and she came back up the hospital the next morning . 137678_142188
and &-um she had a fit because she knew there was something wrong . 143337_150037
&-um and I guess that by then I didn't know but <she had> [//] she called the doctors and had had a &+f &+s &+f screaming fit . 151250_163120
and they ended me in <to do> [//] to operate on me which was like twenty hours late . [+ gram] 163909_171419
and by that time I'd lost all use of my right leg . 172559_177829
&-um and <I remember> [//] I sort_o(f) remember going in and out . 179064_189064

&-um I didn't come out of it . 206435_208645
you'd hafta ask my sister but at_least three or four days . 210693_215803
&-um and I gather from my [/] my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious . 217319_228359
&-um and I woke up and was in a blitz &-uh blank out &=ges . 229155_240385
&-um I came out_of the hospital like after six days <I think> [//] seven days . 241140_247760
and they immediately <put in> [/] put me in . 248538_251308
&-um and it took me another ten [//] twelve days +... 252020_258820
