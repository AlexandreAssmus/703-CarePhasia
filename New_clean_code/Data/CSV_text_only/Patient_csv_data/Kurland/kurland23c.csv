oh I [/] I definitely think &-uh because &-uh when I first met you at &-uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house you were doing the same kind of testing . 28756_37276
and I think most of them <I couldn't> [/] I couldn't say anything . 37800_41910
&-um I_mean ‡ I'd [/] &+l I'd see the pictures . 42811_45321

I_mean ‡ I'd just look at the pictures . 53082_54562

&-uh if I saw a peacock or an artichoke or something like that you_know <it was> [//] <I probably> [//] there was probably most things +... 57618_66538
maybe my [//] I could say my glasses maybe or banana . 67060_70570
I don't know if I said that at the time but +... 70616_72106
+< I could say something like that . 72490_73820
but most everything else <I'd just> [//] <you_know I'd just look at the> [//] I would just look at the pictures you_know . 74064_78944
and I'd [//] I would be trying to say something but you_know I couldn't do it . 79306_83256
so ‡ I think I'm a_lot better now . 83651_85461
and [/] &-um and I think I [/] I did better in &-uh well +... 86289_90409
I haven't seen &-uh Martha and Jacquie and [/] and [/] and you and myself were doing that for like a couple of weeks . [+ gram] 91000_100330

yeah . 104869_105229
that's [/] that's what I'm saying . 105387_106627
that's [/] that's one of the &-uh +... 107166_110296
and then of_course that [//] you_know when you're not doing it for like +... 110828_114168
<it's been> [/] it's been &-uh awhile . [+ gram] 114550_117080
&-um I hadn't been thinking about for [//] &-uh &+g up until recently a couple of &-uh days ago . 117700_125100
and I started thinking about everything else together . [+ es] 125583_128562
now you_know the saying stuff again . [+ gram] 129151_130722
and &-uh a_lot_of it was coming back perfectly fine . 131147_134047
and then <some of the> [//] some of them &-uh I've added . [+ es] 134100_137850
I've added that <I really couldn't> [//] &-uh I wouldn't be able to do correctly . [+ gram] 138520_142140
but I think I've done a little bit better . 142500_144260
&-uh like something's planting you_know . [+ gram] 144839_148049
it has &-uh planting &-uh in the ground or something like that . [+ es] 148100_151920
yeah . 153701_154061
I don't know if there's anything else you'd like me to say . 154704_156414
yeah . 157840_158200
yes . [+ exc] 171377_171717
okay . [+ exc] 172043_172133
yeah . [+ exc] 174112_174502
a young man is &-um kicking a ball . 176000_179100
and he's really not looking where he's going to do it . 180652_183742
and it comes over to a neighbor's window . 184155_187415
<and the> [/] &-uh and the ball goes right through the window . 188049_193139
and the [//] &-uh it's hard to tell whether that's [//] <it's an old> [/] <it's an older> [//] &+p it's a +... 194804_204354
it could be <a elder> [//] &-uh <a young> [//] <a old> [//] an older man <not an older man> [//] &-uh that's sitting in the sofa . 204400_212060
and the [/] &-uh the ball just knocked over the &-uh lamp . 212454_217094
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp . 217566_220986
and [/] &-uh and probably [/] probably could hit the [/] &-uh <the third> [//] this third person here . [+ gram] 221503_231893
they're sitting here . 232200_233020
so ‡ the [/] &-uh the man &-uh stands up . 233425_237555
and he's picking up the ball . 237578_239878
and he's looking out the window to see who [/] who probably threw it . 239929_244179
yeah . [+ exc] 247116_247296
well ‡ this is an umbrella . 257486_258586
remember I couldn't even say umbrella ? [+ exc] 259035_260495
+< before again I could say umbrella . [+ exc] 260757_261817
so ‡ &-uh the mother [/] mother is holding the &-uh umbrella . 262045_273585
and the little boy is [/] &-uh is looking . 274430_279780
and she probably saying [/] &+g &-um saying “goodbye” . [+ gram] 279797_282737
"and &-uh she thinks +""/. 283366_284986"

you can see <it's even> [/] it's even getting worse over here . 298617_301967
and he [//] &-uh he's back . 302529_304669
comes [//] so ‡ he runs back to his house . 304925_308305
and the mother's there . 308468_310068
and she's saying +... 310659_311819
they're both looking . 312367_313117
he's soakin(g) wet . 313168_314268
and the mother's looking at him . 314602_316432
and she's gonna probably give him the umbrella . 316877_319237
&-um and he's going back . 320059_322009
I don't know where he's going . [+ exc] 322141_322851
he's probably going to school . 322900_324090
and he has an umbrella . 324740_325900
and now he's going back to school . 325959_330649
yup . [+ exc] 333240_333350
and &-uh +/. [+ exc] 334222_334922
yup . [+ exc] 341231_341351
well ‡ the little girl's looking <at the> [/] at the &+t +... 342302_346172
there's a tree here . 346400_347410
and &-um <now this thing probably was start> [//] I think this was started that the dog was running after <a cow [
and the cat ran up the tree into a [/] &+li a [/] &+le a &+la +//. 364284_370074
how do I say this &=ges ? [+ exc] 370123_371103
oh a breach [
I'm doing two with and I'm not saying it right . [+ exc] 376452_378272
anyway <it's the> [//] &-um <it's part of the> [/] it's part of the tree . [+ cir] 378967_384797
so ‡ this is where the cat eventually <got up> [//] was up here . 385746_390106
so ‡ the little girl <could've been> [/] could've been actually seeing the [/] &-uh the dog &-uh &+cha chasing the cat . 391024_404454
and &-uh but anyway she [/] she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down . 405342_414172
she was probably riding a &+tric tricycle . 415151_417791
&-um so ‡ the [//] probably her father put the ladder up on <the limb [/] limb> [/] the limb and &-uh went up there . 419193_431133
<and the> [/] &+l and the ladder fell . 431238_433558
&-uh so ‡ the [//] it's pretty high up . 434981_437781
and the cat's up there . 438243_440033
and the [/] &-uh the man is way up high . 440465_442885
and he doesn't have a ladder . 442900_444080
<and his> [//] &-uh and by the looks of it his [//] actually his daughter's more interested in the cat than [/] than her father . 444578_452168
<or that's> [//] or it's a man perhaps . 452407_454287
and &-uh there's a bird <on the> [//] &+tr in the tree also but I don't think they're involved in &-uh +... 454810_463410
yeah ‡ and I don't think they're afraid the cat or anything like that . [+ gram] 463790_466210
&-uh so ‡ the &-uh firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going &-uh to first take the [/] the father down . 467314_477014
and &-uh then they're gonna get the cat . 478556_480676
and &-uh the little girl will be happy . 483039_484439
and the [/] &-uh the dog +... 484484_487424
who knows what's gonna happen to the dog . 488288_490128
it's gonna probably chase after her [//] the cat again and find another tree . 490200_494550
I don't know &=laughs . [+ exc] 494871_496381
Cinderella . 498277_498987

&-um on [

and <there's a> [/] there's another girl who's a blonde and quite attractive . 724120_731310
&-uh &+s same age . [+ gram] 732441_734501
&-uh but she hasta do things to &-like do all the work . 735077_739497
and the [//] &-um I think that the [/] &-uh the mother +... 740162_745942
and I'm not sure whether that [//] <the mother> [//] the &-uh attractive &-uh one <is part> [//] is [//] she's [/] &-uh &-uh she's part of the family or one of &-uh <a younger> [/] a younger woman . [+ gram] 746269_763459
well ‡ with [/] <with the> [//] with this mother . [+ gram] 763509_767349
I'm not sure how that works out . [+ exc] 767400_768780
there's a handsome man too . 769019_771049
I'm not sure that that's her husband . 771100_773250
and [//] you_know and maybe you_know that's the reason why he has <those two> [//] &-uh <the two> [//] the other two woman that aren't very attractive . [+ es] 773300_782120
&-uh so ‡ &-uh he's [//] the [/] &-uh <the young> [/] the young lady &-um is looking [/] &-um looking <over the> [/] over the window out into the city and sees the [/] the &-uh &+cass castle which I'm sure that [//] who [//] &-um who's probably the king &-uh <of the> [/] &-uh of that area &-uh lives at the regular city .

I'm not sure the [/] the [//] &-uh they have &-like dark [/] dark hair and stuff like that . 831257_835937
so ‡ she's [//] &-um the [/] &-uh the king wants to have a party &-uh for his [/] <his young> [/] &+s his young son . 836528_849318
and it'd be nice <if &-uh he might> [//] if everybody in the city <that are> [//] &-uh they get a letter . 849692_859932

&-uh and she [/] &-uh she has a magical &+f &-uh +... 949805_956335
