that's an interesting question „ isn't it . 645375_646975
<well &-um it seemed> [//] <it [/] it probably> [//] presumably you could actually do this <on [/] on a> [/] on a &-uh &-uh less high tech [
but it is nice to have . 659795_661335
and &-uh it [/] it [/] it has several different functions . 661835_665335
one is the &-uh &-um +... 665495_666195
what do you call that thing ? 667406_668516
&-um know yourself . 668800_670530

then there's &-uh &+t &+s the stɑprɑwɑtʃ@u [
and there's the [/] &-uh the [/] &-uh the [/] the [/] the [/] the basic media <of the> [/] of the thing . [+ es] 683220_690080
so ‡ it has a_lot_of different &-uh uses I think . 690485_693915
so ‡ it [//] I guess it's [/] it's probably exactly what you need for your +... 694000_697700
well ‡ I_mean ‡ sure . 703117_705937
because you_know something got [/] &+bet got better here <through the> [/] through the whole operation &-uh „ I think . 706160_714130
you_know ‡ it certainly seems that's [//] that seems to be the case (be)cause I was really flailing there at the beginning . 714178_719648
and [/] &-um and then I flailed again when [/] when I was trying not to look <at the> [/] at the &-uh &-uh letters . 720530_728840
you_know ‡ just [//] <I would> [/] I would just push it &=ges
so ‡ &-uh that [//] and that seems to have been the second way to help [/] help myself here . 736462_742072
is [//] &-uh because then I [/] I could get to the point where I could sort_o(f) write these things a little bit . 742691_748831
&-um and [/] and actually everyday this is getting a little better now . 750183_753593

&-uh but Cinderella was not allowed to go . 1343162_1345632
at that point a fairy godmomother [
here &-uh the [/] &-uh the two &-uh women who lived in in [/] the house were [/] were not very attractive .
&-uh and the prince was not much interested in them .
but <in turn> [//] in time he discovered that Cinderella was &-uh really quite charming and delightful .
and he would gladly have asked her to be there <a bit> [/] a bit longer .
but &-uh then came &-uh the stroke of midnight .
and she [/] &-uh <she got back her [/] her [/] her> [//] &-uh she got back <to her> [//] &-uh her [//] &-um <to her> [/] to her room and had a wonderful time .
the prince there would [/] would &+s still had not found the [/] &-uh the [/] the [/] the [/] &-uh the perfect woman that he adored . [+ gram]
so ‡ &-uh several people started looking around to see them &-uh and to decide <which one was really> [//] &~Cinder <was like> [//] &+cin which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted . [+ cir]
one after another several of these terrible creatures &-uh proved that <she could not> [//] &+f <she could not &+f &-uh fill [//] fit the [/] the [/] &-uh the> [//] &-uh she <couldn't fit the [/] &-uh the portions> [//] the [/] the [//] &-uh could not fit the &-um +...

but the shoe &-uh fit Cinderella perfectly . 1526245_1530615
at that point the [/] &-uh the prince then was brought to the castle . 1531519_1536369
