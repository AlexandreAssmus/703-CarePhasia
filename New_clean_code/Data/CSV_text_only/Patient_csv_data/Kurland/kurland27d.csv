&-um I was thinking about &+th going over the words in my head . 75003_81243

I hadta keep going back . 94463_96203
I [//] the words I knew &=ges I hadta keep going back sometimes . 97021_101981
but [/] &-um did I feel it was helpful &=shrugs ? 102151_106080

&-um <I was> [//] &=ges because of moving and everything else I lost a_lot_of time and repetition &=ges in it . 127230_138190
&-um but <I still kept a_lot_of> [//] like I said I still kept a_lot of &-uh the words . 138806_145356

and keep on those &=ges . 203091_204341
&=ges and add ten more words . 204391_206611
