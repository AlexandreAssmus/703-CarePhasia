and &-uh that's the last thing I ever remembered &=laughs . 156520_161500
and &-uh until &-uh I [/] &+in I [/] I [/] I never saw another thing in [/] &-uh in Cooley_Dickinson at all . 163378_172408
all_of_a_sudden I came to in [/] &-uh &+dal in &-uh &-uh +... 173483_177833

well ‡ Cinderella was [/] &-uh was apparently &-uh adapted [
&-um and so they [/] <they hadta> [/] &-uh they hadta to [/] to [/] work all the time and hadta to [/] deal with the [/] the [/] the hideous &-uh &-uh sisters &-uh while <they were> [/] they [/] they were just <having to> [/] having to [/] &-uh <to get> [/] &-uh &-uh to be her work person . [+ cir] 440850_462160
so ‡ at that point then there was a moment where the [/] &-uh the prince wanted to meet all of the eligible women &-uh in [/] <in the> [/] &-uh in [/] in the [/] &-uh the [/] the town . 463019_476749
"and as Cinderella was thinking +""/. 477221_479051"

"&-uh but they said +""/. 484853_486153"
"+"" no ‡ you can't do that ! 486325_488315"
<only [/] only &-uh the> [//] only &-uh these [//] the terrible creatures that [/] &-uh <that were> [/] &-um that were &-uh living in the house are the only ones that could really do this . 488876_500846
then there came a &-uh &-uh +... 501262_503882
what do you call those creatures ? [+ exc] 505085_506575
<it's a> [/] &-uh &-uh it's a [/] &-uh &-uh a magic personage . [+ cir] 506754_515063
a &=laughs +... 515610_515950
what do they call those &+cre creatures ? [+ exc] 517520_519941
anyway ‡ this magic personage wanted to &-uh change &-uh &-uh all of the [/] &-uh the [//] <all the> [//] all of the things that Cinderella wanted to [/] to [/] &-uh to [/] <to read> [//] to [/] to &-uh &-uh +... 520607_538558
she wanted to change all of her clothes until something really fancy happened . [+ cir] 539570_545550
and it was the [//] &-uh this &-uh magical creature that made that all possible . [+ cir] 545890_551410
then the magical creature went back and sure enough saw &-uh the prince . 551847_557197
<and the> [/] <and the> [/] and the prince [* s
whereas the [/] the [/] the horrible creatures that [/] that lived in the house no [//] &-uh had no real particular interest &-uh in the [/] the prince . 563221_573511
&-uh sooner or later then the [/] the prince was [/] was [/] was doing quite well . 574155_579305
and [//] but it was time for for Cinderella to leave because she hadta do that . 579500_585560
and [/] &-uh and [/] &+s and eventually then this [//] &-uh the [/] the [/] &-uh the wonderful time that they had &-uh disappeared . 586236_599156
nevertheless &-uh the [//] &-uh everybody wanted to [/] to discover whether Cinderella might be the personage they were hoping for . 599667_610727
&-uh and yet that was not to be the case . 611284_614724
<then only> [//] and then only &-uh did Cinderella &-uh &-uh &-uh take all <of her> [/] of her fancy clothes once again and sure enough was exactly the person that [/] &-uh that &-uh they were hoping for . [+ cir] 615029_634519
&-uh then &-uh the prince went clomping back <to the> [/] &-uh <to the [/] &-uh the whatever they are> [//] <to all these> [//] &-uh &-uh &-uh &+a to all of the [/] &+w the workers that they hafta deal with . [+ cir] 635100_652770
