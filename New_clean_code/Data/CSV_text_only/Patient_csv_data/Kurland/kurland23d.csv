excuse_me . 519304_519864
what did I think of that ? 529043_529893
+< well ‡ I thought that &-uh for one thing in the beginning I would not know <all of the> [/] all of the actions and objects „ you_know ? 530424_540864
"and the more I did that, the better I could get at it . 541003_543843"
and I would say really at the end <I would do> [//] <if I was> [//] <if I would> [/] &-uh if I would do twenty of each I would probably be nineteen or twenty „ you_know ? 544512_556512
I thought <I was very close> [//] &-uh I was very good at that I thought . 557249_560959
and [/] &-uh and then the last thing I did is <I was doing> [//] &+sens I was writing &+sensin sɛnsɪsɪz [
I'm not saying it right &=head
I was writing &-uh senses [
I guess I can't say it „ can I ? 573617_574657
yes ‡ I was doing that . 576155_577275
and &-uh <I was trying to do> [/] <I was trying to do much> [//] I was trying to do a better job . 577557_582757
but <I_mean that> [//] and that would +... 583325_584565
and I don't know if you noticed &-um &-uh in [/] in November and &-uh &+s January [//] in January and &-uh &-uh December <I would> [/] I would take a long time to try to &-like do a [/] a good job of doing [/] &-um doing +//. 584940_602120
say if I was doing an object . [+ gram] 602350_604550
if I was trying to write a sentence about it „ you_know ? [+ gram] 604595_607385
I [/] I was trying very difficult [
you_know ? 611594_611774
and I think the Ipad is the [//] really the thing that [/] that started me doing that „ you_know . 612422_618342
I don't know <if what I'm> [//] if [/] if [/] if that's fine . 618745_620775
yeah [/] yeah . 622486_623236
yeah . 624497_624607

yeah ‡ I [/] I know what <this one> [/] this one &=points +/. [+ exc] 630506_631666
+< I can see that one coming . [+ exc] 632963_634213
<I just> [/] &+aw I just walked in the door and I knew that . [+ exc] 634413_637163
+< I was hoping oh_no <she's gonna have> [//] somebody else is gonna do it . [+ exc] 638359_640710
it's not gonna be me . [+ exc] 640849_641599
okay . [+ exc] 657812_658322
well ‡ I think in the beginning &-uh there was the &-uh little girl . 658720_664860
&-uh she [/] &-uh she really loved her cat . 666047_671507
and the cat went up the tree . 672116_673686
no ‡ it's not . [+ es] 674380_674880
so ‡ she tried to get it down . 675000_677420
so ‡ then I think that was probably her father . 677659_680679
"&-um so ‡ <she'd say> [//] <she said to> [//] &-uh the girl said to her father +""/. 681552_686242"
"+"" could you <go up the brɛnt@u ["
so ‡ &-um the [/] the [/] &-uh the father took &-uh a ladder . 692671_698871
and he went up the tree . 699100_700100
and &-uh maybe this is why the cat went up there though . 700779_703419
I [/] I guess <the dog> [/] the dog caught the [/] &-uh the cat up [/] up [/] up the tree . 703938_709948
so ‡ anyway ‡ the [/] &-uh the ladder fell down . 710688_714188
and the [/] &-uh the father was caught up there . 714959_719989
so ‡ and of_course years ago &-uh she would hafta go home <and call> [/] and call up <the fire> [/] the firemen to come but now she probably has a smartphone and she could call up the firemen . 720665_734285
and they're gonna come back . 734300_736100
and <they're gonna get> [//] &-uh not only are they gonna get the [//] &-uh her father . 736203_740453
they're [//] also they're gonna get the cat . 740500_742220
and I think that &-uh there's a nice bird up here . 742723_745953
and <the bird> [//] the [/] the bird is [/] &-uh is [/] is just looking up there . 746080_751280
and it's kind_o(f) like &-uh singing &-uh about &-uh +... 751516_757186
I don't know what it's gonna be singing about but &-uh she's gonna be happy about it . 757312_761822

www .
I'm not good at telling this story . [+ exc] 935187_936357
&-um in the beginning I guess it was like an old town probably in Europe . 938266_947116
&-um and &-um <there were> [//] &-um there was a mother with &-uh little girls . 947888_958758
<and the> [//] &-uh and then there was a blonde girl who &-uh when she was young &-um I don't know what she was doing &-um but <she useta help> [//] she was helping . 959035_974685
she didn't really do great work . 975228_977118
I_mean ‡ <she wasn't> [/] &-uh she wasn't &-uh part of the family . 977518_980568
and I think that the [/] &-uh &-um the mother with the [/] &-uh the two girls +... 981450_987890
and they had black hair . 988300_989590
and they weren't very attractive and [//] when they were young . 990038_993658
and the little girl when she was +//. 994038_995508
I think they were probably nine or ten . 995716_997416
and the &-uh little blonde girl looked [//] she looked basically the same . 997984_1003384
when she got older she still was very attractive but <she did> [//] &-uh &+me <she was doing> [//] &-um she was &+j just doing work <down in> [//] &-um you_know down in &-um +... 1003731_1016991
she was doing work like &-uh washing clothes and [/] and cleaning the house and things like that . 1017150_1028240

they're sending a letter to everyone that they were gonna have a dance or &-um +... 1035099_1041280
I guess there was a castle in the background . 1041300_1043390
and &-uh they were invited to go to see the [//] &-uh <her son> [//] her [/] her son who &-uh +... 1044285_1052635
and I'm not of_course <when I> [//] even when I was young I don't remember this story you_know to be honest with you . [+ exc] 1052692_1058322
but I think that the [/] &-uh the [/] the young man wanted to get married . 1058968_1065338
<whether he was> [//] I don't know if he was going to be the king in the future or whether he was just an <important person> [//] young important person or something . 1065928_1074348
so ‡ they [/] &-uh they [/] they invited probably +... 1074939_1080489
I don't know if the people <were probably> [//] had &-uh more money or something like that . 1081700_1085910
but the mother she was kind_of an evil person . 1085930_1089590
and I think that <the older> [//] those two little girls now that they're older they're [//] &-uh <I don't think that they're> [//] they're [/] &-uh they're not +... 1089638_1098318
you_know ‡ they're not wonderful people either „ I don't think . 1100800_1102850
so ‡ &-um the [/] &-um <the little> [//] <the blonde> [/] the blonde &-uh girl &-um she was looking at beautiful [//] &-uh a dress . 1103223_1117133

that was part of her jobs down in the you_know maybe it's in a barn or something like that . 1135164_1140294
and &-uh so I think what got things a_lot better is that the fairy godmother helped her out &-um when she went to the dance . 1140790_1156260
and &-uh so the [//] &-uh there was a pumpkin &-uh turned into this +... 1156803_1163863
