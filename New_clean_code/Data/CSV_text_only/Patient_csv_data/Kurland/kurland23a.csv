(o)kay ‡ well ‡ <I was> [/] <I was at> [/] &-um I was at &-um Baystate . 688210_692660

I don't know if they come every month or something . 801111_802981

so ‡ &-uh <and then> [/] and then after ten days I was there . 807222_811282
we &+dec &-uh decided that we went to [//] &-uh in Amherst . 811815_815805
and it was like &-um &-um rust [
and you_know what happened is that the speech therapist would come . 823676_827616
and she was there for like fifteen minutes . 828242_830782
and she'd do the same kind of testing that you've been doing . 830840_833050

right ? 848543_848953
and she wasn't here that long . 849436_851086
and then &-uh the next day this other person came again . 851480_855550
and &-uh we were doing the same thing . 856163_857753
but none of them +... 857777_858587
it was only very short period of time you_know maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving . 858950_865030
and &-uh so I think &-uh FirstnameG and I <we actually> [/] we actually &=points went for a walk you_know because where she was isn't really that far away . 865432_876472
so ‡ in the center of town &=points we went to &-uh dinner . 876773_879833

and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the New_York_Times . 994334_998704
that's basically the only thing I hadta try to read . 998927_1002087
and I would say if I read something like &-um &-um one section of the New_York_Times <it would probably take me> [//] &-um maybe it would take me an hour just to read one [/] one . 1002452_1017322
and then I'd only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read you_know . 1017620_1024030
(of)_course <if it was> [//] maybe if it was an &-uh newspaper that was easier to read I might do better . [+ gram] 1024176_1029656
but &-uh it was still the New_York_Times and &-uh the &+edi editorials and things like that . 1029912_1034872
I was having a hard time understanding it . 1035170_1037280
but I had an idear@a [

and &-uh <I really> [/] <I really> [//] I thought she was quite good &=head
but you_know what happened . 1072019_1073169
I think they found one in Athol . 1073186_1074816
and then I started to drive too . 1075706_1077846
and if I could drive then you see you [/] &+c you couldn't have a person that would come to my house . 1078384_1084864
right ? 1085373_1085703
so [/] &-um so ‡ what happened . 1086020_1088830
I really liked this woman the speech therapist &=head

how do you say the right term ? 1102656_1103756
&-um we [//] &-um I started doing that . [+ es] 1105167_1112897
you_know ‡ she would do things like writing a picture . 1113000_1115670
there'd be pictures or something like that . 1116046_1117866
"and we'd be like +""/. 1117890_1118740"
"+"" &-uh the [/] &-uh (.) the clock . [+ gram] 1119457_1123637"

<it would be on> [//] &-uh &-um you_know it would be on &-uh eight or something . 1131371_1138621

+< so [/] &-um so ‡ then I [/] I [//] we found that we could go to [/] &-um to Athol . 1156063_1161503
<and it's> [//] and <I'm gonna still> [//] <I'm gonna go> [//] I'm going three times a week to see FirstnameE . 1162646_1167356

okay . 1174307_1174667
oh ! 1189074_1189534

and &-uh so ‡ I_mean ‡ that was a_lot of the work that you did . 1220990_1223820
and I think the reason <why &-uh &+y you were involved> [//] that you were involved with that is that &-uh we were worried that we couldn't even find a speech therapist . 1224773_1234683
and I think that's how FirstnameY found you you_know ? 1236205_1239835

his father is &-uh in the living room . 1357988_1360108

I don't know who it is that's here . [+ exc] 1388649_1389759

<this doesn't> [//] this isn't very &-uh +... [+ exc] 1433252_1435182
it's hard to tell very much of this other_than there's somebody standing up . 1440504_1443674

this that's what the +... [+ exc] 1497540_1498890
you_know ‡ I [/] I &+n +... [+ exc] 1499127_1500237
the umbrella . [+ exc] 1500430_1501170
okay ‡ the umbrella &=head
finally I got to say umbrella . [+ exc] 1502635_1503745
the little boy wanted the umbrella . 1504161_1507291
and his mother had it . 1507852_1509102
the mother doesn't look very happy . 1509287_1510937
<she doesn't> [//] actually it's hard to tell anything about how she looks &=ges
she changes over here . [+ exc] 1517014_1517934
&-uh <so or he> [//] either that or he tried to grab it from her . 1518726_1524006
I'm not sure . [+ exc] 1524653_1525463
(be)cause it looked like something happened &=ges . 1525550_1527030
&-um the second &-uh he looks like well [//] he's going to leave . 1527732_1533212
and &-uh <she's gonna> [//] she still has the umbrella . 1534374_1539314
so ‡ here's the [/] &+s the little boy . 1540293_1542083
he's actually getting wet . 1542660_1543970
he's walking . 1544497_1545407
and &-um he's getting wet . 1545951_1548151
and now he's really getting wet because it's probably really coming out a_lot . 1548613_1552093
you can see right here . 1552111_1553791
<it's like> [//] &-um this in pʌlt@u [

well ‡ he's a pool [* s
pool [* s
<he's on> [//] this [/] this pools on his &-um shoes and stuff like that . 1569619_1575849
so ‡ he's back in his house . 1576286_1578496
and he's all covered with water . 1578869_1580559
and his mother she doesn't look like &+sh this was a great decision on her part . 1581315_1587255
she doesn't look happy . 1587907_1588827
it's hard to tell really but it's kind_of like &-uh the cartoon is +... [+ exc] 1589406_1593806
it's hard to tell what she really looks . [+ exc] 1594740_1596340
&-uh so ‡ I guess that she decided she'll let him use the umbrella . 1597212_1602392
and it's still really raining . 1602974_1604804
but he [//] at_least he's dry with the umbrella . 1605229_1608689
yeah . [+ exc] 1613307_1613497
&=laughs well this is pretty funny . [+ exc] 1622635_1624785
well ‡ this is a little girl who has a cat . 1627267_1632377

<she had her> [//] &+bici she was on a tricycle . 1640771_1643381

and he's barking . 1649249_1650159
maybe <that's what caused> [//] the [/] &-uh the cat was afraid or something and went up there . 1650605_1656065
either that or they're afraid of the sun . 1656508_1659228
I've always said that as a joke . [+ exc] 1659333_1660573
