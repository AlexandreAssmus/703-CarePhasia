and when I got up I collapsed &=ges (.) suddenly . 90480_94310
(.) and they did the usual m_r_is and the cat [

but (.) &=ges
and after several days I got to where I could maybe (.) read and comprehend a short paragraph . 185778_192208
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could <go down> [//] mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was . 192813_199883

"and that one after I had it, read it off and looked at it after, &=ges it was very jumbled . 249490_253970"

(.) and I felt (..) it was a very good experience because I started making (.) progress . 284161_293621
and what I [//] &+fel I've always said about with FirstnameM and &+p the center as a general is they seem to have a very good &+k way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge (.) but <not over> [//] not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it . [+ gram] 293643_310893

so ‡ I [/] &+b I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students . 355985_359645

I decided I would start to write a [//] (.) maybe a little journal (.) of my experiences <from the day> [//] as I recalled it from the day (.) I had my first &-uh stroke and [/] and &=ges to the recovery period . 368847_382937

and I ended up labelling it as Firstname's aphasia journal . 393421_396761
and &-uh I would &+s &=ges write a [/] (.) a little section each week . 398339_403059
&=ges and then she would kind_of react [//] respond back to me . 404362_406632

so ‡ &=ges <all that> [/] all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this . 421257_427047
&=head
but &+a I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again . 428553_434973
and that's when xxx sent me in and dɑɪəgmost@u [
