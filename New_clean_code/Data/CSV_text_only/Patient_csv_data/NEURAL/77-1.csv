I can say what I want to . 5226_11086
it is just very halting . 11872_17592
and I can't find the words all the time . 18099_28269
I think it happened at night when I was asleep . 35441_43841
it was at breakfast time . 53573_58423
and I couldn't say what I wanted to . 58867_65897
the words wouldn't come . 67077_70797
I [/] I went to a rehab facility for one week . 93074_107654
and there was a speech therapist there . 109027_117487
and she did &-um little kinds of tests . 118478_127988
then I came home . 130776_136196
and I had a speech therapist for once a week . 137060_150250
and she is almost done . 152568_156718
and now I am doing Arc Zoom kind of events . 158933_173033
and I try to do two or three a week . 174194_184944
I don't know how to tell a story . [+ exc] 209734_223524
&-um I [/] <I can't> [//] I don't snory [
&-um I [/] I don't [//] can't think of a story . [+ exc] 273276_283836
&-um there was a man . 292028_301268
and we play pickleball together . 302364_307584
and he died on the court &-uh two days ago . 308168_318028
yes â€¡ it was a shock . 333055_337495
and I was upset about it . 338241_345341
&-um the boy is kicking a ball . 373182_381482
and the ball hits a window and breaks it . 381839_390639
and it comes in and surprises the man in the chair . 391527_400477
the ball came into the room and knocked over the lamp . 400791_408051
and the man stands up from the chair and looks out the window where the ball came from . 410093_420933
oh okay . [+ exc] 456246_457536
I think that the mother is trying to give the umbrella to the boy . 459451_470941
but the boy says no . 472365_475755
and he doesn't want the umbrella . 477247_480797
and then he goes along . 482247_484847
and all_of_a_sudden he gets rained on . 485368_490138
and then he goes back . 490933_493363
and he is wet . 493945_496775
and he tells his mother that he is unhappy and wet . 497715_505955
and she gives him the umbrella . 506679_510599
and he goes back out . 511453_513933
and has the umbrella to protect him from the rain . 514697_521787
I think that the man tried to climb up in the tree to get the cat . 540725_550945
but the ladder fell down . 555804_560484
and he was not able to get down . 561457_570777
and the dog is barking . 572077_575927
and the firemen are coming to get the man down and to take the kitty out_of the tree . 576961_593721
alright . [+ exc] 913621_914791
the book begins when the father comes home . 916899_925509
and he introduces his daughter to the &+s new stepmother and the two stepsisters . 926148_940288
then it goes on and shows that they do not take very good care of her . 942961_954601
the father died . 954983_957333
and the stepmother and her daughters were not nice to Cinderella . 957801_967251
she had to take care of the horses in the stable and was not being treated very well . 967336_976136
then there came &-uh an announcement that the kingdom was going to have a ball . 985479_1003379
and that Cinderella wanted to go . 1004353_1010533
and the mice helped her make a pretty dress . 1011704_1019154
but the bad stepsisters tore the dress apart and the necklace that she was going to wear . 1020618_1033308
and they locked her in her room . 1033983_1039564
but the mice came and helped her and get out_of the room . 1041329_1050959
and she had a fairy godmother . 1052268_1058338
and the fairy godmother made a beautiful white dress and a pumpkin and turned into a beautiful coach . 1059836_1079296
and the mice were beautiful horses . 1079912_1085052
and the carriage took her to the ball . 1085818_1090038
and she had a dance with the prince . 1091895_1096045
and they were very happy . 1098902_1104912
she was very worried about the time . 1109530_1115590
and the clock ruck [
and she had to hurry away down the stairs . 1122478_1126698
and in the process she lost one of her glass slippers . 1129730_1137850
and the <pumpkin no> [//] carriage turned back into a pumpkin and <the mice back> [//] the horses back into mice . 1140128_1157948
and then they made an announcement in the kingdom that they were going to look for the lady who had the foot that would fit in it . 1159315_1179605
and then the stepmother and the stepdaughters tried . 1180490_1188130
and Cinderella came out . 1188672_1192812
and the glass slipper fit her foot perfectly . 1193294_1199484
and then she married the prince . 1200561_1204631
and they lived happily ever after . 1206767_1210217
I would have two pieces of bread . 1221524_1226604
and on one I would spread the jam . 1227515_1231695
and on the other I would spread the peanut butter . 1233871_1238721
then I would put them together into a sandwich . 1239517_1245707
