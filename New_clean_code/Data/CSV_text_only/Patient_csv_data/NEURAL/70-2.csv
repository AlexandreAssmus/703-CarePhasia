&-uh it's pretty good . 7920_10000
&-um I have problems sometimes especially with &-uh numbers still &-uh . 10158_20268
and sometimes I don't know if it's because I don't hear <the [/] the [/] the> [//] what I'm &-uh saying correctly . 21630_35470
"it's something like if I was to say +""/. 36238_41378"
"+"" &-uh I had to take care of my &-uh income tax . 41992_46222"
&-uh I might say &-uh my income@q taxed@q or &-uh my income@q &+texa or [//] Texas . 47083_59913
you_know &+s stuff like that where I [/] I kinda think twice of what <the [/] &-uh the real or> [//] the [/] &-um the word that I was trying to say . 64196_87076
&-uh something like that . 87541_91261
but other than that I'm thinking I can talk pretty good as long as &-uh &-uh people give me time and slow down &-uh you_know (be)cause normally people speak faster than I can . 91850_116020
so ‡ &-uh usually if I'm in a group or whatever people know that I have aphasia or I [/] I have some kind of problem speaking . 116888_129488
so ‡ they understand . 129615_132575
so ‡ it [/] it [//] it's pretty good . 133848_137078
I_mean &-like I [//] I've gone &-uh to a bunch of doctors . 137100_144780
and you_know they might repeat something for me or you_know &-uh ask what I had really said stuff like that you_know if I &-uh say it wrong . 145039_162929
but other_than that I'm feeling okay speaking . 165607_168917
oh I [/] I [/] I don't really too much about it . 176751_183281
&-uh I knew that &-uh I had been having &-uh physical therapy because I'd had had <a hip replacement> [//] the other hip replacement . 183424_200254
&-uh so ‡ &-uh that morning my wife &+unders <or she said that she understood or> [//] she knew that I was having some kind of &-uh problems speaking . 200445_223045
but she thought I was just being silly or something like that . 224101_228401
but a little bit after that the physical therapist came over for a regular &-uh session . 229368_240108
and he also noticed that I &-uh was speaking differently . 240945_250245
and &-uh he took my vitals and stuff like that . 250711_255931
and he said that I should go to the emergency room . 256011_259961
and after that &-uh we're only &+ah maybe three miles from the hospital . 260908_269968
so ‡ my brother came over and took &-uh my wife and &-uh him over there . 270716_280406
and they sat there while I went through the &-uh emergency room and stuff like that . 281854_290524
so ‡ it [/] it took about &-uh &-uh maybe three or four hours to have [//] you_know go through . 292524_305034
&-uh they did some task . 305237_307547
and I think they have a good &-uh stroke &-uh thing . 307696_315546
so ‡ they [//] actually in the &-uh emergency room they had a c_t scan &-uh were I could do . 315628_328158
and then they [/] they found where I had &-uh a room . 328909_334159
you_know and they [/] they had found that I had had the stroke through the c_t [/] c_t scan . 334724_341754
and then by the time I [/] I went up to the room probably three or four other &-uh doctors came from you_know the [/] the hospital doctor &-uh &-uh neurologist . 344522_364422
&-uh they actually had &-uh a neurosurgeon ready to see if they had to &-uh stop the blood or anything . 365419_375569
but it looks like after it [/] it [//] the clot burst I was okay . 375615_383245
and there was no xxx &-uh more &-um bleeding . 383348_392678
so ‡ that [//] that's about what I remember . 395482_397292
and I [/] I know &-um when I saw the doctors at the &-uh &-uh room <they all had the> [//] they have the same type o(f) test that they do to see if it was really &-uh a stroke and what kind of damage it might've been . 397313_422393
and I knew that I &-um had some memory loss . 423285_431255
&-uh I recognized my &-uh brother and my &-uh wife . 432397_440697
but my &-uh brother's wife came later (be)cause &+sh she was a nurse . 441994_452234
and even_though I know her for thirty five forty years I couldn't remember her name . 452832_463952
so ‡ I [/] I did have some &-uh small [//] <or what do you call it> [//] short memory &-uh loss . 464258_471918
but that [//] that's about it . 473392_474832
well ‡ at the hospital I [/] I stayed there for three days . 491251_498111
and they did a_lot tests . 499993_501463
&-uh they did &-uh m_r_is &-uh &-uh echocardiograms &-uh to make sure you_know I didn't have it . 501481_514160
they did &-uh things &-uh measure in my legs to make sure there were still no clots or anything . 514885_525975
&-uh <they did> [//] &-like the last day that I was there they brought a &-uh speech therapist there because they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital . 526117_546257
and she had me for about an hour doing some tests to see how my [/] my speech xxx &+a affected . 547248_559198
and it turned out that you_know the next day they &-uh &+dis distarged [
and I never saw her again . 576069_578149
and &-uh because_of my [/] &-uh my medical insurance &-uh when I went home they said that I had to finish my physical therapy before &-uh they could start my speech therapy . 580742_608782
so ‡ I think it was probably maybe two and a half weeks after the stroke before I was able to have the speech therapy come home to my house . 616064_630444
and that [/] that was about it . 632954_634354
&-um I'm trying to think . 651775_657085
I [/] I know last session I think I talked about &-uh my daughter being &-uh pregnant nowadays . 657178_665988
but if I was to think younger &-uh maybe a good time a thing that I liked &-uh was <in my> [//] when I was twenty &-uh I was in the airforce . 667480_693630
and I was stationed in Italy &-uh in the Alps . 694661_703281
it was a radio station on top of a [/] &-uh a mountain actually . 703456_709386
so ‡ &-uh having never &-uh learned <how to play or> [//] how to ski the airforce sent me to Garmisch Germany to learn <how to play or> [//] how to &-uh ski &-uh because our [/] &-uh our sight was on the top of the mountain . 710432_734402
and they had a &-uh &-uh ski slopes there . 745869_752269
so ‡ I had a good time &-uh in Germany . 753082_757582
and the guy was a very old &-uh German guy that gave &-uh several of us &-uh skiing lesson . 758195_775975
and &-uh after that &-uh because our [/] &-uh our location &-uh &+wa where I would &-uh work for three days and then have three days off we would ski for hours and hours when we didn't xxx . 776891_797821
so ‡ I got to be pretty good at &-uh ski [//] playing ski . 805276_809536
&-er I keep on saying play@q playing@q ski@q . 809701_812681
&-uh skiing is skiing . 813217_814607
it's not playing ski . 815071_816281
and that [/] that was a good time . 817228_819438
yeah . 824596_824896
yeah I_mean it [/] it [/] it was a very small village where we lived <when we were at> [//] when we were off the sight . 838152_853952
so ‡ there was a_lot_of places to ski . 854783_860083
and it was only like &-uh forty five minutes to drive to a Insberg . 860813_870483
so ‡ we [//] we'd ski in a_lot a places around the Alps . 871162_877322
okay . [+ exc] 899435_899955
&-um there's a boy in the yard playing with the &+sco &-er &-uh soccer ball . 900160_910090
&-uh he kicks the ball . 912354_914454
and it hits the window and breaks the window . 914599_919539
&-uh the window gets broken and comes through into the house and knocks the [/] &-uh the <lamb [
and then the man goes over to the window to see who had &-uh broke the window . 943387_955797
okay . [+ exc] 982973_983423
&-uh the story starts with the mother telling the young boy that he should take a umbrella . 984336_996306
but the &-uh child kinda waved it off saying that I don't need the &-uh umbrella . 997505_1008435
and he starts walking to school . 1009402_1015102
and the &-uh rain starts to fall . 1015822_1020722
it starts gettin(g) a_lot heavier . 1021777_1024777
so ‡ he runs back <to his> [//] &+off <or not his office> [//] to his house . 1025410_1032060
and &-uh he gets all wet . 1032792_1037463
and his mother is a_little mad at him because he didn't bring the &-uh umbrella like he told him . 1037805_1049845
so ‡ and then he went got the umbrella and started to walk back to school . 1051172_1061502
okay . [+ exc] 1078088_1078568
&-um I think I'm pretty good . [+ exc] 1079177_1083207
&-uh you want me to tell you what I okay . [+ exc] 1086966_1089696
what I'm seeing at [//] is &-uh a cat that is &-uh <on top or> [/] on top of the tree . 1092557_1104967
and the young girl wants to bring him down . 1105929_1113329
and her father &-uh tried to go up the tree to &-uh get the cat out . 1114279_1124939
and the dog is barking at the man . 1126414_1129984
and apparently the father got stuck in the tree himself with . 1131433_1140363
and after that &-uh two firemen came to bring him a [/] &+lat a ladder to probably take both the father and the cat out_of the tree . 1140778_1157868
no ‡ I [/] I think I [/] I have them as as good as I'll be able to remember . 1333914_1339794
okay . [+ exc] 1362779_1363089
okay &-uh the story starts when a man brings &-uh his [//] <maybe his youngest> [//] her [
&-uh they start when they were earlier . [+ cir] 1408531_1413111
but &-uh after several years it turns out that &-uh &-uh Cinderella <has [/] has made> [//] hasta do all of the work to &-uh take care of the [/] the [/] the family there . 1414050_1440450
&-uh after awhile &-uh Cinderella starts to be friends with little critters . 1440760_1455550
&-uh &-uh after awhile there comes an announcement that there's gonna be a ball at the prince's [/] &-uh prince's &-uh castle . 1455600_1470460
&-uh all the women the stepmother and the stepsisters were all &-uh dressed up for the ball . 1480744_1501054
but &-uh &-uh Cinderella was not invited . 1501807_1511597
so ‡ she started to look around or she was reading something . 1513038_1521808
and she saw a &-uh <godfather [
&-uh and <she had> [//] she made up a beautiful gown for Cinderella . 1551162_1561282
and she turned the animals into a <couch [
so ‡ &-uh Cinderella and the prince had a beautiful time and were dancing . 1587069_1601429
and then at the &-um strike [
and the &-uh coach turned in back into &-uh a pumpkin . 1638749_1646469
so ‡ when she was leaving from &-uh the ball she left [//] lost her &-uh glass slipper . 1647868_1666798
&-uh after they found the glass [/] &-uh glass slipper &-uh a man who worked for the king and the prince went around to try and to see if they could find who &-uh dropped the glass slipper . 1668524_1699264
so ‡ they look . 1706386_1707826
and none of the other woman at the house would fit with the [/] the &-uh slipper until &-uh they found <Cindereed [
so ‡ &-uh they went to the castle . 1735718_1742818
and the prince and &+Cinder Cinderella &-uh got married and live happily ɛv@u [
okay . [+ exc] 1770101_1770281
&-uh I would get a couple slices of bread . 1770305_1775305
&-uh the way I would usually do it would be spread the peanut butter on one slice . 1776124_1785574
&-uh put a little bit of &-uh jam around it . 1786753_1792703
and then put the top &-uh slice . 1793628_1796588
and then usually cut it in half . 1797193_1803263
