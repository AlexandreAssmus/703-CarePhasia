&*INV
but it's pretty good . 12055_12915
understandable . 14929_15949
yes I do . 24243_24853
well ‡ no ‡ I don't remember the stroke . 25081_26641
I remember the first one that I had . 26768_28888
and I remember the third one that I had . 29417_31257
I do not remember the second one . 31674_33404
okay &-uh I can tell you about the first one . 41214_43764
I'll tell you that one . 43983_44753
&-um the first one &-um I was home alone . 44965_49185
&-uh FirstnameS had gone to get her &-uh hair cut about twenty five miles away . 50145_55955
and I was working here at the house . 56729_59249
<I was> [/] &-uh <I was> [/] <I was> [//] I'd been working on [/] &-uh on doing some carpenter work in the house . 59356_65906
and &-uh <I started to feel> [/] &-um I started to feel kind_of numb in my right hand . 66863_77443
&-um I didn't feel too bad . 78568_81008
but I knew from what people had told me what I'd heard &-uh many times the [//] one of the signs of a stroke is &-uh numbness . 81870_92080
in_fact I remember <I was> [//] &-uh &-uh a fellow that &+w I used to work with had a stroke at work . 92788_100668
and I remember going through that and &-um kinda recognize from that how it looked . 101522_109052
&-um so ‡ I [/] I [/] I [/] I knew what was going on . 109884_114594
I knew I was having a stroke . 114613_116023
&-um <against my> [//] well ‡ <I probably> [//] &+sh I shouldn't have done it . 116750_123150

&-uh FirstnameS &-uh she'd [//] &+b it was about a half hour away . 200971_206011
so ‡ she got there after this had started that [//] &-uh the &+ex &-um &+z questions . 206640_214150

and [/] and &-uh <I remembered> [//] I knew what was going on &-uh I [//] <that I was> [//] that I had a stroke . 260766_268756

it was just stroke . 274781_276471
&-uh so ‡ I wasn't too worried about it . 277631_280161
but [//] and at that time it was only still <in my> [/] in my &-um right arm . 280853_286263

and then I did that again a_couple more times other days . 474380_478920
and &-uh it seemed like things were going pretty well . 479606_484386
<and then I> [//] and then we [/] &-uh we [//] as I said [//] &+w made an appointment to go see the &+n &-uh neurosurgeon . 485633_492313

it's not a regular stroke . 564021_565301
it's not a regular stroke . 566259_567599
it's [/] &-uh it's a &-uh situation that I've had probably since birth . 568121_574811
and it [//] the situation is that there is a [/] &-um &-uh a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the &-um artery . 575852_594932
and instead of going &+th through the little capillaries and everything it doesn't go through the capillaries . 597091_604741
it goes directly into a [/] a vein . 604762_608902
so ‡ there's no [/] no filter there to [/] to slow it down or [//] you_know . 610117_615697
and so that [/] that con [
and it [//] I said it probably was there from birth . 633474_637114
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure . 637827_641837
and it [/] it didn't blow . 641856_644946
<it just> [//] <there was> [//] and it was not a <very big> [/] &-um &-uh very big spot . 645104_650594

it stopped . 657152_657872

it stopped . 660021_660531
and there wasn't really much damage . 660613_663523

in July [//] middle of July somewhere I had another stroke . 1119269_1127339
and they +//. 1129522_1130662
<I was at that point> [//] <I was in the> [//] &-uh I was in &-uh <a rehabilitation center> [//] a rehab hospital . 1130781_1137851
and they [/] &-uh they took me &-uh by ambulance because <I [/] I felt> [//] I could feel that something was going on . 1139115_1150115
and I was afraid it was stroke . 1150758_1152358
but I couldn't say it was a stroke . 1152519_1154289
but I knew there was something going on . 1154988_1156478
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem . 1156499_1162159
they took me to the hospital and &-um did the scans and so_forth . 1162181_1167651
and sure enough <I'd had another> [/] &+s I'd had another stroke . 1168149_1170979
&-um while I was there in the hospital +... 1171824_1176254
&-um up until that time I could not move my legs at all . 1178984_1187314
my hands <I had> [//] <I was no> [//] I couldn't do anything with it . 1187803_1191893
<I you_know was just> [//] that's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again . 1192196_1197456
but while I was in the hospital &-um I started being able to move +//. 1198562_1207522
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost &-um my ability to focus my eyes together . 1207660_1216570
so ‡ I can only see out_of one eye at a time . 1217413_1219453
so ‡ I was wearing an eye patch over one side . 1219841_1221931
then I'd wear it for a while over this side then &+w you_know . 1222318_1226148
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see &-um with both eyes . 1226169_1234599
I can steer with both eyes . 1235527_1236847
but I'd see different [/] different things . 1236868_1238918
and so &-um when I had <the second stroke or well> [//] this third stroke in the hospital &-uh I [//] the vision started clearing up . 1239922_1251692
and I remember <telling me> [//] telling FirstnameS . 1252660_1255000
"I said +""/. 1255493_1255743"
"+"" my visions are getting better . 1256160_1257490"
"+"" I can see better . 1257850_1258660"
"+"" I can focus . 1258853_1259553"
"+"" I can focus with my eyes . 1260099_1261389"
and [/] &-um and I [//] &-uh sure enough I could . 1262540_1265760
and then I also told her that [/] that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit . 1266499_1271739
and &-uh you_know (be)cause <when you're> [/] when you're paralyzed you're not sure whether it's moving or not . 1272321_1277811
you think you're moving it . 1278214_1279244
but &+y it really isn't . 1279990_1281960
"and I said +""/. 1282390_1283110"
"+"" you_know look at my leg and see if it's moving and [//] &-uh because I really felt like it was . 1283745_1290185"
and indeed it was moving . 1290578_1292298
it was moving . 1292900_1293770
so ‡ whenever happened in this second stroke was [/] was good for me because I was able to start moving my &-uh &-uh &-uh muscle . 1293910_1304970
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle . 1306174_1308974
&-uh and I was able to &-um see with both eyes together . 1310037_1315007
so ‡ &-uh I was there two or three days . 1316387_1319487
and &-uh they took me back <to the> [/] &-uh to the rehab hospital . 1320530_1324300
and &-um <at that point I was able to> [//] &-um up until that point I'd &+permy primarily been doing rehab in terms of &-uh mental stuff . 1325848_1342058
and &-uh at that point then I was &+t able to start doing sʌmpɪŋ@u [
&-um and you_know as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to you_know start &-uh make myself move my muscles . 1354960_1367800
<my arm> [//] I can move my arm . 1367822_1370032
my hand still wouldn't move . 1371245_1372995
we just numbed it . 1373098_1373748
I <couldn't do> [//] &+anyth couldn't move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that . 1373860_1379410
and &-uh so I [/] I do remember that <when at that> [/] at that point . 1380526_1386556
and you [/] you [//] I don't know . [+ exc] 1387409_1388549

&-um was that the question ? 1394282_1395452
yeah . [+ exc] 1395608_1395848
and so I started working really hard . 1396402_1399602
I started working really hard because at that point <I knew that> [/] I knew that +//. 1400010_1407070
well ‡ actually you_know I knew it before that . 1407212_1409062
that <I was some> [//] at some point I was gonna get better . 1409938_1413988
I just couldn't do it . 1415165_1416615
but at that point when &+fi I <was steɪbəlɪ@u [
and if I work at it hard enough I'll be able to get better . 1429786_1435276
so ‡ I [/] I was in <that rehab hospital for> [//] two rehab hospitals for awhile . 1436761_1442061
and then I went to a [/] &-uh a long term &-uh &-uh care facility . 1442355_1447825

&-uh and the hundred days +... 1460854_1465644
I could've used more but that was the &+r limit for [//] because_of Medicare . 1467451_1471321

and &-um so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs . 1515622_1526192
<I hadta> [/] I [/] I'd had some more rehab along . 1526290_1530270

&-um you_know I [/] I had [/] had a very good physical therapist to help me . 1584699_1591909

she was running down the stairs . 4273796_4275326
the slipper fell off . 4275400_4276600

it was perfectly obvious whose [/] whose foot it was . 4375141_4379741
