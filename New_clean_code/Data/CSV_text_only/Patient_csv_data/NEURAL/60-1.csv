&-uh it's pretty good . 8979_11259
I know I &+s struggle when I get overly tired . 11337_14447
I [//] I'm told that people wouldn't know I have trouble unless I
my hesitation to them I'm told is [//] sounds like I'm thoughtful .
they don't understand it . 28127_29347
my hesitation is because I'm struggling &=laughs . 29912_32922
yes . 38799_39289
sure . 45689_46109
&-um I went to bed on a Monday night after work . 46617_52337
and &-uh just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and
&-um about &-uh one or two in the morning &-uh I hadta go to the
and I was struggling to get the covers off . 67789_70409
I was laying on my left side . 70589_72219
so ‡ I trying to get the covers off with the right . [+ gram] 73175_76055
and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were . 76100_78350
and &-uh that was my first sign something was wrong . 79261_82631
I [//] at first I thought (be)cause I had the two cats . 83185_85865
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something . 85998_88348
but &-uh they [//] I [//] you_know the room was dark . 88399_92299
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might . 92317_96717
and finally they came off . 96733_97943
and then I &-um tried to take some steps . 98006_102516
the bathroom was the next room over . 102772_104742
and I was &-um finding that I was exhausted . 105487_110327
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed .
&-uh I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed . 116810_119250
but I just laid on the floor . 119971_121351
&-uh I laid there for about thirty minutes . 122217_124677
"&-um my Garmin told me what was goin(g) on , the timeline . 125046_129196"
and &-uh so when I got back up I still didn't feel like I could
so ‡ I did and just crawled back into bed . 135991_138451
and &-uh <then about> [//] &-um I was awake asleep back and forth
and I was trying to figure out . 147560_150950
something's wrong with me . 151000_152050
but I don't know if this is major . 152100_154480
and I was trying to decide . 154502_155922
it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart . 156536_160896
and &-um I didn't want to go to the emergency room . 161942_169102
and there'd be nothing wrong . 170300_171530
&-uh but I called &-uh a guy from work . 172859_176429
I used my phone . 176525_177705
and I thought I was dialing his work number . 177757_180877
but I got his cellphone number . 180964_182454
so ‡ I want to leave him a voicemail message . 183349_186699
and I was surprised to hear him answer . 187451_189191
"and that's when he told me +""/. 189329_190209"
"+"" you called my cell number . 190330_191740"
so ‡ I worked for a very difficult company to work for . 192609_197969
and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on . 199024_202824
so ‡ I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh
but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day . 208401_211161
"and I said &-uh +""/. 211636_212346"
"+"" pass the word on . 213545_214545"
"+"" &+m my brain's not working right today . 214919_218319"
"+"" I won't be in . 218431_219121"
"and so he just chuckled and said +""/. 219931_221931"
"+"" well ‡ okay ‡ I'll pass that on . 222220_223610"
and then I called a friend and &-uh told him what was goin(g) on .
and &-uh then &-uh between two of us &-uh we decided +//. 229402_235712
&-um &-um well ‡ my [/] my idea . 236728_239648
"+"" I will call him in a half hour . 240146_242206"
"+"" if you don't hear from me call me . 242315_244315"
"+"" if you can't reach me call for help . 244529_247039"
so ‡ a half hour later I called him . 247815_251565
and &-uh I decided I'm going to call my neighbor . 252159_255299
take me to the hospital . 256046_257565
so ‡ I did . 257748_258577
and my neighbor next door came and got me . 258827_261687
and &-um &+w we went to the hospital . 262457_266767
I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did . 267116_271146
it was a great one . 271193_272053
we've got &-uh four hospitals to choose from . 272099_275779
so ‡ <I don't &+re know why> [//] or remember why we went to that
but &-um she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago
and &-uh she was struggling trying to figure out where the
and at that point I couldn't read . 290859_292739
but I saw the red lettering . 293498_296458
and I knew that must be emergency . 296477_299387
and so I pointed to that . 300005_301775
and then [/] &-um &+sh then she didn't know what to do with me once
again she was someone with a brain injury . 309128_311188
so ‡ she was having trouble thinking her way through this . 311315_313995
"and so here , me , I just had a stroke . 314856_316936"
and I'm having to do the thinking &=laughs . 316957_318317
so ‡ &-uh when we pulled up under the awning there was a
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital . 326017_329417
and I caught his eye . 329992_333942
and he came out . 334640_335800
and I told him +//. 336535_337425
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke . 338079_340659
"and I told him +""/. 340731_341291"
"+"" I think I had a stroke . 341493_342653"
"+"" and I'm afraid to walk . 342836_344336"
&-um at this point I was not having trouble walking . 345118_347828
but I was afraid I might . 347844_349614
&-um earlier in the day in wee hours I was &-um having a real
but now I was okay with it . 355922_357102
"&-um so ‡ he said +""/. 357676_359796"
"+"" hold on . 360009_360219"
"+"" I'll go get someone . 360380_361010"
and he got a nurse . 361030_362200
and &-uh she came out . 362902_364222
and I told her the same thing . 364566_366176
and then she went back and got a wheelchair . 366200_368440
and they got me in . 368488_369458
mhm &-um I had a_lot_of speech therapy . 382135_388405
&-um I went to two different &-um organizations for therapy because
so ‡ I wanted more therapy than that . 404936_407216
and &-uh so I went to both . 407952_410052
so ‡ for maybe about <I don't know> [//] six or eight months I got
&-um each &-uh session is about an hour . 416651_420051
&-um &-uh I also did some physical therapy . 420675_426995
but I didn't stick with it . 427846_429246
and so I can still feel &-like my right leg drag a little bit . 429310_434560
&-um and I also have trouble writing . 435245_438475
so ‡ I have &-uh some occupational therapy I did as_well . 438544_441814
&-um and it [/] it helped a little bit but not a_lot . 442746_447496
&-um &-uh but the speech therapy &-uh +... 447662_454572
I found &-uh some therapists I just connected with better than
and &-uh the one I spent the most time with I really liked her
she was very good and very positive . 468427_471647
and as she explained it something important to me . [+ gram] 472388_475118
"<she said> [//] &-um in the beginning she said +""/. 475164_479054"
"+"" I'm going to test you right now to see where you're at right now"
then after we work together awhile I'll test you again to gauge
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that
so ‡ when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was
I felt so stupid (be)cause I couldn't do them . 501641_503771
but if I'd have known earlier that that's what they were doing it
but you_know they didn't think to tell me that . 510441_513270
but &-um I did &-uh games on my phone . 513945_518085
&-um I went to a local college that had &-uh meetings on &-uh
and so the first hour everybody's in the same room . 528115_531355
and then the second hour we're split up into groups . 532189_535229
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into . 535756_539116
so ‡ you go into a group with about four or five other people who
&-um I bought books &-uh grade school books for math and reading
&-um and I did that on my own . 560325_561965
and I did &-uh puzzle books . 562177_564037
and then &-uh I went back to work . 565344_567844
I went back to work very quickly . 567941_569591
way before I really was able to do much . 570120_572990
"but I just thought +""/. 573138_573878"
"+"" I've just got to get in there and do it . 574170_575560"
so ‡ I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke . 575576_579286
&-um there was something +... [+ exc] 580176_582436
oh &-uh I always liked to cook . 582483_586123
but now I really kicked it up . 586144_588124
&-um I found &-uh about healthy eating . 589067_594217
and I've always liked junk food . 595130_596980
and I decide to eat really healthy . 598029_600619
I felt like that would help me recover . 600641_603421
and &-uh so I [/] &-uh I got this [
and &-uh learning to understand measurements again was difficult at
but I learned . 617215_618325
and I still struggle with it sometimes . 618676_620466
making conversions is not so easy for me . 621078_623588
but [/] &-um but I see the ingredient list . 623604_627444
and then you've got &-like a paragraph of everythings
so ‡ I've learned to [//] if it's the first &-uh two things you do
and then maybe the next three things you've gotta do something else
then I color those other three with another color . 645258_649358
that kind of thing . 649377_650537
and so &-um then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods .
and that was motivating for me . 655103_656433
and then <I also> [//] &-uh I was working near a mall . 656456_662196
and &-uh so at lunch time I would go walk every day . 662895_665445
well ‡ the job that I had that was so stressful . 686419_696049
&-uh about two years ago now &-uh they laid me off . 696852_707392
and &-uh I was happy about that . 708775_711415
I hated that place . 712914_713834
I loved the work . 713891_714541
but the people were just insane . 714557_715987
and &-uh bullying people to get things done . 716998_720688
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over
but I was afraid to look for another job &-um because if the next
so ‡ I was really afraid to move . 738947_740137
and there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work . 740161_743511
so ‡ I felt really trapped . 744656_746076
but I was looking . 747323_748153
but <it was just> [//] you_know there really wasn't a_lot to pick
and [//] well ‡ anyway ‡ <the day> [//] three months or so before
so ‡ I started collecting my information that I was gonna need
and I put my notes in a notebook . 768206_770796
and I took (th)em out to my car . 770815_772285
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and
I didn't keep them at my desk . 777041_778091
I took everything out_of my office except for things that belonged
"&-uh I saved off programs I had written , everything . 783304_786714"
and so then when the boss and the h_r guy came to my office and
I tried not to look so happy about it . 796537_798107
but I was really happy . 798259_799299
and then &-uh I was out_of work for ten months . 799976_804226
and it was okay (be)cause I had unemployment . 805311_808211
I had money in savings . 808235_809125
and I was doing alright with that . 809148_810698
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job . 811133_814613
and now I work from home full-time for a company that's &-uh in
and &-uh so &-uh my boss that's [
&-uh he's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice
and I still do the same kind of work I useta do . 831345_833525
but now it's for nice people . 833549_835009
okay . [+ exc] 853080_853530
&-um this boy is kicking a soccer ball . 855959_859389
and he kicked it right into somebody's living room window . 860737_866117
and it went in and knocked over the lamp . 867264_872014
and the man saw the damage as it happened . 872893_877723
he got up with the ball in his hand . 878462_880452
and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball . 880469_884579
&-um the mom is &-uh trying to hand the son a umbrella . 902198_917428
&-uh but he doesn't want it . 918402_920582
and so she still holds onto it . 920605_924125
&-um so ‡ now the boy is walking . 960512_963742
and it's raining on him . 964286_965866
and &-uh the rain is getting heavier . 965888_970258
and he &-uh shows up in front of his mom all wet . 971514_976234
and he's not happy about it . 976257_978667
and she's not happy about it either . 978683_980623
&-um but now he's got the umbrella . 981227_983147
and he's continuing on his walk now with the umbrella . 983168_986188
&-um the little girl wants her cat that climbed up in the tree . 1002449_1008789
and so the man got up the tree to retrieve the cat . 1009632_1014862
&-um and the ladder fell out behind him . 1016088_1019038
and the dog is barking at all the excitement . 1020204_1024023
and the firemen are coming to rescue &-uh I assume the cat and the
