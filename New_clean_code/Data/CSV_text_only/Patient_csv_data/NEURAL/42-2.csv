how it was ? 25257_25887
&-um mostly when I started +... 30905_33235
I had a month I don't even remember anything about it . 34302_36282
but &-um it was like ten days . 36966_39436
<they finally got me in there to> [//] &-um <I finally started> [//] I_mean I could actually talk or anything like that . 39455_48165
&-um but I had to remember how to remember everything . 49097_54147
and we're [//] everything is gone back . 55540_58350
I mean everything about &-um abc@k all that kind of stuff like that . 58400_63160
everybody's name . 63579_64379
everybody [//] the computer on there . 64822_67492
the [/] the Coke sitting there . 67754_71274
everything . 71395_71915
the wrong about it . 71960_72520
you have nothing about it . 72671_73481
you hadta remember everything about it . [+ es] 73503_74473
so ‡ &-um we &-um went to +... 74523_78083
I had like thirty [/] thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first . 79587_86947
&-um and then &-um we went to +... 87031_90801
&-um after that that's when we started to talk and to &-um get in the sort of thing . [+ es] 91189_102499
make sure I'm forget something . [+ exc] 102549_103339
it's ten years before . [+ exc] 103356_104236
&-um &=laughs but we did start &-like &-um abc@k one two three or something like that with my mom . 105251_112021
<started to> [//] &-um it's in &-um &-um books . 112606_124276
I went there . 124847_125437
<there is someone> [//] we got a talk over there . 125575_127075
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abc@k one two three and stuff like that . 127698_133808
&-um and it took a long time . 134371_136601
it was about a year the start over that . 136619_138499
and I've gone down . 138702_139522
it was Monday to Friday . 139588_141198
now it's down Monday Wednesday Friday . 141243_143053
then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks . 144539_149789
just try to talk a_little better and that . 150771_152321
because I_mean at this time I could talk a_little better . 152688_154468
but it just hard to get back everything out_of there . 154555_157275
so ‡ that helped different things about it for those six weeks . 158287_162427
and you're trying with computer . 163145_164125
or <trying to> [//] try to write on there . 164143_165493
trying to do something about it get a_little better there . 165545_168165
and that's how they tried to +... 168339_169979
after that they started IU . 171000_172760
and that's when they &-um started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that . 173390_180550
&-um there's so much you couldn't remember anything about it . 180897_184047
&-um but it's [//] you just take your time trying to +//. 184961_190241
me [/] &+m me and <my mom> [/] my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that . 190400_195920
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things [
so ‡ it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time . 203582_206292
so ‡ you just gotta <keep everything> [//] keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk . 206345_214455
mostly taking my time . 216020_217820
so ‡ if I talk too much people have no idea what I'm doing . 218156_221156
and they talk to me real quick . 222577_224187
this is kind_of weird because if one person talk [
if there's three people I can understand other people . 228777_232867
I can understand more of this . 233199_234279
but [//] so ‡ it takes time &-um getting around everything . 234326_237926
so [/] &-um so ‡ <it's just> [//] it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting a_little better . 238000_244400
&-um I don't know how long I can go . 244694_247564
<but it's just> [//] it seems like I'm still doing something with it . 247579_250199
so [//] &-um and it keeps going over time . 250218_253478
so [/] so ‡ I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that . 253500_257180
<and the> [//] &-um and it's [//] my mom's very helping . 257226_262676
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too . 262700_266360
they need to do something like that . 266410_267760
but &-um I have my brothers too . 268482_270492
<one of them> [//] I_mean one I don't see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other . 270538_274828
so ‡ <it just> [//] it's not it [//] as it used to be . 274900_279140
I knew a_lot_of people and all that kind . 279155_281205
now I'm kind_of move down &-like a_couple people I knew and just take my time . 281608_286158
so ‡ it's a_lot easy as how it was . 286327_288477
&-um I dunno . 289199_290079
is that come around or +..? [+ exc] 290461_291871
&*INV
xxx about it was &-um like I said I had to &+re remember everything . 314865_318655
"I_mean I <wasn't really> [//] didn't get me out that bad because I said +""/. 319828_323368"
"+"" what was I gonna do ? 323787_324597"
so ‡ you hadta restart everything to get back on there . 325666_328546
so ‡ you took your time and tried to get through it . 328600_331690
and I_mean if you're going to yell at it it's not gonna do anything for it . 331791_334591
so ‡ you're [//] the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that . 334727_338737
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that . 339448_342098
I'd be outside and doing stuff like that or you_know . 342671_345081
but it really doesn't bother me that much . 345919_347399
I_mean I just take my time during the day . 347504_349334
&-like I'm [/] I'm gonna dry [* s
and I might go outside and working on the [//] a branch or something like that . 351267_354347
just keep going back and forth . 354400_355810
&-um &-like I'd [/] I'd go get my aunt . 356601_359541
she's ninety seven . 360281_361291
I get her on almost every times for a week . 361715_365305
and maybe &-like one day of the week and we'll see her . 365362_367182
but I get her on the phone every day . 367300_368750
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving . 368963_373663
and [/] and it's another way to get through to me and everybody else . 373678_377378
I_mean a_lot_of them can't understand what I'm doing . 377429_379319
but a_lot I know they know everything about it . 379990_382340
so ‡ it's easy about it „ so +... 382521_383641
just anything you're telling me or +..? 407714_408984
&-um I thought it was kind_of totally different when I [/] I [/] &+re I restarted here . 417172_425282
&-um I hadta remember how to do everything . 425753_427493
<which was> [//] <it was kind_of> [//] it's a_little weird for every [//] everybody too . 427851_435091
because I_mean I knew right away my mom could ask me you_know what this was in the kitchen or something like that . 435180_441530
yeah I knew how to make it . 441916_442796
I can make my breakfast and all that stuff . 443286_445296
"she goes +""/. 445357_445537"
"+"" know what that is ? 445675_446175"
no ‡ can't remember . 446259_447439
like that . 447943_449413
I knew everything . 449429_450069
it's all on my head like that . 450226_451426
I_mean made my breakfast and you_know &-like the &-um eggs bacon &-um microwave and the whatever &-like things like that . 452378_463148
and always be there in the morning . 463321_464251
always my breakfast first . 464333_465553
people think I'm weird . [+ exc] 466103_466653
but [/] but [/] &-um but it's just something that &-um +... 466675_470465
it is another way I tried to keep doing what I'm doing . 472257_476047
but it also is doing whatever I need to do . 476067_479647
I_mean I hadta do everything like that anyway . 479747_481747
so ‡ it took some time on that . 481800_483770
and &-um it's [//] it was a long time to do . 483886_487816
but you had [//] just took your time and do whatever you're doing „ I think . 487996_490696
it's [//] &-um I don't know how to +... 491108_492238
you're not gonna too quick . 493740_494700
and you hafta do sometimes . 495505_497035
so ‡ you just kinda do whatever you're doing but then a little bit farther . 497050_504470
number one the [/] the boy was sitting outside with a &-um soccer ball . 520191_525191
and he kicked a good one there . 525953_527143
but it went over by &-um the house over there went into <the umbrella &-um not the umbrella how_about> [//] the window . 527922_535162

there's a guy <sittin(g) in number third [
the soccer ball came in . 546397_548787
knocked out the lamp . 548803_551003
knocked him out too . 551747_552727
he was probably sleeping I think and scared him out pretty bad . 552902_555142
and then &-um number four I gotta see what I can move around here . [+ exc] 556347_559997
&-uh he's over looking through the window to see who it was . 564547_569377
their probably [/] probably ran away . 569535_571255
but &-um he's not very happy somebody threw the soccer ball into the window there . 571472_576782
about it . [+ exc] 578677_579177
&-um mom told the boy that she [
and she [
"+"" oh ‡ no ‡ I don't need to take that . 605562_606962"
on number two . [+ exc] 608126_608776
number three he went out there and it rained . 608986_610666
so ‡ he's walking . 612383_613163
and it's raining more . 613218_614168
and he's getting his feet in there . 614186_615436
but he got all the way back . 617298_618298
and she's not very happy with him . 618629_620649
mom's very happy with him . 620833_622043
and he knows . 622065_623335
he had water all over the place . 623581_624491
but next time he changed and took the umbrella with him . 625557_628117
enough . [+ exc] 633232_633522
okay . [+ exc] 650416_650636
&-um looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree . 653285_658335
which they could do anytime „ I think . 658600_660080
&-um well ‡ I don't know . [+ exc] 660888_662178
they can't get everything but they're [//] they do <to know> [//] to enough . 662505_666145
&-um but the [/] the girl she'd like to get her cat back . 666846_673966
but [//] &-um so ‡ she's waiting there . 674112_677082
and her [/] her dad decided he could go up there to help with that . 677103_680633
when he took the &-um +... 681647_683937
I know what it is . [+ exc] 690496_691086
la@k [//] lædɪd@u [
something close like that . [+ exc] 696689_697379
but he took it up the top . 697580_698460
and [/] &-um and it fell down . 699673_700913
so ‡ he's gonna have trouble anyway . 701185_702425
the cat's too far away . 702790_703870
but he's stuck . 704872_705592
he can't get down . 705737_706327
the dog's kinda barkin(g) at him for no reason driving him nuts . 706957_710607
but [/] &-um but the &-um firemen came in here . 711450_717360
they're gonna help for him . 717377_718207
so ‡ they're walking over this way . 718499_719909
&-um so ‡ they're walking . 720518_722838
and they'll get up here in a little bit . 722886_723876
they'll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him . 723900_726890
but &-um the [/] the bird's happy . 727965_734085
they're on the other place over there away from everyone else . 734100_736140
so ‡ they're singing something like (th)at . 736162_737772
but &-um it's pretty much about what it is unless they're waiting on he gets down and the cat doesn't wanna come down . 738891_747681
&-um did I get enough ? [+ exc] 748887_751017
okay . [+ exc] 941020_941200
<looks like> [//] &-um for some reason they gave it seems like another cousin with them . 942531_949071
they gave her with her aunt [
so ‡ &-um I'm not sure why he's [//] they send that way . 955671_960011
but anyway &-um whoever gave it said that'd be nice . [+ es] 960211_965031
we'll give it to you and stuff like that . [+ es] 965120_966540
<and they'll keep and> [//] &+st and they'll make it good for you too . 966627_969227
but then the aunt [
she made her pretty bad . [+ es] 975166_977326
she had to go work outside and [/] and everything else . 977511_980611
and again she's certain [* s
but her cousins [
they got to do whatever they wanted . 987059_988089
and they're kind_of a pain in the butt . 988106_989776
&-um but [//] &-um so ‡ that's how it was for all the time . 990343_995613
she tried to be nice . 996428_998378
but they were still not very nice . 998500_1000120
but &-um the one time they were gonna have they were &+t +... 1000596_1003936
I guess they do for the sometime the year they get to see everybody . 1004407_1008457
so ‡ they went to &-um see if this would be [//] see +//. 1008472_1015102
their [/] their aunt [

they had one they would bring on the way . [+ es] 1051163_1052573
that's not normal how the &-um people and stuff like that . [+ es] 1053423_1058833
this was totally different . 1059170_1059880
how they [
but they [
so ‡ she could go on that way . 1066279_1067579
&-um so ‡ she got to go in that place . 1068750_1070580
then &-um went to see there to that night . 1070600_1074810
got up . 1075250_1075620
she could go &-um sing and play or was out there . 1076795_1081835
got some people . 1082198_1083008
and that's where they saw the big &-um +... 1083795_1087655
it's one of the +... 1089664_1091034
I think he's &-um +... 1091171_1094061
I don't know if he is the king . 1094869_1097209
or he might be just the new king coming there . 1097547_1099637
he was out there . 1100414_1101134
he was with her for a while . 1101811_1103011
but then she hadta leave . 1103346_1104586
and he is worried what happened her . 1105260_1106610
but &-um she left . 1106657_1109267
and he was worried about that . 1109356_1110176
but she did drop one of her &-um shoes . 1110200_1113230
so ‡ he had that . 1113774_1114524
so ‡ they went back . 1115000_1115860
she was going back her place where she was just &+gon not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff . 1116739_1121769
but &-um her cousins [

but then &-um while they're there <they did> [//] he did bring (th)em over to her . 1132000_1136250
and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes . 1136493_1141183
so ‡ he knew what it was . 1141200_1142720
so ‡ he took her back . 1143022_1144162
and that's <one of the great or> [//] the best thing you could ever do . 1145052_1148982
she went back . 1149175_1149545
she's [/] she's like a queen now . 1149593_1152083

so ‡ enough ? [+ exc] 1154023_1156083
okay . [+ exc] 1166614_1166744
