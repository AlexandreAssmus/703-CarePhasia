I [/] I can tell you about our trip to China . 265705_273145
it was a land and tour [//] sea tour trip . 274241_282061
we took an airplane from Singapore . 283391_289711
and we flew to other hotels . 290133_295483
the airplane flew to Tibet . 296595_300375
and we got to see many beautiful temples . 302481_309451
and the people were walking around the temple . 309993_317063
and it was very beautiful . 317948_322498
and I enjoyed going inside the temple . 323233_330293
they had a very big Buddha there who was made all of gold . 331583_344463
and it was an immense amount of gold . 345361_350681
the people burned oil in the temple . 351839_355309
and we had to inhale the smoke . 358103_365093
the [//] visiting the temple was very beautiful . 365495_372745
we saw the people doing exercises +//. 376315_382825
&-um or not exercises . [+ exc] 383972_387212
they were praying . 387381_389811
and they prayed by moving their bodies up and down . 390278_399008
so ‡ I enjoyed watching them . 400162_404122
then we walked along the street . 404979_409249
and we went to various vendors . 409862_416352
and we purchased a silver Buddha and a singing bowl . 417021_428031
and that was rary [
then we went to eyenother [
and it was so tall . 444981_448471
the height of the place was very tall fourteen thousand feet . 449481_456381
and I had altitude sickness . 462321_467931
and I had to have oxygen . 469032_476152
and the &+mpee doctor gave me oxygen at night and the next day . 476866_489746
so ‡ I was glad to leave Tibet after that time . 491032_501282
then I took a boat on the Yangtzi river . 502962_512611
and it was very beautiful . 515227_519938
the boat stopped at different cities along the way . 520726_529216
and we saw many bridges that went across the river . 530180_539840
and I thought that it was interesting . 541822_548782
it looks like a young boy is practicing his kicking . 566504_571234
and he is kicking the soccer ball . 571714_576214
and &+an the soccer ball hits a window . 576658_582928
and it is broken . 583421_586991
and he knocks over a lamp and startles the man who is sitting in the chair . 587184_598314
and the man in the chair gets up . 599124_603584
and he picks up the ball . 603863_606683
and he looks out the window at the boy &-uh maybe wondering where the soccer ball came from . 607259_618889
the mother is trying to get the young boy to accept the umbrella when he's going to go out . 640192_651282
but the young boy says no . 651807_655597
he doesn't need the umbrella . 655839_658059
and he will do without it . 658553_661553
but he gets out . 662384_663724
and he finds that it is raining on him . 664379_670659
and he gets very wet and decides that that is not a good thing . 671217_678187
so ‡ he comes back . 679296_681546
and he &+sh talks to his mother . 682294_686264
and he is very unhappy because he is very wet . 686784_692894
so ‡ the mother gives him an umbrella . 693727_697417
and he goes back out into the rain . 697945_701995
but now he has the umbrella to protect him . 702441_706291
and he can walk in the rain just fine . 706307_711607
a picture of a man who went up the tree to rescue the kitty . 729916_735486
and in the process he got stuck up on the tree . 736113_741513
and they had to call the fire department to get him down and to rescue him . 742532_752002
and the girl is crying about the kitty . 752771_757721
and the dog is barking . 758520_761020
it seems as_though the ladder fell out away from the man . 761704_767894
and that's how he got stuck in the tree . 767909_773159
the story of Cinderella begins when [
and he is introducing Cinderella to his [
they are &-uh introduced . 1040178_1043218
and the life goes on . 1043777_1047237
and the father passes away . 1047969_1051239
and the stepmother and the stepdaughters are very mean to Cinderella . 1051691_1059321
they treat her very badly and have her cleaning out the fireplaces which is how she got her name Cinderella . 1061591_1073571
and so she also has to clean out the stables . 1074103_1080033
but along this time comes a announcement from the castle . 1080904_1088314
and the &+ma manager speaks an announcement that there is going to be a great ball because they want the prince to find a consort or a wife . 1088939_1108509
<so the princess> [//] so ‡ Cinderella makes her &+dr a dress . 1109611_1119911
she finds a book and makes a pretty dress with bows and sashes . 1120059_1128879
and it is very pretty pink and white . 1129185_1133685
but the sepsisters [
and they hurt the dress . 1140831_1143231
they tore off the sashes and the bows . 1143534_1148334
and the stepmother looked on and allowed this to happen . 1148891_1154291
so ‡ then they went off . 1155220_1159200
and they were going to the ball . 1159812_1163252
but <the &+m princesses no> [//] the magic lady &-um came along . [+ cir] 1163985_1175545
and she was a good fairy . 1177191_1181581
and she made a beautiful dress for Cinderella . 1182071_1188661
and she made the pumpkin turn into a beautiful coach and the dog into a concert [//] &-uh some kind of person to help with the coat [
and then the mice were turned into magical horses . 1210965_1216755
so ‡ then Cinderella went off to the ball . 1217550_1223020
and she had a wonderful time . 1223671_1227961
and the prince thought she was very beautiful and had nice dances with her . 1228535_1237745
and the stepmother and stepsisters were jealous . 1237762_1245062
and so they were whispering and talking . 1245438_1251198
and <the princess no> [//] Cinderella went &-uh outside into the garden . 1251670_1259170
and she noticed that the time was getting close to midnight . 1261849_1268759
and she knew that she had to hurry back because everything would turn back at midnight into its natural form . 1269178_1282028
so ‡ she quick got into the carriage and went home . 1283321_1289251
and she just about made it . 1289817_1293247
and all_of_a_sudden the pumpkin returned its way . 1293295_1300455
and they [//] &-um &-uh the pumpkin returned to its natural form . 1301804_1313404
and the mice turned into horses . 1313839_1316709
<and the> [//] and so then they &+me man in the castle made an announcement because she left a glass slipper on the stairway when she ran away . 1317417_1337457
and they were going to try and find the person who fit the glass slipper . 1340345_1348235
so ‡ the manager person came around . 1351575_1357845
and <they locked Cinderella> [//] the stepmother and stepsisters locked Cinderella in the room . 1358493_1367033
but she had the help of the mice . 1367757_1371187
and they helped slip the key out . 1371726_1375036
and she was able to come out . 1375507_1378497
and she fit the glass slipper exactly perfect . 1379169_1385569
and so then the &-um Cinderella and the prince got together . 1386285_1394855
and they got married and lived happily ever after . 1395179_1400679
I would have two pieces of bread . 1409467_1413067
and on one of them I would spread the jam . 1413619_1417839
and on the other piece I would spread the peanut butter . 1418615_1423535
"then I would put the two pieces , the bread together . 1424323_1428423"
and I would cut them in half (.) diagonally . 1429246_1435926
