&-um I can be confused a couple of times . 7640_13040
&-uh sometimes I get the wrong words . 13089_18569
&-um it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say . 19175_25125
&-uh &+su sometimes it's like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that I'm trying to say . 25903_36623
&-um I do have problems on [//] sometimes on the relationship between words . 37217_46537
&-like I know that I'm wanna talk about a female relative . 46629_55439
and I might say the wrong one . 56067_59057
&-like I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother . 59588_69798
stuff like that . 70045_71085
&-um but &-um I do have problems with &-um numbers too . 71195_80085
&-um I know if I'm talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number &-uh even how many times she hasta &-uh repell [
so ‡ and just like that I [/] I said repeal@q instead_of repeat@q . 110110_117340
that [//] that's some of the things that I have problems with . 117916_121546
but other_than that I_mean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow [//] slowly I usually can get through it . 123668_137308
&-uh I don't know about it actually . 144337_151467
&-um &=laughs I was sposta be having &-um a physical &-uh &+s therapy at home . 152201_163961
&-um and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kind_of crazy she said . 164837_176227
&-um I wasn't making sense . 176672_179072
and later that morning the physical therapist came . 180131_188981
and <he had all [/] all the> [/] &-um &-uh he had all the equipment . 189144_199914
and <he took my> [/] &-um he took my &-uh vitals . 200442_204472
and he said that I should go to the emergency room . 206943_211473
and that's [/] that's [//] &+th that I remember . 212263_216103
I didn't remember . 216969_218319
so ‡ my &-uh brother and my wife took me to the emergency room . 219126_223826
and luckily at the hospital that &-um I went to has a good &-uh stroke &-um thing . 223957_236697
so ‡ they took me right in there . 236749_238539
<they took a> [//] even in the emergency room they had &-uh a c_k [
so [/] so ‡ that's about what I remember . 248586_254286
well ‡ <when I> [//] when they took me back to the &-um &-uh hospital room there &-um I saw like five different doctors . 255104_270974
and they all did the same type of stuff . 270995_274835
so ‡ I could probably you_know do the [/] the what a doctor would see to check <about a> [/] about a stroke . 275569_285459
but I remember &-um I had &-um some memory loss . 286500_297150
&-like &-uh by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit . 298369_308739
and although I've know my brother's wife for you_know thirty five forty years I could not remember her name . 309358_323038
"&-like one [//] I said +""/. 323598_325328"
"+"" who is that ? 325571_326211"
you_know stuff like that . 326235_328015
<but it> [//] by the time I was &-um discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the [//] knowing that I did have some &-um &+apha +//. 349930_350100
I didn't know at the time that it was aphasia . 350100_352300
but I [/] I knew the symptoms that I &-uh &+pro &+pro &+pro <protest [
but that [//] that's all I remember . 368624_369844
&-uh &+w <well with the> [//] I didn't have any physical problems with <the streak [
&-uh <so when I did get> [//] &-uh well ‡ at the hospital they brought a speech therapist . 399050_408970
&-uh they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital . 409203_413003
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged . 413896_419316
so ‡ &-uh <I had hoped> [//] I [/] I knew I had problem speeching [* p
so ‡ I had asked if I could &-um forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well . 434463_447503
I [/] I was walking and all that . 449033_449963
"but they said that +""/. 450900_451390"
"+"" no you have to finish your physical &-uh therapy before you can start the speech &-uh therapy . 451996_462436"
so ‡ I [/] I had &-uh home speech therapy . 463215_470585
&-um it was very good . 472528_473058
I [/] I [//] the [/] the therapist was very good . 474712_477462
and she was actually the one that +... 477569_480039
&-uh after they let me have I think it's a Medicare type thing that you can use &-uh ten sessions . 481279_493409
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the &-uh speech clinic at Buffalo State in &-uh New York . 494040_509410
and &-uh a_lot_of that was &-uh to get my memory back . 510219_520869
&-uh a_lot_of the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories . 521677_535227
&-uh &-uh &+i it's hard to explain how it took . 535281_546571
&-uh I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist . 547147_554597
and after a couple of &-um sessions with the neurologist he said you_know there's pretty much nothing else that he can do about it . 555495_569875
but if I had any other problems &-um &-um you_know they could call me . 570683_580023
&-um one of the things <they did> [/] &-uh they did probably one of those &-uh cognitive &-uh test . 581896_592516
I [/] I did them . 594050_594630
and I did okay I guess . 594850_596380
&-uh probably sound &-uh like the stuff that they [/] they said that &-uh President Trump &-uh aced you_know . 596592_608872
I had some problems with it . 609894_611014
but &-uh &=laughs I had brain damage . 611902_614382
so ‡ I guess I had &-uh a reason . 614430_616840
but &-uh that's about it . 618350_619880
&-um well ‡ &-uh probably one of the [/] the [/] the nicest things that I have recently was &-uh my daughter &-uh on this [/] &-uh this Mother's Day she stopped over with the card for my wife . 642465_667995
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant . 675799_688529
so ‡ on <father [
and then on Father's Day we went over to her house with &-uh my oh son in-law's parents . 694564_710314
and they did a &-uh review [
so ‡ they had <a &-uh car [
and we saw that we're going to have a grandson . 729879_733999
<so that [/] that is probably one of the &-um &-um> [//] you_know that period between there has been exciting for us . 735726_750516
okay . [+ exc] 821090_821610
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the &-uh &=clears_throat window . 822825_835085
the ball breaks the window and startles the &-uh man who <grabs the> [/] &-uh grabs the ball and looks out the window to see what's going on . 836677_854897
okay . [+ exc] 877451_877801
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school . 878383_884453
and <he wanted to take or> [//] &-uh she wanted him to take an umbrella . 885111_894241
but he did not do that . 895987_897267
he started to walk back to school . 898718_902888
and the rain started to come . 903683_907043
so ‡ he ran back . 907461_909261
and the mother was a_little angry because <he had not pulled it or> [//] he had not put the &-uh umbrella with him . 911519_929379
"so ‡ he went back , put the umbrella on and walked back to school . 930201_936881"
okay . [+ exc] 955908_956618
well ‡ it looks like the cat was stuck in the &-uh tree . 957888_968488
and the man had tried to get to [
but he was not able to do that . 981184_983664
so ‡ the firemen came to [/] &-um to help him . 984859_992729
I don't know if they're there to get the cat <or the> [//] &+fa or get the man . 993338_1001348
and <the cat [
okay &-uh the story starts when &-uh <a woman [
so ‡ &+cirren Cinderella goes to <the [/] &+step the man or> [//] the bad stepmother . 1370953_1386473
and the two children the [/] the [/] the stepmother's daughters were bad .
well ‡ they aren't bad . 1386908_1388008
but they make Cinderella do all of the &-uh work around the house . 1403653_1414683
&-uh and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her . 1415593_1431313
and apparently they can talk with her . 1435818_1438588
&-uh and then <at after awhile> [//] after several years it looks like after the [//] Cinderella got &-uh a_little older there was a [/] &-um a invitation to go to the &-um ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for &-uh Cinderella . 1439476_1478036
but then &-uh Cinderella's &-uh godfather [
and a [//] she turns the animals into &-uh people that work for <the &-uh stage not the stage> [//] the coach . 1528563_1548603
&-um so ‡ they go to the &-uh ball where Cinderella meets the prince . 1551919_1566469
but because_of the [/] &-um the godmother only could do the spell until midnight &-um everything turned back to normal where &-uh her gown was gone . 1569294_1594424
and the coach were [* m
and the animals were back . 1601182_1601772
but then there was a man that worked for the princess [
&-um at the end &-uh they [/] they put the glass &+slip slipper on <Cinderitta [
and &-um it fit &+per perfectly . 1648993_1652343
and they found that that was the &-uh woman that the prince was looking for . 1653951_1665111
and <they went happy> [/] they went happy <to the> [/] to the end . 1665833_1675533
and that's about it . [+ exc] 1677394_1678144
oh okay . [+ exc] 1686232_1686822
&-uh I would open up the bag of the bread . 1686868_1692898
&-uh put a <piece of [/] of> [//] slice of bread . 1694886_1704866
<I would push [
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around . 1724716_1730336
and then put the second &-uh top of the slice of bread . 1730780_1736770
and I guess that's it . [+ exc] 1739504_1740044
