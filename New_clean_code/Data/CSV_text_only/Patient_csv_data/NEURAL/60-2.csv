pretty good . 8744_9264
yes . 14913_15373
no . [+ exc] 21369_21989
&-um I went to bed on a Monday night . 22950_27560
&-uh I worked all day . 28356_29586
and I went to sleep . 30205_31575
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back
about &-uh one o'clock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to
and &-uh that's typical for me . 44642_46212
and &-uh I had trouble getting the covers off . 46674_49954
&-uh I was laying on my left side . 50914_53674
&-uh I remember that because &-uh I had right side weakness . 54246_59546
and the blankets just felt really heavy . 59561_62471
and &-uh so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket . 63126_69886
as [//] &-uh it was like they were full of bricks or something . 69933_73053
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it . 73753_77173
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the
I was exhausted . 89490_90630
and &-uh so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed . 91218_94498
and &-uh I laid there for about a half an hour . 94975_98195
and &-um I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down
"and then I got up and &-uh thought +""/. 103617_106687"
"+"" I'll try again . 106942_107672"
"but as soon as I stood up I realized +""/. 107717_109857"
"+"" no I'm still just too tired . 110020_111950"
so ‡ I crawled back in bed . 112522_114462
and &-uh about &-uh seven thirty or eight o'clock I'd decided to
I [//] my boss was a creep . 126512_128151
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible . 128527_131558
<and so> [//] but this guy was &-uh kind_of &-uh the boss's pet . 132045_140715
"and &-uh so I thought +""/. 141646_142616"
"+"" I'd [//] I'll just call him . 142942_144232"
and &-uh when I used my cellphone +//. 144250_146620
I had that guy's cellphone number and desk number . 146665_150955
but I thought sure I selected the desk number (be)cause I was
"but I thought +""/. 158871_159101"
"+"" I'll just leave him a message . 159263_160513"
well ‡ he answered the phone . 160893_162293
and [//] &-uh so it hadta be before eight o'clock (be)cause I was
"and I said to him +""/. 167967_168897"
"+"" FirstnameB ‡ &-uh you're at work already ? 169149_172759"
"and he said +""/. 173557_174227"
"+"" no you called me on my cellphone . 174451_176601"
"+"" well ‡ what's up ? 176919_177509"
"and I said +""/. 178243_178983"
"+"" well ‡ &-um my [/] my brain's not working right today . 180001_184231"
"+"" so ‡ I'm not gonna come in . 184302_185662"
and &-uh I chose those words carefully . 186275_189435
I didn't want them to know there was a health issue . 189991_192291
&-um but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not
and I certainly needed to make that call . 198206_199926
and &-uh so &-uh he took it as &-uh humorous . 200635_206195
and I was fine with that . 206337_207267
that was kind_of why I said it the way I did . 207285_209735
&-um and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that
"he said +""/. 217301_217791"
"+"" I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me . 219098_223878"

"+"" but I just needed to let you guys I [//] know I wasn't gonna be"
and &-uh so he was real relieved to hear that . 237622_240172
and &-uh so I felt bad when he said that . 240788_242888
"I was like +""/. 242903_243353"
"+"" oh_gosh the guilt this guy's carrying around for nothing"
<and &-uh anyway> [//] so ‡ &-um I called either before him or

we've been going together for about six years . 258137_260226
<and I> [//] for me to call him is [//] that's a big deal (be)cause

"+"" call for an ambulance or help . 307577_309207"

"so ‡ I just said +""/. 331799_332649"

"+"" that's fine . 346146_346716"
and so I called him and told him you_know I was gonna go &-uh to
so ‡ &-um later he told me that he almost &-uh called an ambulance
but he [//] he's the kind of person he's afraid to make a mistake .
I'm sure there's some [/] some psychology there to [/] to delve in

so ‡ it's okay . 392570_393630
<so &-um anyway> [//] so then &-uh my neighbor came over . 393710_399230

and &-uh so I was in my bedroom getting dressed . 401241_404491
and &-um I don't remember taking a long time to get dressed or
I wasn't experiencing the exhaustion anymore . 416835_419355
and [//] &-um but I noticed at one point she came around the corner
and [//] &-uh <so then> [//] but I finished getting dressed . 427416_430026
<and just> [//] &-uh I kind_of planned out some things to do to
if I made sure I'd let the dog out and let her back in . 437265_441395
and &-uh I grabbed my purse and my phone . 441633_446793
and &-uh kinda made a mental note . 447592_449832
yes ‡ I've got my health insurance card . 449849_453889
I've got money . 454339_455479
&-uh got my driver's license . 456228_457788

so ‡ she was in my driveway . 472664_476514

I could feel it . 492827_493447
and it's right . 493463_494373
but I'm sitting here looking with my keys . 495299_497419

so ‡ I was having trouble . 498681_500251

&-um <and when we got there> [//] &-um it was like &-uh four of

so ‡ &-um my street is always the first in the city to get paved .

so ‡ &-um then she didn't understand where to go exactly . 540732_549342
she [//] I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didn't
and I saw the red lettering . 553058_556608
and I couldn't read it . 557246_559426
&-uh that was so significant to me (be)cause I remember I could not

and &-uh she brought out &-uh +... 655940_657790

and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair . 662800_664800
I think it was just inside the door . 664847_666687
then [//] so ‡ she got me in the wheelchair . 667153_669003

it was pretty full . 674660_675700

<I think Glucophage is> [//] I think that's the name brand for it .

<and I> [//] it surprised me that I couldn't remember them . 755390_758030

<and they just> [//] for about an hour or two I was enjoying
<it was just> [/] it was &-uh just so cool . 2189861_2192871
so ‡ I [//] yeah I always heard how &+f much fun grandbabies are .
but &-um oh_my_gosh instant celebrity is so much fun &=laughs . 2196731_2201131
so ‡ that's the [//] probably about the best thing that's ever
okay . [+ exc] 2221275_2221465
&-uh there's a boy outside . 2222096_2223446
he's kicking a soccer ball up in the air . 2223499_2227019
and &-um the ball winds up <inside of a> [//] shattering somebody's
and the ball lands inside this man's house . 2236392_2241712
and this man is just sitting on a couch and &-um was surprised to
and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over
and &-uh so the man picks up the ball and &-uh looks out the window
okay . [+ exc] 2283750_2284050
&-um there's a little boy . 2286633_2289783
and &-uh mom is &-uh strongly advising him to take this umbrella
and &-uh he is &-uh not open to that advice . 2298224_2306274
and &-uh so he leaves without it . 2306360_2309120
and &-uh he waves goodbye to his mom . 2309598_2312668
and she's still got that umbrella in hand and &-uh asking him to
but no he's good while he [/] &-uh he gets outside . 2318012_2322612
and it's raining he's noticing . 2322636_2324686
and [/] &-uh and not only is it raining it's <becoming &+t this>
and he's walking through puddles . 2335413_2337093
and he's trying to keep his head dry &-um with just his hands . 2337316_2342706
and he gets to the house . 2343164_2344644
and he sees his mother with this &-uh I told you so attitude . 2344897_2349297
and &-uh she's looking at him where he is drenched . 2349898_2352338
and [//] &-um but the next scene is he's going on his way in the
but this time he's got the umbrella . 2361989_2363999
and it's open and is keeping him dry . 2364447_2366427
(o)kay . [+ exc] 2385564_2386324
&-um this little girl has a cat . 2387406_2394766
and the cat is on a tree and the branch . 2395011_2398771
and the little girl can't reach it . 2398885_2400335
and the cat is just hanging out on that branch . 2400431_2402811
&-uh so ‡ &-um somebody apparently called the &+pol fire department
and &-uh so these two firemen are &-um coming towards the scene
"and &-um the little girl , it looks like she had gotten there [//]"
and &-um &+i &+sh there's a dog &-uh at the tree trunk . 2438919_2446869
&-uh and it's barking up . 2447917_2451957
&-uh there's a man up on the branch of the tree . 2452341_2456231
&-um and the dog is probably barking at him . 2456832_2461542
and there's another tree . 2462051_2463201
there's a bird . 2463312_2464022
looks like it's singing . 2464042_2465372
and &-uh there's a ladder on the ground . 2466947_2469887
&-um possibly the ladder was used by the man . 2469936_2475556
and <he looks &-uh kind_of &-uh not &-uh kind_of> [//] &+discour he
and so it's probably his ladder that fell . 2483418_2485758
and so he's just kinda sitting there taking all that in . 2485779_2488669
and &-uh so with the firemen on the way &-uh looks like it's gonna
mkay . [+ exc] 2941220_2941510
&-um the evil stepmother and &-uh two stepsisters &-uh met the
and &-um then later as the stepsisters are older +//. 2964698_2975658
now they're not little kids anymore . 2975675_2977865
they're like &-uh teenage girls . 2977885_2979525
&-uh they're really not nice to Cinderella and expects [
and &-uh they're preoccupied with themselves . 2988890_2993040
&-uh one especially &+s shown &-uh powdering her nose or something
and &-um &-uh Cinderella notices [//] looks out the window . 3000538_3008308
and she sees the palace . 3008361_3009451
and &-uh she's looking at that kind_of &-uh fondly . 3009850_3015210
and &-uh she fantasizes about wearing a dress &-uh to this &-uh
&-um and so she puts it on . 3024123_3025953
and &-um &+sh her stepmother witnesses one of the &+stepdaught &-uh
&-um then Cinderella was talking to her fairy godmother . 3050764_3065424
and &-um this &-uh fairy godmother &-um made a driver and a
&-um the mice became horses . 3076743_3082873
and think the dog might've been the driver . 3083902_3088732
&-um then she gets the palace . 3090323_3092903
and she dances with the prince . 3093197_3095727
and &-uh the fairy godmother had given her a &-uh beautiful dress
and her hair was done nice . 3103876_3105346
&-um and &-uh she has a great time Cinderella does at the dance . 3106251_3111961
and then she notices it's almost midnight . 3112272_3114922
and &-uh so she explains to the prince that she hasta go . 3115663_3119163
and the prince is [//] doesn't really want her to go . 3119645_3122355
<and so> [//] but she leaves . 3123116_3124746
and in her rush down the steps she drops &-uh a glass slipper . 3124904_3135214
but I should back up . [+ exc] 3135230_3136270
there was two workers that worked in the palace . 3136856_3139446
and they were planning this &-uh event earlier on . 3140141_3144691
we saw &+s slide of them talking about something probably this
<and he was> [//] so ‡ she rushes down the steps and loses her
and one of those same workers that had planned this event &-uh was
and &-uh so she rushes on home not even know where she dropped it .
and &-uh then [/] then &-uh <one of those> [//] the same worker
<and &-uh then> [//] so ‡ he takes it to Cinderella's house . 3186101_3191611
and &-uh the evil stepmother &-um +//. 3191976_3195266
oh <back at> [/] back at the dance &-uh the stepmother and the
but she was forbidden to even go to this dance . 3207777_3210667
so ‡ now she's there dancing with the prince of all things . 3210794_3214324
<and the> [//] &-um anyway the [/] &-uh the one worker that xxx had
that way they'll know &-uh who it is exactly that the prince had
and &-um the evil stepmother she knew about the slipper who it
so ‡ she was hoping that since it was glass <it would> [//] she
so ‡ she tried to trip the guy who was carrying it carefully on a
and [//] but apparently <he didn't> [//] &-uh he was able to keep
and it fits perfectly . 3272554_3273864
and &-uh so then &-uh next scene is &-uh she's at the palace with
and they're married now . 3282427_3283627
&-um I would make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by gathering
so ‡ I gather the bread and &-uh the peanut butter and the jelly
and so then I would spread the peanut butter on one slice of bread
and &-uh then &-uh I would use the spoon to get the jelly and
and &-uh then I'd put them both together . 3341406_3343286
and I'd put them on a plate . 3343308_3344828
and &-uh &-um put the peanut butter and jelly and bread away . 3345327_3350947
and &-um grab the napkin . 3351240_3354630
and go sit down . 3354654_3355414
