&-um I don't rimɛmbvɚ@u [
&-um I didn't even know my name . 107931_109651
I didn't know who I was . 110105_111015
they gave me a mirror to know who I was . 111292_113762
and I didn't know it was me . 113837_115157
I thought it was a picture of someone else . 115389_117229
so ‡ yeah ‡ for that long &=laughs . 118237_119387
so ‡ I had about two weeks of not here &=laughs . 120438_122698
yes . [+ exc] 123959_123989
&-um let's see . [+ exc] 134583_136383
at the beginning &-um <I had> [//] I could not walk yet . 136403_141543
so ‡ they were helping me to &-um stand up &+s at the beginning &-um not walking anywhere but able to stand up . 141996_155206
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side . 155471_159871
&-um so ‡ I had one therapist that [//] bet [
this one arm was not always going . 170770_173900
so ‡ weights trying to get that going . 174220_177600
&-um then I had another &-um therapist &-um was trying to get me to start &-uh talking . 178362_189222
&-um I couldn't really talk of anything . 189906_193176
so ‡ they were showing me like &-um yes@q or no@q a_lot . 193384_199094
&-um I [//] we had to start with that . 200014_202414
"sometimes I didn't really even understand if they said +""/. 202745_208635"
"+"" do you wanna drink something ? 208881_211231"
usually they would show me that . 211252_213032
"and I thought +""/. 213739_214309"
"+"" what are they doing ? 214493_215393"
I'd [//] so ‡ that was hard . 215412_217632
&-um even at the beginning I didn't even understand cups . 218027_221927
and &-um they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere . 222000_229350
and &-um <they showed me how to> [//] they hadta show me how to eat again . 230001_235371
&-um to [//] &-um at the beginning I was very [/] &-um very scared by myself in a room . 236196_247176
&-um <I also thought we had> [//] I [/] I thought someone had took me like [/] &-um like a bad person taking me . 247959_258399
so ‡ I was trying to run to help myself . 258951_265281
I had those thoughts too of scared &-um &-uh to the point where I was trying to &-um hit people in a way because <I thought they were trying to help no> [//] I thought they were bad people . 265483_285943
so ‡ I [/] I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run . 286128_291018
that was even that part for me . 291407_293327
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way . [+ cir] 294041_300561
&-um didn't [//] my mom and dad were there . 301401_304451
didn't know who they were . 304469_305669
&-um my kids were here . 306617_309007
didn't know them . 309028_310138
&-um like I said they showed me a mirror . 310759_314279
"and they said +""/. 314333_314983"
"+"" do you know who you are ? 315203_316623"
"and I [/] &+di I thought +""/. 316783_317783"
"+"" who is this person ? 317980_319060"
and it was me . 319243_320103
so ‡ that's when it got started . 320802_322562
"&-um then therapy started with even very small like &-um saying my name , saying yes@q or no@q . 322671_334391"
&-um went from that point to we played some games &+t for numbers like &-um dice . 334829_343509
"&-um we played some games that were cards like &-uh &+p play cards in a way , put [//] sort all the cards together , what colors matching . 344484_359584"
&+suh little things . 359600_360710
it gives me &-um focus . 361044_363814
and also I would əlæks@u [
if we're playing a game I was okay . 368840_370560
so ‡ we did that . 370793_371723
&-um then they started giving me cards . 372437_376067
what [//] the first one I ever saw was a baby . 376393_379813
there's a baby card . 380784_382344
and there was a bird . 382724_384604
"and they said +""/. 385244_386184"
"+"" what is this ? 386438_387378"
is it a bird or &-um a baby ? 387563_392653
and it took +/. 393049_393919
I didn't know . 396453_397233
but I knew it a little bit in my brain . 397503_400433
but not really on what they were you_know . 400452_403192
it was happy thoughts . 403275_404615
but <I don't know> [//] I wasn't sure what that was . 404665_406805
that's when it started . 407446_408606
&-um then I was able to start not walking very well . 408652_414852
"but I could stand up , pivot , sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself . 415034_421234"
that's when all that started during [
"&-um once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well , not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning . 425906_437066"
I still do have to watch my &-um &-uh dizzy &+s feelings . 437165_445255
"but &-um therapy [//] that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better , stuff like that . 445722_453452"
"and other therapy was still doing the talking , started at the beginning . 454198_459928"
"&-um so ‡ it's [//] that was about &-uh a year of just talking , working on all those words and all that you_know . 461048_470798"
&-um then after two years didn't have to worry about the other therapy (be)cause now I'm starting to walk &-uh very well now . 471330_479030
so ‡ only just therapy for [/] &-um &-um for speech . 479492_485812
&-um then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years &-um we started working on these numbers which I still not good at &=laughs . 486391_499031
&-um I went from &-um one to now I know one and two to one two three . 500061_508771
<I'm not> [//] higher than that not very good so you_know . 509789_514479
"and one plus one , not sure there yet . 515032_517371"
but [//] &-um so ‡ was working on numbers &-um and trying to start reading of any kind . 517520_525981
&-um reading [//] it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading . 526005_533305
I'm still not all there . 533822_535312
now it's been three years . 535655_537085
&-um <I can> [//] I really can't read „ I say . 537213_541123
"&-um sentences , maybe . 541602_544132"
it depends on what we're talking about . 544181_546281
I'm starting to read &-um books from &-like little kids books . 546706_551936
&-um now I can do some of that . 552374_554234
writing is not as good . 555367_556837
so ‡ I use my phone . 557459_559299
"but &-um therapy people was showing me &-like apps , stuff like that . 559684_566404"
because someday if you can't write again there's other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that . 566500_573820
so [//] well ‡ I can't remember the first thing we're talking about . [+ exc] 574737_577787
sorry about that . [+ exc] 578029_578919
see ‡ this is me &=laughs . [+ exc] 578970_579880
okay ‡ kʊz@u [
&-um let's see . [+ exc] 606917_609697
&-um I [//] &+th <does it have to> [//] so ‡ what +..? [+ exc] 611058_617088
are you talking about just &-um a story are you saying ? [+ exc] 617558_622978
or are you saying &-like something about something like that ? [+ exc] 623000_627980
okay ‡ &-um I think &-um is [/] is new stuff . [+ exc] 643133_650343
I [/] I think &-um since [/] since I'm &+i a teacher +//. 650433_658063
and I was before . 658224_659404
&-um but now I hafta &-um be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school „ right . 659821_667881
so ‡ one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke . 668379_674559
they have aphasia . 675272_676152
and we [//] &-um when there's a new patient here &-um I [/] I like to help them . 677316_687196
they're gonna have the [/] &+sa the same struggles most o(f) the time that I had . 687700_693870
and so &-um now we [/] we are now friends . 694396_700186
I can help them to have her [
&-um and &-um tips I can give them . 706299_710929
&-um and so now when I do that kind of stuff I'm now a teacher again . 711610_719410
so ‡ I [/] I like that . 720031_721781
and they're also now my friends . 722342_724862
I [//] when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back . 725178_732428
so ‡ I haven't seen some of them now for years . 732879_735629
they don't call me back . 735674_736674
they don't understand me now . 736787_738847
&-um so ‡ my new friends are kinda like me . 739837_745037
<we're very> [//] &-uh we talk a_lot which is good . 745061_749651
but &-um I think that we have bad days . 750245_755775
&-um therapy is hard some days . 756667_760207
&-um &-um some days <our brain> [//] mine [//] my [//] I would say my brain doesn't always work some days . 761137_770557
&-um my eyes don't always work . 771341_774911
&-um <my foot> [//] now that we're talking my foot's not working right now . 775781_781701
&-um things like that . 782282_783412
but &-um my life being a teacher and a friend is [/] &-uh is an awesome thing to me . 784251_793471

yeah I don't know if it's really dad „ I guess . 1163207_1167287
maybe it's just someone who is helping for the cat . 1167741_1170901
or if it's you_know the little girl's dad that did that . 1171467_1175237
