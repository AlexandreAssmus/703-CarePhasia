<does it> [/] <does it> [//] is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching ? 52333_57083
I said some things backwards . 58369_59929
"so ‡ if I'll say +""/. 59981_61451"
"+"" &-um &-uh <if it's> [//] <if it> [/] if it's big I'd say small and so_forth . 61731_67711"
&-um I think those are the main issues I have . 68366_73956
no I don't remember anything for about six weeks . 83830_86910
the first memories that I had after my stroke are [//] were very cloudy . 96971_102921
&-uh and <they were not accurate> [/] &-uh they were not accurate . 103112_107502
for example I [/] I remember being in a wheelchair . 107632_112132
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair . 112853_114883
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the weɪrtʃeɪr@u [
and I was strapped in because I couldn't sit up on my own . 119730_122670
&-uh those [//] &-um for about two months I [/] I [/] <I really didn't> [//] <I couldn't remember> [//] I remembered [/] &+al remembered almost nothing . 123749_139639
&-um and some of the things I had were &-um very much &-um incorrect . 140478_152358
&-um I found out later things I thought . 153658_158498
and then &-uh when I first started remembering things &-um I was &+mooz was at that point I was moved to a &-uh rɪləbɪləteɪʃɪn@u [
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct &-uh somewhat accurate . 173155_181095
&-uh and that was probably &-um month and a half or two months in . 182104_187294
then I [/] &-uh I started remembering things but [/] but it was slow coming back very slow coming back . 188567_199427
&-um one thing that [/] that I didn't know was that &-uh <as I was> [//] as it was coming and waking up I guess I was gettin(g) [/] getting (a)round to being able to talk . 200317_217867
I thought I was talking . 218496_219666
but I found out later <that I wasn't> [//] that I couldn't talk clearly . 219688_225418
I couldn't say anything . 225433_226983
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling . 227000_229370
and so I don't remember when I started talkin(g) because in my mind I was always talking just [/] just fine . 230368_239668
and <I felt like> [//] &-uh <feel like> [/] you feel like maybe I was &-uh a baby tried to talk . 241113_248113
and I thought everybody should understand me . 248242_249952
but apparently in_fact nobody did . 250000_252170
and &-um that happened for a long that +... 253732_257072
well ‡ in my mind I've always been able to talk right . 257088_263998
now &-um maybe in the last year or so I'm much more aware of the fact that I don't talk plainly . 264139_273839
&-um &+th that [//] that's [/] that's kind_of the &-um the story of my memories <that I> [/] that I have . 276146_287076

well ‡ I <went to> [/] went to a couple of rehab hospitals for awhile for two or three weeks each . 335265_341025
and &-uh then I started remembering . 341813_344013
and I started doing some [/] some therapy of that sort at that time . 344029_348589
&-um I couldn't do much of anything . 349208_352478
&-um I thought I could do more than I really could . 353181_358381

the kid is out kickin(g) the soccer ball . 979943_983003
&-uh yeah he kicks it pretty hard . 984947_990267
goes up [/] &-uh up pretty high . 991522_993302
and it goes pretty far . 994154_995754
and it goes through somebody's window . 995775_998555
and &-uh then <it goes through> [/] it goes through the window . 1001475_1006285
"and the [//] <this guy is> [//] the guy is sitting there <in the> [/] in the chair <as the> [/] <as the> [/] &-uh as the ball comes crashing through the window and hits the lamp , knocks the lamp off and &-uh scares him „ I guess . 1006305_1026944"
and then I'm not sure exactly what happens after that . 1028155_1034244
but yeah there's a hole in the window then . 1034325_1037415
there's a hole in the window . 1037464_1038714
and he [//] the guy is holding the soccer ball looking out the window . 1039362_1044722
&-uh so ‡ not sure what he's gonna do <about the> [/] &-uh about the kid who kicked the soccer ball through the window . 1046315_1058115
that's about it . [+ exc] 1059185_1059895
now [//] yeah . [+ exc] 1061382_1064772
I'm not sure . [+ exc] 1067350_1068360
well ‡ let's see here . [+ exc] 1068379_1069549
yeah it &+w hit the window with the shutters on that . 1071909_1077009
&-um &+th <there's a> [/] there's a problem here because <when the> [/] when the ball comes through the window there's a lamp there . 1077025_1091845
and in [/] in the final picture the [/] the lamp is gone . 1092995_1096295
&-uh yeah <the chair is gone> [//] the chair he was sitting in is gone . 1096995_1102495
&-um and the guy's standing there and next to the window „ I guess . 1103596_1109696
but the chair and the lamp are gone . 1110801_1112671
so ‡ not sure what happened there . 1113058_1115048
okay that's about it . [+ exc] 1117608_1118828
okay . [+ exc] 1137318_1138378
&-um well ‡ the [/] the [/] the [/] the little kid is going off to school . 1138400_1150110
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him . 1150851_1154851
"but he's kinda waving it off saying +""/. 1154873_1157783"
"+"" no I don't need umbrella . 1158133_1159023"
"+"" &-um yeah I'm going off to school . 1160284_1162434"
"+"" I'll be okay . 1162556_1163566"
so ‡ he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye . 1164405_1169085
and &-um he gets out there going on his way to school . 1169138_1175418
and it starts raining . 1175442_1176712
and you can see he's kinda a_little worried there and worry it rains more and more . 1177790_1184430
and &+s now it's [/] &-uh it's a downpour . 1184445_1188275
and it's raining pretty hard . 1189566_1191196
and he's kinda running to get outta the rain . 1191213_1193703
and &-um he ran back home . 1194821_1197861
and &-uh he [/] he did &-uh see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the &-uh umbrella . 1199381_1207811
so ‡ then he &-uh gets the umbrella to go off to school . 1208455_1213175
and he's happy going off to school with his umbrella . 1213199_1216579
okay . [+ exc] 1234927_1235347
well ‡ the story is that &-um this little girl's cat got up in the tree . 1235482_1243042
and the [/] &-uh the dad went up to <get the> [/] get the cat down . 1244361_1250091
and he's got stuck in the tree . 1250106_1251936
and &-uh the [/] the dog is standing there barking up the tree . 1251960_1258640
I don't know if he's barking because he's trying to get that guy down or what . 1258664_1263374
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down . 1263690_1269730
and in the process somehow the ladder +//. 1269751_1273951
maybe the dog hit the ladder . 1274240_1275750
but it [//] &-uh the ladder got knocked down . 1276784_1279064
so ‡ the guy <couldn't get> [//] couldn't climb down the ladder . 1279984_1282344
so ‡ they hadta call a fire department . 1283935_1285785
and they came . 1286068_1287198
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder . 1287215_1291275
and &-uh they're going to &-uh <get the> [/] <get the> [/] get the guy down from the tree . 1292502_1301622
now the cat in the meantime is sittin(g) up in the tree . 1301646_1305746
and &-um I don't know if he's taking a nap or just +... 1305767_1308927
but he doesn't really care . 1310044_1310884
he's not bothering him . 1310907_1311987
&-uh the little girl <probably was> [//] musta been riding her tricycle because it's sitting there . 1313261_1319451
&-uh but she is now tryin(g) to coax the cat down . 1321022_1325162
&-uh there's a bird there in the tree . 1326749_1328839
and he's just kinda singin(g) away and probably &+i is oblivious to everything else that's going on . 1328857_1335217
&-um that's pretty much it . 1335269_1342479
the girl's got pigtails and all of that . 1342530_1344490
so ‡ maybe she's a tomboy or something . 1344562_1347242
I don't know . [+ exc] 1347291_1348451
that's about it . [+ exc] 1350469_1350889

and they weren't very nice to her . 1904754_1906434
they made her do the laundry . 1907129_1908429
&-um obviously in the story here <all the> [/] &-uh all the animals loved Cinderella because <they're all in> [//] they're all around whenever she is . 1908446_1918846
and they [/] they found that they [/] they like her a_lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her thing . 1918868_1931268
&-um so the [/] &-um the [/] &-um the [/] the king has a son . 1932641_1942051
