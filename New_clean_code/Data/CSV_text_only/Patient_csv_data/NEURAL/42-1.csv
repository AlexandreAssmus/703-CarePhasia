<ten years> [//] you_know ten [/] ten years „ right . 11147_13537
I had &-um encephalitis &-um ten years before . 20686_26246
and I hadta remember everything . 26931_27881
so ‡ it's in my head . 27952_29502
but it's how when you get it out_of there „ so . 29552_31322
&-um <I had> [/] &-um I had &-like &-um encephalitis for <it was> [//] about a month . 37920_46750
I don't even remember anything about it . 47283_48723
<but &-um I was in the> [//] but when I remember they got me to start up another time . 49720_55530
&-um <hadta remember> [//] how to remember how I'll talking about abc@k one two three &-um noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff . 55726_64406
just remember how do you rewrite everything . 64509_66169
&-um just taking your time . 66425_67735
but it's still in there . 67754_69774
and you can't just get it on there . 69798_71188
you might talk a_couple times about it . 71206_72746
then you're talking about <the decks [
and then you forgot about that one . 75796_76576
so ‡ it's always kind_of like that . 77066_78686
but you can still do it . 78844_80404
so ‡ I'm still writing and &-um preposition and all that kind of stuff . 80555_88135
just sort o(f) thing you can do . 88184_89004
<just keep> [//] make sure it's still doin(g) than [//] better than it was . 89200_91000
yeah ‡ oh ‡ it's unbelievable „ yeah . 96106_97546
&-um &-um mostly hadta remember how to &-um +//. 110777_115837
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get +... 116829_119949
it's funny how &-uh my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that . 121456_124816
I could go in the kitchen first . 124902_127022
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that . 127071_129651
the name +... 130193_130854
I don't remember anything about it with my head . 131000_132960
I could sit there and making &-um breakfast and stuff like that . 133033_136373
"and she'd say +""/. 136389_136809"
"+"" &-um don't know . 139609_141239"
"she'd put toast and I'd say +""/. 141493_142373"
but eggs +... 144151_145151
"+"" that's right „ okay . 145429_146459"
but it takes time to get everything out_of your head outta there „ so . 146597_148777
&-um a_lot_of it's there . 149189_150949
but most of it's just you can't get it out_of my head on there . 151809_154009
&-um it's hard to come back around everything like that . 154559_157989
and also [//] it's also because when you talk to me doesn't get the same way coming back to me . 159528_163378
&-um and it's also kind_of weird because if you talk to one person and me it kind_of kills me . 164119_170739
but if you have another person here I can understand a_lot better with that . 171322_175912
but it's depends [/] depends on how it's coming on to me yeah . 176730_179570
&-um like I said I hadta remember doin(g) abc@k one two three everything like that . 190519_196759
&-um they took me <at &-um oh> [//] to &-uh &-um books for the first year . 197456_205806
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that . 205828_210118
&-um just trying to get back where it was . 210634_212184
&-um I &+yu just write trying to &+re just getting everything on there . 212294_217834
so ‡ it's [/] &-um it's like that . 218365_221655
it's just hard . 222275_222985
you start getting little things starting through there . 223032_225322
but then I went to &-um +... 225337_226787
I don't know if you go to Chicago . 226952_229492
there's five weeks . 230093_231713
there we got back how to do different things around there . 232011_235301
how you're kind_of think you're on this place I think then maybe a different one . 235354_241874
it's like you had different places you get around there helped around . 241921_244531
but [//] &-um so ‡ it does get out_of there more than you can . 244753_248843
I_mean the first time you're just going straight . 248892_250872
and it's hard to get anything out_of there . 251460_252810
but &-um I don't know . 252898_254438
<is that> [//] did I tell you anything ? [+ exc] 254582_255672
when I was little first time ? [+ exc] 274094_276204
well ‡ it also can be that too for [//] like I said for ten years <it's kind_of> [//] I really hadta remember start everything . 289660_297050
so ‡ I did get a remember . 297589_299059
I did start up another time . 299191_300431
so ‡ it did help . 300536_301226
&-um I_mean &-uh my mom helped me . 301794_305714
and &-um different places they've [//] they help everything about it . 305938_308858
but it is nice to get back up &-um where you can go +... 308920_312090
the bottom +//. 313187_313577
I_mean it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down . 313600_317210
I hadta go up . 318010_318610
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were . 318978_321488
&-um so ‡ it's been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that . 321841_328101
it helps &-um a_lot better . 329107_330617
okay . [+ exc] 358059_358219
the boy was &+out outside <with a> [/] with a soccer ball . 358243_363433
and he was kicking around . 363448_364978
and he kicked one really good . 365896_367026
&-um but it hit right in the middle of the window <on the> [/] on the house there . 367553_371723
&-um so ‡ the next one over there her [
gotta [//] might have been &+s sleeping and jumped out [
and the lamp broke down there too . 388738_390648
&-um but you really can't tell on number four . [+ exc] 391504_395574
&-um it looks like he is not very happy . 502156_506756
(be)cause he got his &-um soccer ball . 506773_510803
&-um but he's still looking out there . 511463_514582
and I think the [/] the boy musta ran away . 514597_516967
he ran away . 517505_518184
so [//] &-uh (be)cause he's still looking to see what he's doing . 518288_520828
okay . [+ exc] 546470_546740
&-um looks like mom told [
and he said well$co he doesn't really want that . 556069_557769
so ‡ &-um he's moving onto the next . 558083_560073
he says no big deal with the [//] <he doesn't> [//] the umbrella . 561313_563953
so ‡ he got outside . 564215_564905
and it rained . 564929_565729
&-um that was on number three . [+ exc] 566649_568269
he's over there rainin(g) on him . 568292_569712
number four . [+  exc] 570054_570684
and it's really rainin(g) him . 570700_571830
he's gotten water all over the place . 571963_573383
&-um number five . [+ exc] 574850_575730
he finally came back . 575749_577049
and [/] and he didn't look that very good . 577848_580518
and <she didn't> [//] she told him it's not very good and probably smarter that he didn't take it . 580620_585760
&-um so ‡ next time he's gonna take the umbrella when it rains . 586653_590903
www . [+ exc]
&-um it looks like her dad . 618627_621767
&-um well ‡ mostly the [/] the girl who's looking to find her cat up on top on the tree . 621785_630515
she wanted to get it there . 630537_632177
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder . 632192_634742
but it fell down . 635479_636769
so ‡ he's stuck up there the whole time . 637260_638500
&-um the dog's kinda barkin(g) at him xxx . 639322_642292
really helpin(g) there . 642690_643390
but &-um the &-um firemen are coming over there . 643492_649192
they've got another ladder . 649582_651082
they're gonna help him back up [
&-um but I don't understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree . 653365_659235
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat . 659257_661627
&-um and the cat gets by itself anyway . 662981_664891
&-um it's just kind_of +... 665547_668247
yeah I don't know . [+ exc] 670285_670735
it's probably about what it is „ I think . [+ exc] 671557_673027
so ‡ I'm ready huh . [+ exc] 963300_963780
okay . [+ exc] 965351_965891
&-um what it was &-um <she has> [//] &-um she's not actually with the [/] the people . 966616_979276
but there's two &-um +... 980901_982421
it's not like they're &-um cousins or something like that . 983593_986823
there's two girls . 986843_988143
and were next by him and their mom . 988190_990730
they're really bad ones and stuff like that or <not very> [//] &-um very [//] not very haɪs@u [
(of)_course she's not <very good> [/] very good to her . 999087_1001307
&-um then she always hadta work outside and do all the [/] the hard things . 1002200_1006830
&-um and they dune [
they've got enough money and doing whatever they could . 1009248_1011978
so ‡ they gave a time that &-um they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the [/] <the money> [//] &+p the +... 1012277_1022977
I'm trying to say something . 1023000_1024230
trying to say all the good people there . [+ cir] 1024819_1026489
they had to go see them . 1026853_1028002
and &-um there's [//] &-uh they got to play and music and stuff like that . 1028179_1035858
&-um so ‡ she would never get to go there . 1036338_1039887
but &-um &+s I forget how . [+ exc] 1040291_1043452
somehow she got in here . 1043534_1044763
but &-um she got to go . 1045243_1047723
&-um say exactly &-um +... [+ exc] 1048862_1052842
it came that she had a very unbelievable great &-um clothes and stuff like +//. 1055904_1062984
they took her so_that one [/] one night where they got to see everyone . 1063160_1067420
&-um and [/] and actually it was the [/] &-um the guy who came to see her . 1068208_1077748
he was probably the best one there . 1079216_1080896
he was very nice and very [//] the best thing he could . 1080912_1084552
&-um and he really liked to see her . 1084875_1086285
but when it was done that time he [
so ‡ he [
and &-um so it was all done . 1092778_1095238
but the next day someone actually brought those to him [
because it was his [
because the only ones that are big enough for him [
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that . 1102998_1105988
so ‡ it didn't work for them . 1106070_1106920
so ‡ it came to him [
they just told him [
so ‡ it came on to him [
it goes to that . 1116576_1117346
I'm not done yet . [+ exc] 1118088_1119538
&-um &=laughs <the guy> [//] he's the [/] the one guy that I saw . 1120379_1125979
the two &-um sing with him and play and stuff like that . 1126165_1132055
that's where he was that night . 1132285_1133255
so ‡ he came back to make sure it was her . 1133335_1134735
so ‡ since it's her he's taken with her . 1135553_1137413
so ‡ it's going to be with her for <all this> [//] all the time and stuff like that &-um as much as it could be for him . 1138705_1144695
that tell you anything ? [+ exc] 1147105_1147805
okay . [+ exc] 1157967_1158217
&-um you should take a bread . 1159609_1163439
&-um get some &-um butter out_of the refrigerator with a knife . 1164869_1171689
&-um put some of those on the bread and also some of the &-um &-um +... 1172589_1179369
they're not peanuts exactly . 1181958_1183068
&+pee close_by the peanuts . [+ cir] 1183084_1186624
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread . 1187225_1189105
so ‡ everything feels pretty good . 1189673_1191763
except for your hand probably gets all over the place . 1192319_1193739
&-um but it's a real easy one . 1194447_1197657
you can do it for about two minutes . 1197778_1198718
and that's a good one to eat <if you> [/] if you you need to get something to eat . 1198772_1201352
