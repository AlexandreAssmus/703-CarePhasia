well ‡ it's doing fairly well except when I get in a hurry &=laughs and try to describe something for someone . 8042_15953
that's where I have more problem with speech than anything „ I think . 17032_19752
is &+des describing something for somebody else to &+he know what I'm trying to &-uh talk about . 21046_29866
especially FirstnameP my wife &=laughs . 30643_32012
"seems like you_know I'm think +""/. 33178_36678"
"+"" she oughta know this . 36996_37926"
and then you_know get the details . 39131_41651
and then sometimes the details don't [/] don't work well . 41666_44956
so +... 45092_45452
all I remember about the stroke is the fact I woke up one morning with a splitting headache . 60043_66413
and it was so bad that &-uh +... 67402_71022
I think it's probably the worst headache I ever had . 71046_74916
&-um took a couple aspirin and went to [//] &-uh outside and picked up <the mail> [//] my [//] <not the mail but> [//] my newspaper . 74968_89698
went back to have breakfast . 90666_93476
and &-uh as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast I tried to read . 94102_100102
and I could not make [//] read the paper properly . 100365_105935
the blocks of words &+ch were just that . 106069_109969
they were blocks . 110075_110685
and <some of it> [//] they weren't &+s all together . 110871_113571
it was like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words not the whole words . 113623_118603
so ‡ I left the newspaper that morning and didn't &-uh read it and finished getting ready and went to work . 119838_127308
and &-uh drove to work . 127962_130262
and on the way to work I &-uh noticed <that on the dashboard of the car> [//] again <parts of that was> [//] I could see parts of the dashboard . 131684_144704
and parts of it I couldn't see . 144750_145900
I couldn't see all the words all that . 145924_148224
but I was able to drive properly . 148280_149920
and &-uh drove to work . 151362_152492
got to work . 153679_154319
and when I <tried to> [//] got to work I tried to log into my computer . 154759_158059
and I didn't know how . 158767_160707
I think that's probably the best thing I can say about that . 161423_164163
I didn't know how to log in . 164289_166029
I didn't know my username . 166122_168082
I didn't know my password . 168106_169426
anything . 170005_170385
and I just had a total blank with that . 171471_173551
so ‡ &-uh I worked at it for a while and couldn't [/] couldn't do anything . 174924_179364
"so ‡ I finally went to my boss and said +""/. 179438_182628"
hey I've got a problem . 182791_183801
"+"" I've got a headache . 184006_184626"
"+"" and &-uh I just can't [/] can't log in . 184740_189060"
and &-uh I was asked [
"+"" just take time . 190670_192260"
"+"" and find a place to rest and relax . 192369_195569"
"+"" and come back in a_little while and try again . 195695_198235"
so ‡ I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again . 198284_204834
and I couldn't make it . 204887_205777
"so ‡ I finally said +""/. 205845_206685"
"+"" I [/] I can't &-uh do it . 207100_209340"
"+"" I need to go home . 209865_210485"
so ‡ I went home and went to bed . 210624_211634
&-uh when I got home I took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and spent most of the day in bed . 213750_220760
and I [/] I slept . 220777_222177
and then when I got up in the afternoon I was able to &-uh read . 223723_230243
I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that . 230265_235455
but it still was problems . 235507_238807
and &-um I do Sudokus the puzzle . 239487_247017
and &-uh I did that on the computer and was able to do it . 247908_255828
it took much much longer than normally to do it the puzzle . 255844_261704
but &-uh I was able to complete that . 263524_265194
and then &-uh had a normal evening and went to bed early . 266369_272719
got up the next day and went to &-uh exercise class with a group that we meet at [//] early in the mornings on Monday Wednesday and Friday . 273644_286644
and this was a Friday morning that +//. 286693_288313
I'd gone to work on Thursday . 290011_291591
couldn't work . 291821_292141
so ‡ then Friday when I got up I went exercise with the group . 292665_298655
and with the group &-uh we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up . 299821_309641
and while we're walking we talk and visit with each_other . 310689_313839
and &-uh when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didn't make sense as far as the [/] the words that I was &-uh speaking . 315033_331363
&-uh the words were correct . 332067_334287
but they were not making sense as complete words . 335869_343279
so ‡ I said [//] knew there was something wrong . 344905_347275
my friends knew there was something wrong . 347299_348539
<so I> [//] when I got through the exercise class +//. 348593_353013
we spent an hour exercising together . 353184_355294
I went home and &-uh had breakfast . 356211_359721
and &-uh I told FirstnameP . 359913_361223
"I said +""/. 361407_361727"
"+"" there's something wrong . 361830_362550"
"+"" I need to [/] to go to the doctor . 362670_364410"
that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor &=laughs . 364513_367673
and she decided that rather_than that we'd take me to the emergency room . 368970_373780
and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke . 374298_378548
and so I spent the next three days +//. 379441_383381
well ‡ there was a problem with my heart . 383560_385030
&-uh my heart was beating too fast and out_of rhythm . 385556_389186
and so they spent most of the time from the next two or three days correcting that issue . 390446_397086
and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia . 397931_407371
and they'd discovered that I'd had a stroke and had aphasia . 409001_412051
so ‡ that's pretty much where I am . 413422_414992
&=laughs well ‡ I tried to . 428327_429377
no ‡ I [//] I really didn't you_know +//. 430216_432136
I just thought I had a headache you_know . 432155_433915
"and &-uh talking with FirstnameP later she said on [/] on the Wednesday the day before I woke up with a headache she said +""/. 434327_445927"
"+"" you had a headache that [/] that day too . 446070_448060"
&-like Wednesday night late I'd &+tol mentioned that I had a headache then . 448731_454381
so ‡ I don't remember <that at all> [//] that part of it . 455034_459524
but it's +... 459661_460211
so +... 462670_463000
yes . 467373_467643
yes I do . 468321_468761
<yeah> [/] yeah . 483166_484716
well ‡ I think the best thing that happened was &-uh I got a great therapist . 498523_503103
and &-uh she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction . 503741_511731
it's finding what &-uh needed to be done . 511754_515063
and then working with me to &-uh &-uh get that . 515312_520162
but basically I went therapy three times a week for several months . 520741_528881
and then dropped down to a couple times a week <and &-uh we> [//] &-uh til finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us were [//] you_know I'd &+al already done all of them . 529513_546213
and &-um reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it . 546631_550341
so ‡ &-uh yeah . 551560_552850
<but &-uh starting> [//] I've got a squirrel running across my &-uh patio &=laughs . [+ exc] 554472_563542
&-uh never_mind . [+ exc] 563845_565615
let go of that one . [+ exc] 567331_568121
&-uh but &-um part of it starting out was &-uh almost like we looked at the pictures <with the> [//] that we saw with all the drawings of different things . 568723_580893
I had the same thing <sitting in a> [//] go in the room . 581555_586235
sit in here . 587129_587789
look around . 588151_588951
and name each object I see in that room and &-uh say it out loud . 589362_595492
you_know I'd tell I can figure . 596386_597666
you_know sometimes [//] you_know you know all these words . 598242_600822
you know all these items . 601369_602899
but you <don't aim> [//] not able to pull those words out . 603664_607414
and the same thing driving down the street . 607998_609898
you look at &-uh say a mailbox . 609917_613717
say [/] say that word out loud . 614539_615959
mailbox . 616039_616539
post &+off &-uh you_know and &-um hedges . 617043_622153
whatever [/] you_know whatever you see make a name . 622588_625238
you_know bring a name for that item . 625285_627465
and it's something that I've kept along with <all the> [//] as long as I've had a [//] &+s aphasia now . 629024_639084
it's [//] you_know when I look at something I'll say the name of that item just to keep [/] keep it going . 639303_648543
and so that's &-uh one of the things I do all the time . 649378_651998
I [/] I don't even think about it a_lot_of the times . 652971_655371
it's just something automatic to do . 655487_656957
okay . [+ exc] 671995_672435
the boy was out playing in the yard kicking a soccer ball . 672983_677493
he kicked the soccer ball a_little too hard in the wrong way . 678453_681803
and it hit a window and broke . 682129_683619
the window [
and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor . 693022_697832
I'm not sure who this person is whether it's his father or neighbor . 698011_702081
and then the &-uh adult was watching out_of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broken his window . 702781_714931
well ‡ at this point we don't see his face . 727087_729147
<and from> [//] (.) I would say he's upset about it . 730725_738635
but I'm not sure how much . 738839_741969
you can't see the expression on the face . 743055_745145
alright . [+ exc] 761817_762357
a mom and the boy . 763817_765997
looks like he's got a backpack on going [//] getting ready to go to school . 766553_769743
but it must be raining outside or look like it's raining . 770151_775661
"and she said +""/. 776098_776478"
"+"" you need to take your umbrella . 776818_778418"
"he said +""/. 778984_779244"
"+"" no ‡ I can go out without it . 779944_780914"
so ‡ he l left home without the umbrella . 782023_785293
and as he was walking to school it started raining . 785315_789575
and &-uh he realized that was getting wet . 791365_796675
so ‡ &-uh ran back . 797129_798829
and &-uh his mom was upset about it . 800451_803011
but he got his umbrella <and went back out to> [//] and went back to school carrying his umbrella . 803027_811077
alright . [+ exc] 826572_826882
at the beginning it looks like the little girl was out in the yard on her tricycle . 826899_836479
the dog was out in the yard . 837269_840019
and the cat was out in the yard . 840035_842285
dog chased the cat up the tree . 844127_846297
and &-uh the little girl got upset then got her father to get the cat out_of the tree . 848215_857275
"he brought the ladder out , climbed the ladder and in the process knocked the ladder down and got stuck in the tree . 858921_866891"
and then they had to call the &+f fire department to &-uh rescue the father and the cat . 866910_874150
so [//] and hopefully that's where everybody got back down on the ground <after the> [//] from the ladder the firemen brought . 875000_888040
okay . [+ exc] 1400737_1401047
alright . [+ exc] 1403154_1403434
Cinderella . 1404429_1405089
story started out when she was a small young girl . 1406963_1409713
and her [//] &-uh apparently her mother died . 1410899_1413049
and her father brought home a stepmother . 1413073_1420883
and &-uh they met &+whe when she was young . 1421875_1425955
and &-um met with her stepsisters as_well . 1427338_1431398
&-uh and as they grew it looked like more and more she was [//] acted as a servant rather than &-uh <a child> [//] or a girl <in the family> [//] as part of the family . 1432647_1453087
she was more of &-uh a &-uh servant . 1453246_1456346
and &-uh so they grew up that way . 1457782_1461232
&-uh and then &-uh over time she &-uh got to know the animals in the home . 1461902_1471222
&-uh horse and the dog and the mice . 1471959_1476369
and &-uh had more of a friends with those than with &-uh the other two people . 1477004_1484364
&-uh and then &-uh as she grew <the &-uh family> [//] or the king in that &+neighbor neighborhood [//] city whatever &-uh had a son that was grown same time . 1485625_1509755
and he decided the son needed to &-uh meet a girl his age and possibly &-um +... 1509801_1520811
don't know what the situation was there . 1523917_1526447
but anyway he decided to &-uh create a ball to bring all of the eligible girls in the &+n kingdom and [/] and &-uh meet them and decide who might &-uh be his &-uh girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it . 1527057_1555977
and so &-uh they sent that invitation out . 1557043_1560753
the &-uh stepmother saw it and planned on taking his [
Cinderella wanted to go as_well . 1572071_1573591
so ‡ she with the help of the &-uh animals <made a> [//] build a [/] a dress for her a gown and &-uh showed it to her stepmother and <the &-uh daught> [//] or the sisters . 1573688_1604808
"and &-uh they <ended up in> [//] damaged it , tore it . 1605953_1611703"
so ‡ she couldn't wear it . 1612525_1613405
and somehow <she got> [//] her godmother found out about it and &-uh helped her get another dress <and &-uh changed> [//] and set the &-uh animals up as a coach and horses and took her to the ball . 1613888_1652148
and while she was at the ball she met the princess [
prince liked her and spent most of the time with her . 1659145_1663185
<the other people were> [//] the girls were jealous . 1663209_1666589
&-uh but they they danced and got along well . 1668821_1672381
but she had to leave at midnight . 1673499_1675019
she [/] &+w she was running out . 1675043_1676863
she lost her [//] one of her slippers as they were leaving . 1677235_1681285
it was too late . 1682008_1682828
so ‡ he sent people out looking for slipper to match the girl . 1683324_1691114
and &-uh eventually they found it at their home . 1692472_1698302
the &-uh stepmothers [//] stepsisters didn't [//] &-uh weren't able to fit it . 1698601_1710131
the mother tried to break the glass slipper . 1710756_1713876
and &-uh they recovered it . 1715267_1717497
and they got [/] got <the princess or> [//] to the Cinderella . 1717521_1722701
she was able to wear it . 1723371_1724311
and she showed them also the other one that she had . 1725339_1728169
so ‡ she had those to prove that she was the person that &-uh actually had the slipper . 1728407_1734457
and &-uh then got together with the prince again and lived happily ever after . 1736141_1743941
&=laughs that's it . [+ exc] 1744633_1745813
get <two pieces of butter or> [//] two pieces of &-uh bread . 1755642_1760932
