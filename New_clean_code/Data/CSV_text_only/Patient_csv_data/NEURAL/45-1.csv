my speech ? 14445_15205
I think it's a_lot better than <what it> [/] what it was . 16043_19193
and I'm hoping that it gets better . 20747_24207
actually I'm hoping <that it> [/] that it gets back to where it was . 26196_28906
yes &-um but to be honest with you I [//] if [/] if [/] if what you're asking is I think that I didn't exactly understand what had all happened you_know . 38191_54021
&-um and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and a_lot of it [
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were [/] were [/] were kind_of funny or weren't making sense . 68526_74806
so ‡ I [/] I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand . 75875_81345
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would &+r remember everything . 82713_93363
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought . 95229_98209
there [//] I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really <upset [//] not upset> [//] sad [/] sad . 101780_113240
<and then> [//] but then +... 115277_116247
anyway sorry . [+ exc] 116801_117381
well ‡ most of the time I've been pretty happy <sorry> [//] because &-um I'm very fortunate that I'm still here and have a &+s second time to be alive and be with people that I [/] I care about . 121156_150206
but it's just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything . 153735_159745
<I was> [/] I was home when it happened . 165187_167977
and &-um I [//] it just really hurt . 168043_172943
for me it was on my left side . 173294_174744
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down . 177735_180515
but right away I could tell something wasn't right . 181414_183604
and &-um then I [//] my wife realized more stuff that was going on . 184837_192807
and she was able to ask me &+ques quite a few questions . 194650_197150
and after a few questions she could realize I wasn't making sense . 197200_202340
so ‡ I guess that's the answer . [+ exc] 204825_206635
&-um sure &-um a_lot . 224734_226834
&-um &-um I'm trying to think where to start . [+ exc] 227103_235103
from the time that I was at the &-um +... 237056_240906
I can't even think what it's called . [+ exc] 241328_242638
where was I at ? [+ exc] 243541_244291
after the stroke happened at first &*CAR
yeah i_c_u and then the +... 249358_251148
did it +..? 251523_251683
where I was for awhile ? [+ exc] 252414_253544
&-um yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me &*CAR
yeah rehab that's the one . 260209_261769
it's hard for me to answer when I can't think how to say it . [+ exc] 262557_264177
rehab . 265478_265928
and they were helping me . 266861_267941
and they [/] they were very kind . 269178_273468
and my wife was wonderful . 273573_274903
and they were just telling me things that gave [//] &+g &+i &+i me [//] it gave me a_lot_of hope that they realized <I was pretty much> [//] I was a_little weak . 274947_285387
but I was physically able to walk around and do a_lot . 285520_289420
and that [//] remember I told yesterday I could remember a_lot_of like well [//] &-uh &-um how to play a guitar and &-um kind_of singing . 289559_301349
although I guess you would know how this stuff means . 301752_305802
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was . 305910_312620
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something . 312769_318009
but that gave me a_lot_of hope . 318051_320181
and then &-um I got back home . 320729_322709
and I've worked with a whole lot of things . 323701_325471
I'll show you one of them . 326024_327004
xxx .
here it is . 330383_330763
one of these things &=ges
so ‡ not every day but for a_lot_of days I just go back . 335903_339423
and I look at this . 339584_340774
and I started going backwards &+i just &-uh to try to read it . 340846_343096
you_know dog and cat . 343962_345932
so ‡ &+th there's a whole bunch of these things that they had . 347352_350332
and then &-uh some of those in the other room that I can't always get a hold of but I [/] I managed to get a hold of these . 351378_357998
<I usually> [//] I can usually get them . 358543_359883
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something . [+ es] 360769_367619
and when I started playing +... 370080_373110
is it okay &+i if I keep blabbing for a minute ? 374658_376548
<this is actually> [//] I guess my wife can tell me I [/] I kinda blab . 378975_384085
so ‡ &-uh I don't mean to be that way . 384205_387135
but &-um &-um you_know &+sh I guess she realized soon . 387763_397543
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing . 397587_405807
and &-um after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with &-um older people . 406584_419834
and then it made me think more about that after &+so somethin(g) I was going through . 421003_424933
and &-uh I really wanted to [/] to just sing . 426009_428449
I [/] I [/] I realized that I missed that . 428492_431072
so ‡ we were talking about me doing that . 431184_433494
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened . [+ gram] 434193_443773
&-um somehow one of them got [/] got missed . 444762_447372
and so it was about a month <I guess> [//] later . 448160_451530
&-um yeah [/] yeah July . 452413_456283
one [//] &-uh well ‡ I'm forgot to say it . [+ exc] 457867_459387
&-uh &+w bottom line is one of them called not long before . 459734_467404
oh_my_gosh you_know &+w we didn't tell him [//] [* s
"and so I still said +""/. 473004_474824"
"+"" yeah I want to try it . 474946_476246"
so ‡ I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs . 476476_484166
and I [/] I did it . 484304_485264
and I was nervous . 485625_486305
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to [/] to start doing it again . 486528_490638
and I did a whole lot of shows again . 491154_492864
and I think that really helped me (be)cause it [/] it started &+r remembering and a_lot_of that . 493841_499891
so ‡ I guess that's the answer to a_lot_of it . [+ exc] 500886_507283
yeah and I was feeling so good . 517556_520706
I [/] &+m I musta done a hundred shows at least . 520832_525142
she could tell you . 525268_525848
there was a ton of them I did . 525900_527210
and &-uh pretty much not having any problems . 528271_531531
&-um but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing . 532416_539786
and I was singing all not making sense . 539830_543180
and that just destroyed me . 543840_545370
I_mean <I just> [//] that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I [/] I was back . 546358_553338
and then that happened and the next thing I knew we're going to the hospital . 554265_556935
and I just couldn't believe it . 556970_558730
"<I just> [/] I just said +""/. 559209_561199"
"+"" oh_my_god no . 561490_562460"
and <that was> [/] that was probably the worst . 563478_565748
&-um but then came back around again . 567238_569998
so ‡ I was doing better again . 570490_572270
and then all_of_a_sudden Covid came in . 573439_575829
so ‡ since it's been so many weird things in my life because_of just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything . 577693_592173
and then that's come along . 592212_593652
and it's just every [//] we're all going through that . 594469_597669
kind_of figure out what's [/] &+h what's all gonna happen . 598598_602358
and how are people and etcetera and +... 602393_604183
so ‡ yeah it's been really really crazy . 604948_606898
oh_my_gosh so many +... [+ exc] 627716_630996
I don't know where to start with that . [+ exc] 631578_632958
I [/] I can only tell just [/] just the one „ huh ? [+ exc] 633072_634912
well ‡ I would talk about my wife and I gettin(g) [/] gettin(g) [/] gettin(g) married . 639414_643994
&-um I guess that's pretty obvious that I would say that . 645039_650629
&-um gosh I_mean I'm trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more . [+ exc] 651666_666106
&-um <I got> [//] I forgot a little what you asked me . [+ exc] 668370_677880
but this might be part of it too . [+ exc] 677896_680106
&-um we got to go to where we useta go every year . 681428_687658
up [//] to up north from us which is up &+b by Wisconsin . 688845_693015
&-um FirstnameT my wife +//. 694369_697259
you_know <I wasn't able to actually> [//] I used to always be the one that kind_of was the &-like main &-like &-uh driver . 698202_705832
and so of_course she [//] you_know I knew that <I couldn't> [//] we weren't going to do that especially with our kids with me driving . 707236_716686
so ‡ she [/] she did . 716770_718240
but going there again was a really wonderful time . 718336_726526
it really &-uh reminded me of a_lot of places . 727893_732013
(be)cause we [/] we usually would go in the same places . 732051_734211
and &-uh so that sort_of is a long thinking about +... 735637_738457
I just felt kind_of +... 739386_740296
we [/] we married there . 740984_742104
so ‡ I guess I don't know . [+ exc] 742151_743021
I don't think I'm really answering what you asked me . [+ exc] 743590_745280
just like happy times of just one happy time ? [+ exc] 747245_750865
yes <I would> [/] &-uh I would &-uh love to . [+ exc] 763071_765571
&-um well ‡ first of all we're just friends . 766443_775833
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church . 775970_781190
and I was really interested in her . 782004_785594
but I took a long time . 787078_789398
&-um and finally I mentioned about if we could &+g go out . 791044_798474
and she said yes which is wonderful . 798517_800617
we went out . 801463_801933
one of the happiest +... 803001_803961
the [/] that first date was just amazing . 805168_808308
I felt like I was this younger &+g person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of +... 809533_819033
and we just went out to see a movie . 819532_821842
and then we just talked for a long time . 821877_824197
and I told her good night and drove home . 824573_827093
and that was incredible . 827134_828504
and so we started going out . 829499_831239
and when we got married it was such a happy time . 832462_834772
&-um I remember <I went> [//] &+t &+t &+t it didn't right away go +... 835732_843842
&+be before we got married that last night for [
but I did . 851570_852470
and I woke up . 852508_853948
and I was really happy . 854073_855063
and &-uh I &-uh was looking fairly forward to it . 856238_862648
felt a_lot_of peace . 863920_864910
and so &-um we had a pretty special wedding that we had done . 866211_870491
and &-um the way we did it was that you_know I didn't get to see her how she was looking when &+h she walked out . 871515_886775
and I was standing way back . 887643_889793
and I saw her coming . 889981_890871
sorry . [+ exc] 895602_895982
it's &+no nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda . 899440_902000
but I cried (be)cause she was coming &+w &+w &+w &+wsorry [//] with her dad . 902043_910193
and &-uh that was amazing . 911220_916190
and &-uh we had &-uh &-uh a fantastic &-uh &+w wedding there . 917665_924045
and &-uh anyway the whole time it was happy . 925147_929577
I don't know why I cried „ sorry . 929613_930623
I think I might have thought of &+c (be)cause_of <FirstnameT's [/] FirstnameT's &-like> [/] FirstnameT's &-like &-uh mom who [/] who had passed away a year and a half ago . 930663_943003
so ‡ I think that kinda got me . 943108_944428
but everything else &+w was [/] was really happy . 947073_948943
oh_boy . [+ exc] 966132_967092
well ‡ in this case <it's a> [/] <it's a> [/] it's a guy a young &+bo boy . 968514_973854
and he's got a &-uh +... 974879_977719
oh what do you call those things . [+ exc] 978495_979805
things that you +... 979840_980590
see now I get stuck on +//. [+ exc] 982895_983845
I [/] I [/] &+n I owe [
totally I can't think what that's called . [+ exc] 985650_986860
&-uh bouncing go +... [+ cir] 987693_990673
oh_no . [+ exc] 991520_992370
&-uh &-uh I [//] I'll get that . [+ exc] 994140_1000560
do I have much time (be)cause [/] (be)cause I can think of that ? [+ exc] 1001014_1003204
is there a timing on it ? [+ exc] 1003542_1004222
okay ‡ I hope that's okay and that's doesn't drive you crazy . [+ exc] 1007760_1010380
"you're like +""/. [+ exc] 1010396_1010586"
"+"" okay come_on „ FirstnameJ . [+ exc] 1010661_1011541"
&-uh I've got this . [+ exc] 1012441_1013601
it's [//] &-um oh what do you call that ? [+ exc] 1013809_1021309
mom [//] the moms go with +... 1032336_1036935
oh ‡ I'm stuck on something really obvious . [+ exc] 1037223_1040654
but anyway <he's gonna> [//] he's taking it and &-um using his foot . 1040853_1050473
and as he does hits it a_little too hard into the &+r <I guess> [//] the right . 1052013_1060103
and it's going right toward a person's house . 1061310_1064800
and oops looks like in number three you can see that it [/] it actually broke there . 1066330_1072110
and there's this person's probably somebody's dad just sittin(g) there . [+ gram] 1073692_1077772
it looks like he mighta been reading or something . 1079723_1081373
I'm [/] I'm not sure about that . 1081490_1082620
&-like oh_my_gosh got a_little startled . 1083281_1084811
now he's looking down at the fourth one . 1085626_1088496
and he can look back there and see what happened . 1089625_1092545
and then probably can see behind &+wh who that probably was I would assume back there . 1092589_1097229
so ‡ that's my answer to that question . [+ exc] 1098395_1100315
okay . [+ exc] 1123174_1123564
<on the first one xxx> [//] on the first one &-uh there is &-uh a person . 1124896_1135596

and &-uh yes <which is like> [//] &-um sorry [//] which is like &-um &-um mother . 1140559_1149039
and it looks like to me like she is tellin(g) him that he should take a &-um +... 1150362_1158922
&-uh it's going to be the hard when we hadta think what that's called . [+ exc] 1159164_1161024
&-uh to &+k not get wet . [+ cir] 1164487_1169847
&-um like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain . 1177095_1183145
stuck on what that's called . [+ exc] 1184666_1185686
but I know what it is . [+ exc] 1185723_1186713

<and the> [//] though the [/] the second one it looks <like he's> [//] oh like she's +//. 1193032_1198712

"+"" you're not gonna leave ? 1204827_1205507"
and then the third one he's now outside . 1206439_1209229
and boy$co guess what happened . 1209266_1210956
now it's [/] it's [//] he's getting soaked . 1210977_1212767
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house . 1213691_1217821
yes and she does look a little bit upset . 1218598_1220698
"and he's looking kind_of like +""/. 1221273_1222383"

that's pretty much what I have . [+ exc] 1240272_1241522

okay . [+ exc] 2230349_2230779
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella . [+ exc] 2232718_2236278
"but &-um Cinderella starts with &-uh she was [//] had a wonderful mom &+a and also dad , father and mother . 2237258_2252318"
and they were loving and [/] and kind . 2253629_2258549
and she was too . 2259883_2260793
and &-um something happened which a_lot [/] lot of [
and that was her [/] &-um her [/] sorry [//] her &-like mother . 2273505_2278525
so ‡ &+h <her dad> [//] her father &-um met this other woman and decided to [//] &-uh he'd like to &+m &+m have &+h him and her get married . 2279735_2295925
"and &-uh as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go +""/. 2297287_2306137"
"+"" oh_no don't be marrying this particular person . 2306447_2309217"
but he did . 2309257_2310257
and that person had <a couple> [/] &-uh <a couple like> [/] sorry [//] a_couple &-like daughters that she owned . 2311021_2324201
and it's showing that they're all very very mean not only to [/] to Cinderella but even to themself [
<they just> [//] <they're just very> [//] all they think about is &-uh themself [
and the [/] &+m the mother is just interested in trying to make a_lot_of money when she gets married . 2341048_2351818
so ‡ they realize that Cinderella <is just> [//] is a very beautiful person . 2352033_2359763
I_mean she's [/] <she's very> [/] she's very pretty and beautiful . 2360873_2364353
but she's [//] inside she's just a really sweet person who [/] who cares about people . 2364394_2371364
<so the> [//] &-uh &+s oh ‡ I think it's called stepmother . 2373035_2377745
I think that's what it's called . [+ exc] 2377864_2379084
&-um realizes <they need to> [//] she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters . [+ gram] 2379939_2390019
and so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that she's [* m
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy &-um at least for the most part and just doing a_lot_of lovely things in taking care of them . [+ gram] 2418582_2435462
and so around that time the [/] &-uh &+p the prince +... 2436454_2446684
&-uh let me see . [+ exc] 2448418_2449948
his dad +... 2450000_2450950
I can't think of what that's called . [+ exc] 2450999_2452079
&-um wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all . 2453237_2464547
who would be &-uh just a lovely &-like a girl [
and so they have [/] have <this &-like> [/] this &-like ball . 2471445_2477835
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that &-um Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that you_know . 2479102_2488402
but they showed that the other two stepmothers [
and that their mom . [+ gram] 2494244_2496104
and they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen . 2497510_2502590
woo this is hard . [+ exc] 2502634_2504584
"but the &-um mom realizes +""/. 2504982_2507982"
"+"" uhoh better not have with Cinderella (be)cause it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen . 2508242_2519602"
so ‡ Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready . 2520714_2524984
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little &-uh animals horse even helping her (be)cause everything loved her (be)cause she was so wonderful . [+ gram] 2526367_2541837
so ‡ they <made is> [//] made her beautiful thing . [+ gram] 2542734_2545214
but then the stepmother got where she [/] she [/] she couldn't go . 2545279_2551669
and so then Cinderella was really crying . 2552773_2556293
as I remember that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken . 2557426_2565016
and you_know how could they not even let me do anything . 2565057_2569177
and then there's &+s fairy godmother person pops out_of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be &-uh driven . [+ cir] [+ gram] 2569253_2588553
she gets there . 2590161_2591231
and she can dance . 2593483_2595113
and he sees her and wants to dance with her . 2596605_2601605
and &-uh he's captivated by her . 2603069_2607559
and &-um all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes oh_no it's <by this> [//] &+i midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back . [+ gram] 2608541_2619601
so ‡ Cinderella gets home . 2620825_2621835
and she's still kinda happy . 2621856_2623046
&-um <which is> [//] I thought that was always amazing . 2624711_2627081
"<she was still> [//] she just happy &+a and so honest about +""/. [+ gram] 2627170_2633740"
"+"" wow I got to actually do something like that . 2634276_2636026"
and she thinks that's the end that would ever be . 2636050_2638870
but she was still happy . 2638912_2640242
"and so then with the prince he is like +""/. 2641211_2648671"
"+"" I hafta find out who [/] who [/] <who that> [/] who that was . 2650085_2653385"
which I [/] I wouldn't really blame him . 2655002_2656242
of_course he's gonna wanna meet her . 2656277_2658637
and <goes he wants to> [//] he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her . 2658678_2667338
so ‡ &-um he <hasta go> [//] has a <decree I guess that popped in> [//] decree to every single unmarried person . 2667603_2681183
<hasta be> [//] &-uh figure out who that was because +... 2682180_2686540
oh ‡ yeah ‡ I forgot when [/] when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things . [+ es] 2688309_2694079

&-uh so ‡ they know that if they can go to each person they'll find out <who that was> [//] &+h who that fits . 2702143_2712133
so ‡ &+th they go . 2712817_2713817
and at the end Cinderella [//] it's obvious that she's the [/] the correct one . 2714007_2717987
so ‡ they get married . 2718786_2721726
