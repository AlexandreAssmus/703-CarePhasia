&-um most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well . 10029_15839
but it &+s seems like when I get in a situation where I'm in a hurry is more &-uh when <my speech or my> [//] I lose some of the [/] the words that I want . 15921_29661
and I found that the [//] going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know I'm hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my [/] my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it . 30269_56979
so ‡ that's what I do for you_know my help . 57000_63180
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache . 71864_78894
&*INV
"&-uh I normally in the morning go out get the paper , have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work . 81331_92521"
and &-um I went out and got the paper . 94317_97067
I still had a splitting headache . 97410_98640
"I took a couple of aspirin , came in and &-uh had a bowl of cereal for breakfast . 98767_106837"
and &-uh while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper . 107746_111956
and I opened it up . 112558_113728
and I could not read what was on the newspaper . 113859_117339
I couldn't see a whole paragraph . 117358_119888
and blocks of characters were missing altogether . 120380_123610
so ‡ that's the first thing . 124591_125401
so ‡ <I just> [//] I set the &-uh paper aside and said . 125446_129795
"+"" okay ‡ I'll read it when I get home . 130039_131400"
and &-um got dressed and went to work . 132755_134755
I &+w droving [
and &-um what I was seeing on the highway again on the &-uh dashboard of the car I couldn't see all of the &+inf &+ins instrumentation on the dash . 144407_157597
but I was able to drive fine and go to work . 158922_161662
&-uh no problem at all there . 162380_163780
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office . 164162_168132
and I couldn't remember my login . 168604_170234
didn't know how to log in . 171890_173370
and &-uh I still had the headache . 175136_176806
I &-uh talked to my boss and [/] and told her what was going on . 177900_181940
"she said +""/. 183480_183730"
"+"" just take it easy for awhile and see if you can later . 184056_188356"
"remember , I took probably <a half hour> [//] forty five minutes and still couldn't . 188742_192202"
"so ‡ I said +""/. 192328_192598"
"+"" I [/] I just can't do it . 192788_194718"
"+"" I'm going to go home . 195040_196320"
"I came home , took a_couple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day . 196570_203790"
that was on a Thursday . 205508_206758
on Friday morning I got up . 208666_210796
and <I exercise on Friday> [//] Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning . 211545_217885
so ‡ I went to exercise class . 217971_219641
and &-um I exercised . 220841_224251
but when I was with the group I was talking . 224811_227051
and what I was saying wasn't making sense to me . 227719_230289
wasn't making sense to any of my friends . 230306_232256
you_know they [//] the words were correct . 232306_236466
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words . 237394_241094
they didn't fit whiff [
"and so I said +""/. 244377_244887"
"+"" there's something wrong there . 245050_246030"
so ‡ I came back home and &-uh had breakfast when I got back from &-uh exercise . 246109_257168
and then I normally would go to work . 257577_260096
but I couldn't go to work . 260113_261024
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to &-uh see my doctor . 261041_268561
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a [//] &+hear heart [//] &+col the &+oncolo &-uh heart doctor . 269678_281428
and she &+s talked me instead to go to the emergency room . 282573_285713
went to the emergency room . 285900_286800
and they discovered that I'd had a stroke . 286824_288724
and so they put me in the hospital . 289595_291065
and &-uh I was there three days . 292649_297409
<they were trying> [//] basically my heart was out_of rhythm and &-uh was beating too fast and lots_of different things . 297427_309547
so ‡ they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized . 309596_316316
and then three more days basically discovering that &-uh I'd had &-uh a stroke and aphasia . 316525_325225
<and &-um then I was> [//] <went home after the> [//] trying to think what day of the week it was . [+ exc] 326225_336755
Wednesday [/] Wednesday I went home . 337188_338918
and &-uh Thursday I <drove back to the> [//] drove then (be)cause I could drive . 341345_349375
I could &+s everything [//] do everything I needed to do except talk &=laughs . 349654_353724
so ‡ I went to make a appointment with the &-uh &-uh speech therapy at that point . 354862_361382
and that's where it started . 362669_364019
well ‡ it started out with something simple because basically I could look at [/] at anything and know what it was . 376255_382415
but I couldn't pull the words out . 382463_384283
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example . 384603_387803
looking around the room . 388221_389291
looking at each object in the room . 389433_391003
naming it . 392239_392879
trying to find the [/] the word and say the word out loud . 393093_396453
you_know so ‡ that's where it first started . 397249_399739
and it built from there . 399784_401644
you_know just [//] and some of the things we &+sa looked at just a few minutes ago you_know like with the pictures . 402366_408836
you_know look at the picture . 409568_410528
name the picture . 410546_411226
and over time that gradually got better and better . 411971_417911
but &-uh that's where I think the start with the therapy was . 418668_424288
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out . 424702_430682
and I found when <writing I> [//] taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldn't spell properly anymore . 432034_442044
and you_know that was something I had to work at . 442892_445402
so ‡ I found that with my &-uh keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil . 446154_453144
and with a notebood [
it [/] it has a spellchecker and a [//] &+spell +//. 459122_462382
&-uh not [//] I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily . [+ exc] 463156_466756
a checker . 466771_467381
<but it starts out> [//] you_know if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work . 467435_478085
so ‡ that sometimes helped a_lot as_well writing . 478417_481617
so ‡ &-uh I've done a_lot_of that . 483336_485176
but it's mainly &-uh &-uh working with <seeing what &+uf> [//] seeing the words and then saying it out loud . 485541_495361
that's done more I think better than anything else . 495689_498679
and I worked hard at it for a long time . 498700_502340
and then <I took [//] got kind_of> [//] &+st afterwards I've kinda gotten a_little slow about it . 502360_509620
or not slow but just haven't done it as diligently as I used to . 509637_517527
but &-uh for the first months after the stroke <I was> [//] I worked hard at it . 518941_528341
trying to pull those pictures back . 528513_530313
and I found that you [//] it's [/] it's like learning in school again grade school . 530417_539027
you look at a word . 539042_540562
and you learn that word . 540585_541515
and [/] and oh that's that word . 541530_544350
and it comes back and stays back . 544366_545686
but with aphasia it doesn't stay there . 545738_547458
it's [/] it's more like having &-uh an electronic dictionary that is [//] occasionally gets scrambled . 548607_556667
"you_know it's like +""/. 557915_558695"
"+"" okay ‡ I know that word . 559039_559999"
"+"" it's not in the dictionary where it should be . 561350_563520"
"+"" it's over there instead . 563810_565550"
you_know that type of thing . 566315_567495
so +... 567627_567947
happy ? 585317_585837
I think when my grandson was born . 587031_588951
he was a joy to be around . 590364_592664
and &-uh I got to spend a_lot_of time with him when he was little and an infant . 593566_599686
and &-uh watching him grow . 600959_603329
and just [//] that was special . 604249_608809
he's ten now . 609741_610491
and he's doesn't spend as much crime [
and he's off doing other things . 619558_620978
so +... 621000_621440
www .

okay . [+ exc] 665623_666033
boy's out kicking a soccer ball . 666533_668053
kicked it . 669597_670067
got a_little too close . 670645_671825
kicked it through the window . 672153_674113
I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad . 675111_677431
but the window [* s
<and a> [//] &-uh I'd say his dad saw it . 683553_691653
opened looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball . 691899_696849
okay . [+ exc] 713059_713449
in the beginning the mom sent little boy out to go to school . 714348_722998
she [
and he didn't want to take his umbrella . 725074_726854
"so ‡ he said +""/. 726997_727147"
"+"" I'll be fine without it „ mom . 727490_728650"
<and he went out> [/] and he went out . 729085_731635
and the rain started raining . 732260_733490
and so he ran back to the house . 734804_737604
and his mom was upset with him and [//] &+hu for going out without the umbrella . 737795_746275
and so he got a &+r umbrella . 746569_748099
and went back out with an umbrella the next time . 748354_750914
alright . [+ exc] 763749_764449
well ‡ it looks like the beginning the little girl was riding her bicycle [//] or tricycle . 764857_771317
and the dog or [
and the dog chased the cat up the tree . 776792_779402
"and so she called back to her dad and said +""/. 780538_783748"
"+"" the cat's stuck in the tree . 784312_785622"
and he got out a ladder . 786853_788683
went out to climb up to get the cat down . 789863_792493
and the ladder fell . 793797_795437
and so they hadta call the fire to help him and the cat get down the tree . 796659_802339
so ‡ that's pretty much the story . [+ exc] 803515_804705
alright . [+ exc] 1313103_1313483
Cinderella . 1316755_1317845
well ‡ originally apparently her mother died . 1318047_1321847
and &-um &+sh her and her family were comfortably well-off . 1323007_1329377
and &-uh that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters as_well that moved in with her . 1330601_1342691
and they were not very friendly with her . 1343815_1345585
<and over time> [//] her father must be out_of the picture for some reason because she [//] <the change of the> [//] Cinderella and the family changed dramatically . 1346573_1362223
and she became more of a slave than a [/] &+s a sister and the girl and the mother . 1362768_1372548
and &-uh things got worse and worse as she got older . 1374109_1377049
and &-uh one point in time she got acquainted +//. 1378875_1389835
or how do I say it ? [+ exc] 1389972_1393352
she &-uh learned to live with the animals <in the home> [//] <in the family or> [//] in the house and &-uh outside the home as_well . 1394555_1406145
and &-uh they became her friends instead of &-uh her &+s stepsisters . 1407881_1413441
and &-uh that developed over time . 1415374_1420004
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his [//] the princess [
so ‡ he [//] they planned on a &-uh ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the [/] the kingdom . 1441015_1451535
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave [//] not take sepmother [
and &-uh Cinderella had a gown somewhere „ I think . 1463015_1470115
from the looks of the one picture like it was in <a closet or not a closet but> [//] a trunk someplace . 1470913_1480343
and she got it out . 1480654_1481584
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters . 1482298_1491488
and they ended up tearing it up . 1491535_1495095
and she didn't have anything . 1495548_1496478
and then &-uh the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to &-uh redo her dress . 1496527_1510117
her stairy [
there we go . [+ exc] 1523610_1524150
I got a word &=laughs . [+ exc] 1524260_1525080
fairy godmother stepped in as_well . 1526399_1528279
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into &-uh horses . 1528575_1546195
and &-uh &+s anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball . 1546738_1554608
and &-uh stepmother [//] the [/] the prince fell in love with &-uh Cinderella . 1556463_1563163
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening . 1563184_1573614
and they [//] &-uh Cinderella hadta [/] hadta leave at midnight . 1573629_1579919
and as she was leaving <she left her> [//] one slipper got left behind . 1579971_1586751
and &-uh they couldn't find her . 1588350_1590560
they had to looked all over <for Cinderella or> [//] for the girl . 1591284_1594314
and they couldn't find her until they finally came to her home . 1595234_1599214
and &-uh her <stepmothers couldn't> [//] stepsisters couldn't fit the slipper . 1601174_1614194
but Cinderella could . 1614626_1615646
so ‡ that's where they ended it . 1616638_1619898
oh that's easy . [+ exc] 1629225_1630065
get two pieces of bread . 1631099_1631939
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife . 1631961_1641821
&-um put the peanut butter on one side of the bread . 1643421_1648081
jelly on the other . 1649797_1650577
put (th)em together . 1650593_1651263
