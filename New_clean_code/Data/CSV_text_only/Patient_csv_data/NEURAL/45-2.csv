<well for the most part or [/] or> [//] I guess I'd hafta say &+m most of the time I think it's doing a_lot better than it [/] it [/] it had done . 12295_24155
and [/] and we're talking of_course &+a after my stroke „ right ? 24675_27675
&*INV
hopefully I wouldn't have +//. 30570_31360
yeah ‡ so ‡ I think I [//] I'm doing better . 31432_33492
have a way I hafta &-like go . 34903_36583
but I think I'm doing better . 37508_40038
I've been trying really hard to think . 41970_43660
and [/] and I don't mean to keep blabbing . 43742_47052
I'm sorry but +/. [+ exc] 47068_47648
I'm just talking . 49859_50559
earlier &-um <I think it was> [//] yeah this morning I was telling somebody here my wife or my kids or something about how sometimes I feel like a person that's just not born but whatever . 51449_67769
what I mean is there's things I've just forgotten all about . 68205_71895
we [/] we got to eat a couple of things and I just forgot . 72426_75466
oh I forgot what that even is . 75871_77181
and so in a way that's kind_of exciting . 78144_82584
"but then you feel like +""/. 82608_83568"
"+"" oh_my_god what's happened to me that I couldn't remember xxx ? 83757_85927"
<so but> [//] yeah but overall better [/] better hopefully . 86729_89729
I'm hoping . 89776_90306
yes . 95991_96441
absolutely . [+ exc] 100892_101742
&-um no ‡ I [/] I probably feel like I blabbed too much about that last time . [+ exc] 102435_110255
so ‡ it +//. 110552_110932
I had come home . 114775_115885
and &-uh it wasn't very late in the day . 117328_120598
I think it was maybe twelve or one o'clock „ I think . 120622_123792
and &-uh I had &-uh decided to look outside to see if we got any [//] &-um yeah <any &-like> [//] <I'm sorry> [//] <any &-like> [//] &-um &-uh any [//] <I'm sorry> [//] any mail . 124871_141251
and &-um I walked back in the house and said hi and gave them the mail „ I think . 142181_150921
and anyway I &-um just started feeling really weird . 150975_155025
and I can't even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it . 155907_159877
but I &-uh decided I wanted to just to sit down <with our> [//] with my &-like bedroom . 160762_172022
and I did . 173044_173694
and right away it just started getting worse . 175093_177013
and it really hurt . 178127_181207
and for me it was you_know my left side „ I guess . 181850_185960
but it was probably other ones . 186099_188179
but I think I felt more here . 188203_189533
and &-um something [//] I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really [//] very very different and strange . 190554_205704
and something was [/] was kind_of scary . 205725_209045
and &-um she started talking with me . 210011_215721
<and realized> [//] she asked me a few questions . 216785_218815
and &-um she could tell after several things she'd asked me that I wasn't making enough sense . 220290_231570
and then I started feeling almost sick . 232731_234821
and she got me a thing in case I did . 235624_237294
and I did getting sick . [+ gram] 237382_238582
and she right away knew to get me to &-uh a [/] a hospital . 238667_246997
<and &-uh I think that> [//] well ‡ my wife and my kids knew [//] they probably figured some things out (be)cause with [//] &-um my wife's mom had passed away &-uh about &+s six months or something I guess it was before that . [+ gram] 249089_274169
I think that's about right . 274451_275491
<and I think> [//] last thing I'm saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on (be)cause I remembered what had happened with her a little bit . 276728_289818
and &-um so I was thinking about that and praying about that . 290783_298693
and that's the last thing I can tell you . 298793_302243
we were going to the hospital . 302613_303703
and <I was trying> [//] she was asking me a_lot_of questions as she was driving . 303726_308116
and I was doing the best I could . 309350_311720
but I [/] I couldn't really explain very well . 311740_314090
so ‡ it was a pretty &-uh whew wow pretty intense thing that happened . 316071_324721
that is a fantastic question . [+ exc] 341375_342815
&-um and if you asked my that before I'm not even thinking of that . [+ exc] 344312_348552
so ‡ I'm just saying that's a really excellent question . [+ exc] 348688_351088
&-um well ‡ my wife and my kids came from church . 351928_361908
friends had been all so wonderful . 362790_366000
and especially as a wife and kids they &-um asked me a_lot_of questions . 366857_376137
and part of the whole thing <I don't know how to say it> [//] &-um is they've had to figure out what I'm trying to say . 376248_386218
and &-uh they've been very patient about this when I get stuck on something . 387470_393320
and every now and then I get a little bit upset . 393396_396226
but not upset like crazy scary somethin(g) . 396278_404328
&+y <I just> [/] I just get frustrated because I know what I'm trying to say but I can't think how to say it . 404892_410282
but anyway <so they've> [//] &-um also [/] also with them I should have said &-um my sister . 411254_420294
my sister is always [/] always one of my best friends . 421740_426170
she's a couple years younger than me . 427336_429316
and [/] &+a and her husband too . [+ gram] 430312_433952
&-um they've all gotten back . 434050_438730
and they showed me a_lot_of photos and remembrances you_know . 438925_444405
things that I remember . 445263_446423
and sɛn@u [
I don't have it here . 450885_451435
but &-like they'd gaven [
&-like if it says &-like &-uh &-um dog@q a picture of a dog . 455770_460670
they give me tons of those . 461441_462691
but my wife's is the main one . 463237_466337
she's helped me out so much . 466399_468559
and like I say they've had to guess what I'm trying to say . 469803_475003
"or &-like I'll say +""/. 475087_476397"
"+"" oh it's like this . 476565_477105"
and then they're all trying to &+ge &=imit
and then finally someone (wi)ll figure . 479304_480884
"I'll say +""/. 480900_481010"
"+"" yeah that's it . 481190_482040"
that [//] that's it . 482332_483062
"you_know but it's getting to the point where &-um hopefully as I'm getting better I hope &-um they'll sometimes say +""/. 483528_495468"
"+"" you_know FirstnameJ now &+y &+y &+y you know <what that> [/] what that [/] that [/] that means . 497303_504293"
"+"" so ‡ you just keep trying . 504422_505552"
you_know ‡ so ‡ that's been a_lot_of [/] a_lot_of it . 506451_509961
and then I think also <with me> [/] with me playing music &-um my wife's realized that so much of that seems to have come back which is amazing (be)cause for a long time I didn't do music for a long time in my life . 510796_529196
I started again awhile back . 529835_531195
but stuff's back there from when I was a kid . 531213_534333
it's just back you_know . 534353_536223
oh ‡ and one more thing . 536916_537726
we really love certain tv shows and &-um sometimes movies . 538302_545932
and a_lot_of those have [/] have helped me too . 546930_549020
there's certain ones that we just really like . 549779_552769
that I don't know it just helps me you_know with anyway . 553107_557787
so ‡ that helps at all . 557835_559755
so ‡ &-uh it was (g)onna get something else but I can't think what to say . [+ exc] 560870_564390
&-um &-um sorry ‡ I'm stuck on what the name of the show is . [+ exc] 567559_574609
I guess that [//] that's probably not very &+im important „ sorry . [+ exc] 575530_578310
we [//] <I liked> [//] I watch a_lot_of older shows . 579600_582310
and some of those are just great . 583247_585457
they're just great . 585569_586329
anyway ‡ so ‡ that's what I've got . [+ exc] 587292_589292
cool ‡ yeah ‡ there are just certain ones . [+ exc] 609979_612859
<and some of the especially> [//] I'm not trying to &-uh say anything whatever bad about newer shows (be)cause there's certainly some good new ones I'm sure . [+ exc] 612994_624264
but some of those older ones are just [/] just so great . [+ exc] 624281_627161
sometimes they're so &+th well thought out or just so funny . [+ exc] 627954_631674
&+y the [//] &+a and so even when I was a kid there were certain shows that everybody remembered . [+ exc] 631726_638316
you_know it's just I'll say something that's kind_of probably silly . [+ exc] 639228_642168
but they're showin(g) with tv now &-um &-uh the guy with the Fonzi going hey@q . [+ exc] 642972_649982
you_know <it's just one little> [//] that's not a very deep thing . 649998_653398
but something like that back then that was everybody knew &+w who that was . 653881_658861
anyway it's the best I've got . [+ exc] 659618_661608
sorry [/] sorry ‡ that I'm [/] I'm [/] I'm taking a second . [+ exc] 691515_693635
I'm trying to decide which one I had mentioned . [+ exc] 693722_698552
my wife &-um and that's a very [/] very vital one . [+ exc] 698567_707407
I thought I'd try to think of &-uh something else too . [+ exc] 708281_710971
and every one I'm thinking of &-i isn't much to say in there . [+ exc] 710986_716016
so [//] and there's a_lot I just [/] just [/] just think of it . [+ exc] 716931_720481
&-um I thought of one that (wou)ld be very hard for me explain that . [+ exc] 721540_724280
<I just> [//] I wouldn't be able to get all in my head . [+ exc] 724300_726250
&-um well ‡ okay . [+ exc] 727266_732686
with my wife again <when we got married> [//] &+w when we were married . 733387_738827
I mentioned that . 739113_739573
but I don't think I mentioned this . 739593_742143
&-um after we'd been married for a couple days we went up north up to Wisconsin <and no> [//] yeah . 743269_754829
<and no yeah> [//] and then we went +... 755495_757205
&-uh sorry ‡ Wisconsin . 758176_761176
&+als &+s what I meant to say was actually [/] actually next to that <which is like> [//] <which sorry> [//] which [/] which is Michigan . 761194_770114
and we went up to Michigan to stay +... 771415_775915
oh_brother ‡ it &-uh +... 777114_779034
how could I not think of that ? [+ exc] 780465_781625
I could draw a picture of it . [+ exc] 785045_786165
I could drive where to get there . [+ exc] 786280_787350
I can't think what it's called . [+ exc] 787483_788643
oh Mackinaw . 789095_790395
and we stayed at &-uh Mackinaw . 791986_794616
and that was fantastic . 794976_796806
we had a few days . 797855_801745
and &-um we stayed at a beautiful place . 802653_806463
and &-um it was just so peaceful and just beautiful . 808260_814130
and at [/] at that place I had mentioned which took me while to get out as kɔk@u [
well ‡ up in Mackinaw &-uh they can't have any vehicles and cars . 824943_832223
so ‡ you just hear this little clip clip clip clip clip of [/] of [/] of [//] sorry [//] of <a horse> [//] horses going &=imit
and &-uh we just were out there . 844122_846752
we had a &+s suite <I guess you'd call it> [//] &+o our third floor . 848205_853135
and we could open it up and look down there and just see these [/] these horses . 854261_858691
and it was just so peaceful and so beautiful . 859724_862644
and &-um that was &-uh a wonderful time . 863599_870119
&-um just being married and having a life together with each other . 871159_876809
and looking back at that and seein(g) there's a_lot_of other all around that whole place . 876825_883635
but I remember that particular part of it . 884146_885866
&-um and there's another one that's close to it . 887290_890690
&-uh I guess it was +... 891997_893387
I forgot if it's before or after . 895230_896470
"right around there we went to a place called the Sleeping Bear Dune that this guy that I knew years ago had just told me +""/. 897248_910428"
"+"" oh you should go there . 911287_913017"
and so we went there not even knowing <how to> [/] how to get there (be)cause back then we didn't have &-like &-uh our [/] &-um our inter^uh^net [
we had to just figure out how to get there . 926343_927453
but we found this place . 927471_928871
well ‡ you [/] you [/] you [/] you go up real high . 929662_933342
and then when you finish you can just run down . 934704_937504
that was one of the neatest things . 938509_939749
when I went up all the way high and we could look down there it was just beyond beautiful just unbelievable . 940509_949209
and so when I think about that too <I just> [/] <I just> [/] I <just get> [/] just get happy . 950001_954291
so ‡ that's my little stories [
www .
&-um <on number> [//] on one &-um there's <a guy> [//] a boy whatever . 1022535_1029655
and he's got a soccer . 1030845_1032315
and he's hittin(g) the soccer . 1033338_1036478
and on the second one looks like he is +... 1037808_1042897
oh I see it now . [+ exc] 1043798_1044407
he's hit it . 1045224_1045685
and you can see actually <where it's actually> [//] where they have it showing &+w where exactly went . 1045708_1050138
and he hit by mistake I'm sure but hit one of the &-um +... 1051002_1056652
oh ‡ let's see here . [+ exc] 1058409_1059569
let me think what it's called . [+ exc] 1059617_1060587
one of the &-um houses . 1061712_1066602
and it got crashed . 1068316_1070716
and on number three +... [+ exc] 1072416_1073706
oh_boy ‡ there's the [/] the man that probably owns the house there who was sitting down probably just trying to just relax and all_of_a_sudden probably got oh_my_gosh what was that scared but realized what happened . 1074396_1097236
then &-um that just crashed and [/] and [/] and broke . 1097260_1106580
and so again I missed you on that but I think +//. [+ exc] 1107897_1111197
(be)cause I can't see him . 1111628_1112328
but it looks like he's probably angry . 1112352_1114932
&+a but he's [/] he's &-like holding it . 1116075_1118175
and he can see what made it get broken . 1119034_1126544
and I think that's end of the story „ I think . [+ exc] 1127985_1129655

we see that &-um where they would use to have gotten around there . [+ cir] 1529347_1535387
I can't think what it's called . [+ exc] 1535436_1536396
and the last thing on the very top of that is a [/] &-um a bird . 1538078_1544748
that's the best I can do right now . [+ exc] 1546340_1547750
&-um the story of Cinderella . [+ exc] 2145813_2148633
&-um I guess it starts off +... 2148802_2152042
&+leas at least the way I remember . [+ exc] 2152572_2154432
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very [/] &-um &+v very good people . 2154481_2165371
and they treated her as they should very [/] very [/] very kind and with [/] with a_lot_of love . 2166353_2174283
and &-um that would [/] would of_course have been great except &-um her [/] her &-like mother died . 2175781_2191511
and I guess a_lot of those &-like Disney shows do that sometimes . 2193850_2198970
and &-um so the dad was a good man . 2199331_2206451
but &-um like a_lot_of people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else . 2207521_2218881
and so that ends up happening . 2220609_2223529
and really messed up by marrying this other woman . [+ gram] 2223870_2230700
<who ends up> [//] she's just so cruel and so selfish . 2231837_2237597
and &-um oh okay what I should say before &+t also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life . 2238997_2258567
and so what I mean now is that the +... 2259253_2261343
&-uh what is it called ? [+ exc] 2262268_2263708
the other woman &-um she now has &-uh the power I guess where she's really being awful with [/] &-um with [/] &+s with Cinderella . [+ es] 2267475_2293645
&+a and I guess maybe even the [//] her &+d dad might've died . 2294814_2299734
I don't remember about that . 2299750_2300800
anyway ‡ so ‡ <they're showing> [//] they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed . 2301584_2309524
she went through &-um a really nice life which was deserving to her (be)cause she was a very [/] very [/] very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone . 2309719_2329349
so ‡ now that the other mother is now there &-um the other mother &-uh makes Cinderella do everything . 2330371_2345321
all the washing and &-uh everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do . 2346355_2353495
and these [//] <those two sisters> [//] the [/] &+sek &+fes the other &+s &=sighs +//. 2354825_2363065
what are those called ? [+ exc] 2363647_2364297
those two other girls &-um are just so mean to her and so just very &+s &-like very snotty horrible . 2364966_2379266
don't even care about Cinderella at all . 2380824_2383584
only that they can get whatever they want . [+ gram] 2384690_2387060
they make her do everything . 2388165_2389215
but even so she still [//] seems to still have an amazing way to be &-uh lovely and sweet and caring . 2390591_2406811
and so &-um I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place . 2406829_2426419
I can't think what it's called . [+ exc] 2426562_2427512
&-um beautiful place . 2427778_2430338
so ‡ sorry ‡ somebody's walking back here and I'm [/] I'm getting this for &-um +... [+ exc] 2431317_2435477
&+s <okay so> [//] &-um okay ‡ I think then the next part of the story is it shows <that the> [/] &-um that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman . 2436355_2469015
I guess . [+ exc] 2469410_2470060
so [//] oh ‡ this is hard . [+ exc] 2470880_2474210
so ‡ the [/] &-um the &-like +... 2474322_2480602
&+s <how's that> [//] I'm in track where they are . [+ exc] 2481169_2483599
<so the> [//] so ‡ it's made by decree that <they should have> [/] &-uh they should have <this &-like> [//] &+th <yeah okay this &-like> [/] this &-like ball . 2485474_2502814
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta [//] hasta come there . 2504665_2517985
and then they'll be able to [/] &+dec to figure out who's the best one that <he should> [/] he should marry . 2518911_2528051
so ‡ then they showed in the picture if I remember right &-uh his [
"+"" oh ‡ good ‡ we all get to go to the ball . 2544205_2548255"
and &+sh &+s she's excited (be)cause she thinks between those two daughters <that one of them will [/] will be> [//] &-uh that they will want one of &+th them . 2549533_2561333
so ‡ they're all excited including Cinderella was excited . 2562338_2568458
"but lo_and_behold &-um I think it showed that the other mother says +""/. 2568509_2580649"
"+"" oh ‡ no ‡ you're not going there . 2580843_2582573"
seems to me &-like I remember &-like the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear „ I think . 2584195_2592705
anyway ‡ so ‡ Cinderella <part of her> [//] part of how she's just so lovely and kind &-um even <the little> [/] &-um <a little &-like &-um sorry &-like ænəbəl@u [
&-um so ‡ they even <do what> [//] help to try to make her what she can wear . 2636676_2647676
<and I think I'm> [//] what happened with that ? [+ exc] 2649523_2652393
anyway ‡ yeah ‡ then it gets messed up . 2653228_2655608
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think that's where it shows Cinderella really [//] for the first time really crying . 2655702_2666092
"really just destroyed because it's like +""/. 2667332_2669172"
"+"" come_on I can't even you_know do anything . 2670177_2673607"
"+"" I can't even &+d &+d go to this ball . 2673849_2676409"
<I'm being> [//] it's like they think she's just nothing . 2677660_2683470
and &-um she doesn't deserve any of that . 2684556_2687096
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother pops out_of nowhere . 2688004_2692504
and she makes a beautiful outfit . 2693600_2699160
and &-uh then she &-uh +... 2700630_2704380
oh_boy the [/] the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where &-um +... 2705041_2708961
&-uh yeah with [/] with [/] with [//] it's &-like a pumpkin . 2712159_2716089
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in . [+ cir] 2717117_2721087
and the animals are made to look like they're &-uh people . 2721987_2725897

"+"" but by the stroke of midnight it's all gonna go back the other way again . 2740860_2746890"
so ‡ I think it showed Cinderella arrives . 2748135_2753475
"and they can see that &-um <the other> [/] &-uh <the other> [/] the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like +""/. 2753703_2772323"

why this is really hard to explain this ? [+ exc] 2784309_2785799
then the &-um guy . 2787508_2792708
I can't think what he's even called now . [+ exc] 2793470_2794860
&-uh oh how embarrassing . [+ exc] 2794877_2800707
&-um I can't think of the name of the guy . 2800998_2803618
the young man who's gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her . [+ cir] 2804785_2814695

and they get to dance . 2833068_2834458
and it's just almost magical . 2834698_2839188
they're just obvious those two are meant to be &-like in love . 2839239_2843449

&-uh boy$co my brain . [+ exc] 2893171_2894371
that there was a &+s grass [

and I think I missed one thing in there . [+ exc] 2942430_2944730
