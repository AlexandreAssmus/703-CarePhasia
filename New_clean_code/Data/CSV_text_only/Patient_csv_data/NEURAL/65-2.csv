&-um and [/] &-uh &-uh and so here is just a [/] a simple little
oughta be able to know how to use that . 486979_488119
and [/] and so <they brought this> [//] &-uh &-uh my boss brought

well ‡ hell ‡ that was never described in the manual at all . 585777_588727
and <that [/] that [/] that really> [//] that threw me for a loop

&-uh and [/] and so [/] so finally the [/] the [//] like I say the
"+"" oh okay . 609025_609595"
the most [/] most &+s basic of terms which the [/] the &-uh &-um

<and so [/] so the> [//] and &-uh so I went back to work and &-uh
and [/] and finally &-uh my [/] my [//] after a couple years &-uh
"+"" <you might [/] might have it> [//] you <take those> [//] take"
and so wow <that was> [/] that was a godsend . 681229_683699
I_mean just being able to [/] to write [/] write things down . 684720_686870
so ‡ I [/] I carry a small +//. 686892_688562
don't have with me right now . 689233_690193

&-um &+tha that [/] that in particular . 719266_721926
and [/] and also I ended up &-uh &-uh <as a later> [//] as a &-um
&-uh I developed &-uh &-uh tricks where I when I meet somebody new
use their name in any kind_of verbal [/] verbal conversation with
<use name> [//] &+e use their name every time first or last name or

for example <I met a> [//] &-uh in our neighborhood met a +//. 775921_778861

but &-uh met a fellow <in [/] in the> [/] in the &-uh neighborhood
and I got his name . 794526_795776
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told
and &-uh this morning <I was> [//] I saw him out for a walk and [/]
and then &+fine finally the name came to xxx . 810996_812506
so [//] but [/] but the [/] the discipline on [/] on &-um recalling
yes [/] yes . 839375_839895
the [//] &-uh &-um I think I mentioned to you last week . 840697_845477
&+may &+may &-uh possibly I didn't . 846085_847405
but <the time> [//] I'd spent some time <as a> [//] at the rehab
&-uh and [//] &-uh &-uh (be)cause I [/] I started oh [

<you just> [//] you're able to survive . 871699_873669
<just a> [//] the thing you're able to just [/] could just check
&-uh and &-uh &-um (be)cause they just did not do therapy in those
and [/] and over the course the next twenty years &-uh wife and I
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five
that's what they're telling people even &-uh fifteen years ago . 905719_910439
&-uh and so I <wanted to [/] to> [//] wanted to share that with [/]

&-uh <I had a> [//] in <the eight> [//] the eighty [/] eighty four
