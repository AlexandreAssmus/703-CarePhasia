and [/] and I was on [/] on the accident in eighty four . 432046_434506
I was on company business . 434528_435638
and <I knew> [//] I [/] I just knew that [/] that &-uh mɑt@u [
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired . 443288_445238

&-uh and [/] and so <like I say> [/] like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job . 461855_467345
and <it took me> [//] but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that [/] that &-uh I was no longer on [/] on the fast track . 467981_475721
no [/] no [/] no longer . 476146_477226
<it took> [//] <I wasn't> [//] it wasn't obvious at first . 477247_479607

&-uh and so &-uh I ended up with &-uh a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to <help my> [/] help my short term memory . 493261_505061
&-uh so ‡ <it was> [/] it was &-uh &-uh &-uh &-uh largely the [/] the &-um aphasia and [/] and people seeing me differently at work . 506110_516429

I [//] it [/] &+wa it [/] it [/] it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me . 524107_528077
but it wasn't obvious to me . 528092_528812
&-uh and that the &-uh writing everything down was [/] was &-uh the biggest [/] &-uh &+as &-uh biggest assistant [//] &+as &+assis assistant [//] assistance to me that &-uh helped [/] helped me do my job . 530176_544586

because I've struggled with the [/] the &-uh aphasia obviously and memory issues &-uh ever since then . 597640_606530
and [/] and [/] &-uh &-uh and [/] and [//] &-uh I_mean &-like for example &-uh the [/] the [/] &-um the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was out_of engineering school at Purdue . 606552_619772

&-uh no ‡ <actually I was> [//] &-uh I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering . 695671_700741
&-uh and [/] and I got out_of school the spring of seventy six . 701591_706231
had a job at a company named Shwitzer . 706317_708267
&-uh they're in Indianapolis . 709739_710609
