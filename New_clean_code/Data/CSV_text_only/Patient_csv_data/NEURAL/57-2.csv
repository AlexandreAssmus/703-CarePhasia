my speech &-um I think they're not too bad . 9626_16446
better than <it was> [/] &-uh it was before . 17030_20520
yeah doing very well . 20637_22347
not a hundred percent but you_know good enough „ right . 23580_28630
&-um yes it's been &-um a little bit more than &-um three years . 35393_43573
yeah &-um right [//] &+be about a week before my birthday . 44010_48220
yes had my stroke . 49546_50936
&-um I had been having headaches . 56847_59877
&-um and <I was> [/] I was a teacher working at a school and &-um working . 60707_69617
and during that day my headache was getting more worse . 70024_75164
and I went to the nurse that day &-um at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile . 75546_85486
and as we were talking she looked at me funny . 85967_90867
"and she said that &-um +""/. 91191_92791"
"+"" are you doing okay ? 93080_94480"
and I thought I was talking fine . 94590_97210
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that . 98035_103395
and &-um she knew that I was having a stroke from that . 103853_109023
and they called <five six seven eight> [//] nine-one-one . 109507_114087
and &-um I don't remember +... 114701_117281
right after that when they +... 118074_119524
I remember being <in the> [/] &-um &-uh <what do you call it> [//] in the +... 119781_124661
it's not a car you_know . [+ cir] 126282_127932
it's not a truck . [+ cir] 128247_129048
it's [//] is being in there laying down you_know . [+ cir] 129120_132010
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions . 132356_134906
but I could not think . 135094_136804
at that point it was getting worse as it goes . 137263_139653
and &-um they ended up taking me . 140419_144119
and one of the guys who does &-um brains he found a spot . 144642_151212
&+w they made it a picture . 151236_152786
they said that <you're having> [//] you have a &+s clot in your brain in the back . 153272_157842
and it's starting to blood [
and it starts to &-uh take &-um part of your &-uh <what do you call it> [//] &-uh &-like cells in a way that die . 161397_170597
and so he [/] he ended up giving me surgery at that point and &-um fixed it pretty much yeah . 171342_181442
so ‡ &-um I'm still here today . 181534_183724
but the &-um clot is still here . 183771_185991
it hasn't left . 186600_187500
so ‡ &-um that's why I'm taking the medicine I am . 187517_190097
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I [//] &+t it happened again . 190120_195260
they said I was taking &-um medicine that &-um əræktɪd@u [
it [//] &-um most people don't have trouble with it . 202755_206115
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think . 206164_210164
they're hoping that they +//. 210686_211726
yeah it's one of those things . 212109_213209
yup . [+ exc] 214250_214780
&-um I think at the beginning &-um the first thing they were helping me to stand up &-um to be able to walk again . 225351_235791
they were more into that at the very beginning than other &-like &-um aphasia type stuff . 235843_242063
they wanted to make sure I was able to [/] to walk again and [//] (be)cause my one side of my &-um body was starting to have trouble they said . 242230_254160
so ‡ they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning . 254176_261396
they started doing some little task for me . 261629_264189
"&-like &-um we played cards to see how many cards I can find , looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that . 264239_272929"
but we were doing that just here and there feeling . 273338_276948
&-um I was also very sad very &-um emotional feeling . 277586_282826
didn't [//] I couldn't even remember who I was . 283311_285911
and so &-um getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff . 286547_293727
&-um once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year [
"so ‡ &-um said +""/. 307910_309130"
"+"" let's go for our therapy now . 309230_310670"
"+"" let's start walking around and stuff . 310939_312799"
so ‡ once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit &-um we started working on therapy . 313123_320983
"and &-um they said +""/. 321148_322078"
"+"" you have aphasia . 322173_323163"
&-um and my talking <I couldn't say pretty much any> [//] I couldn't say anything . 323989_331629
"they were saying like +""/. 331949_332769"
"+"" do you want something to eat ? 332929_334039"
I didn't understand what that meant . 334163_335973
so ‡ they'd give me &-like a cup . 336375_337895
"+"" do you want something to drink ? 338044_338704"
they'd &+sh take the cup and show me . 338720_340900
and I'd go yes@q or no@q . 341441_343061
it took me a [//] &+lil even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it &=ges
if you don't want it it goes this way &=ges
took that long to figure that out . 352208_353758
little things like that that I didn't remember . 353835_357305
&-um then once I was able to at_least think a little bit more we started with &-um &-uh pictures like that bird <and the> [/] and the boy and the banana . 358157_373297
and &-uh <we start> [//] that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words . 373541_381511
and &-um my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else . 382129_390299
so ‡ still working on therapy myself . 390819_393209
I have &-uh a book at home that I still do my homework everyday . 393283_398843
so ‡ still going . 401055_402145
it's [//] I [//] I'm [//] &-um the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write . 402405_408755
<and I said> [//] but I told myself that I'm going to do it . 409091_413581
so ‡ I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up &+s you_know . 413977_418527
I'm going to read someday . 418838_420218
and I will write . 420238_421268
and I will have numbers at some point . 422510_424270
so ‡ yeah . [+ exc] 424348_425778
&-um let's see . [+ exc] 446419_447699
&-um &-um let's [/] let's see . [+ exc] 448247_455117
I [//] oh one of my &-um from a long time ago &-um when I was <I don't know> [//] ten fifteen right in there you_know teens in a way &-um <we had> [//] my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage . 455416_476766
and we [//] on the weekends you went to the cottage . 477653_481553
and &-um we wouldn't go every weekend . 482119_484909
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools you_know . 485016_490406
we would &-um take that time . 490453_492553
and &-um I think that was one my favorite places to go . 493074_497594
we could &-um fish . 498271_501261
we could swim . 501728_503288
we could +//. 503712_504262
and it wasn't very deep . 504362_506202
there was a_lot +//. 506733_507413
now it was deep in the middle . 507521_509211
<but right now> [//] &+y I_mean you could [//] didn't really hafta swim . 509415_513284
you could just walk around a little bit . 513299_515720
&-um there were frogs . 516399_518198
there was &-um &-um turtles at +//. 518250_522150
so ‡ I_mean <it was> [//] we got up in the morning . 522203_524943
and I think we ate as fast as we could <to be> [//] to go outside . 524965_529625
and I think you're pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed . 530311_534041
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that &-uh &-um all the fun things that we were able to do . 534537_542747
&-like my dad let me +//. 542768_544448
&-um we useta have a rowboat that had paddles . 544986_549816
but we also had one that had the &-um motor in the back . 550242_554672
<and it> [//] now you're [//] you were not allowed to go fast . 554804_557184
it was like two <what do you call it> [//] &-like &+fi no [//] five fast . 557249_563909
so ‡ it wasn't very fast . 564701_565981
you could almost swim as fast as you can the [/] you_know the boat . 566027_569277
but &-um they let me actually &+m mow [* s
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that [/] that paddle boat and stuff like that . 574385_582395
I loved to [/] &+r &-um to drive . 582756_586956
I just thought that was really cool . 588380_589630
I'm not sure why now <it was like> [//] it was such a big thing . 589648_592258
but it was you_know . 592275_593565
and I was by myself on the boat you_know . 593580_596690
and I thought I was something else you_know and all that . 596712_599552
we forgot the gas one time . 600038_601728
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid . 601744_604654
but I think that was . 605668_606538
and at night &-um <we had> [/] &-uh we had &-like a [/] &-uh a place to lay down outside . 607145_612995
and we would &-um go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty . 613045_618665
and I [/] I think &-um <when I have my> [//] if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage . 618681_629611
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads [
I think about that place . 636778_637948
I don't know why &=laughs . [+ exc] 638665_640345
yeah . [+ exc] 641724_642024
www .
&-um there's &-uha boy outside that was &-um hitting the ball around and having fun „ I'm sure . 686816_699976
and [//] &-um but as he was going by &-um he hit the ball on the window . 701010_709820
and it broke . 710383_711063
and it actually went in the house with it . 711135_715195
so ‡ the [//] &-um that &-um ball fell into someone else's house . 715638_722708
and I'm sure the guy +//. 723486_725706
I can't see that he has a picture . [+ exc] 725727_727137
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously . 727465_730975
but &-um it even hit the lamp and everything . 731505_736965
and so &-um he was looking to see you_know what happened . 737947_744787
so ‡ he's looking for the [/] the kid . 746082_747632
so ‡ we don't know if he took off or if &-uh he was &-uh going oops feeling or what . 748043_755103
we don't see him in the picture now . 755239_757339
so ‡ at the end all we know is that the [//] there's a guy with the ball looking for [//] to [//] outside to see what's happening . 758161_765661
yeah . [+ exc] 766754_767164
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened . [+ exc] 767429_770019
we don't know what happens this time . [+ exc] 770204_771564
okay . [+ exc] 788157_788457
&-um in the morning the [/] &+l the little boy are [
"and mom had looked at the weather and said +""/. 802842_806042"
"+"" I think there's a chance for rain . 806251_808521"
"and said +""/. 810145_810715"
"+"" bring your umbrella . 810856_812596"
"and the boy said +""/. 814882_816472"
"+"" no I [/] I don't need it . 816613_818553"
"and so mom said +""/. 819352_820602"
"+"" are you sure you're gonna do that ? 820848_822408"
and okay . 823396_825176
and so he said “bye mom” and went to school started walking . 825200_830940
and here comes the rain . 831491_833961
and it started probably even more rain as it looked . 835320_839990
and so he ran to come home the other way . 840413_844453
and let's see . [+ exc] 846905_848095
"so ‡ he went back in the house probably and said +""/. 848576_852306"
"+"" &-uh mom ‡ &-um you're right . 852642_855412"
"+"" there was rain . 855528_856658"
"and so she said +""/. 856966_857846"
"+"" well ‡ go get your &+b brɛlə@u ["
and so he put it on the brɛlə@u [
done . [+ exc] 871937_872277
okay . [+ exc] 888445_889025
&-um there's a cat that &-um was going up this tree on that bird . 891316_901616
and &-um I think it was up there and stuck . 903689_907909
"and so this little girl was watching and thought +""/. 908915_911995"
"+"" oh_my_goodness how do I get it down ? 912348_914378"
and &-um there was probably a guy walking by . 915565_920755
"and he thought +""/. 921161_921521"
"+"" I can help that little girl to get the cat on the tree . 921750_926930"
and &-uh but he got up there . 928372_930532
and now he's stuck too „ it looks like . 930549_932739
and &-um someone saw the guy up there . 933863_938773
"and the firetruck called and said +""/. 938825_944275"
"+"" we have a guy and a cat stuck in the tree . 944444_947774"
and so they &-um brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down . 948715_956985
yeah . [+ exc] 959490_959760
okay . [+ exc] 1464359_1464889
alright . [+ exc] 1466252_1467002
&-um so ‡ let's see . 1467709_1470539
&-um she [/] &-um she +//. 1471090_1478340
I think her mom must've died because dad is finding <a new> [//] &-um a very bad lady . 1478712_1489852
and &-um now she's here &-um &+s stepmom in a way now right and with two girls . 1490394_1500674
and they come to their really nice place . 1501363_1504093
and &-um she hasta &-um do all the dishes and the laundry and everything . 1505141_1513411
and the other girls actually they were even doing &-um &-um &-like either singing . 1514206_1522166
or they do their little &-um mɛstrəmɛnts@u [
they're doing all of that during the day and &-um having their fun . 1526026_1531146

and everyone can go and everything . 1541906_1544516
and &-um the [//] so she goes to get a dress . 1545198_1552228
and &-um it was new in my head on the fact that [//] &-um the [/] the birds I think and &-um maybe see others &+l a little &+fu friends &-um helped her to make even brɪɾɪ@u [
it's one of those things that they lock . [+ cir] 1578305_1580275

it looks really pretty . 1581844_1582884
"but she's like +""/. 1582972_1583402"
