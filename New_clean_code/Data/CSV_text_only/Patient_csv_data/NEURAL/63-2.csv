&-um my speech is okay . 8939_12749
but &+l a_lot_of times I [/] I [/] I know what it is but I can't say it . 12805_18625
that's what it is . 20929_21599
I [/] I know what it is . 21647_23007
and until someone tells me what it is I just can't say it . 23054_27554
I don't know why . 27999_28709
but it's the way it is now . 28733_30993
yeah . 38859_39209
well ‡ I got up <in the> [/] &+m &-uh in the morning . 44303_47383
and right away I [/] I [/] I [/] I rolled over . 48081_50901
&+sh she [/] she was by my side . 51772_53912
and &-uh I told her I felt a little queasy . 54630_58460
and she didn't &+s &+s say much about it . 59076_62396
so ‡ then <I went to the bathroom and> [/] I [/] I [/] I [/] I [/] I [/] I [/] I went to the bathroom and did my thing . 62957_75977
and then right after I did my thing something happened in here &=points
"and &-uh I said +""/. 83156_85516"
"+"" oh_no . 86280_86840"
and that's the last thing I remember for weeks . 87247_91347
well ‡ the [/] the last thing I knew &+be before my stroke hit was &-uh +... 110622_119142
well ‡ after my stroke hit &-uh I [/] I woke up . 119546_125836
<and I was> [//] well ‡ I [/] I remember <that is> [//] this was Amsterdam New_York . 125884_131834
so ‡ the next thing I know I'm back in Wichita . 131943_135903
and I'm [/] I'm on a bed . 137638_141868
my wife's there . 141886_144906
and [/] &-uh and I [/] I slowly start talking to her . 145895_154155
but <I don't think I> [//] at [/] at the &+fir first thing I &+don don't think I made much sense to her . 154830_161690
but she was always there for me . 161771_164131
so ‡ it [/] it [/] it [/] &+w you_know it was okay (be)cause I [/] I could tell her anything I wanted . 166318_172258
she'd listen . 172567_173307
did whatever she could . 174287_176717
and &-uh then after awhile &-uh two or three &-uh nurses would come in everyday . 179540_187850
and &+th they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back . 187899_197519
and &+e every day it was something different . 197735_200855
and I would go down the hall . 200878_202278
and &-uh they would do &-uh leg lifts &-uh trying to get me &+sh whatever . 203680_216830
and &-uh I [/] I would do [/] &+t do stairs . 216852_220462
I remember that I did stairs . 220720_222990
did a_lot_of &-uh I don't know &-uh +... 223735_230275
then I don't know . 231307_232287
&+th there was always somebody there . 232337_234217
there was always [/] always somebody doing something to me . 234266_238626
a_lot_of it I don't know anymore . 238866_241686
but it [/] <it was very> [//] for the first couple weeks I [//] it was very &+ex extensive . 241734_247804
well ‡ &+th &+th the [/] &+th the best thing I can remember before my stroke was getting married of_course . 270707_286957
and &-uh I was in the service at the time . 287802_290762
&+c we [/] we [//] <before my> [//] before I was a privacy officer I was also <in the> [/] in the airforce for twenty two years . 290815_301175
so ‡ &-um other from that I think &+th the thing that I [/] I do the most about in [/] in [/] &-uh in Helenikon Greece . 302963_317423
I [/] &+w I was very interested in basketball and baseball and [/] and especially &+so &-uh football . 318711_329211
had a_lot_of good memories about football . 330401_333411

but &+tha that's the way it is . 387736_389046
okay . [+ exc] 411303_411883
&-uh there [/] there was a &+bo boy who kicked the ball . 413030_417480
and the ball went into a glass window . 417912_421552
and <when he> [//] when [/] &+h when it went into the window and it hit the guy <on the> [/] on the stairs [
and so she [
and he [/] he told him he wasn't getting it back til the lamp was fixed . 442108_449508

&-uh first of all I see a little girl . 557835_561545
and she's trying to get a cat . 561562_563042
but her [/] her [/] her ladder broke . 564448_567938
so ‡ she couldn't get it . 568152_569122

<and he> [//] and up [/] up the tree trying to get him . 594116_598236
and so &+be because she couldn't get him . 599141_603851
and she couldn't get the cat . 603984_605224
she couldn't get the dog . 606497_607747
she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal . 608377_617727
okay . 1440511_1441251
&-uh when the grandmother [
and &-uh &+Cin Cinderella did all the work . 1458806_1465586
and as kids got older there were more things for Cinderella to do that [/] that they wouldn't do . 1466686_1476716
and finally they [/] they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala <at the> [/] at the prince's palace . 1478756_1493526
and &-uh they [/] they told her she couldn't go (be)cause she [/] &+wa she wasn't invited . 1495182_1501392
and only they went . 1501414_1502544
so ‡ after they were gone &-uh the fairy godmother showed up and [/] and showed them how she could do it . 1503720_1517650
and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into [/] &+in &+in &+in into &-uh the carriage and the horse and all . 1518630_1534120
