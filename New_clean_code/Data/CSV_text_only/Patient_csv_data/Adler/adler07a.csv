and &-um his new wife had two girls .

&-um they weren't very nice .
they didn't like Cinderella .
and &-um they always made her do &-uh a_lot_of work around the house cleaning up and doing stuff like that .
and &-um the other two they would go to parties and [/] and &-uh be with friends and everything .
and then &-uh all_of_a_sudden one day the mother got a letter and [//] &-uh from the [/] &-um (.) <the prince's &+sh (.) it's not a house> [//] (.) the &-uh (.) palace .

and &-um there was &-uh &-uh the fairy godmother .
that's the one who said about the &-uh dress .
and &-uh &=clears
and the horses will be the mice „ I think it was .
so ‡ &-um she did that .
she got all dressed .
she went to the ball .

and as she was running down the steps she lost her one shoe .
and it was <the good> [//] the pretty shoe that she had on .
and &-um she got home .

and &-um they came to her house .
"and &-uh the two stepsisters they thought +""/."
"+"" well ‡ there's no sense in her <looking at> [//] &-uh trying because it's not her ."
so ‡ they tried and they tried so hard to squeeze their feet into this little shoe .
and it didn't work .
and it turned out that &-uh Cinderella was the last one left to try it .
and &-um they teased her and everything you know that it's no use of doing it .
but she did and it fit perfect .
and &-um it end up that they fell in love .
and &-um they got married and lived happily ever after &=laughs .
