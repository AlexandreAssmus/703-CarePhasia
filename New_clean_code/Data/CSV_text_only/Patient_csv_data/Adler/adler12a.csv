when did you have that one ? 35886_36906
&-um on [//] in (.) <ninety four (.) I think wait wait no> [//] two thousand four . [+ gram] 37194_44884
and &-um I forgot family friends &-um husband (.) everybody . 46241_54821
<I could> [//] I couldn't remember anybody . 55325_58485
I didn't know how to drive . 58561_59971
I started hitting cars because <I thought> [//] I didn't know where I was going . 60500_65069
I didn't even know how to start a car . 65819_67519
and (.) maybe like (.) three years then I was able to start driving . 69472_76402
and then &-um (.) my speech got better . 78122_83022
<I still have> [//] I have some difficulties still &-um with [/] &+w &-um with numbers (.) „ you_know ? 84308_92378
&-um but I can speak a_lot better <than I useta be> [//] than I was . 92644_98524

&-um (.) I do a little Spanish now but it's &=head
you_know ‡ I do try but sometimes it just doesn't come out proper . 180933_185903
&*INV
if I'm upset or something (.) <I start> [//] you_know the words don't come out . 188266_194496
I just get more flustered . 194624_196154
&-um (.) what else ? 197283_199913
I think the saddest day was probably when my father passed away . 216559_222429
and that day I had gotten a raise from my job . 223770_228420
and I was so depressed . 229998_232398
six months later I had my stroke . 233173_235143
and (.) nobody really knows what happened . 236824_240284

but he was you_know the light of my life . 257971_260690
and so when he passed away I just couldn't take . 261557_264827
it it was just too much for me . 264923_266283
and then I had my first stroke . 267170_268770
