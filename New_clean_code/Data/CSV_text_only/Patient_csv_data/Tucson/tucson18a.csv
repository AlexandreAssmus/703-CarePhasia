it depends on what I'm talking about . 7253_12243
&-um if it's pretty typical &=ges
telling a story . [+ gram] 32274_33164
I'll put it that way . 33297_34087
if I told you something about what happened &=ges <it becomes> [//] (.) I [/] I [//] &=ges
and &-um people will say . 47780_49330
"&-like even my mom will be like +""/. 49707_52167"
"+"" I don't know what you're saying . 52350_53500"
so ‡ you know what I mean ? 54710_55330
my words &=ges
yes [/] yes &=head
&-mm mhm . 75477_76087
and it [//] &+a a_lot_of times &=ges I can't come up with the words either . 78421_81431
but what I've learned quickly to do is how to define &=ges (.) what the word is which then becomes &=ges part of telling a story &=ges in order to &=laughs point out what the word is . 81736_93486
&-um you mean &-like once I'd been in the hospital ? 102622_105802
I [/] &+c I can +... 110541_111691
well ‡ yeah ‡ &=ges I [/] I can &=ges before they took me +/. 113000_115177
okay . 119389_119899
basically what happened like two or three months in advance &=ges <I couldn't> [/] &-um I couldn't organize . 120682_131522
I was running &-uh a business at a church bookstore &=ges . 131661_136101
and &-um &=ges it was close to Christmas so there's more stuff &=ges
and trying to figure out even how to &=ges
and at one point when I realized &=points
and &-um &=ges I couldn't figure out how to do it . 169057_172037
&+i and things looked a different size &=ges
so ‡ I couldn't tell what fit &=ges
&-um and it turns out I also &=ges +//. 177195_179355
I remember specifically too . 179519_181179
&=ges I'd ordered fifteen hundred dollars worth of books . 181300_183930
Christmas time . [+ gram] 184180_185030
<and then> [//] so ‡ I've got the receipt &=ges
and I couldn't get anything put together &=ges . 187657_191257
&-like I didn't know where to &=ges
I'm pretty focused &=ges
couldn't figure that out . 196326_197336
and then I saw another receipt &=ges (be)cause I got [//] ordered like &=ges seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books . 197394_202194
"and I remember looking at it going +""/. 202552_204002"
"+"" <I don't> [//] &=ges what does this mean ? 205059_206589"
"and then I just was like +""/. 206636_207476"
"+"" never_mind I can't think about it right now &=ges"
and &=ges in addition to that I was going to school . 210486_212926
so ‡ you_know all together &=ges
well ‡ at school <I was> [//] I'd been in digital arts classes . 215964_220094
so ‡ I was in a Flash class where [//] making movement &=ges
and &-um it was the same kind o(f) thing &=ges where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things . 226769_236579
but our final project &=head
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing &=ges that we'd done right before that <it took> [//] I put it in &=ges like seven or eight different programs . 245602_255662
so ‡ now I look back &=ges
"+"" oh ‡ I wasn't stupid &=points"
"+"" it was this thing &=points"
so ‡ to &+s +... 264404_264734
mhm . 269629_269999
and then the day that I went into the hospital &-um it was the first &=ges part of January . 271576_281706
and &=ges I was at work . 281797_283017
and [/] &-um and things had been &=ges bein(g) weird . 283747_288217
and a girl was there &=ges . 288349_289609
and (.) it's <like I was> [/] like I was &=ges
"I'm like +""/. 298870_299040"
"+"" woah ‡ &=ges this is a weird feeling . 299460_300970"
my mom picks me up &=points
well ‡ actually drive &=points
and I took a rest during that time . 307721_311101
&=ges but I found out later that I wasn't even speaking well . 311297_314327
that [//] then &=ges I go to the emergency room . 314951_317261
it took (th)em eight or nine hours to see me . 317727_320907
yeah . 322224_322574
and &=ges I didn't know that until later that &=points
"they were just like +""/. 330440_331010"
"+"" oh ‡ &=head"
(be)cause they were nice . 332119_332919
I remember &=points that part . 335772_337602
and then I did get &=ges unconscious . 337623_339863
&-um my mom tells me that they put me &=ges
"and &-uh (.) so I [/] <I still don't have> [//] I don't even go like +""/. 343915_347955"
"+"" oh ! 348341_348471"
nothing like that . [+ gram] 349313_350103
and (.) the way they discovered I had encephalitis (.) and this unusual one herpes encephalitis . [+ gram] 350939_359339
"the neurologist was saying +""/. 359914_361764"
"+"" no ‡ it can't be . 362325_363165"
and &=ges
"+"" yeah ‡ I think it is . 364589_365479"
so ‡ they gave me the medicine right away instead &=ges of waiting for the test results three or four days later . 365500_371590
and that's when I see it's kind_of &=ges
that's what even the neurologist has said . 378252_380172
so ‡ that's my story . 380259_382229
so they say . 388880_389940
mhm . 405758_406198
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year . 408395_413685
&-um and &-um you_know it was tough to figure out how to walk &=ges
it's not that it was &-um &=ges (.) where I couldn't walk . 423534_429074
it's that I couldn't &=ges
&-um <I couldn't both> [//] &-like if there was &=points a radio or a tv on I couldn't pay attention to what you &=points
I couldn't figure out how to cook . 445460_446740
you_know things like that are still complicate +//. 447557_450677
no ‡ they're complex but they're not as complicated . 450780_452980
I've just learned how to &=ges
(.) and +... 460699_461079
&+y you mean &-like [/] &-um &-like learning words again ? 471511_476241
well ‡ I definitely &=head
I wrote &=ges a_lot . 480152_481912
I_mean ‡ I wrote pages and pages and pages . 482245_484555
&-um just in general (.) I wrote a letter to (.) Pima_College &-um because of something &=ges that had happened the semester before . 485498_496348
and I took three or four months to write it . 496475_498565
I didn't want anyone to help me . 498667_499947
so ‡ and that was cool that I'm [/] I'm +... 501155_504005
you_know ‡ I look back I'm &-like really glad I was the person that I was to not give up . 504021_508531
&-um and so I also went to exercise . 509796_515025
mom took me to her exercise class . 515110_517179
and they knew my mom well so I didn't feel &=ges uncomfortable (.) not being able to do much . 517200_522380
&-um little things like that . [+ gram] 523350_524540
I did lots of little things . 524735_526015
okay ‡ now like what +..? 538845_540245
oh ‡ okay &=laughs . 541826_542246
"I'm like +""/. 542990_543130"
"+"" &=ges what things ? [+ gram] 543300_543870"
yeah ‡ I'll tell you a recent one because that might be a_little more difficult . 562543_567613
I can tell you the past (be)cause I've told a_lot_of stories from the past . 567806_570976
so [/] &-um so ‡ I'm doing it deliberately for (.) the current &=ges
and it's sad . 577909_578689
&-um my grandson just passed away a week ago . 579143_582753
he's twenty . 583100_584160
and he passed away from cancer . 584303_586283
and he was sick for a year and a half . 587347_591627
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer . [+ gram] 591691_594951
so he was sick before &=ges
&-um now (.) let's see how I can +... 597277_601327
I shouldn't try to think &=ges
okay . 606455_606785
&-um so ‡ (.) what happened is when he graduated from high_school he lived outside &=ges of Tucson close to Phoenix . 606971_617161
and [/] &+a and &-um (.) so he was going to join the Marines &=ges
"but I said +""/. 625757_626137"
"+"" don't join the Marines until you (.) find out &=ges what you wanna do really . 626253_630803"
because it had been tough &=ges in his family life . 631126_633376
&-um so ‡ I found &-uh a way to get &=ges him to move in with me . 634428_641478
we didn't have a_lot_of money to make it happen . 641786_643726
so ‡ I found a way &=ges to get him here . 643840_645660
"and after he'd been here a few months &=ges kept saying +""/. 646212_647932"
"+"" I'm sick . 648029_648399"
"+"" I'm sick . 648513_648873"
they finally found out what it was . 648891_650991
so ‡ &=ges it was just a tough approach . 651982_653952
and &-um (.) &=exhales so they [//] &+f his parents finally moved him &=ges back in . 654620_663240
and it's just been a tough path &=ges
&-um I've learned how not to talk much . 667658_670688
so ‡ &=ges I haven't been able to participate <in us> [//] &=ges in language at all just in &=ges touchy-feely stuff . 670737_679827
but &-um I've stayed up there &-um when he was in the hospital . 680674_687464
well ‡ a week before he passed away &=ges my man and I went up there for &-uh a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool . 687512_699782
we got to spend time there . 699900_701280
and then the following &=ges
&=ges and we went up there (.) for a day . 704662_707492
"we were right there when he passed, along with other people &=ges and stuff . 707507_713247"
so ‡ <it was> [/] &-uh it was very sad . 713262_715662
and it was a good process too in the final moments . 715678_719158
that's my story . 720392_721172
oh ‡ yeah &=head
+< okay . [+ exc] 750553_750554
okay ‡ these things are pretty easy for me . [+ exc] 751700_753720

(..) <there was> [/] there was a girl (.) who had a family . 966997_973107
but two of the girls weren't her real sisters because her dad &=ges had married a woman with these two girls . 974613_987173
and they were pretty rotten . 987816_989696
and &-um (.) I can see some pictures with some animals . 992119_997979
and I don't know what that meant . [+ exc] 998000_999270

okay <just a minute> [=! whispers] &=finger
oh ‡ and I think they wanted to go to a [//] like a party . 1006030_1010220
and the girls wanted to go . 1012130_1013290
oh ‡ &=ges it had something to do with <the prince> [//] meeting the prince . 1013367_1017257
the girls wanted to go . 1018449_1019479
&+s for some reason Cinderella also wanted to go . 1019500_1022550
and &+sh she was able to because a fairy came along and helped her get dressed and get there . 1024027_1031067
so ‡ then she (.) <gets there> [=! whispers] . 1032534_1033934
and then something happens at midnight . 1036823_1038512
so ‡ she can't get home because what she rode in &=ges becomes a pumpkin again . 1039230_1045599
and [/] &-um (.) and she loses a shoe . 1047207_1053927
and then once she's home like the next day the [/] the prince comes with the shoe &=ges
he's looking for the person it fits . 1063659_1065329
and it's not her stepsisters (.) or her fake sisters whatever they're called . 1065413_1070583
but her [/] &+f her foot fits in it &=ges because her foot's little and so is the shoe . 1070789_1075749
and so they (.) officially fall in love and get ready to get married . 1076070_1081810
&=head
I know these days &=points how to say it . [+ exc] 1092978_1094228
