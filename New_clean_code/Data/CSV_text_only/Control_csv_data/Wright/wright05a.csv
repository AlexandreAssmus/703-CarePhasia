I haven't broken a bone since I was five . 22664_26664
and (.) I haven't been hospitalized since I was twenty nine . 27622_35702
I haven't been really sick . 35934_40084
<so ‡ it's gonna be hard to come up with something> [=! laughing] . 41180_43890
let's see +... 44337_44797
+< oh ‡ okay ‡ I will &=laughs . 52790_53680
<I was> [/] &-uh (.) I was five and <my folks were> [//] we were +//. 55120_65200
I was an only child . 66302_67262
so ‡ the three of us had gone to [/] &-um to see the Von Hindenburg . 67309_75329
<which had> [//] which was a big dirigible that was transporting people across the ocean . 75609_82099
and it was the last one before [//] as it turned out before it exploded and [//] &-um in [/] in its return trip . 83028_91328
and so my dad was real anxious to see this thing that [/] that he had been talking about . 91451_96201
so ‡ we went to see it . 96388_97378
and on the way back they decided they'd stop at a little &-uh kind of amusement park but it had &-uh monkeys and other small animals down in the front area . 98231_111331
and so &-uh my mother hadta go into the restroom . 112082_114872
"she said +""/. 115184_115404"
"+"" now you watch her . 115609_116289"
"+"" don't let her get into trouble . 116543_117833"
and so I was watching the monkeys . 118787_120597
and he was standing there talking to me . 120648_122398
I poked my finger in the cage . 123764_126104
and the monkey &=ges
&-uh so_that although it didn't actually break the bone it twisted my finger so_that it's always been crooked . 129882_138002
"and of_course when my mother came out she said +""/. 138866_140836"
"+"" it does look like for five minutes you could watch her . 141471_144081"
&=laughs and I remember that very vividly [=! laughing] . 144669_148249
because [=! laughing] because it was my fault but my dad got into trouble &=laughs . 148520_153320
&=laughs it was &=laughs . 160873_162118
&=sighs not really . 173880_175080
yeah ‡ that gets to be difficult . 183528_184878
oh okay [=! laughing] . 191751_192741
well ‡ &-um I spent last summer taking an ASU class in Florence Italy for a six week summer session . 194284_203634
and of_course I do [/] do not speak Italian . 203752_206172
so ‡ it became imperative that I be able to at_least read enough so that I knew what was going on . 206986_213296
but lots of times I misunderstood . 213530_216220
and so I would hafta &-um point to what somebody else was eating if that's what I wanted to order . 216272_223292
or &-uh we'd go in a [/] &+caf a cafeteria and so I could point to the food that I wanted . 224005_230525
and &-um I needed directions I hadta show them the map of where I wanted to go . 230690_238470
and [=! laughing] [/] and point to you_know what I wanted to do . 238780_242320
and then they usually could point me in the right direction . 242973_245543
so ‡ I used objects . 246045_248865
I used &-um food that other people were eating . 249077_252747
and I used a map . 252804_253944
&-uh and I tried one of the few of my other words but they weren't very good so +... 254234_261603
&=laughs they would always smile at me . 261745_265016
<they usually figure out what it was I wanted> [=! laughing] . 265238_269298
I don't get so +... 278893_287473
+< I [/] I can't remember any time when I was really scared . 289050_292640
&-um <I &+me I> [//] &-uh I've never been in fear for my life . 302407_310067
but &-um I did have an automobile accident . 310171_314061
&-um I was driving south on Central . 314128_318788
went to turn on Bethany home . 318834_320694
and I looked at the oncoming traffic and there wasn't anybody . 320748_325888
but there was a car about a block down the street . 325934_328644
and I started to turn . 328828_330318
and before I got through the intersection the car hit me &-uh broadside . 331206_337726
and knocked me into the telephone pole . 339123_342563
and my [//] I had on an Indian necklace that had a wire that was strung on jeweler's wire . 342612_349462
and they hit me so hard that it broke that necklace off my neck . 349546_354136
and the pieces went all over the xxx . 354414_356504
and I wasn't frightened from that . 357730_360090
but I was really nervous because we didn't have very much money and the car was relatively new . 360105_365575
and I didn't wanna hafta go home and tell my husband that that I'd wreck the car &=laughs . 365626_370686
and so when I got home +... 371265_373815
my mother &-uh came and pick me up because he was out_of town . 373862_377892
but she called him . 379185_380525
and told him <that I was> [//] that I'd had an accident . 381221_384551
so ‡ he came home . 384745_386205
when he got home I was standing out in the driveway waiting for him . 387097_391667
"and he said +""/. 392216_392696"
"+"" oh ‡ what did you do ? 393175_394235"

"+"" <I don't> [//] the car can always be fixed . 400928_403428"

+< oh I [//] it was . 412348_413418
it really was . 413802_414492

<the police the fire> [//] &+de the fireman put on a inflatable vest . 473757_478897

trying to help her &-uh out_of the swirling water . 485171_489561
which he was successfully able to do because of the team that helped him as he &-uh wrapped the belt around his arm and around her to help pull her out_of the water . 490369_505629
so ‡ she was not hurt . 507235_508695

young boy was playing soccer . 520392_522212
and he hit [//] kicked the ball . 522640_525040
and it went through the window . 525058_526528
the man inside was very upset because it not only did it break the window but it knocked over the lamp . 526620_534260
and glass shattered all over the living room where he was sitting . 535228_538978
then he picked up the ball and looked out the window to discover that it was his son . 539024_545554
"and so he called him inside and said +""/. 545612_548982"
"+"" how are we gonna take care of this ? 550014_551574"

&-um the mother wanted the little boy to take an umbrella to school because it looked like rain . 571252_576092

"+"" oh ‡ no . 576666_576916"
he didn't need it . 576969_577789
but he got halfway there . 577839_579129
and realized that it was already raining . 579177_581887
so ‡ he ran back in the &+mu mud puddles . 581936_584436
and he was all wet . 584516_585896
his mother made him go change clothes . 586591_588671
and gave him the umbrella . 589161_590431
and he started off with the umbrella again in dry clothes . 590551_594801

Cinderella had a very happy home . 691436_693966
but her mother died . 694011_694921
and &-uh after a bit her father remarried . 695124_699224
and stepmother had two very unattractive and unpleasant daughters . 699885_705075
and they made Cinderella's life miserable . 705660_707740
&-um as they grew Cinderella became the [/] the housemaid and took care of everything <for the> [/] &-um for the girls . 709134_717944
did what they wanted her to . 718037_719347
fetched whatever they wanted from her . 720382_722432
and in the meantime the young prince had grown . 722649_726949
and the father was disturbed because he hadn't found &-uh the princess that he wanted to marry . 727239_732249
so ‡ he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday . 732869_736179
and he sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball . 737093_744323
so ‡ the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation . 745405_750265
so ‡ they got their new dresses . 750393_753103
and had Cinderella polish and shine everything so_that they would look just elegant . 753156_758996
and so because the invitation went to everyone Cinderella decided she would prepare a [/] &-uh a dress to go too .
all the animals had helped her prepare it in the movie . 768491_771711
and she sewed this lovely little +... 772659_773999
it was simple dress but very very pretty xxx . 774657_777087
and when she [//] &-um <what this> [//] the time came for them all to dress and go to the ball why she helped the stepsisters get dressed . 777494_789104
and then she went up and put on her pretty little pink dress . 789663_792733
"and when she came down the stepsister says +""/. 793685_795555"
"+"" oh ! 796130_796320"
<they couldn't> [//] she could not go with them . 796422_798932
that was absolutely impossible because she was nothing but a chambermaid . 798983_802793
and so they actually tore her dress so she couldn't wear it . 803959_806879
they got in their coach and left . 807467_809147
and Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball . 810080_813460
and the sisters were so mean to her . 814288_815848
and all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appeared . 816970_820600
"and she said +""/. 820860_821180"
"+"" I will take care of this . 821654_822814"
"+"" I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land . 823410_826070"
which she did . 826666_827256
and it was just gorgeous . 827648_828998
and Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful . 830836_833116
"but she said +""/. 833175_833455"
"+"" how am I going to get there ? 833810_835040"
"and the fairy said +""/. 836938_837338"
"+"" bring me the pumpkin and mice . 837972_841342"
and she made a coach out_of the pumpkin <and horses> [//] and mice became horses . 842278_848458
so ‡ they carried her <to the> [/] to the ball . 848565_850985
when she entered the prince was just dazzled by her . 851160_854150
and he asked her to dance . 855416_856436
and they danced again . 856707_857767
and they danced again . 858477_859467
and finally it struck midnight . 859763_860883
and she knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave <as soon as> [//] &-uh before midnight . 862164_871634
so ‡ she dashed out_of the &-uh ball . 872741_876241
and in her hurry she lost one of her slippers [//] &-um glass slippers . 876961_881611
and got into the coach and &-uh took off . 883473_888353
but unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve . 889183_893303
and she had nothing but a pumpkin and mice . 893772_896912
and she had lost her pretty dress . 897738_898768
but she still had one single glass slipper . 899304_902494
and so she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she didn't think she'd ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had . 914666_914696
and the [/] the sisters came home . 914696_915766
and they were talking about this strange young woman who was there . 916175_919525
that she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her . 919785_922545
and they wondered who she was and how_come he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once . 922773_930203
and then the prince was &+dis [//] so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing Cinderella . 930938_942148
and the [/] &-um the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper &-uh on all [/] all of the eligible young women . 943080_956810
"and so the stepmother said +""/. 957519_958099"
"+"" we have only two . 958275_959225"
and &-um so he [//] they tried to push their big feet into the &+sli &+sli glass slipper and it wouldn't work . 959422_967712
they were too big . 967862_968442
"and he said +""/. 968818_968998"
"+"" but isn't there another young woman here ? 969907_972337"

"and she said +""/. 975206_975306"

"and said +""/. 991569_991669"
"+"" I think this matches . 992353_993273"

and they both fit beautifully . 996901_998621
and he then took her back to the palace . 998761_1001871
and they had a beautiful wedding . 1002022_1003402
and Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after &=laughs . 1004866_1007986
