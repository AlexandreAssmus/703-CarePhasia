(o)kay . [+ exc] 1191_1331
first of all I pull out the bread . 1353_2843
then I hafta go in the cupboard an(d) get the peanut butter
an(d) we keep our jelly in (th)e refrigerator . 6500_8360
so ‡ I hafta open up the refrigerator pull out the (.) jelly . 8376_11436
spread the peanut butter onto the one slice of the bread . 12123_15683
&-uh actually I like a_lot_o(f) peanut butter . 16490_18080
so ‡ I usually would put it on both slices o(f) the bread . 18100_20390
an(d) then just put the jelly in the center of it . 20875_22965
an(d) close it up . 22983_23733
put the bread away into the cupboard . 23920_25800
an(d) put the other items away of_course . 25815_27385
yeah . [+ exc] 27755_27855
<the &-uh family pet> [//] the girl's pet which is a cat got stuck up in a tree . 29635_34515
the father tells his &-uh daughter that he will get the cat down out o(f) the tree . 35471_41381
climbs up into the tree . 41433_43173
an(d) &-uh the [//] loses the ladder that he got up into the tree . 43813_47733
so ‡ now the cat an(d) the father are both stuck up in the tree . 48200_51830
the dog is of_course barkin(g) an(d) barkin(g) . 52585_55215
but &-uh that's just to &=laughs see what's goin(g) on . 55231_58231
(be)cause the dog probably is the one that chased the cat up in the tree to begin with . 58246_62086
an(d) then &-uh somebody called the fire department of_course to get everybody out_o(f) the tree . 62870_67700
<I got> [//] &-uh I [/] &=head
I have a back problem . 74990_76580
I guess that's my worst problem right now . 77168_79828
and &-um I &-uh have pains &=points
and I have &-uh (ap)pointment with the &-uh neurosurgeon in March to see what it's all about . 88675_94815
but they think what it is it's a pinched nerve &=points
I have &=hand
and &-uh I have bone spurs an(d) things like that up there . 106800_110730
so ‡ I'm sure they probably are gonna be doing a surgery of some sort . 110823_115413
because I [//] right now I hafta take pain pills to get to sleep at night . 115436_119876
that's my only problem . 119893_120963
it doesn't bother me too much in the day time . 120981_122651
(be)cause it's not that great o(f) pain . 122675_124285
<I can> [/] I can &-uh deal with it . 124300_126830
just at night I can't &=ges
because it hurts too much . 129490_131090
&-uh the pain does . 131643_132603
so ‡ I hafta take a pain pill right now at night . 132620_134430
which I don't like to do . 134450_135380
because I don't really like to take &-uh any kind of pills . 135400_138120
the only any kind o(f) pills I take at all are for high cholesterol . 138143_140973
but [//] &-uh so ‡ I don('t) like that at all . 140995_144165
but &-um I do take those at night . 144180_146280
so ‡ I can least sleep halfway decent . 146340_148430
and [//] &-uh but that's about all . 149020_150630
<I don't really> [//] <I been> [//] &=ges
+< I've been [/] &-uh been fortunate basically &-uh throughout my life . 153036_157276
&-uh I never smoked an(d) [/] and &-um only really drink at like Christmas an(d) special occasions [>] an(d) stuff like that . 157470_166100
so ‡ I didn('t) drink a_lot . 166161_166971
the reason I don('t) do that is (be)cause my mother died from drinking . 166988_171548
and &-uh my father was German . 171840_174250
so ‡ he drank a_lot . 174331_175361
so ‡ maybe that's why I don('t) drink . 175413_176663
but &-uh &-uh &-uh so I been livin(g) a healthy life . 176683_181383

&=lips_smack &-uh I have a thing where I don't eat anything [/] anything with sugar in it &-uh like snacks or anything after six or seven o'clock . 222276_229406
(be)cause I found out for whatever reason I wake up in the next morning with a headache <if I> [/] if I have sugars in the evening . 229426_235596
but anyways <we had> [//] I [//] &-uh we &+ha both had a cup o(f) cocoa . 236006_238666
an(d) then I just had a hamburger . 238938_240148
so ‡ can't believe it was the hamburger . 240593_242633
so ‡ we figured it was the cocoa . 242830_244160
but anyways &-uh came back . 244183_246973
&=lips_smack an(d) I started feeling queasy in my stomach . 247876_251246

&-um (.) didn('t) seem like my heart was racing . 275991_278441
so [//] an(d) don't think it was any kind of &-um an attack of any kind . 278510_282150
&-uh but I was sweatin(g) . 282843_284303

an(d) she made friends with her . 384093_385253
an(d) so she learned to do sign language . 385271_387241
be [//] so ‡ she could communicate with her . 387433_388803
but I [//] of_course I don('t) . 388825_389805
it's too deep for me to learn . 390503_391493

&-like she had problems with her telephone company one time . 415590_418380
so [>] ‡ I called the telephone company for her . 418470_421380
because it's so hard for her to communicate with anybody . 421400_423780
(be)cause she hasta go through that TDY thing <that you_know that> [>] you have on the telephones . 423850_427240
