but they weren't close enough to [/] &=laughs to rescue each_other . 70525_76645
in the meantime the firemen were coming to rescue both of them . 76936_81906
and (.) &+v Mary was ready to catch the cat . 82641_86601
and so there was a happy ending to this because the firemen were going to take care of the whole thing and rescue everybody . 88111_96281
and life would be back to normal . 96326_99066
my sister had a stroke if you wouldn't mind . 101742_103862
I sprained my back which took &-um a couple of years to heal . 118667_123437
and all I did was &-uh bend over to get something out_of a drawer . 124286_127876
and I felt like the left side of my body just rip . 127895_130384
and &-um I went to the doctor who told me it would only take a couple weeks to &+ha heal . 131359_137219
this is sports medicine doctor . 137238_138958
"and &-uh &+s immediately stretched [//] started stretching my legs, which was ɪnskɹuʃieθɪŋ@u ["
&-um (.) <but in actuality> [//] so I went back to work actually after about four or five days thinking +... 148122_154982
and I had a pretty physical job doing visual merchandising at the time display for stores . 155159_160349
thinking that I would be fine . 160989_162509
and &-um &+i &+i the experience <pulled me> [//] after &-like about four hours of standing pulled me down to the groun(d) . 162958_170338
<I couldn't> [/] <I couldn'(t)> [//] I would pass out if I &+n continued to stand . 170386_175696
so ‡ &-um I hadta &-like lie flat on my back until I could get up and leave . 176672_180322
&=laughs and then go home and &-like lie flat on my back for [//] &-um you_know until I could get up . 180531_188121
so ‡ <it was> [/] it was a [/] a really &+i incredible experience . 188294_193884
&+i <it [/] it [/] &+w it had me> [//] it &+s xxx +... 193930_196870
so ‡ there [//] the doctor really didn't do much . 197403_199153
I ended up going to physical therapy &-uh which made it worse before it got better . 199688_204848
and [//] &-um but that was just because they hadta massage the muscles . 205891_209731
they say that sometimes a sprain is worse than &-uh a break . 210396_213396
so ‡ that whole &+f experience took about a year and a half . 214482_217442
and [/] &-um (.) and then my back finally healed . 217586_222176
I [//] &+an &+an &+i and the depression that set in . 222495_224855
not knowing quite what to do about it . 225611_227071
I went to different people . 227235_228275
&+m different doctors and <didn't know> [//] didn'(t) [/] &+n didn't see any way out_of &+i the pain . 228410_233710
so ‡ &-um it finally ended and +... 234711_237781
+< &=laughs I'm all better . 241682_242992

this &+wen went on for years . 279891_280981
&+s &+h called denial &=laughs . 281504_282174
<and finally> [//] &+ya people started to tell me that the doorbell was ringing <and I couldn't> [//] at work &+an because I &-er +... 286360_292080
and &+i &-um I worked in a [/] a photographer's studio at that point in time . 293160_298050
and people useta ring the doorbell when they come in . 298074_300064

and &+e people started pointing out that I was not hearing things . 301973_304803
so ‡ &-um (.) then [/] then I thought &-um that if [//] it was everybody else's problem because &=laughs their &-uh speech was not distinct . 304887_316147
