and she was so depressed . 490451_491931
well ‡ okay . [+ exc] 516107_516948
it starts out where the boy is playing with his soccer ball . 517970_521960
he's kickin(g) it up practicing . 522832_525263
and then accidentally &-eh one of the times he kicked the ball he hit the window . 525831_532291
and it broke through the window . 532630_534260
"his father was inside the house and wonderin(g) +""/. 535320_539200"
"+"" what is goin(g) on here ? 539380_541130"
&=laughs and he sees the ball come into the house . 542313_546143
so ‡ his father gets up and grabs the ball . 546955_550145
and he figures that his son must have been playing <with the> [/] with the &-uh soccer ball . 550168_556718
okay . [+ exc] 585118_585638
it was one day . 587758_588828
this little boy was +... 589048_590308
it was time for him to go to school . 590965_592505
and &-uh his mother was &-uh tellin(g) him to take the umbrella (be)cause it might rain . 593483_600823
so ‡ the little boy waves to her and says no he doesn't need it . 601463_604593
so ‡ he <goes he> [//] proceeds going to school when all_of_a_sudden it starts to rain . 605521_611081
and <he &+s (.) decides to> [//] he's gonna get all wet . 612011_616791

so ‡ then his mother gives him the &-uh umbrella and goes back to school . 621436_625206
okay ‡ this story's about &-uh Cinderella . 629021_631661
it was about &-uh a young girl that was &-um &-um a cleaning lady . 632346_642096
and she goes over to this &-uh big house where she [//] this lady has &-um a couple o(f) daughters that are very wealthy . 642698_654428
so ‡ they have this young girl that is about their age . 654768_658288
and &-um &-uh she (i)s [//] just &-uh cleans around the house and &-uh helps them to keep the big house clean . 658945_668705
so ‡ one day &-uh they received a letter . 669385_673225
it was an invitation to a &-um (.) big &-uh celebration where they were gonna have dancing and &-uh at [//] &-um I guess at a &-uh prince house &=shrugs . 673911_685251
so ‡ &-uh she was readin(g) it out loud when Cinderella was in the room and was excited for them because they were going to this big &-uh ball . 691531_704081
and &-um her being young she wished that she could go to something like that . 706085_713035
but she knew that she could never attend just anything like that . 713058_716498
and she had &-uh +... 718106_720446
the [/] the girls were all excited . 721043_722833
they were gettin(g) ready . 722851_723861
they were &=touches
and &-uh so they ended up &-uh having their dresses made . 727881_734471
and &-um the day &+w it was getting closer and closer . 735436_739366
so ‡ <she was> [//] Cinderella was upset because &+sh it was getting closer for that time . 739390_746510
she knew that she wasn't gonna be able to go . 747353_749093
so ‡ all_of_a_sudden she jus(t) wished that she could jus(t) go . 749765_754715
and &-um <what was> [/] &+th what was it ? [+ exc] 755588_759568
&-um &+f &-um (.) the fairy popped out_o(f) nowhere and told her that she could go . 759590_771010
that <they would> [//] &-uh she could make it possible for her . 771561_775981
and she just &-like couldn't believe this . 776433_778423
and <her little> [//] she had little mice friends that were consoling her trying to calm her down (be)cause she was upset . 778876_785456
and she's got this &-uh look on her face like it's unbelievable . 786286_790076
so ‡ this [//] she said that your wish will come true and that she would have a dress for her . 791040_798830
and so she opens the closet and she finds this dress specially made for her . 800096_805416
so ‡ then the day comes when &-um it's time to go . 806398_812028
and they had her working at the house . 813073_816993
and they were all laughing and &-uh making fun o(f) her (be)cause she hadta stay behind to clean the house . 817418_823508
when all_of_a_sudden &-uh &-uh they all [/] all left . 824835_830935
"and all_of_a_sudden the fairy comes back and asked her +""/. 831301_835141"

"and she says +""/. 837741_838071"
"+"" I have no way of going . 838321_839721"
so ‡ then she &=ges all_of_a_sudden gets her magic wand . 840208_844838
and then there is &-uh a chariot waitin(g) for her outside . 845451_849231
so ‡ she gets all excited . 849888_850988
an(d) <it all &+h get> [//] &-uh they help her put her dress on an(d) [/] and her &-uh special slippers that [/] &+sh that [/] that [/] that were made for her . 851003_860313

&-uh &+h she left running . 898781_900911
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers . 901708_905278
so ‡ then &-um (.) she &-um finally got home . 906176_912546
