okay . 628_888
first you get some bread out_of the pantry . 1440_3580
and then you go to the refrigerator . 4273_5973
and you get a jar of jelly . 6166_8216
&-uh and then you hafta &=ges
and you &=ges
you open up &=twists
you open up &=twists
and then you open up the bag of bread . 18226_20056
you take two slices of the bread out . 20948_22528
and you get a butter knife from the drawer . 23238_25408
and you take out &=ges
and you smear it &=ges
and then you take that same knife and use it to &=ges
and spread that &=ges
and then you &=claps

so ‡ little Sally was playing with her cat out in the front yard of the house . 43760_47950
she was riding circles around her cat when all (o)f a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them . 48450_55580
the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree . 55630_59960
and little Sally was worried about &=points
so ‡ she went and found a ladder . 64181_65571
"she was gonna put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said +""/. 67330_71460"
"+"" oh_no ‡ no ‡ don't worry about it . 71651_72931"

at which point the dog came back and scared the man . 75110_78230
and he ran up into the tree . 78838_80288
little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree . 82565_86495
so ‡ she hadta call the [/] &+pfoli the firemen so_that they could come and rescue everybody . 87386_93186
I will tell you about having my tonsils out &=laughs <at the> [//] at &-uh &-uh &=points
&-uh I had had strep throat five times in one year . 102476_106256
and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to hafta come out . 106573_110973
which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult . 111613_115213
and I still had them at all . 115368_117068
so ‡ &-uh my sister came into town to &-uh stay with me &=traces
and I hadta go to Scottsdale . 129235_131675
&-um I think I went to Scottsdale_Samaritan to have it done ? 132111_135621
but it [//] they did it &-like on a day surgery . 135671_137731
&-um but what I remember about it most is a@l it hurt . 138421_143051
but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning . 143066_149906
but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight . 149921_153451
so ‡ by the time I got in there I was &-like a little bit dehydrated . 154175_159045
so ‡ they couldn't find a vein &=touches
and they hadta stick me &-like six times in_order_to &=touches
and that was very very unpleasant &=laughs . 166916_168456
&-um they [/] they finally got it in &=ges
they had The_Wall on for the music . 181235_183685
"and I was like +""/. 183706_184086"
"+"" oh ‡ that's gonna be great . 184331_185081"
"+"" you're gonna gimme drugs . 185131_185951"
"+"" and I'm listening to Pink_Floyd . 186125_187325"
"+"" so ‡ this is gonna be a good day ! 187426_188486"
&-uh so ‡ did that &-um laid down on the gurney . 189343_194403
they gave me &=ges
and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery . 196186_199216
&-uh &=ges
it was painful . 201481_202731
I felt I wanted to cry . 202746_204636
in_fact ‡ I did cry just because it was so unpleasant . 204688_207758
and it hurt so bad . 207776_208916
&-um they were trying to give me &-like some water to help kind_of &=ges
and I couldn't swallow it . 214146_215256
so ‡ it was coming back out_o(f) my nose . 215305_217195
<it was just> [//] it was a mess . 217643_219153
it was horrible . 219421_220351
&-um but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out . 220513_227203
but it was like &=arms
&-um and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out . 231948_236778
so ‡ I spent the next probably four days just layin(g) around in bed just trying to [/] to feel better . 237963_245073
the only thing I could eat were popsicles . 245095_247055
"&-um you_know ‡ people were like +""/. 247698_248778"
"+"" oh ‡ you always get ice cream . 248940_249950"
"+"" you get ice cream . 250023_250583"
but I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have ice cream . 250605_252925
so ‡ that made it that much worse . 253385_255945
&-um I couldn't eat anything really hot because <it was hurt> [//] it was burning my throat . 256132_260663
&-um and <it was probably> [/] it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that . 261358_271798
"&-um and I've had people ask me you_know +""/. 272418_274018"
"+"" if you hadta do it all over again . 274190_275490"

"+"" &=scoffs <I'd have just> [//] I'd just continue to have strep throat . 276136_278396"
that's what I would continue to do . 278443_279983
I would not have had them out at my age &=points
so ‡ &=laughs +... 283211_283481
mhm . 285790_286350
yes . 297910_298200
&-uh
and <they were> [//] actually I spent a_lot_of time in Iraq and Afghanistan . 308701_311921
and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you . 311945_315595
so ‡ it's [/] it's collectively a scary situation all the time because you're in a country and kind_of a situation where not everybody likes you . 316045_325945
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just don't want you there . 326518_329278
so ‡ when we would hafta go &=ges
&-um any time you're on the road you're essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks . 340675_347565
so ‡ you're constantly havin(g) to watch and look around &=points
&-um one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you don't stop on the road . 355828_362488
<you just> [//] you always keep goin(g) &=ges
&=ges
you always keep going keep going keep going . 366300_368140
and (.) we were part of a convoy . 368835_372625
it was like a &=ges
but I guess &=points
or he didn't get the memo that you don't stop (be)cause it makes you a target . 377731_381201
and he decided to stop for some cows &=ges
so ‡ he decided to stop . 390536_391836
and we all lost our xxx &=ges
"I_mean we were like +""/. 394455_395985"
"+"" what are you doin(g) ? 396141_397221"
but you don't wanna get out because that also makes you a target . 397695_400535
so ‡ everybody's &=ges
"+"" get back in the vehicles ! 402763_403713"
"+"" get back in the vehicles ! 403760_404670"
and you're having to yell it . 404716_405506
so ‡ it was a little bit <of a> [/] of a crazy situation . 405608_408428
&-um the whole thing probably lasted (.) maybe two minutes . 409006_414966
maybe two minutes . 415348_416288
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to [/] to everything . 416760_424980
so ‡ yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation . 425156_428366
yes . 444108_444488
&-um (.) &+th <this perso(n)> [//] they have dɪfɪkəlpɪ@u [
I_mean they have the ability to talk . 462846_464836
they (a)re [//] &-um (.) don't have the skill base in talking with adults though . 465285_474015
&-um it's a friend of mine who teaches at a &=ges
so ‡ she spends a_lot_of time around &=ges
so ‡ when it comes time to &=ges
&-um (..) more it's being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time &=ges
&-um I think there's probably some self-esteem issues that go with that . 507053_511013
so ‡ she's not out . 511031_512051
she's not socializing . 512075_513085
and then when she does go it's like &=puffs
it's like &=ges
"or if there's something that's bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like you_know +""/. 521318_527728"

"+"" do you wanna talk ? 529041_529511"
and you don't ever say anything . 529535_531595
so ‡ &-um (.) eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as that's just part of that person's behavior . 531823_540113
&-um and that's how they're [/] they're choosing not to communicate by &=ges
(...) okay . [+ exc] 578226_578556
so ‡ little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer . 579241_582261

they made her do all the cleaning while he was off &=ges
that's why he wasn't around . 741435_742415
