okay ‡ it looks like they have problems with their pets . 610_5360
and I have a cat . [+ exc] 6376_8306
so ‡ I know that cats climb anywhere . [+ exc] 8398_10608
and all_of_a_sudden it's in a high tree . 10653_13053
and it doesn't look like the cat is stressed . 13105_15895
but <the kids are &+s or> [//] the little girl is stressed . 16456_18906
so ‡ Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat . 19540_24840
but I don't think he's able to . 24856_26316
so ‡ he calls the firemen . 26380_28180
and the firemen look like they're going to get the cat down . 29318_32607
and I'm just gonna assume that they got the cat down . 32753_35954
and the little kid is gonna be so excited . 36533_39353
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down . 39995_42625
and they live happily ever after &=laughs . 45235_47595
okay ‡ you take the [/] the loaf of bread . 50191_53351
and you open the bag . 53375_54955
and take two slices out . 54976_57566
you get your peanut butter jar . 58475_60055
you unsc(r)ew it . 60196_60986
and you get your knife . 61005_63115
and take out the peanut butter . 63136_65046
and put peanut butter <on both sides of the &+bre I mean> [//] on one side &=ges
so_that both &=ges
and then you get your favorite jelly . 78250_80180
and you do the same thing . 81068_82918
and then you put (th)em together . 83838_86008
and serve it . 86905_87585
and eat happily ever &=laughs after . 87745_90405
well ‡ I [/] &=clears
and when I found out I had breast cancer . 103533_106353
which runs very prominently in my family . 106506_109126
"&-um my husband &-um said +""/. 109976_113876"
"+"" we're gonna whip this thing . 114053_115573"
and so I had a mastectomy . 116628_119528
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours . 120145_124085
"and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said +""/. 124968_132218"
"+"" we're going off to war again . 133068_134948"
"+"" and we're gonna beat it . 135090_136180"
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing . 137088_140488
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband . 141150_147680
and my husband was &+b trying to be strong for me . 147846_150606
so ‡ we always had a positive attitude . 151261_153791
and we [/] &-uh we never thought negatively . 154451_158941
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors . 159440_164870
yes . 173803_174123
okay ‡ well ‡ my mother was eighty nine when she had her &+s breast cancer . 179433_186703
and she came through that fine . 187678_190088
but then <after that> [//] a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes . 190570_197040
"and so she herself said +""/. 198088_200118"
"+"" I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab . 200575_203895"
and she was living by herself at the time . 204478_206228
and so she
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in [//] near my sister in Dallas . 215236_220836
and so then I went there once a month to visit her . 221648_225788
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well . 226705_233175
she &-um she would start sentences . 233788_237738
and never be able to finish (th)em . 237803_239143
"and she would say +""/. 239260_240160"
"+"" would you +... 242253_243313"
and then she wouldn't be able to [/] to finish the sentence . 243745_246535
so ‡ it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted (.) us to do . 246585_253775
but we didn't really know what to do . 253820_256579
so ‡ the only thing my sister and I did was we just &-um smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf . 256673_267333
so ‡ we talked slowly and loudly . 267685_270955
and we always had a big smile on our faces . 271533_274393
and &-um we just showed her that we cared . 275078_279238
and we would always &-um read her mail to her . 279256_283626
and we knew two favorite people of hers . 284256_286466
so ‡ we would always read those &-uh more than once . 286488_290678
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her . 291155_295845
okay ‡ (.) &-um &=clears_throat when I was working for this man <he was the> [//] &-um he was a member of Young_Presidents_Organization . 309151_327611
and it was made up of presidents from around the world . 328455_332125
and they had &-um a [//] not a seminar but a [//] &-um they called it a university . 333160_343650
and it was &-like a week long . 343753_345463
and it would always be one would be in the United_States . 345956_348796
and the second one of the year would be outside the United_States . 349141_351981
and this year it was going to be in San_Francisco . 352786_355416
and &-um it'll be twenty years ago next month . 356406_361256
and &-um my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening . 362291_368401
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a_lot of the background work . 369545_375285
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working &-uh week . 376396_386336
and so Don stayed here . 386800_388390
and my sister from Dallas &-uh flew in . 388663_391283
and that was the week that they had the San_Francisco earthquake . 392188_397238
and &-um so we were at Fisherman's_Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free . 398216_405516
and &-um we were waiting to go &-uh on the trolley cart back to &-um <Saint_Francis> [//] the Westin_Saint_Francis . 406508_416438
and as we're waiting in line the earthquake hit . 418498_422078
and &-um it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that . 423020_428530
and so my sister (.) just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down . 429006_435376
"and she said +""/. 435926_436366"
"+"" that was probably a two or three . 436520_438180"
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didn't know . 438790_445120
but that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing . 445166_448046
well ‡ the electricity was off so nothing worked . 448838_452268
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel . 452881_458341
and &-um in San_Francisco you_know it's pretty hilly &=ges
and so &-um I_mean <it was> [/] it was &-uh quite a jog back there . 464096_468906
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel . 469753_473163
so ‡ we sat outside this big &-uh park area &-um for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in . 473720_484150
and &-uh the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was +... 484170_488880
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there . 488970_495800
and we wanted to also call our two husbands . 496448_498808
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news . 499576_507036
she doesn't like to hear &-uh the bad news . 507120_510120
and there's hardly any good news that's told . 510181_512441
so ‡ we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know . 512518_515847
"but my sister said +""/. 516788_518378"
"+"" mother what are you doing ? 518626_519535"
"and she said +""/. 519558_519979"
"+"" well ‡ I'm watching the news because so-and-so told me that there was a big earthquake in San_Francisco . 520283_526683"
so ‡ this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco . 526770_531340
so ‡ it was a_lot_of (.) fear at the beginning . 531953_537283
we were on the nineteenth floor . 538128_539658
so ‡ we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor . 539816_542476
and then walk down with our luggage . 542573_545043
so ‡ it was just &-uh the fear of the unknown . 545600_548280
and not knowing if we're gonna be able to fly out because maybe the [/] the airline canceled the flight or whatever . 548298_556308
but both of our flights were fine . 556330_558090
and we made it home okay . 558106_559496
and our families were okay &=laughs . 559513_561823
www .
okay . [+ exc] 568290_568880
first of all it looks like there has been &-um a weather change . 571136_576026
and so whatever the girl was doing at the beginning I would say she was +//. 576160_581390
I can't tell if it's a young girl or if it's a young lady . [+ exc] 582576_586076
so ‡ I'm [//] whatever she was doing I think it's +... 586693_590083
she was (.) riding her bicycle . 591606_595306
I'm going to say it's a young girl riding a bicycle . 595328_598738
and she [//] the weather came up quickly . 599645_603155
and it looks like it is flooding the roadway . 604001_608031
and perhaps she was &-um I'm just gonna say a [//] on a bicycle . 608421_615491
and so it washed her haway [
and &-uh (.) she's very frightened and concerned and scared and (.) all other emotions [//] negative emotions . 618786_632106
and this one +... 632800_634380
it might be a firefighter (.) or whatever rescuer is coming . 635181_640991
&-uh it looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb . 641563_645553
and <he is> [//] he's got his lifejacket on . 646666_651266
and so he is coming to rescue the little girl . 651313_655863
and being that he's a professional rescuer of one way or another . 655910_661110
&-um the family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land . 661880_670230
www .
okay . [+ exc] 688361_689051
this young boy is practicing soccer . 691951_695961
and as happens <most of the time or> [//] many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood . 698135_707145
&-um whether it's baseball or [/] or golf or a soccer ball . 708138_716388
it goes in a way that it shouldn't have gone . 716965_720685
so ‡ he's kicking this soccer ball . 721128_722898
and it accidently crashes through a window . 722920_726390
I'm going to say it's a neighbor's window . 727775_730065
and all_of_a_sudden it +//. 731485_733945
the neighbor is sitting in a chair . 734591_737961
and this ball comes through . 738516_740706
and knocks over a lamp . 740721_742201
and then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window . 743396_747086
and is looking outside the broken window to the young man . 747508_752518
and being that it's a neighbor I think that he knows that accidents do happen . 753265_760985
and he's not happy what happened . 761785_765135
but he's understandable [//] &+u understanding that it was just an accident . 765743_771613
and is not going to be upset with the boy . 772013_775553
"but is just going to tell him +""/. 776286_777456"

well ‡ (.) little boy is [/] is with his mom . 802015_808045
and his mom is (.) sort_of insisting that he [//] &+ta even_though it's not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast . 808061_817291
and he should take this umbrella . 817465_819375
&=head
they'd rather have the rain probably and play in the rain . [+ exc] 825221_828021
but he's insisting that he does not wanna take the umbrella . 828073_832323
so ‡ as he's walking +... 833400_834850
looks like to school (be)cause he's got a backpack on . 836638_839188
&-uh it starts raining . 840071_842921
it's okay at the very beginning (be)cause it's just drizzling . 843630_846250
but then all_of_a_sudden it is really coming down . 846568_850658
<so he's> [//] you can see the puddles on the ground . 851150_853980
so ‡ he's trying to cover his head with his hand . 854283_857343
and he's turned around to go back home . 857961_860401
and he comes in . 861466_862896
and he's very sad because he's soaked . 862920_865310
and his mother looks at him . 866266_867996
and is disappointed that he didn't take the umbrella . 868481_870941
but now he realizes that his mother was right . 871683_874973
and he should've taken the umbrella . 875018_876758
and he goes out using the umbrella . 877233_880773
and though it's pouring down rain he's now keeping dry . 880795_884275
okay ‡ the story of Cinderella . 887080_889190
I've forgotten some of it but anyway . 890798_892548
&-um it's a story of a <family that has> [//] mother that has three daughters . 893236_899596
two seem to be &-uh mean sisters to their one sister who is Cinderella . 901163_910193
they always have fun . 911243_912793
and they dress up . 912933_914623
they go places . 914646_915816
&-um <she is left> [//] Cinderella is left to do the chores the hard work . 916545_921555
feeding the animals cooking cleaning the house . 922031_925931
&-um then they get an invitation to a ball . 926948_935128
the prince has invited everybody to come to the ball . 935375_940225
and so they're all excited because they're gonna go to the ball . 940775_944715
well ‡ Cinderella gets dressed . 945486_947466
and her sisters get dressed . 948038_951378
and they take some of their things that she was going to wear (.) for themselves . 952036_958296
and so now Cinderella really doesn't wanna go because she doesn't look pretty . 958358_963248
and so the other two sisters go to the ball . 964201_966581
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother comes . 967095_970675
"and says +""/. 971136_971456"
"+"" you're going to the ball . 971733_972903"
and waves her magic wand . 973536_976446
and Cinderella looks beautiful . 976720_978340
and so she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball . 979068_984038
and she has on beautiful silver slippers . 985110_990250
and so all_of_a_sudden she gets to the ball . 991100_995090

<and she says> [//] all_of_a_sudden it's midnight . 998835_1001825

the prince finds the shoe . 1018476_1020456
