<her dog> [//] the neighbor dog comes outside and chases the cat up the tree . 31135_37705

one time a long time ago when we lived in Colorado we had a little dog . 84548_92118

and (.) I had three boys then and the dog and a husband . 94691_100251

and my left foot (.) bent . 108873_111563
I heard it crack . 112033_114163
and it made a snapping sound . 114343_115993
and I knew that was not a good thing to hear . 116050_118880
so ‡ I went down on the ground . 119016_121026
sat down (im)mediately . 121540_122930
and got off my foot . 122980_124190

and we would sit out there and have our barbeque and that . 152016_155496
so ‡ I climbed up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kind_o(f) dragging it . 155588_161498
I would not step on the other foot that was broken . 161521_164551
so ‡ I got upstairs and went onto the couch . 165660_168400
and I layed down . 168530_169440

and he told Steve . 208178_210008
and Steve told his wife the nurse what happened . 210441_214871
since I wouldn't do what my son told me to do he &+s ran off to find out some other advice . 215491_222071
so ‡ the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor . 222383_225513

&+n nurse would know what to do not me or not my son . 234208_238388
