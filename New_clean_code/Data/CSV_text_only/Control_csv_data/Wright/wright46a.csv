a very large party has been planned . 3060_4600
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy . 5116_6836
an(d) good friends were invited over . 7141_8671
well ‡ (.) somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after [//] of the cake after climbing up onto the table . 9781_21161
mom sees this and is very very upset . 22350_25080
very frustrated . 25100_26390
an(d) grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch . 26701_29901
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy . 30946_37546
to see this cake having much much less than it's sposta have &=laughs . 37568_46388
first you &=hands
lightly toast them . 51881_52531
bring the peanut butter an(d) jelly to the table &=ges
apply jelly to one side &=ges
an(d) peanut butter &=ges
an(d) then bringing them together so_that the jelly and the peanut butter meet . 65993_70213
put t(h)em together &=hands
and eat it &=laughs . 72003_73733
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the p_x +... 74000_83950
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck (.) was kept up . 84240_89410
an(d) there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time . 89666_94526
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible . 94725_104945
but (.) this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck . 105370_115920
an(d) as I left (.) &=laughs by kicking my left leg up an(d) over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed o(f) the truck . 116300_131350
I was lightly tupped [
(be)cause I had only been moved about a [//] an inch an(d) a half . 145118_147078
&=sighs if I had had this awareness it would've been much easier for me to push away &-uh from the truck and sustain less injury than I had .
as that my left leg was kicked up an(d) about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries I've ever &+u had . 158630_172300
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest . 172693_176983
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate . 178570_185470
then falling down further the back of the bed . 185488_188268
then the bumper . 188491_189371
and (.) in my attention anyhow almost &=laughs eons later &=sighs after I had thought that the last of the contusions were (.) &=sighs occurring the same spot &=sighs on the under side of my left calf hit the [/] &-uh the [/] &+gar the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle . 190265_214825
the bed <of the> [/] &+v of the vehicle itself just &=hand
an(d) coming down underneath &=ges
well ‡ this hit in the same spot one two three four . 240440_243620
and &-uh I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries [
&+fr at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy an(d) sprained my ankle .
an(d) their &-uh discretion chose to take me to the hospital . 256803_260313
an(d) they're my drill sergeants so I let them do that &-um instead of saying it's just a sprained ankle .
and finally they got well upset with that an(d) told me to stop . 266133_270383
well ‡ &+t I immediately went into shock . 271271_273741
and being in basic training &-uh there is much suggestion to do as one is told . 274330_280420
an(d) a myriad [//] &+f &-uh manner of forms &=laughs directly and indirectly . 281616_287246
so ‡ &-uh my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the a^mount of pain and &-uh &-uh damage that I had just gone through . 287823_302643
&=sighs I actually hadta walk the next morning to &-uh the clinic on a very very swollen calf . 303036_316796
so ‡ swollen in_fact that I was unable to take the b_d_u's which are the &-uh battle dress uniform . 317941_323581
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants &-uh from being able to be lifted up &=ges
my calf was so swollen . 332591_333731
&-uh unfortunately that was the major holiday of that &-um &=laughs &-uh whole fort . 334803_340953
combination of its anniversary and Fourth_of_July . 341726_344456
so ‡ the crew at the clinic on that Saturday +//. 346233_347683
which then being a Saturday busses never ran &-uh so I hadta walk about two an(d) a half miles on that condition . 349228_355168
did a very cursory and &-um less than effective look at my injury . 355878_361048
an(d) described me as &-uh rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches . 362273_369933
<the next> [//] <an(d) without> [//] an(d) &=ges
the next day &-uh because it was a holiday and &-uh through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given k_p duty .
and &-uh the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing k_p because everyone else had been working .
&-uh an(d) I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself +//. 397816_400646
I was in shock continually this entire time . 402541_404131
so ‡ I never volunteered for any of the k_p duties . 405733_408373
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and &-uh sprained almost knee . 408658_422708
well ‡ regardless to say as I got back on Monday the &-uh staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went an(d) got a physician's assistant . 423376_432936
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and &-uh started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms . 433001_442871
and &-uh pretty much I got through it an(d) went beyond through very basic physical therapies . 444613_450063
and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic [
yes &=head
actually ‡ I
for the last &-uh year I've been a life coach for a developmentally disabled man where I live . 483265_490375
and his developmental disablement has come about because of &-uh &+a actual large set of circumstance . 491035_500605
&-um traumatic &-uh psychological and physiological experiences have pretty much left him with <the mental state> [//] a mental emotional state of a very high strung five year old .
and &-uh various communication (.) miscues . 516988_522078
an(d) the lack of my &-um focus to make sure &=ges
and to [/] &-uh to better his activities has created a [/] a very large &=ges
and &-uh at this moment I have hadta disconnect from being a life coach for this individual .
in the past reiterations an(d) nonreactive acceptance of whatever form of communication this individual has relayed .
an(d) then full discourse &+a about the perspectives and the [/] the missing pieces of the [/] &-uh the sides of the total experiences happening . 565348_578578
repeatedly and calmly &-uh delivered to this gentleman has helped . 579808_586728
though current situations an(d) my own revealing of larger circumstance has led me to necessitively [
yes &=heads
&=sighs the only [/] only thing that's coming up to my mind right now was a trip to Hoover_Dam when I was young .
and I had &-uh at that time my [/] &+sist my youngest sister . 635265_635755
she was about four an(d) a half . 636038_637748

an(d) [/] an(d) saw all [/] all the insides &=ges
well ‡ when we got back up <as I> [/] as I looked out across the bridge an(d) saw the very very deep hole &=ges
(wh)en the water gets too high &=ges
I got an immediate &-uh sensation of fear . 659480_662050
prolly [
&-um and I immediately saw my sister . 672440_674660
an(d) I just felt horrible of [//] about potential of her being drug down &=ges
an(d) then spit out the side . 684250_685220
(be)cause <this thing> [/] this thing is about a [/] a good hundred yards wide an(d) very very very deep . 686341_691161
