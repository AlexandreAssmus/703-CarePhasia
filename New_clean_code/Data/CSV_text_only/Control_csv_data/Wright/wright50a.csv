&-uh well ‡ it's birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old .
and &-uh maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite out_of cake which he obviously knew he wasn't sposta do because he's hiding under the couch . 16440_16730
and the boy's crying . 16730_16950
and the mother is waving the &-uh broom threateningly .
and the guests are looking a_little startled .
and that's the end of that . 23748_24818
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich . [+ exc]
get [//] hafta get two pieces of bread .
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top . 34631_34681
and put them together . 34681_34891
well ‡ this is fairly minor but many years ago <I was> [//] &-uh when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was &-uh &+w cleaning a glass .
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand . 69438_69488
and &-uh it [/] it started to bleed all over the place . 71045_71085
but I was also pregnant at the time .
and I don't know if that had somethin(g) to do with it .
but I had this weirdest feeling .
and my husband came in and I just passed out .
it was the first and last and only time I've ever done that .
I guess <the most> [//] <the time> [//] the [//] &+ti most of the instances I've had with people that have trouble communicating it's usually more of a language barrier .
&-uh I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man &-um who had a stutter .
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too .
but you_know I found it so hard to [/] to talk to him that &-uh I tended to avoid him in a way . 110451_110491
&-uh so ‡ I can't say that <I really> [//] other_than saying “hi Julio how are you” I never really went much beyond that .
and plus at the time <I couldn't excuse me> [//] I couldn't hear well .
so ‡ I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway .
so +...
that's about it . 111696_111916
one time I was just &+m moseying down the street in a car and &-uh was preparing to turn left .
and I thought I had my signal on .
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough .
but then somebody else who I don't even know where he came from I think he was walking out_of the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done .
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something .
&=laughs thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didn't [//] you_know wasn't upset .
"he just said +""/. 151690_151740"
"+"" oh ‡ I ran into you ."
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness .
oh apparently &-uh this girl has fallen into some water that's [//] maybe there's a flood or a storm .
and a man &-uh is trying to rescue her .
apparently she's been holding onto a tree branch .
and he's trying to get a hold of her .
but she won't let go of the tree branch probably .
about all I can say . [+ exc] 178401_179791
well ‡ hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window .
it's really improbable . [+ exc]
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp .
&-um but &-uh obviously the boy has ran away because the man can't see him when he goes in at the window .
this is kind_of improbable too . [+ exc] 200090_200120
the mother wants to give the [/] the boy an [/] an umbrella .
he doesn't want it . 204735_204835
so ‡ he goes off and gets wet . 205733_207003
&-um this is the improbable part . [+ exc] 209305_209395
he doesn't like getting wet . 210000_210280
he runs back to his mom who's mad .
and he's wet so he takes the umbrella .
now my son would love getting wet . [+ exc]
&-um &=laughs looking at that I can hear the music &=laughs from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old .
&-um Cinderella &-uh is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother .
&-uh wicked and stepmother always go together . [+ exc]
she has <two ugly> [/] &+sist two &+ug ugly stepsisters .
I can't remember their names . [+ exc]
one of them (i)s Drizella or something equally ugly .
&-um anyway &-uh Cinderella is forced [/] forced to work like a drudge for the [/] the rest of the family who are cruel to her .
&-um but an edict comes from the &-uh +... 254706_254976
I think I'm spinning tales here . [+ exc]
an edict comes from the prince that they're going to have a ball .
and every maiden is &-uh eligible to go to the ball .
&-uh but Cinderella's mother [//] stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready .
&-uh and at last the girls drive away &-uh in their carriage and Cinderella's left behind &-um crying in the cinders .
&-um then the little mice come to her aid and start &-uh +...
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working .
&-um and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because &-uh yeah they didn't want her to go . 317331_317381
so ‡ then the fairy godmother enters the picture .
&-um this is not in sequence at all . [+ exc]
&=laughs &-um and of_course she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the [/] the pumpkin carriage .
&=laughs oh yeah . [+ exc]
"and she goes off to the ball where of_course she is the bell of the ball, meets the prince ."
the prince falls in love with her on sight .
but at twelve o'clock she hasta run off .
she leaves her slipper . 328263_329133
&-um I guess that story goes all the way to the end . [+ exc]
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the [/] the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper .
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they don't fit .
so ‡ he find [* m
here's one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree .
and then this &-uh the [/] the father has climbed up to rescue the cat .
and now he needs to be rescued .
for some reason (.) the ladder is on the ground .
and nobody has put it up there .
so ‡ here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad .
that's all . [+ exc]
