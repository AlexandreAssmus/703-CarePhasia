okay . [+ exc] 2630_2720
a little girl was playing outside in the yard with her kitty and her puppy . 21705_21715
and suddenly she realized her kitty had gone up into the tree and was lounging on the branch .
the birds were singing . 21715_22445
so ‡ it must have been in the springtime . 22702_23642
and she was very upset . 25261_25971
she'd been riding her tricycle also . 26145_28055
and she was very upset . 29125_29485
she went and got her dad . 30111_31561
her dad came out . 31710_32520
climbed up in the tree . 32606_32936
but he got scared . 33706_34036
couldn't [//] the kitty was on a branch he couldn't reach . 35940_38550
and so he was sitting there and didn't know how to get back down .
the dog was barking at the dad . 42020_43870
and someone [//] mommy probably (.) realized what was going on .
she called the fire department . 49100_49740
and the fire department came with a ladder . 50441_52511
actually ‡ it looks like a ladder laying there . 52956_54906
so ‡ dad probably climbed up on the ladder . 55536_57006
and then the ladder fell down . 57570_58080
and he couldn't <get up> [//] get back down . 58590_59430
okay ‡ &=sighs you get two pieces of bread . 66509_69689
and you get &-um your peanut butter and your jelly . 70655_73895
and first you put the peanut butter on one slice of bread . 77538_81648
and then you put the jelly on the other slice of bread . 82398_87048
and then you place the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and jelly touching each other . 93261_93751
and then you slice it in half . 93871_94731
well ‡ it was in
and it was April first . 102860_103460
and &-um I has [//] was working . 103845_107685
&-um and I had been ill for a couple of months . 107758_112888
going to <the doctors> [//] different doctors and doing tests . 114166_116846
and &-um I wasn't getting any better . 117070_120380
and I went to the doctor that day . 120600_122190
and he took one look at me . 123040_124910
"and said +""/. 125098_125188"
"+"" you're going to the hospital . 125670_126900"
and so the hospital was right next door . 129460_130139
and I went next door . 130288_131278
and &-um they admitted me . 132956_134156
and I called work to tell them where I was . 137941_138651
and that I wasn't gonna be in . 139658_140178
but I was so kind_of out_of it I didn't even know where I was . 141011_143541
and &=laughs they couldn't figure it out for quite awhile . 145053_145923
and &-um (.) I was in the hospital for a week with them doing intraveneous [
which I've been on antibotics [
and they did all kinds o(f) tests . 158056_159286
they couldn't find out what was wrong . 159331_160971
but I was slowly dying . 161043_164133
and they knew that . 165036_165656
and &-um that I was filled with infection . 166511_169011
and they couldn't locate it . 169726_170296
and so finally a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory . 170748_176618
and I agreed &=sighs because I knew that I was not gonna make it . 179210_180740
and so they went in . 181003_181323
and what had happened I had &-like peritonitis . 182602_184682
and &-um I'd had diverticulitis . 185090_188290
and one of them burst &=hands
and that would have been peritonitis with the infection bu
and they [//] &+h it had sealed it except for a &=ges
that &=ges
and so I was &+w I guess what they call septic . 211150_212700
and so they did the surgery . 214141_214721
and it was a long long surgery . 215170_216820
and &-um I ended up with a &+colo <colonoscopy no> [//] colostomy [/] colostomy . 218710_223660
it was the bag . 224093_224403
and &-um then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that . 224675_229245
&-um and then six months later I was able to go back in the hospital (be)cause they had removed a section of my colon .
went back in the hospital . 240876_241216
and they resectioned [
and I was able to not have the bag anymore . 246126_248536
&=sighs so ‡ I can remember all of that &=laughs . 250406_253786
and [/] and it was life threatening . 255510_256920
but [//] &-um and I knew that . 257399_257459
and [/] and that's why I'm not afraid to die now because it was very peaceful . 260438_262838
<it wasn't> [/] it wasn't like a scary thing so +... 262956_267606
yes . 273453_273483
well ‡ it's still on going . 277576_278066
my mother as I said is eighty eight . 280018_281908
&-um she has a pretty profound hearing loss . 282045_286465
and has for probably &-uh at_least ten years . 286650_290280
but she refuses &-uh ta [
so ‡ we have hadta deal with this . 296215_300165
&-um so ‡ when I take her +//. 300438_303358
and I'm the one that's responsible for taking her to all of her doctors' appointments .
and when she's in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth .
and so I hafta yell at her all the time . 312500_315120
and it's so rude and awful to be yelling at her . 316100_320500
and even when I explain to the doctors they still turn and talk ta [
&-um and that's &-uh frustrating for her . 328080_329340
&-um and once I leave I'm feeling really tense and frustrated because I've been yelling &=points
<and our bodies> [//] when &=points
and my mother also is getting some dementia . 344896_346946
<and so the combination> [//] &+a what I've realized is more to just allow her to talk .
and not really have a conversation with her anymore . 354950_357420
and that's very sad . 357750_358880
&=laughs it's [//] &+i I guess it's not that unusual &+fo +//. 361583_364893
and I've already told my boys . 365991_366441
and I've had my hearing test here that I won't do that to them . 369511_370911
you_know ‡ it's really really bad . 370931_372941
&=laughs yes . 375000_375280
and right from the beginning so [>] that you_know you don't hafta make that huge you_know &+li . 375975_382265
and [/] and I don't think that it works as well when it's done later on you_know . 382585_388165
&-um so ‡ anyway . 389383_389583
&-hm I'm sure there has been . 393860_394510
<well yeah> [<] &-um obviously <I've got> [//] with two boys +... 404031_409331
&-um they're adults now . 409496_412056
but with them growing up there was you_know always something going on . 412471_416741
&-um (be)cause they were getting into stuff different things . 417303_420663
&-um probably one of the times that was really scary that &+co first comes to mind is my oldest boy .
&-um when he was maybe
and they were doing swim lessons and [//] &+i in the neighbor's yard . 433510_438990
&-uh &+wher with [//] the pool was next door . 439111_441641
<and the neighbor> [//] <and the> [/] and the instructor would come out to the pool . 441900_446640
so ‡ he was very familiar with the pool . 446930_448380
and there was two friends there that +//. 448790_449790
and so we were over there &-um <just as a> [//] &+pa at a party . 450365_455075
and so he had been practicing going off the board &=ges . 459180_459850
it was just a little board . 461050_461220
but he'd been practicing doing that and he wanted to do that . 461373_463873
but then he got scared just as he started t(o) jump off . 466845_467635
and he jumped toward the side &=ges
and so he hit his chin &=points
and it just opened it up . 476540_476930
and &-um of_course he was hysterical . 477551_479791
and I was getting pretty scared . 481166_481626
<but it> [//] &+wa you could see the bone . 482091_483111
I_mean it was really really scary . 483158_484508
and so we had ta [
and &+w he wasn't knocked out . 488178_489028
so ‡ we took him to the hospital into emergency . 489125_491685
and then they [//] of_course they hadta do stitches . 492110_493570
and &-um yeah &=laughs it was kind_of scary . 494048_496848
but they survive those things most of the time . 497306_501916
&=laughs .
(...) there was a family that was going home . 516171_536031
&-um and there was &-um some water in the road where they were going to cross . 536668_543928
&-um and the father decided to go ahead . 544701_547991
and that they could make it . 549065_549265
but as they got (a)bout half way across the water was too deep . 551978_554548
and started washing the car away . 555728_557178
the windows were down luckily . 557290_558930
and they were all getting [//] &+ou crawling out the window . 559480_561240
and some people they had called nine-one-one . 561943_562603
and there was a &+res first responder that came . 565340_567360
had on a life vest . 568486_569406
and grabbed a hold of a limb of a tree . 570933_572683
and was reaching out to save the little girl that was in the churning water that &-um had gone under but then had come back up . 573740_584840
and he was able to rescue her . 585401_586841
(...) there was a young man that was learning to play soccer . 596291_612501
and he was on the soccer team . 613520_614090
and he was excited . 614613_615153
and he was practicing with his kicks in the front yard . 615750_618530
and he kicked it really good . 618943_620913
only thing he kicked it too hard . 621005_622625
and wasn't careful about where he was aiming . 623120_625680
and it hit the window . 626366_627706
and he had kicked it so hard that it broke the window . 628688_630858
his dad was sitting inside when the soccer ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp .
&-um and he jumped up and grabbed the soccer ball . 638400_640080
and looked out the window . 641990_642200
and saw that it was his son that was practicing . 644005_645655
and so he understood . 647580_647900
he was [//] &-uh had been a boy before . 648260_650270
and knew that it was just a window and it could be repaired . 650848_653808
(...) &=sighs the little boy was getting ready ta [
he had his backpack on . 678930_679150
"and Mom told him +""/. 681298_681668"
"+"" it looks like and I had &+h read in the paper that it's going to rain today . 682530_686210"

"+"" I don't need an umbrella today . 688935_690695"
"+"" it looks beautiful outside . 691116_691446"
and so he went . 692626_693146
she wasn't happy about it . 693180_694810
but he started walking and was on his way ta [
and suddenly it started sprinkling . 699121_699911
and he was getting wet . 700550_701080
and he went running back through the puddles an(d) through the rain back to the house . 701783_705353
and he was all wet . 706370_706470
"mom looked at him and said +""/. 706553_708683"
