and we had &-um gone to a bar and played pool and met up with some of my friend's friends . 80445_86745
and he was walking his date back to her car and we were waiting at the top of the hill for him . 87098_90528
he got about halfway up the hill . 90713_92553
and two guys &-like ran across the street and just started beating up on him . 93003_96343
so ‡ my husband and I we go running down there . 97325_99515
I am on the phone with nine-one-one . 99753_100933
my husband kinda jumps in ends up getting hit . 101371_103861
but my husband's incredibly calm and collected . 105415_108485
and he stands up <an(d) a> [/] an(d) a minute later &-like &+a we're running up to the top of this hill . 108691_113231
and one of the guys is lying in the gutter . 113470_115080
so ‡ we get up to the top of the hill and there happens to be a cop car . 116033_118583
and the cop gets out . 119235_119865
and there's two cops . 120118_120878
and &-uh one of (th)em goes down with the [/] the guy laying in the street . 121630_124170
and the other guy stays with us and asks what happened . 124660_126830
and the friend tells the story about how he's [//] he got punched . 127025_129115
"and the cop asks +""/. 129739_130219"
"+"" well ‡ what happened to that guy down there ? 130407_132038"

&=recoils and we just &-like looked at him . 139183_140093
we were just totally shocked . 140141_141321
and &-uh yeah my husband had a pocket knife and pulled it out and stabbed this guy . 141773_145323
and &=shrugs <he was> [//] the guy was okay . 147130_148100

an(d) +...
yeah . 153670_153820
but we all &=shrugs ended up okay besides the guys had some black eyes and a couple stitches . 153995_158175
so ‡ <that was> [/] that was really scary not knowing what was going to happen . 158222_162132
yeah [=! whispering] . 162655_162795

and &-um they challenged us the first semester to go out into the &-um deaf population and &-um &-uh go to an event . 200046_209906
and so I actually ended up going to The_Vagina_Monologues all done in sign language . 210215_214425
and it was really a f
and &-um they did a voiceover on it . 223531_225571
but &-uh <it was> [/] it was interesting afterwards there was a [//] &-uh &-like a meet-and-greet . 225711_230381
and I went in and I was [//] you_know had my glass of wine and like my snacks and (.) was you_know trying to communicate with people with &-like a very limited amount of sign language . 231258_239388
I had been in class you_know maybe six weeks or something and just really feeling at a loss you_know only being able to say a few words . 239846_247926
I felt like a child &=nods . 248030_249470

on a very sunny summer afternoon three girls went out into the desert . 270325_274945
and they were out behind their house in the desert . 276401_278611
they were playing in a wash . 278630_280090
and even_though there were no storm clouds there a storm came up in the mountains and flooded the wash . 281700_286190
and the three little girls were swept away in the water . 286896_289666
and one of the girls &-um ended up finding a tree branch and held onto it for dear life . 291076_296446
and finally a rescue helicopter came along because some other people had seen the girls in the wash . 297471_303241
and one of the &-um rescue workers &=ges

one day a little boy was out in his neighborhood playing with a soccer ball . 331868_335048
and he kicked it really really hard . 336231_337381
and it went through the window of his neighbor's house . 337550_339900
and the neighbor was jus(t) sitting there watching some television . 340620_342960
all_of_a_sudden the soccer ball comes in . 342981_344461
so ‡ he gets up . 345148_345908
and he goes to the window and he looks out . 346275_347985
but he doesn't see anyone because the little boy got scared and ran away . 348000_352400
(o)kay . [+ exc]
there was a mom and a little boy . 365686_367866
and they were always arguing about the little boy taking his umbrella . 368268_372128
"and he always said +""/. 372655_373115"
"+"" Mom ‡ I don't need it . 373306_374616"
"+"" I'm fine . 374730_375330"
"+"" stop telling me what to do . 375401_376471"
so ‡ (.) &+s just another typical day he leaves the house thinking that he's gonna be fine . 376563_381973
and it begins to rain . 382250_383130
and he splashes through puddles . 383700_384920
and he ends up soaked . 385121_386101
and finally he comes home . 386440_387490

"+"" Mom ‡ I'm soaking wet . 388133_389543"

there once was a beautiful girl named Cinderella . 403976_406036
and she lived in a house near the castle with her father . 407006_410046
her father traveled quite a bit . 410900_412120
and while he was away he fell in love with a woman who had two less than beautiful stepdaughters . 413211_419151

but after her dad left &=shakes
and they made Cinderella cook . 430280_431670
and they made Cinderella clean and do their laundry and [/] and just do everything for them . 431888_437828
but Cinderella she was a (.) determined young woman . 439676_444086
she had a good relationship with her pets . 444331_445881
this is not the best version of this story . [+ exc] 445933_447793
&=laughs and [/] and so (.) she remained happy and was [/] was always cheery . 450805_457285
meanwhile ‡ at the castle the prince is &-um in trouble with his dad because he hasn't found a wife . 457905_464505
and so they decide to hold a big ball and have all the women <in the> [/] in the kingdom come so_that he can find a wife . 465241_471121
so ‡ Cinderella is very excited about this . 472006_474706
and she sets off to fix up one of her dresses . 475021_477821
and she sews and sews and sews all night on top of having to cook and clean and do all these other things . 478105_482325
and when the not so pretty s
and they &=ges rip up her dress . 486081_487241
and they &=ges tear off her jewelry . 487445_489285
and Cinderella is very sad . 489555_490985
so ‡ <off the> [//] &-uh &=ges
and Cinderella's crying until her fairy godmother comes . 496506_499066
and the fairy godmother &-um &=waves
not a wagon . [+ exc] 510075_510485
not a cart . [+ exc] 510790_511110
having a moment here . [+ exc] 511606_512395
and [/] &-um and turns the [/] &-uh the mice into beautiful horses . 514054_518745
and off &=ges
and of_course the prince falls in love with her because she's so beautiful . 520210_522990
but the fairy godmother told her at the stroke &=ges of midnight it all goes away . 523785_527456
so ‡ &=ges just as it [/] it starts chiming midnight she runs out the door . 527548_531838
one of her [/] her glass slippers falls off . 532216_534136
and she runs off into the night . 534451_535831
so ‡ now the prince is in love with this woman . 536753_538573
and all he has is this little glass slipper . 538810_540480
and so the kingdom begins &-uh a search for the girl whose foot fits in the glass slipper . 540741_546351
and so when they go to Cinderella's house &-um the stepmother tries to sabotage it &=fingers
but of_course they do . 556001_557351
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after . 557598_559448
once upon a time &=laughs there was a little girl named Sally . 561211_564501
and she had a beloved cat named Fluffy . 565085_566905
and Fluffy got chased up in the tree by a dog that lived down the street . 567995_572405
so ‡ her father came along and saw that she was quite upset . 573518_576408
and he got a ladder . 576653_577413
and he got it up and &+g climbed up in the tree to get Fluffy down for little Sally . 578635_583315
but when he got up there the ladder fell . 584341_586051
and now both Fluffy and dad were stuck in the tree . 586638_589358
so ‡ they hadta call the fire department . 590313_591913
