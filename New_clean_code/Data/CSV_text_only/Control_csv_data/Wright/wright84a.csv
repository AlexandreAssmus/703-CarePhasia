I was having a real hard time for a few nights &-uh sleeping and breathing . 85856_91006
and I would sit up a_lot . 91021_92941
and in the morning when I got up my wife Angela said that she had called the doctor and made an appointment because I had been saying no no ‡ there's nothing wrong . 93825_108495
it's just my allergies . 108540_110020
and she was tired of hearing me up all night . 110905_115625

and she checked me out . 127598_128918

and they said well you have congestive heart failure . 138448_143238
