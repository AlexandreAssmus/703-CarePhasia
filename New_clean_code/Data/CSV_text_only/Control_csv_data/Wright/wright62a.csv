apparently a birthday &-uh &-uh celebration is planned . 60_4920
and &-uh there is a cake with four candles on the table . 4973_11083
&-um we see on the right &-uh two women &-uh &-uh one already in [/] in the room the other entering through the doorway .
and each has a child . 25843_27203
the women already inside has a little boy . 28042_30402
and the women just entering is with a little girl . 57965_58105
<both of> [//] both children who are entering &-uh have wrapped presents presumably for the party . 58705_58715
"&-um when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it, a pretty good size portion of it ."
and &-uh there are pieces of cake on the table . 58715_62285
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to <what we perc(ieve)> [//] what we see as a dog sort_of hiding underneath the sofa .
"and the hostess apparently, the women who's giving the party, is standing there facing the dog ."
she has a broom in her hand . 84057_85537
she appears to be very angry . 85589_87209
and the [/] &-uh the birthday boy &-uh &=laughs we can't tell what he's doing . 90017_95907
he seems to be &+w +//. 96109_97159
I can't tell weather he's wiping his eyes . 97232_99222
his [/] &+mou &+hi his &-uh mouth is wide open apparently &-uh to call or do something . 99269_106699
and <looks as though the wom(an)> [//] the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom .
oh my favorite food &=laughs . [+ exc] 111757_118207
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . [+ exc]
my way or the common way ? [+ exc] 122891_125011
&=laughs well ‡ we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all . 129388_136728
but use a good bread . 136869_139479
sometimes it's nice to toast it first . 140073_142863
&-uh on the other hand it's not necessary . 143673_147293
it's whatever you feel like at the time . 147353_149023
well ‡ &-uh having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading .
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first .
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it . [+ exc] 170570_170630
it works better . 170630_170870
spread [/] &-uh spread the +//. 173177_173797
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread .
well ‡ after that &-um a little bit of butter . 178555_180715
not too much but some . 183296_185936
&-uh tends to help &-uh make the thing a little bit &+m more moist than usual . 186161_191661
and on top of that goes the jelly . 192981_196391
"now &-uh having done so , what a_lot_of people fail to have ever learned is &-uh you_know regardless of how much &-uh bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof o(f) your mouth ."
well ‡ there's an easy way around that . 217362_219932
most people don't know my special secret . 220343_221433
my special secret is lettuce . 223056_226056
nice &-uh leaves of iceberg lettuce . 226219_229899
just a couple is just right to do it . 230947_232767
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had .
I got a_lot of (th)em but <I can tell you> [//] I'll tell you this one . 237387_245417
&-um when the Korean_War started &-uh I was twenty one and One_a . 246723_252083
and &-um in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself &-uh <in a> [//] in [/] &+ar in a stinky rice paddy &-uh shooting people &-uh <I arranged or> [//] I [/] I applied for the Air_force's &-uh Aviation Cadet program . 275899_276369
&-um and &-uh <I was> [/] I was appointed . 276369_279889
I finally got an appointment to an air [/] air cadet class . 282987_285977
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia .
and &-uh in those times +... 290553_295983
well ‡ I never did &-uh do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid . 318893_318963
&-uh <in the> [//] I was still <in the> [/] <in the> [//] within <the very first> [//] &-uh <I guess> [//] it was just the first phase of [/] of training .
&-uh I had already &+d had some flying instruction . 318963_322353
and &-uh I awoke one Saturday morning . 324245_328195
&-uh no ‡ actually it was a Sunday morning . 328291_331401
I awoke feeling hungover . 331491_333961
I knew the hungover feeling . 334227_336227
&-uh but <I had not ha(d)> [/] I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then . 342762_342772

"+"" boy_oh_boy this is terrible . 348196_348726"
so ‡ <I kind_of stayed &+ar you_know just> [//] I hung back all day . 349653_352883
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover . 353359_358119
well ‡ I knew that I didn't feel well enough to fly . 358197_362357
I was not safe . 362916_363166
so ‡ I put myself into sick call . 364188_366878
well ‡ <this was> [/] this was a civilian contract flying school .
and they had a &+f infirmary but <only a> [//] you_know <it wasn't> [/] it wasn't a hospital . 371151_374801
so ‡ I found myself in the infirmary . 376605_379985
well ‡ I wasn't feeling too good but I wasn't feeling quite as bad as I had .
you_know ‡ little by little it sort_of left . 385949_387269
"and it got to the point where you_know the doctors would come in, they'd looked at me, and they'd say +""/."
"+"" well ‡ you don't have any jaundice but your liver and your &-uh &+s &-uh spleen are enlarged ."

well ‡ he did . 435852_436042
didn't seem to make very much difference . 436968_438338
upshot of it all was that they gave up . 440176_441896
<they didn't> [//] they couldn't begin to imagine . 442489_445149
"they had never seen a situation like this <with an> [/] with a [//] &-uh an &-uh enlarged and palpable liver, palpable spleen, and no jaundice ."
it wasn't anything they had ever seen before . 456483_459313

and I was feeling pretty good . 496029_497199
so ‡ I'd wander around at night . 497315_499405

well ‡ one morning the flight surgeon came around . 508315_513485
didn't find me in my bed . 514048_516578

and we had a good laugh . 596360_597660
that's the story &=laughs . 599127_600497
yes . 609154_609184
I think I already have . 613046_614726
not at all . 616675_617235
I have a hearing problem . 618047_619187
"and &-uh you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU &-uh &-uh gave a [/] &-uh &-uh &-uh a workshop over time, it was several weeks, where we come over and we'd learn all about hearing loss ."
well ‡ it ended up with me being a regular patient here . 636174_641004
and &-uh what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss . 641348_647328
well ‡ &-uh even now &-uh I find that many people particularly young women &-uh they've been taught to talk through their nose real fast .

&=imit

that's how I handle that . 700274_703394
you bet I have . 710232_711402
the beginning is &-uh <this occured in> [/] &-um &=laughs this occurred in &-uh Louisiana . 715470_728670
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana .
and &-um &-uh we were then flying . 732573_736473
I was a fighter pilot . 736561_738281
we were then flying the [/] &+sw the &-uh swept wing version of the F@l eighty four known as the F@l eighty four F@l . 745461_745471
&-uh and <we were> [//] &-um we had been <out or> [//] &-uh on a [//] you_know a series of missions . 745471_754541
&-uh and we were just returning to the base . 758320_760050
well ‡ &-uh actually I was by myself . 760123_762903
"I was flying solo, not in formation with anybody . 763011_766381"
<it was> [/] it was <just a> [/] &-uh just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane . 773981_774071
and also proficiency . 774631_775801
just practice . 776537_776917
practice this practice that . 777321_778741
well ‡ &-uh in those times we [/] &-uh &-uh we had a [/] a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at &-uh three hundred and forty knots air speed . 831323_831793
"<when directly over the air> [//] when we were directly over the end of the runway, we'd cut our power back, &=ges"
and &-uh &-uh that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees . 832473_836153
after that the airplane is slow enough so_that <we would> [/] &-uh we would have not have touched the throttle .
in other words it cut power completely . 844256_845476
and just bring it on around &=ges
well ‡ &-um the [/] &-uh &+th &-um the [/] the legs <of the> [//] <of a> [//] &+f of the pattern are called the approach . 854043_866343
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind . 868049_870679
ninety degrees from that is the base . 873621_874341
and &+f &+f following that is the final . 875074_877494
so ‡ <it's just &+frel if> [//] &=ges
well ‡ here I am on the base leg with no power . 881471_883711
all the garbage is out . 885252_887022
we call it garbage . 887826_888426
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear . 888922_891422
and all_of_a_sudden I'm about <I don't know> [//] three four hundred feet off the ground . 891488_896118
no ‡ &+m more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet . 896865_900105
something like that . 900168_900808
I'm not really sure . 900825_901635
the airplane started to shutter . 901736_902556
&-uh shuttering is the sign of a stall . 903928_906808
<that means the air> [//] &+w <when an> [/] when an airplane stalls it means it's falling out_of the sky .
and I knew immediately people do not survive these [//] a situation like this . 918782_919002
and yet <I automatically didn't even> [//] I [/] I almost didn't have time to think . 919342_925272
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway . 934338_934348
I didn't want that to happen . 934348_935198
well ‡ what did I do ? 936592_938402
I gave it full power which did not catch in time . 938459_941799
I pulled in the [/] the landing gear . 942923_945953
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone . 946465_956025
well ‡ with low r_p_m there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended .
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down . 966996_971016
I overshot the runway . 971168_972228
but <I wouldn't> [//] I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side .
and &-um &=laughs the F@l eighty four F@l has a [/] a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that &+th the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left &=hand
you can't predict it but it will do that . 994447_995307
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe (be)cause its a jet .
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward &=ges
well ‡ pretty soon there came the ground . 1020995_1024265
in retrospect I can remember very well that the [/] the horizon was jumping up and down . 1036145_1036234
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction &=ges
it yawed . 1041768_1043208
and as I say &-uh I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on .
well ‡ eventually <it did> [/] it did &-uh come to rest . 1055814_1060294
<it had> [//] the [//] it had yawed to the right so_that at full power <the engine was or> [//] the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway <which is frequently in> [//] &+pla which is always in place &-uh for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up .
well ‡ &=laughs they about panicked . 1081245_1082685
well ‡ at which I followed the proper procedures . 1084540_1086070
"&-uh I cut all power, turned everything off . 1086777_1091077"
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I [/] &+th I [/] I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing .
I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again . 1103502_1107572
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground . 1107720_1111760
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels . 1112000_1115030
&-uh and it [/] &+d &+i it did fly again . 1115154_1118064
so ‡ did I of_course . 1118146_1118376

I walked away . 1136050_1136580
it was later determined that &-um while <I was> [/] I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots +...
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone . 1148874_1153654
and he's [//] <he was> [//] &+h &-uh his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating .
but he could tell that he was overtaking me . 1165886_1168716
so ‡ obviously it was an air speed problem . 1168969_1172129
from what I see I haven't the foggiest idea of <what it> [//] what is really going on . [+ exc] 1174501_1182651
I see a man who appears to be lying [//] possibly lying on his back .
&-um I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch . 1188363_1195343
&-uh <he is> [//] &+l over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish . 1197055_1204745
&-uh so ‡ possibly she's there to help him and doesn't know what to +//. 1205665_1209725
you_know ‡ I don't know if she even knows what to do . 1210963_1212313
&-uh I don't know any more than that . [+ exc] 1213024_1215424
I_mean I can tell you what I see which is &-uh &-uh &-uh some kind of a belt &-uh which he has &-uh around his left arm .
&-um he appears to be quite &+mucu muscular . 1225282_1227602
she appears to be &-uh very concerned . 1228875_1232485
that's as much as I can tell you . [+ exc] 1232546_1233646

apparently the weather is somewhat threatening . 1328604_1332154
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella . 1332199_1338569
well ‡ he refuses . 1338802_1341582
he is going to be very brave . 1342380_1345370
nothing's gonna stop him . 1345966_1347136
he doesn't need an umbrella . 1347213_1348953
that's for sissies . 1349000_1349660
out he goes into the weather . 1349900_1353330
it's raining . 1353759_1354969
it's raining hard . 1355256_1357606
it's raining so hard that he's stepping in puddles . 1358184_1362254
he's getting soaked . 1362721_1363871
his hair is dripping . 1364288_1365988
he returns home much to the conversation [
well ‡ apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella . 1373646_1387216
well ‡ this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disney's that's for sure . 1393097_1397737
Cinderella was a good girl . 1398703_1400803
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters . 1408230_1408410
"and &-um &-um &-um &+th they were pampered, spoiled and they were nasty . 1408660_1418100"
and Cinderella was called &+Cinder Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace . 1429865_1429975
she hadta <take out the> [/] &-uh &-uh take out the cinders and do things like that . 1430235_1433655
so ‡ it was pretty dirty . 1435167_1435787
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom &-uh decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one .
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother &-uh <got an> [//] &+in got invitations to go .
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home . 1458148_1459318
"but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared out_of nowhere and said to her +""/."
"+"" look ‡ you deserve to go . 1471389_1472329"
"+"" we could arrange this but there are conditions . 1473612_1474972"
"+"" first of all &-um &+w there will be a coach for you pulled by horses ."
"+"" and &-um there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers ."
"+"" and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at [/] at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be out_of there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin ."
Cinderella went to the ball . 1509600_1510670
the prince &+f could not take his eyes of [
and she had a wonderful time . 1520885_1521405
but all_of_a_sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve . 1530670_1530680
she knew she hadta get the heck out_of there really fast . 1530680_1533060
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers . 1533570_1536230
but it didn't make any difference . 1537947_1538957
<she got out> [//] she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home .
well ‡ the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away . 1544198_1549788
but that didn't matter because he wanted her . 1550468_1552008
<he was> [/] he was so struck by &+h what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was .
so ‡ he decreed that &-uh <there would> [//] a search would occur <over the> [/] over the kingdom until [/] &-uh <until the> [//] <until Cinderella wa(s)> [//] until the woman was found .
now <why was this> [/] why was this such a thing ? 1577031_1580711
well ‡ Cinderella had tiny feet . 1581203_1583633
and the glass slipper was so tiny that <very few people> [//] very few grownups could fit into it .
so ‡ he [/] he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who [/] who [//] whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one .
well ‡ lo_and_behold &-uh &-uh <in his sear(ch)> [//] his search was successful . 1608048_1612248
<they did find> [/] they did find Cinderella as the one who [//] whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper .
and they were married and lived happily ever after . 1623005_1626205
we see here a tree . 1629610_1631970
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs &-um holding on to it sort_of so to speak &+an &+an and barking . 1632059_1642559
<in a branch> [//] in [/] <in the> [/] in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of &-uh rescuing a cat &+wh who is &-uh on one of the smaller branches . 1642609_1661079
under [//] directly underneath of which is a little girl &-uh who [/] &-uh who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down . 1661157_1671707
&-uh she has a tricycle in front of her . 1671758_1675118
and we see &-uh &-uh near the little girl a ladder on the ground &-uh which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is . 1675259_1687889
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which <remains as I say> [//] remains on the ground . 1688357_1698567
&-uh that's [/] &-um <that's what we> [/] &+s <that's what we> [/] &+ap that's what we see to the left [/] left side of the trunk of a tree . 1698585_1707055
on the right side is another branch &-uh which had a few leaves on it . 1707100_1711930
and &-uh <one of> [//] on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing . 1711989_1717739
"at the same time we see <in the> [/] in the distance directly &-uh to the right of the truck a firetruck and two [//] what appear to be two firemen each [/] each &-uh carrying an end of a ladder which presumably <is going to be> [//] they will use &-uh to climb the tree , rescue the man &=laughs and &-uh probably the cat as_well . 1717790_1745400"
