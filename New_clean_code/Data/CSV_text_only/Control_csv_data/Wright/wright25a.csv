"while preparing for Tommy's birthday party their dog Spot jumped up <on the> [/] on the table and ate part of the birthday cake, running under the couch because the mother was angry with the dog . 688_13888"
Spot was hiding under the couch when all of the birthday guests arrived to find the confusion . 14838_19818
Tommy was very sad that his dog Spot had eaten some of his cake but he told his guests it was okay . 20765_26225
and they had brought him nice gifts . 26245_27725
and they went to Chucky_Cheese and had a different cake that was better than the first one . 27868_31648

first you get &-uh two pieces of bread and a jar of peanut butter and a jar of jelly and a knife . 34016_39386
"you take one piece of bread, taking peanut butter on the knife, covering one side of the bread . 39475_45065"
"then you take the knife, filling it with jelly and cover the other piece of bread on one side . 45146_51016"

when I was five years old I had tonsillitis and hadta have my tonsils removed . 56845_62525
it was very scary because I was young and I wasn't able to &-uh breathe or talk correctly because my throat had become &-uh sore and aggravated . 62576_71826
so ‡ I went to the hospital and had my tonsils taken out . 72121_76271
the best part was waking up and getting as much ice cream as you could eat to help make your throat feel better . 76351_82601
but afterwards going home I hadta take medication to help me sleep and make my throat feel better which gave me vivid dreams . 82690_89380
and I had dreamed that I was attacked by a large snake while being chased by a buffalo . 89560_95820
and when I woke up screaming it my mother had come in to take care of me and it turned out I was dreaming about a set of cow horns that were up above my door that were wrapped in snake . 95871_109211
and apparently that had scared me enough and caused me to have this vivid dream while taking medication for my tonsillectomy . 109230_116710
&-um after about a week I got better and I was happy that I never hadta do that again . 116763_123113
I actually had an employee that worked with me that was hearing impaired . 135610_139760
and in_order_to work with her and explain directions and &-uh meet with her on a regular basis we &-uh went and got a sign language specialist that would come in and sit with us and translate from &-uh my speech into sign language to explain &-uh what tasks we had for her or give her regular updates meetings etcetera . 139863_161323
&-um in addition we also learned some basic sign language and worked with her using different electronic means to communicate more easily to get around any communication barriers that we had because_of her hearing impairment . 161413_174773
it worked out well . 176470_177460
yes . 181208_181978
&-uh I was in Vail Colorado with some friends and family &-uh to go on a snowmobiling trip . 185241_192891
we decided to go out when we got there later in the day when it was still snowing and take a quick trip around the area to get our bearings . 192988_200018
&-uh there were five of us on snowmobiles . 200225_202695
and this was my first time I had been on a snowmobile even_though I had told them I had ridden them before . 202826_207336
&-uh we began to run through &-um a series of roads in the [/] the backwood(s) areas of Vail . 207451_214271
and it got darker and darker and the snow became &-um snowier and snowier . 214485_219225
&-um as we got through the area the &-uh group began to spread out . 219666_225966
I wasn't going as fast as everyone else and I lost track of the people in front of me . 226060_229560
so ‡ I couldn't see which direction to go and drove off the side of the mountain in my snowmobile . 229716_233726
I tumbled down the hill about a hundred feet crashing through the darkness &-uh falling off the snowmobile and eventually landing and stopping in the snow . 233780_244090
I was momentarily <I think> [//] unconscious . 244135_247585
and when I woke up it was dark and cold and silent which I thought was very bad because I didn't know where I was and I was in a snowstorm in a mountain in Vail somewhere lost . 247608_258158
&-um I began to move around to see if I was injured and I had hurt my back and my head but could still move around find my flashlight and start looking to see where I was . 258511_269031
I actually landed on top of my snowmobile on the side of the mountain at about a forty five degree angle towards the top where the road was . 269578_276718
and I could see with the flashlight the direction where the road and where I had crashed through the mountain was . 276780_281740
so ‡ I began signaling with my flashlight and trying to yell for people when I heard &-uh a snowmobile coming . 282005_287845
I saw the light and flashed my [/] &+f my &-uh flashlight . 288521_291671
"he saw me, stopped and went to get help from the other group of people that we were with . 291695_296885"
about ten minutes later they all came back . 296931_299001
and after about a half hour they managed to pull me up and the snowmobile and get us back up to the road to &-um look over my damage and the damage to the snowmobile which was pretty extensive . 299023_309503
but we did manage to &-uh ride the crippled snowmobile back into town to the camp where we were where I proceeded to get medical attention and rest for several days . 309555_319595
it was pretty scary . 321736_322736

it was a beautiful spring day and Sarah was excited to go on the trip . 384291_388671
Stan didn't tell Sarah that the area that they were going to was a class four rapids and he wasn't really that qualified to go whitewater rafting but he wanted to make his daughter happy anyway . 389408_398658
"they got their equipment, headed down <to the> [/] &-uh to the river and began to start rafting through the rapids . 399006_405856"
Sarah was having a great time . 406953_408263
"she was very happy that her father had taken her, when all_of_a_sudden things turned for the worse . 408413_412813"
the rapids became angry . 412955_414555
"the class four area (.) thrashed and tortured the boat eventually capsizing it, forcing both Sarah and Stan into the water . 414658_423038"
Sarah was screaming because she had lost her life vest and [//] but managed to grab on to a branch . 423726_429336
Stan swam to her as best he could and grabbed onto the branch to hold onto her and the branch to save their lives . 429725_436575
luckily a park ranger was driving by doing a routine check of the area and saw them in trouble holding onto the branch . 436731_443301
"he called for extra life support, getting a helicopter and several fire trucks and ambulances to show up where rescuers managed to pull them out_of the deadly rapids saving their life taking them to the hospital where Sarah eventually yelled at her father for being such an inexperienced whitewater rafter . 443481_459751"
but was happy that they were both alive . 459751_461953

"the man inside sitting watching television was startled and scared by the breaking window, seeing the soccer ball come in breaking a lamp and forcing him to rise up out_of his chair to see what had happened . 494480_506170"
he looked out the broken window to see the boy running away scared and wondered if his insurance policy was going to cover the broken window . 506221_514390
he called his insurance agent and it turned out windows were covered . 515280_519191
he was happy . 519238_519707

his mother knowing that it was sposta rain told Tommy to bring an umbrella . 564003_567623
Tommy who had aspirations to be a meteorologist knew that it wasn't going to rain and told his mother he didn't need an umbrella . 568033_573773
it wasn't going to rain . 574053_574883
the weathermen on the tv were wrong . 574900_576790
his mother was angry but let him go anyway . 576846_579156
as Tommy began to walk to school it started to rain . 579585_582565

Tommy was upset . 584441_585671
he ran back to the house to tell his mother that he was sorry that he hadn't accurately predicted the weather and that he would probably need his umbrella after all . 585731_594901
the mother gave Tommy the umbrella where he was able to walk to school dry while he rethought his career choices of being a meteorologist . 594955_602665
