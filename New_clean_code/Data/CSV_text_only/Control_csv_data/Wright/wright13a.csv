okay ‡ when I was seventeen years old after I'd &+gra graduated from high school . 24137_28017
I went to Anaheim for a week long conference . 28032_30992
and while I was there I developed meningitis . 31008_34508
and &-uh I couldn't lay my head down on the pillow . 34528_38748
it [/] it [/] it was excruciating . 38768_41248
you_know ‡ the [//] my scalp is very sensitive so I couldn't lay my head down on anything . 41296_45926
I really didn't know what was wrong with me . 46109_47839
I just thought I had a bad headache . 47888_49098
so ‡ I went out to the kitchen and &-uh just sat there for about an hour or two . 49929_55809
it was the middle of the night and &-uh didn't really know what to do (be)cause I couldn't lay my head down . 55856_60686
but I was exhausted . 60736_61496
and &-uh so I ended up &-um going . 61520_66830
and &-uh there was someone staying in the room with me . 66880_69360
I [/] I told them that I couldn't sleep . 69376_71006
something was wrong with my head . 71104_72254
and &-uh he was actually a neurologist . 72272_75262
&-uh but &-uh he ended up giving me some pretty strong &-uh &-um pills to help the pain go away . 76272_85682
and it helped through the morning . 85728_88068
but then the next day it continued to hurt . 88113_89693
so ‡ &-uh I ended up going to the hospital that evening . 90762_93792
I was actually staying with three doctors . 93840_96770
so ‡ they took me to the the hospital . 96816_98376
and &-uh they checked me in . 99260_101270
they <did a> [//] &-um first did a &+elec +... 101290_105410
let's see what was it ? 106227_106887
a cat [
think it was a cat [
&-uh &-um and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me . 114352_121192
&-uh so ‡ that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture . 121375_126345
a [//] <it was a> [/] it was a resident it was a teaching &-uh hospital it was U_C_Irvine . 126431_134941
and &-uh he didn't do a very good job at it . 135802_139292
so ‡ the the doctor was watching him took over . 139432_142652
it was painful . 143893_144603
but they had given me morphine by this point . 144623_147263
so ‡ I felt much better . 147390_148530
&-uh I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside . 148775_151815
and &-uh I was still in the emergency room at that point . 151839_155649
and eventually the next morning got me into my own room . 156536_159786
and &-uh I felt fine by the next day . 160928_164028
&-um but they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much . 164047_168147
but when I was seventeen I was only eating &-uh one meal a day . 168192_171912
but they said I they would let me go home if I didn't eat more . 173386_177136
so ‡ I hadta eat three meals a day . 177334_179264
and they wanted to monitor me . 179280_183010
and but I felt great . 183056_184696
and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there . 184720_187360
and they kept me two more days . 187408_188848
and &-uh they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go . 189864_193694
and to check my white blood cell count . 193743_196573
and it was pretty much the same as it was before . 196592_199102
so ‡ it didn't show much of an improvement . 199152_200842
but I felt great . 200864_201584
so ‡ they let me go home . 201650_203050

and &-um I think both of them had that same problem and a couple of others you_know problems with &-uh liquids . 236000_243640
but that's not a big problem . 243664_244714

&-um but &-uh it [/] it wasn't that big of a difficulty . 251968_256878
you_know ‡ <we could just> [//] I could still understand her for the most part . 257036_260286

her mother had passed away . 656391_657731
and her father &-uh ended up remarrying a woman who had two daughters . 658398_663198
&-uh the [//] this woman and her two daughters +... 664932_667522
well ‡ eventually Cinderella's father also passed away . 668293_671013
and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother . 671059_674769
her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her &-um their servant basically . 675787_681907
and &-uh everyone [//] they were very cruel to her . 681923_687183
and she lived a very &-um meager life . 687234_689914
and &-um but she was &+f friends with all the animals . 690907_693747
&-uh the animals were the people she got along with <people she could talk to or> [//] the [/] the creatures that she could talk to . 693952_701942
and &-uh then one day the there was a prince in that &-um country . 702962_710412
and &-uh they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife . 710466_715346
and [//] &-uh as it was time for him to marry . 716483_718283
<and all> [//] and Cinderella and their [//] her stepsisters were very excited to go . 720071_725071
&-uh however Cinderella &-uh could not go unless she had finished all her chores . 725971_731431
her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish . 731561_734421
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first . 735263_739083
&-um so ‡ &-um by the time &-uh it came to go &-um Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to &-um make a dress or prepare herself to go . 739131_753821
but &-uh unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters' clothes and such that &-uh they had cast away because they didn't want it . 755938_770358
&-um so ‡ Cinderella was very happy &-um that they had the dress for her . 771145_776155
and &+sh while the [/] the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it &-um Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go . 777057_789277
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away . 789884_795814
and &-um they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters . 795835_806215
and she went out to the yard and was crying . 807415_809785
and then &-uh a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight . 809802_816732
she made her very beautiful and &-uh all that . 816748_821118
but she warned her . 821164_821714
it would only last til midnight . 822156_823066
and you_know she turned you_know &-uh a pumpkin into a carriage and you_know transformed all these elements &-uh to make her look very beautiful . 823083_831403
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince . 832709_837779
and &-uh I guess it was love at first sight . 838383_840933
and they were dancing together . 840955_842075
and you_know he he very much enjoyed his time with her . 842090_845850
and &-uh they were dancing outside . 846010_848790
and she saw the clock . 848812_849942
and she knows it's almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs &-uh leaving one of her glass slippers behind &-um . 849962_857272
and she went racing off in the carriage . 858903_860533
and &-um she actually didn't make it quite home in the when it struck midnight . 862065_867445
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin . 867691_869191
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin . 869243_871033
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers . 871051_874971
and so this prince &-um after this happened he &-uh was very interested in finding her . 876469_884669
you_know ‡ <he was> [//] &+wo he wondered why she had ran away . 884907_887227
and so he &-um set out to search for her using the glass slipper . 888225_893905
you_know ‡ whoever's foot it fit would be that girl . 893929_897129
he sent out his [//] &-um I don't know it was the duke or something &-uh to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit . 897807_905467
it was very small . 905513_906303
&-um and eventually that duke got to Cinderella's house . 906857_911377
and &-uh Cinderella got excited . 911401_914581
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella . 914737_921867
I don't remember how . 921888_922788
and &-um locked Cinderella up there . 923691_925981
and [//] &-um while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper . 927386_931026
their feet were way too large . 931041_932421
they went flying you_know every time . 932473_935213
and &-uh the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the [/] the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind . 936763_945683
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper . 946776_950726
the stepmother was very angry at this . 952827_954627
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper . 954681_957971
and &-uh the stepmother tripped him . 958750_962070
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces . 962612_968162
and you_know the duke thought that everything was over . 968185_971245
and everything was ruined . 971305_971945
and they'd never find her . 972073_972953
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity . 974327_980227
and she ended up marrying the prince . 980250_982650
and they lived happily ever after . 982698_983828

she ran home quickly to get her dad <to help him> [//] to help the cat out .
