&-um little boy was having a birthday . 20151_24791

&-uh and &-uh the mom was [//] left the cake for the birthday party out on the table . 29464_36094
and the dog came and ate a piece of it . 37860_39830
right as the guests were showing up for the party . 41496_43776
the mom was very angry at herself for leaving the cake out . 44680_47720
but she was gonna take it out on the dog by hitting him with the broom . 47744_50954
and the boy was sad because his cake got eaten and his mom was beating the dog . 51184_56664
"&-um first you get the bread out_o(f) the cupboard, the peanut butter out_o(f) the cupboard, the jelly out_o(f) the refrigerator . 58140_68740"
"&-uh you open the bag, get the bread out . 70536_71876"
two slices . 72253_72793
probably because you're holding them in your hand you now have get a plate to put the bread on . 77060_80540
put the bread down . 81280_81920
you open the jar of peanut butter . 82978_84078
get a knife out_of the drawer . 84398_85688
scoop the peanut butter . 86611_87371
spread the peanut butter on the bread . 87481_89721
"&-um open the jar of jam, jelly . 91281_93991"
lick off the knife . 98193_98813
scoop the jelly from the jar . 99775_102315
put it on the bread . 102490_103250
fold it together . 104363_104833
eat . 106240_106310
really ? 117903_118023
&-um I don't get sick very often . 118533_121673
never broke a bone and never been hospitalized really . 121883_124943
&-um the most recent tragic sickness I had ? 125713_129473
I went to &-um the freshman camp for engineering students as a staff member . 129526_137426
and the cabin that we were in had fleas or bedbugs or something . 138348_145328
and I got bit all over and broke out into big rash hives . 145373_153243
and &-uh <it was> [//] that was quite traumatic . 153803_156653
&-uh I took three days off o(f) work to stay at home because I didn't actually know that they were bug bites . 157011_161201
I thought I had chickenpox . 161220_162310
so ‡ I went to a dermatologist and found out that no they were bug bites and very +... 163388_167298
&-uh anyway so it was still traumatic . 169126_170646
when I did get back to work I found out that everybody who stayed in that cabin had similar experiences but probably not as bad as mine . 170700_177650
I just got eaten up . 177700_179500
and so it was awful . 179590_181010
yeah . 181990_182050
&-um times when I've hadta communicate with people from another country . 187298_193228
I went to a seminar once where there was a bunch of Brazilians who didn't speak English very well . 193540_199380
so ‡ like all other ignorant Americans I talked louder and slower so that would help . 200105_205815
but they just didn't understand the words . 207513_208883
so ‡ we usually hadta find someone to intermediate &-uh because of the language barrier . 208935_213995
&-um or I guess try different words that <I guess> [//] I thought they might understand better than the ones that I was using . 214828_224008
tell me the story . 234035_234735
&-um well ‡ <I was out> [//] we lived &-uh &-uh +... 235913_242373
"I was a teenager, late teenager . 243111_246181"
"probably [//] I think actually I was about nineteen, eighteen . 247221_250171"
had already graduated high school . 251481_253121
was out with a friend . 255208_257148
her father was the &-uh sheriff's deputy where we lived . 259430_266901
and he came to find me because he knew I was with his daughter . 268371_275281
and I found out that day that my brother had shot himself . 277171_280871
so ‡ that was a little bit &-uh scary . 282021_283891
it was a_little unnerving . 283946_285016
&-um it's hard for me to remember how I felt back then because he ended up living in our [/] our &+li +//. 285703_291953
and he is [//] just has some problems now . 292226_294186
but he didn't die . 294203_295033
so ‡ the resolve &+hel helps me not remember as much as when I was as scared or as intense . 295141_301531
but I'm sure at that moment that it was very unnerving . 301555_303965
it was scary for what might happen . 304168_305638
would he die or not . 305873_306443
we lived not close to a city and so he hadta be helicopter air evacked [
my parents were out_of town . 318123_319233
and my youngest brother was the one who found him after it had been quite awhile . 319286_324306
so ‡ there was a_lot_of blood loss . 324351_326531
I'm sure I was scared . 326583_327423
I'm sure it was a tense moment anyway . 327693_330573
&-um in this story it looks like &-uh +... 336398_340748
okay . [+ exc] 348716_348826
there was a big rainstorm . 351281_352531
lasted for many days . 353685_354665
there was a_lot_of flooding . 354710_356350
family was trying to get out_of their house a [//] or trying to get to safety . 358716_362626
one of the daughters got swept away in the river . 362678_367138
and grabbed onto a tree limb where the water was rushing and very violent . 367158_373548
it was a scary situation . 374648_376038
a nice paramedic or helicopter man as they were out searching for people &-um found where she was located or was notified where she was located . 376725_386675
and so he hadta be lowered below and drag himself across the water so_that he could rescue her . 386726_395026
okay . [+ exc] 408341_408471
a &-uh boy is out on a nice day playing soccer kickin(g) a ball around . 416165_421055
"and &-uh kicked one a little bit too hard, hit a window, broke it . 421950_425780"
man was inside of his house . 427288_428708
when the ball hit the window it smashed into a lamp . 429648_434428
and picked up the ball and started to head out the door find out who kicked the ball through his window . 435601_440991
and &-uh (.) filed a home owner's insurance claim to get his window fixed . 441833_448883
told the boy to be more careful . 449368_450278
a boy like any other was ready to head out the door on his way to school . 465791_471161
"and his mom said +""/. 471176_471616"
"+"" hey why don't you take this umbrella with you ? 471996_474296"
"and he said +""/. 475226_476026"
"+"" no ‡ Mom ‡ I'm too cool for an umbrella . 476496_478386"
"+"" I'm just gonna go . 479211_480011"
but as he headed out the door the rain started to fall just like his mom said it would . 480653_484223
he started to get wet . 484271_485801
so ‡ he ran back home . 485823_487103
his mom was upset that he didn't listen to (h)er . 487118_490568
but boys needta learn and to listen to their moms . 491523_494093
so ‡ he changed his clothes and took the umbrella and headed back outside and was okay and dry . 494146_500066
&-uh once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella . 504138_510488
and she had happy life with her mother and her father . 511203_517283
and her mother died which was sad . 517414_521734
she grew up . 522393_522803
father decided to get remarried . 523775_525155
"and he married a woman that had two other daughters as_well, Cinderella's stepsisters . 526606_530416"
and he was a busy man so he was always off politicking leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters . 531878_537928
and her stepmother wasn't very nice . 539691_544321
and as she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her . 544395_552955
and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them . 553003_558973
it wasn't a happy life . 559860_561820
one day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married . 562613_570303
"and so the king said +""/. 571086_572326"
"+"" Prince we're gonna have a ball so_that you can meet some &-uh ladies to be married . 572900_580730"
an invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball . 581676_587216
and she was happy . 588813_589983
and so she was went to get ready for the ball . 590003_591603
and Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as_well but that Cinderella couldn't go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done . 592046_604136
which was kind_of disheartening because she wouldn't have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear . 605773_610233
so ‡ the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people . 612083_620523
and she slaved away the day . 621310_622590
and so eventually it was time to go to the ball . 624041_626051
and Cinderella felt like she hadn't had time to get ready . 626075_629695
and the stepsisters and the mother were happy . 629740_632120
but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made . 633250_637770
and she was excited because then she could go to the ball . 637820_640790
so ‡ she ran down the stairs to leave . 641008_642378
and the sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart . 643196_648526
so ‡ she wasn't able to go in shambles . 649731_651631
and [//] while the stepmother stat [
and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince . 656693_666533
and &-uh as she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said &-uh that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out . 668466_678746
so ‡ they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress . 679001_695801
and she was all ready to go to the ball . 695868_697128
and &-uh so she headed off . 697146_700426
and the prince danced with a few people but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really . 700910_708340
he was very infatuated . 708363_709613
the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal . 709818_717238
and so &~Cinder Cinderella lost track of time . 717568_722708
and i(t) was about to strike midnight . 724071_725481
she realized what would happen and so she ran . 725820_727870
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers . 728620_730190
and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was . 730235_734325
she was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear . 734346_738506
so ‡ she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper . 739515_745225
so ‡ he was distraught . 745445_747955
the king and he &-uh hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit . 747978_756688
they worked long and hard &-uh the prince long and hard to find the person . 757916_763116
and when they arrived at Cinderella's house the stepmother locked Cinderella in a room so_that she couldn't try on the slipper because she suspected that Cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen . 763811_775331
and the stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper . 776198_779798
and it wouldn't fit . 780598_781228
"and the mice snuck the key past Dragon the cat to open the door to let Cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say +""/. 782420_794900"
"+"" but wait I can try it on . 795023_796383"
and luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on . 796713_802813
"but Cinderella produced the other slipper and said +""/. 805406_807576"
"+"" well ‡ here's the matching pair . 807828_808618"
"+"" I was the girl and it does fit . 808940_810360"
so ‡ they were very happy . 810913_812383
and Cinderella married the prince and they lived happily ever after . 812865_815645
&-uh in this picture (..) <it's a> [//] &-uh cat climbed a tree to try and catch a bird .
and the daughter knows that her cat was stuck in the tree so she went and got her dad .
the dad got stuck in the tree as_well .
and they hadta call the fireman to come and rescue (..) both probably from the tree .
