to make a &+tp peanut butter an(d) jelly sandwich you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients . 1670_6650
&=inhales that would include two slices of bread . 6830_9770
&=lips_smack or one slice that you'd fold in half . 10750_12770
&=inhales peanut butter and jelly . 13893_15613
with butter or margarine being optional . 15870_18100

&=inhales let's assume that you have two slices of bread . 21563_23693
&=lips_smack &=inhales you then hafta make a decision as to whether or not you're going to
or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly . 30436_35206
&=inhales some people prefer &+tha to put the peanut butter on the bread first &=inhales because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth . 35373_45323
&=inhales so ‡ (.) trying to satisfy as many people as possible &=inhales we're going to take a knife . 46025_53705
and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread . 53900_56620
one slice or two . 57400_58380
depending upon how much you wanna fill the bread . 58400_60860
&=inhales and then we'll put the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 60980_64810
put the two pieces of bread together . 65615_67165
