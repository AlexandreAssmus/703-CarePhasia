<when I was was> [//] a time that I was really sick . 29178_34028
there would only be one instance in my life when I had surgery for malignant melanoma in the middle of my back &-uh fifteen (.) years ago or longer . 34158_51908
I had never seen it . 52661_54041
it was discovered by my skin doctor when I went in for a rash . 55067_58827
I was in the hospital with surgery within four days . 59435_66785
was in the hospital ten days . 67443_68983
had skin grafts . 69083_70323
losing a section of my skin on my back that was about the size of a small saucer . 71829_79349
the skin grafts were taken from my left hip . 80547_83377
&-um I don't know which was worse pain (.) the wound in back or the skin grafts on my hip . 83464_95054
but you can't hardly get comfortable in bed . 95101_97511
you just sleep under lights that dry up the &-uh skin wounds . 97564_104674
and then <that was> [//] (.) I was out_of the hospital . 104764_110464
I was back at work within six weeks &-um (.) with still the sort_of a semi open wound over my spine in the back which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years . 110482_129722
in order to close the wound on the back they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar take the flaps of skin close them back over the &-um original scar wound . 130693_156194
and so I had for about six weeks a lump on my back where they were infloating [
that was done and I had ten years with an oncologist . 172264_176924
and now I have a clean bill of health . 177007_178487
that's about all <I can remember> [=! laughs] . 181351_183301

as far as their speech is concerned I [/] I had a husband who had a stroke and had cognitive reasoning problems that made it difficult for him to understand what I was saying or &+under +//. 201304_230034
he knew who I was but he did not connect with what I was saying . 230087_236577
and when people came to visit him in the hospital we had the same problems . 236868_242028
now he could communicate reasonably well but he did not comprehend so his communication was [//] &+ta it was just difficult . 242091_254121
&-uh oh he was in therapy for &-uh +... 257712_261791
and I useta watch . 261969_263629
&-uh he was given many many tests &=ges
&=ges
&=ges
he was to write elephant . 275733_276763
&=ges
a great deal of therapy . 278715_280075
and was &-um really doing fairly well . 280556_283076
six weeks after the &-uh stroke . 283328_287568
so ‡ I had him back home by that time . 287702_291022
and he was doing reasonably well . 291103_293343
mhm . 297726_298546
"+, <did you do some> [//] when you were communicating with him +... 298600_301500"
&-uh no ‡ I did not hafta do anything . 302429_304449
they just &-um gave me instructions on always &=ges
and he had hearing aids . 312289_313279
"+, &=ges"
and that sort of thing just to help him . 317954_320714
no ‡ because by the time he was home and an outpatient &-uh <he was doing> [//] he &=ges
and <it was> [//] it had affected his swallowing and that &=head
so [/] so ‡ there was some speech difficult only because of the swallowing . 344511_348801
that was about my only experience with +... 349682_353232
I'm sure there were many instances when I was frightened . 387054_392144
&-um &-hm . 393150_399140
but not [//] certainly I was afraid but not a terrified type of fright . 404295_411015
&-um maybe like “boo” scared but not hysteria [/] hysteria scared . 411957_421117
it's [//] <that's a hard> [//] that's a real hard question . 421141_423951
I have been afraid when I'd been dreaming because I was lost . 425303_430733
but that was a dream not [//] and I always seem to get out_of it . 430786_435456
let's see ‡ <what ever> [//] where would I have been lost . 435521_438331
I have been lost but not afraid . 438381_442751
it <hasta be> [//] hasta have the fear . 443353_444843
&-hm
I certainly worked in a very large industrial plant where there were certainly dangerous situations all around with mechanics and equipment and furnaces . 471876_486366
but &-um +... 487256_488026
<it's not anything that was> [//] &-uh it's not scary because you are trained to cope with that but you are working constantly around large equipment . 490565_504045
"and I think probably many times, since I was a supervisor, I was probably more concerned about a young man working on one of the drill presses or on a lathe that would lose a finger or was injured by &-uh a grinder or something happening to one of the men &-uh that worked for me . 504476_530606"
"and then the furnaces in a large plant, it's always a concern . 530651_536821"
&-um an industrial plant is [/] is something to be very cautious . 536868_543268
not &+t to be fearful of but to be cautious about your people who are working for you and also that your own behavior you don't do stupid things . 543479_556669
&-um and I worked midnights which was +//. 556821_559991
I was the only female in the plant . 560201_561641
and that still was not a fearful situation . 561740_565040
but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was and the machinery was working . 565094_575164
"and we never had an accident, we never had a fire, we never had +//. 575181_577971"
we had a blizzard . 578021_579011
&-um but &-uh they would have never left me alone with +//. 579841_583141
I_mean they [/] they picked me up at the plant took me back home . 583160_586160
but not [//] that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in . 586289_594169
but <it wasn't> [//] it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job . 594221_600301
you were just more aware of what was going on around you because there was just a_lot_of mechanical equipment and dangerous electrical and that sort of thing . 600483_611203
but that was about the only situation that I was ever in that <was ever> [//] might [/] might have been life threatening but certainly never was . 611249_619789
but it was an interesting experience . 620588_622368
