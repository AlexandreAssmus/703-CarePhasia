and put the two pieces together .
&-uh there's a birthday cake on the table .
and it's the little boy's birthday .
but when you look at the cake you see that there was <a big hole> [//] &+t a big bite taken out_of the cake .
and there are &+d paw prints going to the dog that's hiding under the couch .
so ‡ the mother is mad and chasing the dog with the broom (be)cause she's upset .
and at the same time that she's chasing the dog and upset about the cake being bitten into &-uh the little boy has friends arriving for his birthday party with gifts .
&-um &-um &-uh one time I was playing with some weights at a gym .
and &-um I was trying to fix something .
and the weights came down and smashed my thumb .
&-uh I remember it was throbbing . 81655_81695

&-um &+w &-uh I've spent time out_of the country with people that didn't speak English .
and I usually ended up acting things out like I was playing charades to get myself understood .
(..) or scared +...
&-uh yeah ‡ I useta live in California .
and I was there for the big Northridge earthquake .
that was pretty scary .
&-um &-uh yeah ‡ it was about five in the morning and my dog started barking .
and &-uh he usually didn't get up that early to start barking .
so ‡ I was a_little alarmed . 160361_160471
and I turned around . 161658_162348
and before I could open my mouth to say “what is it” “what do you hear” all_of_a_sudden I started to feel the ground shake . 172111_172211
and you could feel it .
and then I heard crashes and boom and crash and boom .
and &-um I lived in California on a hillside .
and so <I was> [/] I was in the back of the house .
and I was only afraid that the front half of the house had fallen off and fell down the hill .
&-um but when I've [//] it seemed like it stopped .
and it seemed like it went on for a long time .
but I'm guessing it was probably ten seconds .
&-um but when I finally got up to go look &-um my kitchen was a mess and [/] and half the things in every cabinet had fallen on the floor but the structure of the house was intact .
but &-uh I had a_lot_of stuff to clean up .
&-uh there's a girl caught in the water in a current .
and &-uh she's stuck . 228065_228145
and &-uh the guy with the life jacket on is holding onto a tree and trying to rescue her .
&-uh there's a boy outside kicking around a soccer ball .
he kicks the soccer ball . 261185_261266
it hits the window . 263345_264195
breaks the window . 265140_265380
and goes into the house . 268211_268261
it knocks over a lamp where a man is sitting . 273985_274035
and the man gets up . 274105_274185
takes the ball . 274596_274676
and goes to look over the window to see where the ball came from .
&-uh there's a little boy who's leaving for school .
and his mother's handing him an umbrella .
&-uh he tells her he doesn't need the umbrella .
and he leaves . 301271_301351
while he's outside walking it starts to rain . 307965_308015
and then it's coming down even harder . 308635_308725
and he's coming home . 309205_309255
and she looks at him (be)cause he's all wet . 373463_374123
and he gets the umbrella and goes back out .
now he has the umbrella to protect him .
now you're really testing my memory &=laughs .
&-um &=clears_throat there was a [/] a woman with two daughters .
and she married a man who had a daughter . 390226_390236
and once they got together &-uh the woman's daughters &-um turned the man's daughter into sort_of <their housekeeper> [//] their servant and treated her very poorly .
&-um and &-uh she was never very happy . 417716_417726
&-uh then the mother got an invitation to a fancy ball that the king was having and the prince was having at the land .
and &+sh the woman was getting her daughters ready .
and Cinderella was looking at some pretty dresses and trying to decide what to wear .
and the stepsisters were taking her clothes and taking parts of her dress .
and she was all upset .
and they were getting all dressed to go to the ball .
and then a fairy godmother came and found Cinderella upset .
and &-um waved her magic wand .
and gave Cinderella a gorgeous dress .
and made her all pretty .
and she went to the ball .
and she spent most of the evening dancing with the prince .
and &-uh she had been told by the fairy godmother at the stroke of midnight she must leave .
and so when she heard the clock strike midnight she started to run out_of there .
and as she left &+sh one of her glass slippers fell off .
and &-um so she &-uh went home .
and the prince was trying to find her .
but she was gone . 417986_418036
and one of his servants found the glass slipper and gave it to the prince .
and then he starts going around looking for who it fits .
and when he got to her house and found Cinderella and put it on her foot he saw it fit .
and &-uh the stepmother and the stepsisters were all upset that it turned out it was Cinderella .
and then she and the prince got together and lived happily ever after .
&-uh there's a little girl who owns a cat .
and her cat went outside and started climbing up a tree .
the cat got stuck in the tree .
so ‡ she went and told her dad .
and the dad came out .
and brought a ladder .
and climbed up the tree to get the cat .
while he climbed up the tree the ladder fell on the ground .
and he's stuck up in the tree with the cat .
&-uh the dog is barking up the tree trying to get them .
but he can't do anything .
so ‡ someone must have called the firemen .
and the firemen are coming with their ladder to get the dad down and the cat down .
