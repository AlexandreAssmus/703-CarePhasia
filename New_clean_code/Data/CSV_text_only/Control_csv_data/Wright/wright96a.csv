the cat ran up in the tree and the little girl couldn't get him down . 6413_9073
so ‡ she called for her dad . 9201_10361
he came rushing out to see what the excitement was about and realized that his daughter's cat was up in a tree . 11246_16566
so ‡ he got his ladder and went over to the tree climbed up the ladder and got on to the first branch . 16615_22455
then the dog got excited and ran over and knocked the ladder down . 23018_25828
so ‡ now her father was stuck up in the tree with the cat . 25890_28140
luckily a neighbor had seen what was going on and had called the fire department . 29208_32258
so ‡ two firemen came rushing to the rescue with their own ladder . 32275_35055
they set the ladder up against the tree and got both the father and the cat down . 35740_39390
and everybody was happy . 39575_41015

&-um to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich you needta make sure you have two slices of bread . 44260_49300
put them on a plate . 49645_50455
&-um get a jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly out so everything is ready . 51066_55006
&-um get a knife and spoon from the silverware drawer . 55515_58085
and use the knife to get some peanut butter out_of the jar and spread it on one of the slices of bread . 59081_63601
and then you get the spoon to get the jelly <out_of the other> [//] out_of the jelly jar and put that on the second slice of bread . 64313_69933
and you can use the knife to spread that around . 70075_71745
then you put the two slices together <on the bread> [//] on [/] on the plate to make the sandwich . 72056_76736
and you're ready to enjoy your peanut butter sandwich ! 76781_78891
okay . 81716_82176
&-um this was about two years ago . 82302_83992
and I was having &-uh pain in my left hip . 84010_86920
&=points
and I'd had a car accident earlier that year . 89588_91458
so ‡ I thought maybe it was related to that . 91481_93201
&-uh but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an x-ray . 93336_97186
and they found out that &-um <the bone> [//] the joint was actually dying because I had what was called &-uh avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didn't join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off . 98336_110526
so
so ‡ &-um we set up the appointment . 118828_121748
&-um or the [/] the specialist set up the appointment &-uh you_know with the hospital for the date of surgery . 122006_127606
and I went into the hospital . 127660_128780
and &-um &=shrugs &=shakes
I've never really been sick or anything in my life . 131885_133915
so ‡ &-um they put me under . 134026_136516
and I actually kind_of woke up before they were completely finished . 136533_140883
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldn't feel anything from the waist down . 140963_144083
but they were finishing up . 144135_144985
and I was &-like looking around . 145090_146710
and the doctor was kinda surprised . 146726_148396
"he was like +""/. 148415_148695"
"+"" oh ‡ just be calm . 148845_149455"
"+"" we're almost done . 149541_150341"
&-um and &-uh so then after that they wheeled me into the &+r recovery room where you_know I kinda came more out_of the anesthetic . 150790_158060
and then I spent two days in the hospital &-uh <before they were> [/] &-uh before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home . 158113_164983
&-um and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work . 166195_171775
&-um and then it was &=ges a year before they said I was completely healed . 172288_175408
but &-um yeah that was the [/] the only time I've ever really been in the hospital . 176415_179865
no ‡ it was really kind_of strange (be)cause I [//] you_know I trusted the doctors . 186026_189906
and I thought I &+w would be afraid you_know especially when they were putting me under . 189921_193241
&-um but I really wasn't frightened or [/] or scared . 193260_196710
oh yeah definitely . 200886_201836
sure &=laughs . 203870_204210
alright this was &-uh gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager . 205801_210421
and &-uh my family &-uh we lived in Anchorage and <we'd always> [//] every weekend we would go down to the Kenai_Peninsula to either the Kenai_River or the Russian_River to go salmon fishing (be)cause the salmon would run . 211096_221166
and so &-um I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught . 221926_225066
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite . 225090_226810
and I was wearing &=ges
everybody wears waders . 230966_231846
so ‡ anyway I was &=ges
and I'm walkin(g) along . 239183_240723
and I hear something &=ges
and I look over to my right . 242965_243775
and I see a little baby moose &=ges . 243793_245043
"and I'm like +""/. 245095_245395"
"+"" oh ‡ how cute a baby moose . 245701_247051"
well ‡ I hear something &=ges
and I look over and it's the mother moose . 249121_251461
and it freaked me out . 252088_253898
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby . 253915_262495
and I had this huge thing of fish &=ges
and <I was like> [//] (.) &+s I [/] I didn't wanna drop the fish (be)cause I thought that would make noise . 266020_270450
so ‡ I was trying to &-like tiptoe as fast as I could through that area . 270468_274628
and I was able to get past that . 274651_276441
I don't know how I was able to get through there . 276693_278663
I don't know how the [/] &+m the mother moose didn't hear me (be)cause they have good hearing . 278681_281451
they don't see very well . 281473_282653
but apparently &=ges
I don't know . 288444_288834
"but yeah ‡ I was &-like scared for &=laughs my life there for a little bit, until I got past that area and back to camp . 288880_295360"
they're huge . 297771_298571
and they look so goofy and +... 299973_301263
but they can be really dangerous . 301623_303043
yeah ‡ actually my grandmother &-uh on my dad's side &-um you_know as she got older &-um +... 310178_316338
she'd had &-uh a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks &-um in her life . 316571_320801
but as she got older her memory started to go . 320846_323436
and <it was> [//] &-uh I think she +... 323455_325225
I don't know if it was Alzheimer's that she had or dementia or what . 325720_328790
but we would go to see her you_know from time to time . 328836_331476
and you_know sometimes she would be really &+th you_know with it . 331496_335616
she could remember lots of things . 336041_337601
and other times you would kind_of hafta tell her <who you> [/] who you were and talk really slowly . 337620_341520
and you_know she would keep repeating &=twirls
and she'd be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother . 351686_354766
"and so +""/. 355638_355878"
"+"" no . 356055_356195"
"you hafta say +""/. 356211_356601"
"+"" no Grandma it's Rich . 356818_357748"
"and she's +""/. 357901_358141"
"+"" oh ‡ Richie . 358438_358888"
and so then you_know she would remember who I was for awhile . 358938_361398
and then she'd kinda fade out again . 361448_363348
so ‡ it was difficult to communicate . 363513_365353
it was kind_of hard emotionally too you_know because I remember her from when she was younger . 365370_369620
and she was &-like my favorite grandmother . 369670_370950
and she was really a_lot_of fun . 371110_372110
and then to see her in that situation where she's just kind_of a shadow of her former self was [/] was upsetting . 372163_377873
so +... 378176_378236
&-um well ‡ I would hold her hand you_know and just be [//] you_know modulate my tone of voice . 382040_386650
&-um you_know ‡ just repeat it if [/] if she couldn't understand . 386700_390670
&-um you_know ‡ just be there for her really . 390716_393276
sometimes she couldn't understand . 393291_394361
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didn't +//. 394380_397770
you_know ‡ you would talk to her and she may not understand . 397788_399808
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm &=ges
okay . [+ exc] 425431_425711
Joey had just joined the soccer team and he was very excited . 429513_432273
"so ‡ he was on his way home &-uh with the soccer ball kicking it around as he went, trying to make sure that he would be ready for the big soccer match next weekend . 432401_441901"
unfortunately he got a_little too enthusiastic with his kicks . 442433_445343
and the soccer ball went through a window in his neighborhood . 445466_448366
Mister_Moss was sitting calmly in his chair watching tv when all of a sudden the soccer ball came crashing through his window in the living room and hit a lamp and knocked it over . 451485_459505
he jumped out_of the chair grabbed the soccer ball and looked out the window . 460103_463623
but he couldn't see anybody because Joey had hidden in the bushes . 464500_468880
and he was perplexed as to who had done this and what he was going to do about it . 470346_473996

so ‡ he ran back to the house as fast as he could totally annoyed at himself for not taking the umbrella . 515846_520466
he got inside the house where his mother was also not very happy with him because he was soaking wet . 521184_525685
and she was afraid he was gonna catch a cold . 525741_527251
he [/] &+fi he took the umbrella this time <and then walked> [//] &+o and went back outside and headed on to school where he made it safely and dry . 528176_535356

&-um once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella . 541785_544825
and unfortunately her father passed away . 545406_547656
and she was sent to live with &-um her stepmother and stepsisters &-um who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful . 547673_555683
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun . 556216_559286
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm . 560335_566565
&-um one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son . 567200_574420
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that &-uh somebody was [//] would be &-uh able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king . 574498_584898
so ‡ couriers went across the land and delivered the &-uh message or delivered invitations to all the eligible &-uh bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom . 585688_595708
and the [/] &+t the stepsisters were very excited . 596331_598441
and Cinderella was excited too . 598463_599943
"but then they laughed at her saying +""/. 599990_601220"

"+"" you don't have a dress . 603076_603756"

but her friends the animals &-um made a dress for her so [/] so she could go to the ball . 608781_614961
&-um unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her . 615768_618688
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball . 618703_622473
so ‡ they ripped the dress up . 622490_623710
and Cinderella was sent down <to the> [/] to the cellar . 623883_627373
&-um and she cried . 628238_629778
and then all_of_a_sudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying . 629796_634166
and she told her story to the fairy godmother . 634216_635966
and the fairy godmother waved her wand . 636588_638408
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with [/] with glass slippers . 638431_641911
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin . 642045_644535
and it turned into a beautiful carriage . 644556_646176
and she waved her wand over the mice . 646601_648211
and the mice turned into horses . 648228_649928
so ‡ Cinderella arrived <at the> [/] at the &-uh royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress . 650008_658218
&-uh she met the prince . 658871_660391

<but the> [/] &~Cin but the &-uh fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out (un)til midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight . 662488_669008
so ‡ Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away . 669060_673310
and the prince tried to catch her &-um because he was so enchanted with her . 673333_677483
but &-uh he couldn't catch up with her . 677990_679890
she [//] Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left <one of her golden &+slip or> [//] one of her glass slippers on the stairs . 680578_686928
&-uh she made it to the carriage and got home just in time . 687125_689845
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin . 690185_691865
and <the mice turned or> [//] the horses turned back into mice . 692235_694355
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party (be)cause <he was> [//] his heart belonged to her now . 695890_703690
so ‡ he sent couriers across the land again with the [/] &+g the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper . 704235_711225
and then he would know who [/] who was the beautiful woman at the ball . 711275_715015
so ‡ when the courier got to &-uh Cinderella's house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting &-uh to try the slippers on . 715801_724251
but unfortunately they [/] the slippers didn't fit either one of them . 724296_727806
and Cinderella came out_of the cellar and sat down . 727851_731421
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at [/] at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle . 731468_741658
and she and the prince lived happily ever after . 741680_743420
