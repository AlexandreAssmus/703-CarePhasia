well ‡ &=sighs this a story of &-um &=lips_smack a cat that climbed the tree . 46530_53010
and apparently didn't wanna get down (.) or couldn't get down . 54370_58520
an(d) so the little girl asked the dad to climb up the tree to get the cat . 59025_63435
and [/] &-um and I [//] (.) when he got up the tree
because the dog is [/] &+cl is barking . 71500_73800
and <he is> [//] &-like he's wanting to climb the tree . 74301_76781
so ‡ they're stuck . 76870_77740
you've got the father in the tree . 78176_79826
&=lips_smack he's stuck in the tree now because there's no ladder for him to get down . 80900_84180
an(d) the cat seems to be content up in the tree . 84860_88480
does not wanna get down . 88500_89660
and so somehow I don't know who called &=shrugs but &+s &-uh the fire department is here . 90051_94591
an(d) they're here to rescue the dad and the &+ca +/. 94611_97241
we'll I've [/] &+th I've had very good health . 98588_101468
an(d) I have not &-um had any major
which put me about fifty three . 108890_110710
so ‡ I've been really healthy . 110770_111850
bu
I ha
it was the s@l one . 119800_121060
and &-um &=lips_smack the pain was so severe that I was on around the clock &-um &=lips_smack medication . 121990_130470
Oxycontin . 130592_131463
&-um &=lips_smack &-uh &+m &-um &=lips_smack Morphine_sulfate did not relieve my pain at all . 132018_141008
&-um I either hadta get Dilaudid . 141511_143431
&-um or get a shot . 143810_146320
or [/] &-um &=lips_smack or be on my Oxycontin . 147335_152105
because &-um I could not walk . 152588_154938
i(t) was the most severe pain I've ever had in my whole life . 156190_160080
an
&=lips_smack and I had two options . 166170_168120
I &+h could either &-um &=lips_smack &=ges try some kind of &-um therap^peutic [
an(d) I opted for surgery . 177650_179000
an(d) so a week later I wen(t) in to have a discectomy on [/] &+i on my s@l one . 179791_184881
it's between my l@l five and my s@l one . 184900_187070
and &-uh it's been about two and a half years now . 187908_190428
an(d) the pain has gone away . 190480_192080
but I still have &-um side effects that probably will stay with me . 192100_196790
however ‡ I would rather have those side effects than the severe pain an(d) not be able to function . 196966_202046
so ‡ there . 203456_203696
okay . 204291_204611
on
an(d) so my daughter took him in . 223808_225108
an(d) we found out through &-uh several tests m_r_is (.) c_t scans that [/] &-um that he had a tumor . 225130_233600
an(d) this &+w tumor had wrapped around the kidney and had pushed out the liver . 234176_239156
an(d) that's how we found out that <he had> [/] &-uh &-uh he had a tumor . 239180_243510
&=lips_smack so ‡ we went to
and it was diagnosed that he had a rare form of kidney cancer which is called clear cell sarcoma . 247446_254186
which only one in about twenty children a year &-uh get . 254785_259925
and &-um <it was> [/] &-um it was diagnosed as stage three cancer . 261204_266235
<which means that it had> [//] &-um &+an well &=lips_smack it had metastasized to
however ‡ it was in [//] &+c contained to the lymph nodes hopefully . 273400_276820
&-um an(d) so that was a scary situation in my family . 277835_281375
&-um you_know ‡ not knowing exactly what the outcome was . 281551_286081
<and having to> [//] with my daughter &-uh &-uh you_know &+i <it was> [/] &+i it was a very hard &+i &-um situation (.) to know that your daughter is in this with her little boy . 286210_302480
"an(d) you can't say +""/. 302500_303460"
"+"" yes . 303561_303811"
"+"" everything will be &-uh (.) fine . 303920_305910"
a hundred percent sure . 306826_308476
an(d) so &-uh &+i it was scary becau
an(d) number two it was such a [/] &+s a little [/] little child that you didn't know what the results or the aftereffects of &=finger
an(d) so that <was a> [>] scary time in our family . 327350_329290
okay . 332060_332370
&-um I am a [/] a school nurse . 332433_334843
an(d) I have a program in my school . 334980_336630
an(d) it's called SMD which is severely mentally &-uh disabled children . 336650_340850
an(d) these &-uh children have &-uh traumanic [
or they're severely disabled where they're [//] &-uh they barely can function . 345588_351278
<they're usually in> [//] they are in wheelchairs . 351300_353910
&-um all their ADL-s are done for them . 354550_357290
<they are> [//] they don't communicate at all (.) &=ges verbally . 357733_361753
and so basically the only way that you can &+f communicate with them a_lot is
&-um by the way maybe &=points
or if they're
&-um the way that you touch them . 379831_382121
&-um &=lips_smack &-uh maybe just communicating +... 382140_388630
&-um <some of them> [//] &-um well &=lips_smack I have several classes . 388700_394130
there's another class that's MOMD which is a_little (.) more &=ges
an(d) so in that class we communicate by sign language . 399110_402050
&-like this &=ges
or you_know something like &=ges
so ‡ sometimes we do sign language with those kids . 409430_412260
an(d) we &+com communicate with them that way . 412310_414330
okay . [+ exc] 416770_417110
the beginning of the story it looks like there is <this little gir
an(d) somehow [//] I don't know how she got into a raging (.) river . 423600_427500
but it looks really cold . 427550_429140
&-um &=lips_smack (.) &-uh and (.) the &-uh fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her . 429260_439340
an(d) he has all his equipment on . 440166_441676
an(d) basically he hasta go out into this raging river
&-um an(d) he's grabbing on to some kind of &=head
an(d) then he's got some kind of a belt or something to
but he's also out there &-um in [/] in danger in his life too . 465780_473240
&=lips_smack okay . [+ exc] 474755_475155
there's this little boy prob(ab)ly ten twelve years ol
an(d) he's out playing soccer just havin(g) a really fun time . 478400_481120
and &-um the ball goes through (.) &=shrugs possibly maybe the neighbor's &-uh window . 481968_487918
or maybe it's his own front window . 487940_490270
and &-um &=lips_smack the ball &+lan &-er knocks over a lamp . 491083_496143
so ‡ actually it breaks the &=finger
and the man was sitting in a chair . 501225_503655
and then he picks up the ball . 503705_504985
an(d) he looks out the window . 505000_506760
an(d) that's all in those pi(c)tures . [+ exc] 507026_508546
so ‡ I don't know what the end of the story is . [+ exc] 508600_511190
I don't know what the little boy does (.) &+d +/. [+ exc] 511220_512980

an(d) I hope he learned a lesson to always listen to your mom . 567000_569660
once upon a time &=lips_smack there was a little girl named Cinderella . 571113_575443
an(d) she lived with her dad . 576356_577796
her mom had died years ago . 577990_579430
so ‡ it was just her [//] herself an(d) her dad . 579480_582520
an(d) then one day her dad remarried . 583273_586143
an(d) brought the new mom with two
&=lips_smack a
well ‡ (.) &=lips_smack Cinderella an(d) her dad really loved each other . 601471_607281

an(d) the stepmom &=lips_smack was not a very nice mom . 618236_622006
an(d) the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella . 622408_625218
an(d) so they made Cinderella do all the chores . 626135_629045
they made her do the dishes . 629090_631050
and scrub the floor . 631131_632321
and make the beds . 632665_633865

an(d) they would not let Cinderella be part of the fam(i)ly . 635608_638518
an(d) they made Cinderella &=lips_smack sleep upstairs in the addict [
