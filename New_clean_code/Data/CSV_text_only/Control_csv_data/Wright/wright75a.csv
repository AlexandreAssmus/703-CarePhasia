an(d) the firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder . 15506_19446
&-um an(d) there's also a bird in the tree . 19576_23446
well ‡ you take two slices of bread . 25481_27651
an(d) you put peanut butter on one slice an(d) jelly on the other one . 27741_30861
an(d) you put them together . 30876_32366
an(d) that makes a peanut butter an(d) jelly sandwich . 32906_35296
well ‡ not on camera but I've already told you that five years ago I had cancer . 35693_41713
I had surgery . 42426_43446
I had radiation . 43653_44753
I had chemotherapy which lasted well into three months . 44806_51086
&-uh all my hair fell out . 52041_54651
it grew back in . 56471_57591
my eyelashes didn't . 58088_59318
but &=head
&-uh &+w actually my eyelashes came back . 61630_65010
&=shows
&-uh (.) I lost thirty pounds . 67903_71653
an(d) that was not from bein(g) sick . 71860_74930
&-uh because I was &=head
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo [
I [/] I lost it because something in the chemotherapy (.) gave &=ges me a very bad taste in my mouth . 83083_91953
it tasted like I was chewin(g) on pennies . 92026_94346
you &=ges ever &+p when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth an(d) felt that &=ges taste ? 94396_99006
that's what everything tasted like to me no matter what it was . 99710_103200
and so food just didn't really have much of an appeal . 104155_107565
but I'm diabetic so I hadta eat . 108106_110026
but I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check . 110648_114618
so ‡ I lost thirty pounds which was not &+b a bad thing . 115213_118323
I wish I coulda kep(t) it off . 118930_120550
unfortunately <as I> [//] once we got the [/] the radiation an(d) the chemotherapy done an(d) the results of the radiation . 120653_129733
&-uh it took about two an(d) a half years . 130410_132710
but I gained all the weight back . 133266_135196
an(d) &-uh I go in (.) two weeks back to my oncologist for my five year checkup . 135786_143576
an(d) at that time if all sims [
so ‡ that's [/] that's &=head
&-uh yes &=head
&-um well ‡ let's see +... 166908_170748
&-um when it came to [/] &+m to me prob(ab)ly the most frightening thing I ever had was when somebody &+w &-uh somebody &+p a Peeping_Tom was standing at my window . 171251_185411
an(d) I just happened to look up an(d) stared him right in the eye . 185458_190018
scared me to death . 190956_192276
but on a even deeper level the thing that scared me the most I think . 192295_197705
I lived in Japan . 197723_198953
an(d) my daughters were one an(d) two . 198998_203058
an(d) <I had them> [//] my husband was in the field an(d) I had them both in high chairs . 203603_209093
an(d) I was makin(g) hot chocolate for them . 209143_211133
an(d) it was the kind where you put &=ges
an(d) then you pour the hot water . 214376_215696
(.) &+y an(d) my oldest girl was not in a high chair . 215716_218936
she was at the table . 219006_220506
an(d) &-uh I had the powder in both &+k in the cups . 220673_226723
an(d) I went &=ges
an(d) as I did she was so anxious she decided to get up at the table as &=ges
an(d) her fingers hit the [/] &+cu &=ges
and flipped the cup &=ges
an(d) scared me to death . 243955_248615
what scared me was she di(d)n't cry . 249306_253326
&-uh she [//] &+fortun it was winter an(d) she had &=ges
an(d) &-uh I hurried up an(d) got that off of her . 257185_261226
an(d) (.) got in my car . 261565_264966
an(d) you couldn't call nine-one-one then . 265075_268205
it's [//] this is fifty years ago . 268258_270088
&-uh so ‡ I got in my car to take her to the dispensary which was a good ways away . 270135_275475
an(d) &-uh <I had my neighbor> [//] I gave the baby &=hands
an(d) &=ges
an(d) started &=points to the [/] &+dis the dispensary . 282496_286216
an(d) &-uh as I went through the &=hand
an(d) honked the horn like crazy . 292336_295016
an(d) he came over . 295080_296330
an(d) I told him what had happened . 296348_298078
"an(d) he said +""/. 298241_299831"

an(d) he got &=hand
an(d) the guy &=points <in the jeep> [//] in the MP jeep led the way &=points with his siren on . 303346_310146
the other MP drove my car . 310375_312255
an(d) we went over <to the base> [//] <to the [/] the> [//] to the dispensary . 312301_316761
an(d) they took her &=ges right in . 317535_318985
an(d) while I was sittin(g) there she &=shrugs passed out I thought . 319038_325158

an(d) I'd watch &=eyelashes
&=head
the next day he told me that her heart &+has had &=ges stopped . 348133_352483
that she had gone into shock . 352530_354200
an(d) that it was only &=ges
but it scared me . 360501_361831
&+s I_mean I wasn'(t) even aware of how bad it was . 361855_364675
he didn't wanna tell me . 364723_365853
I said to him the next day when I took her back to (h)im +... 366353_370523
"I said +""/. 371271_371421"
"+"" why didn't you tell me what was happening ? 371605_373875"

so ‡ that's probably &=head
(.) yes . 400703_401213
I worked as a speech therapist I told you this <&-uh in> [>] El Paso Texas at the (.) cerebral palsy clinic there . 405261_414061
&-uh an(d) a_lot of the people that I worked with had +//. 414285_418795
they were children for the most part . 419010_420740
&-uh an(d) I loved workin(g) with kids . 420910_424290
so ‡ <that was> [//] it was fun for me . 424335_426445
but they had &=ges all different kinds of problems . 426503_430033
+< &-uh (.) some of them were &+ah +//. 432091_433491
we didn't know at the time . 433596_435166
the diagnosis wasn't thrown around like it is now because this was fifty years ago . 435185_440765
an(d) &-uh &-uh &+d &-uh some o(f) them were autistic . 441146_445786
the one little girl had had spinal meningitis . 445948_449438
an(d) had [//] was now blind . 449533_451523
an(d) had a hard time hearing . 451538_452728
an(d) couldn't [/] &=head
she was nine . 455336_456476
bu(t) [//] she [//] they &=ges hadta start all over with her like she was a baby (.) to teach her &=hand
an(d) they said eventually she was gonna be okay . 463431_466421
an(d) I only worked with her for a year or so . 467438_469308
I don't know but I did speech therapy with her . 469376_471706
&-uh &+th the one patient that they sent me to see &-uh +//. 471901_476781
I_mean I had no business doing any o(f) this . 476840_479140
I had no background . 479185_480315
&-uh but they &=head
an(d) &-uh the one patient was a woman who had had a stroke . 485191_488921
an(d) had aphasia . 489736_491196
an(d) &=ges
an(d) she was talkin(g) about her cake . 495570_497430

an(d) &-uh I don't think I accomplished a thing with her . 500806_504346
I [/] I really don't . 504648_505898
&-um but that was before they placed so much value on early work with stroke people . 506625_514434
an(d) I &=head
&-um (..) other_than that &-uh I had (.) &-uh a daughter . 517951_526971
I have a daughter <who is> [//] <has a genetic> [//] she's missing part of a chromosome . 527278_533968
an(d) didn't talk at all til she was about two an(d) a half . 534808_538418
never &=head
an(d) then started off very slowly . 539835_542635
an(d) now &+n I can't shut her up . 542656_544646
&-uh she's fifty (.) five ? 545655_550415
an(d) has the &+mental +//. 550467_553587
well ‡ it's &-uh +... 553860_554680
she would test probably at about ten years old . 556131_559461
she reads . 560565_561265
&-uh she's a sports fanatic . 562260_565480
but it [/] it was a long time comin(g) an(d) workin(g) with her tryin(g) &=ges
&-uh (.) to express herself in any way really (.) was difficult . 571098_577968
&-uh other_than that (.) I don't think so . 578296_583436
it's a picture of two people stuck in a flood . 587711_590301
