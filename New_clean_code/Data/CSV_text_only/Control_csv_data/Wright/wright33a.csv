today was little Timmy's birthday . 51590_55850
he was five years old . 55901_58711
his mother had baked him a large chocolaty cake with beautiful drippy icing and five wonderful candles . 59818_70688
but as the guests were arriving the dog took the opportunity to take a large bite of the beautiful chocolaty cake . 70840_80830
and &+a
but the dog hid underneath the sofa . 90300_94980
tracking chocolaty footprints all the way . 95425_99135
the little boy was crying . 99180_102620

and the mother angrily [//] <continued angrily to threaten> [//] continued to angrily threaten the dog with the broom . 108196_116056

and everybody got a huge slice of the untainted side of the birthday cake . 126318_131388
and little Timmy had a wonderful fifth birthday with his little friend John and his little friend Greta . 131405_139745

one day I was out to lunch with my friend Bill . 149483_154413
it was a work day . 155420_156410
and we were at Mimi's cafe . 156570_158450
and my stomach started hurting . 159088_160918
and I thought &=shrugs that it might just be stre
so ‡ I ignored it . 168353_169203

who were &=shrugs (.) ten and nine at the time . 194136_199126
and I didn't have my third one . 199438_201178
so ‡ my two kids . 201300_202430
&-um and take them to his wife . 202480_205780
and drive me to the hospital . 206266_207756
which he did . 208563_209333
and I spent from
&-uh they did a_lot_o(f) tests on me . 217776_220046
they found out that I have one kidney . 220063_221743
I was thirty one years old . 221790_223250
and I had no idea I only had one kidney . 223511_225571
but they looked for kidney stones . 225693_227423
and they only saw one kidney which was huge . 227441_230681
"and they thought +""/. 230700_231090"
"+"" what's going on ? 231333_232023"
they looked for the other one . 232040_233150
they never found it (be)cause I don't have another one . 233165_235975
so ‡ I found out I didn't have another kidney . 236523_238823
and I also found out I didn't have kidney stones . 238841_243081
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis . 243105_248345
and it was about to kill me . 248390_249880
so ‡ Doctor Geiger came . 250465_252715
he was the anesthesiologist . 256398_257748
he introduced himself . 257766_258866
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists . 258890_261440
"I said +""/. 261579_261950"
"+"" yes . 262449_262929"
I was in a_lot_of pain . 262975_264855
because the pain medication they had given me &-um +... 264871_269441
I couldn't have any more . 270015_271165
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons . 271373_276053
so ‡ I was in a_lot_of pain . 276106_278236
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things . 278525_283095
and so Doctor Geiger put me under . 283818_286318
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly . 286335_289935
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a &=ges
what are those things called ? 292783_294993
a ventilation tube down my throat . 295150_298020
&-um and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up . 298463_301333
and they gave me some medication . 301746_303866
and sent me home . 304303_305293
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo &=ges
and now I have a third baby . 309498_310748
the end . 310800_311340
okay ‡ one time I was at +... 318660_321300
oh was it Sea_World ? 321443_324843
it was Sea_World in San_Diego . 324978_327068
with three children . 327113_331013
&-uh one of which was in a stroller . 331701_335481
and I was walking . 336155_337785
"and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said +""/. 337835_342455"
"+"" look ! 342613_342903"
so ‡ I was looking . 343498_344948
and then there was a man off to the right <of the> [/] of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily . 344970_353680
and I looked up at him and <there was> [//] he was indicating to me something . 354306_360936
and I looked to my right . 361470_363130
and there's a woman there with a stroller . 363150_364790
and she's fuming at me . 364813_366493
and she's telling her husband six feet away to tell me that I'm in her way . 367071_374761
and I look over at the woman . 374958_378328
and she looks at me like she wants to (.) hit me . 378381_382441
and she's &=points yelling at her husband to tell me &=points
&-um so ‡ I looked at her husband . 386335_389665
and I looked at her . 389716_391316
"and I said +""/. 391336_392206"
"+"" she can talk to me . 392983_394273"
"+"" and the words “excuse me” work very well . 394813_397363"
&-um and so I looked at her . 397386_399376
and she continued to fume at me . 399400_400980
didn't say a single thing to me &-um until after her husband had told me to move . 401000_407030
&-um then she cussed at me and called me a name . 407053_409793
and &-um so I basically let her live her miserable life . 409838_413148
and &-um that's all I really did about it . 413221_415801
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred an(d) six degree temperature . 420191_426581
so ‡ I took her to the emergency room . 427425_429335
and &-um she wouldn't take anything orally . 430196_434366
she jus
&-um and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard even_though her temperature was a hundred an(d) six was a good sign . 439258_448708
so ‡ they gave her &-um &-um +... 449328_453008
&-um what's the nice way to say this ? 453165_455625
a rectal fever reducer . 455713_458203
and she eventually got better . 458890_461480
we got her on antibiotics . 461640_463040
&-um but I was extremely afraid (be)cause it was my first child . 463085_466715
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred an(d) six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature . 466815_472935
so ‡ I took her to the hospital . 472980_475910
and she eventually got better . 475963_477373
okay ‡ once upon a ti
it was raining very hard . 490800_492190
but she hadta get home . 492241_493611
and so she crossed the bridge . 493656_496506
but the bridge wasn't very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was &=ges decaying the under girders . 496528_507488
made that up . 507865_508835
and so the bridge gave way . 508951_511221
and the girl fell off of the bridge . 511241_513160
for she was really riding a bike . 513178_516227
and it was a rumbly bridge . 516246_518326
and she fell into the water . 518342_520153
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help . 521239_525119
eventually someone heard her cries for help . 525211_528471
and put on all the rescue [//] necessary rescue gear . 528520_533560
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her . 533615_539275
and she was very grateful . 539368_541718
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him . 541736_545506
"and he said +""/. 545526_545976"
"+"" don't ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain . 546200_550710"

one day a bo
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball . 559486_564096
and he kicked it into the air . 564378_566308
and it crashed through a neighbor's window . 566361_570611
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window . 570633_577793
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window . 577808_580438
but the boy ran away . 580485_583195
and the man walked outside looking for the boy . 583448_587568
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball . 587615_592425
the man scolded him . 592473_593873
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge . 594383_599943
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even . 600036_605176

one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain . 608635_617165

"the boy said +""/. 618911_619961"
"+"" no I'll be fine, mom . 620120_621390"
and the mother was hesitant . 621438_626718
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella . 626955_637345
then the boy was walking to school . 637560_639720
and it started to rain . 639825_641015
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did . 641066_645806
and so he
and wetly came in the door saying nothing . 654850_659280
but showing his mother that she was indeed right . 659331_662491
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being . 662540_670090
so ‡ she gave it to him . 670498_671558

once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella . 677768_684508
I would guess . [+ exc] 684553_686633
there was a little girl . 686818_687838
and her father was widowed . 688073_689613
and so he remarried . 689665_691145
and the new stepmother had two daughters the &+w girl's age . 691840_698430
and the stepmother was not very nice . 698446_703666
and as the dad got out_of the picture by an unfortunate series of events &-um the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave . 703780_719160
and turned her into basically a scullery maid . 719265_724105
and made her clean out the fireplace . 724460_727810
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I don't know what her name was before . 727861_731931
<and the> [//] one da
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife . 740795_747475
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress . 747546_754766
and the +... 754781_758851
let's just call her the wicked stepmother . 758908_760998
the wicked stepmother &-um was not interested in letting Cinderella go . 761188_769018
so ‡ when Cinderella came downstairs she
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress ? 780910_786620
actually ‡ not Cinderella . 786975_787985
she didn't do that at all . 788000_788830

so ‡ the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress . 793185_797885
Cinderella was very sad . 798425_799905
but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle . 799958_805578
and a
her rather plump fairy godmother came . 809728_813798
and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown . 813818_817268
turned the mice into coachmen and (.) horses . 817288_823968
and turned a pumpkin into a coach . 824020_826520
and Cinderella went to the castle . 826605_829345
the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her . 829486_832046
what are the chances ? [+ exc] 832066_833006

married the prince . 915130_916210
