pretty easy . [+ exc] 0_450
well ‡ you get the ingredients out . 550_1950
you get the [/] the bread that you'd wanna use . 2000_4510
I would first &=inhales take a paper plate and &-uh (.) put the two &-uh slices of &-uh bread on the plate . 4560_13280
and then &=inhales either before or after I'd go get &-uh &-uh the jelly and the peanut butter . 13298_18728
and if they were already open they'd probably be in the refrigerator . 18780_21430
&=inhales and then I would take two knives (be)cause I don't wanna adulterate one or the other . 22480_26550
&=inhales and <I would> [/] &-uh I would probably put the butter on first . 27190_30510
and &-uh (.) I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly . 31180_39280
an(d) &=inhales I would the [//] &-uh put the butter on the one side . 39300_43180
probably the right side just (be)cause it's [//] that's where it's at in my mind . 43330_46250
&=inhales and I would put it on evenly . 47050_48370
but I would put it on very [//] over the whole area . 48390_51280
not this area (be)cause I hate that . 51299_53019
an
&=inhales I'd probably use a_little less jelly than the [/] the peanut butter because I'd rather have more peanut butter . 56440_60650
&=inhales and then <I would put the two> [//] &-uh I would probably <take the> [//] &-uh in the left hand take the &=inhales one with the jelly and put it over the &-uh one with the peanut butter . 61470_70170
so ‡ the two &=inhales &-uh surfaces that have stuff on it &-uh face each other . 70219_75209
and I would put (th)em so <the top of the loaf is where the> [//] &+to you_know the top of the piece is where it has a &+w symmetrical . 75860_81320
&=inhales and then I would cut it in half probably this way &+hori &-uh horizontally . 82020_85460
&=inhales and then <I would> [//] (.) know what I'd eat it . 86160_88460
I don't know if you wanna know that so &+c . [+ exc] 88480_89840
an(d) at some point I'd [//] probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife [>] wouldn't yell at me . 95250_99400
looks like there is &-uh a kitty got up into &-uh &-uh the branch of a tree . 99610_105940
and &-uh it looks like the father &-uh climbed up on the tree with a ladder . 106790_111940
and somehow the ladder (.) fell down . 113222_116902
and the father is stuck in the tree . 117380_119970
&=inhales there's a girl up there &-uh reaching up for &-uh (.) probably her cat . 120430_125130
and there's a tricycle &-uh next to her . 125820_128470
and there's a ladder there that's &=inhales quite a ways from the tree . 129080_132040
so ‡ I don't understand how it got that far away . [+ exc] 132060_134390
but (.) maybe it tipped over backwards . 134410_136440
&=inhales and then there's a dog probably their dog barking &-uh up the tree . 136960_140900
(a)n(d) you_know why I have no idea what dogs do . [+ exc] 141335_143975
&=inhales and then there's a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree . 143990_147780
an(d) then &=lips_smack evidently somebody called a fire department . 147800_151470
an(d) there's a firetruck . 151490_152620
an(d) there's a couple fireman &=inhales carrying a ladder &-uh towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there . 152730_158660
but maybe it's not a good enough one . 158680_160750
and that's pretty much it . [+ exc] 160774_161704
so ‡ evidently &=inhales the father &-uh climbed up the tree to get the cat out . 161721_166411
an(d) &=inhales for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down . 166430_170560
an(d) somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the &-uh fire department . 170580_174670
and &=inhales they're responding . 174687_176177
an
looks like it's low enough he can just jump down so +... 177657_179527
the thing was is that &-uh (.) I never had a heart attack . 179740_183820
and [//] other_than havin(g) a very little &-uh (.) chest pain . 183840_188160
&-uh it was kind_of somewhat of a surprise so +... 188359_191939
&=inhales I had [//] &-uh went an(d) had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician . 192658_197058
and &=inhales he said that was alright . 197074_199254
which they don't show anything &*INV
so ‡ now he suggested a stress echo . 200710_202600
so ‡ I [/] &=inhales I had a stress echo . 202645_204755
an(d) I went to it . 204774_205814
and [/] and I failed it . 205837_206797
you_know ‡ I (wa)s kind_of shocked . 207168_208198
&+is (.) and I &+w was gonna do things afterwards . 210310_213270
an(d) &=inhales I just called my wife . 213290_214980
an(d) [/] and &-uh talked to her . 215093_217493
and then I went home . 217513_218293
an(d) [/] &=lips_smack an(d) then &-uh they did a &-uh cardiac catharization [
&=lips_smack and &-uh (.) between the first day and the second day &-uh they gave me nitroglycerine . 225380_231220
an(d) then I just (.) didn't do anything (be)cause I didn't wanna have a heart attack &*INV
and I had a cardiac catharization [
an(d) I didn't know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was &=inhales older and past his prime wouldn't have done anything if [/] if [/] if +//. 237677_245647
and he wouldn't even put it in a stent . 245700_247920
because [//] &+m which I wouldn't have used him if I would have known that . 248400_252160
&=inhales make a long story short I had three main
one was blocked a hundred percent . 256160_257420
+< one was blocked ninety eight percent . 257558_259048
&=inhales and one was blocked eighty percent . 259560_260890
so ‡ I was very fortunate that I didn't &=inhales either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that &*INV
and I had surgery . 267650_268870
an(d) I had surgery by a [/] &-uh (.) a cardiac surgeon that was considered by &-uh (.) the nurses an(d) people in general one of the better ones . 268990_281830
I went to Scottsdale_Healthcare_Osborn . 282495_284885
an(d) before I went I called and asked (th)em how many &=inhales &-uh procedures they did the previous year . 284901_289531
an(d) based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance [>] you had a better success . 289555_293285
so ‡ they were even better than &=inhales at Mayo . 293305_295355
&+th at the time Mayo was at &-uh (.) Scottsdale &-uh Shea . 295370_299120
and it was li(ke) oh three or four hours there . 300250_302210
I [//] to this day I don't know because what my wife told me &=inhales and &+w what she now says is different . 302540_308170
so ‡ it &+d doesn't matter . 308192_309222
&=lips_smack and &-uh when I got done . 309980_311300
&=inhales &-uh it's [/] it's very intrusive . 312020_315620
you don't know what the &*INV
&=inhales and &-uh they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked &=laughs really bad . 320270_326930
but I was calm . 327200_328080
an(d) well ‡ (.) my brother just had it a <couple weeks> [>] ago . 328127_330367
an(d) his wife said he didn't look that bad . 330390_332460
so ‡ I don't know what that means . 332540_333640
well ‡ &=lips_smack when I saw my mob [
but <she did> [//] &+ver she recovered very &+g rapidly . 339293_341553
and she's still alive . 341570_342500
and that's about fifteen years ago . 342519_343969
&=inhales &-uh &=lips_smack and then I just remember that it [/] &-eh &-uh (..) it took a long time to recover . 346125_353865
"an(d) then one day I went to the (.) cardiologist and he said you_know +""/. 353880_356690"
"+"" go back to work . 357100_357790"
&=inhales which (.) when I went back to work I had problems (be)cause it really was too soon . 357840_361480
"I should have said you_know +""/. 361580_362300"
"+"" well ‡ I'm not really ready . 362480_363510"
and &-uh my wife has always said that &-uh after that I acted like an old man . 364310_369530
<I was> [/] I was fifty five at the time . 369720_372330
that must have been ten years ago . 372880_373870
&=inhales and &-uh the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems . 374663_379253
&=inhales and &-uh I would go from one room to the other <to find out> [//] to get something . 379880_384380
by the time I <got there I forgot> [>] that . 384400_386080
&=inhales and they said that &-uh that was &-uh go away in six months . 386630_390930
it never did . 391030_391620
&=inhales &-uh I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long . 392599_397279
and &=inhales at that time they didn't have a filter in there that filters out the (.) little particles or whatever that causes your problem . 397300_404450
&=inhales and &-uh I've never really been the same since then . 405020_407800
and &-uh you_know that's the [//] pretty much the end of the thing [>] . 408890_413320
the story . 413533_413983
+< &+n no [/] no ‡ I had a little chest pain when I was at work when I walked from the [/] the place I worked into the washroom . 424820_430530
an(d) &=inhales one day it [/] it was a &+l very very little right here . 430550_434530

an
the &+c cardiac &*INV

+< yeah ‡ well [/] well ‡ I +/. 455270_455770
+< <ninety eight and eighty> [//] &+ou &*INV
but the thing was they did five bypasses . 460243_462473
and they took out +/. 462557_463737
both of what they identified as a stroke . 463760_465390
and [/] and they [//] it was very difficult to communicate with them . 465659_469949
&-uh I had an aunt that had [//] &-uh was very old . 470580_473380

that's probably my favorite aunt so [>] +... 486830_488260
and &-uh sometimes I have problems communicating with my wife . 490024_492984
&+b we both don't hear that well . 493860_495180
an(d) [>] we'd &+t start talkin(g) and walk away . 495200_498100
an(d) [/] and &-uh a_lot_o(f) people if you pay attention they jus(t) &+s &+s speak a_lot . 498120_503800
<like my> [//] I've got a son that is an engineer . 503850_506520
an(d) (.) I think he's just stressed out from work (be)cause he's overworked . 506544_509654

&=inhales and &-uh we were moving from one location to another because my dad's &=inhales &-uh place of employment &-uh moved . 567720_575550
and &-uh (.) we were &-uh carrying some stuff on a [/] a big long trailer that he was pulling with his &-uh nineteen fifty five &-uh Buick . 576730_587820
&=inhales and it was a rented U_haul . 589320_590980
an(d) we were driving down the (.) two lane highway and &-uh +//. 591000_596900
"probably going about forty, forty five . 597595_599095"

I didn't know what happened at the time . 601255_603265
but subsequently I found out that &=inhales &-uh one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch &=inhales . 603280_609680
because it was put in upside down . 610056_611386
it came &+aw undone and it fell out . 611409_612939
and because of that &=inhales it [//] &-uh the trailer caused the car to go like this . 613235_617815
(.) and &-uh the car was going like this . 619950_622880
and I had a big &=inhales round mirror that was above the dresser . 623040_627000
and I had it <in my> [//] in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side . 627023_630863
&=inhales because &-uh (.) you_know so it didn't get broken . 631540_634520

an
an(d) to make a long story short +... 643750_644970
&=inhales the trailer caused the car t(o) spin all the way around . 645600_649720
