and they follow the cake mess to under the couch where it looks like the dog has taken a bite out_of the cake and is now resting . 41490_51260

okay ‡ Cinderella was an only child . 367175_371995

&-um but Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life . 408346_415926

he was a mean old cat . 421136_422216
that was the stepmother's cat . 422231_423491

"and this fairy godmother appears and does this bippety_boppety_boo thing, whips her up a real pretty white dress . 634526_641176"
