the boy made it to school walking to school without getting wet because he used the umbrella like his mom told him in the first place . 385138_395410
so ‡ the story of Cinderella &-uh starts off by &-um Cinderella's father takes her to &-uh her new home with [//] &-uh and introduces (th)em to her new stepsisters and her new stepmother . 397025_414286
and so at first things are okay . 414286_418328
and Cinderella just ends up having to do chores and earn [/] earn her keep inside the house . 418328_426510
and &-uh then one day there was a grand ball going on at the great palace . 426510_434383
and an invitation came that said all the ladies in the house could come to the grand ball . 434383_440875
so ‡ everybody was really excited at [//] that they were gonna go to the grand ball at the palace . 440875_449241
and so everybody was gettin(g) ready . 449241_452130
and Cinderella had a nice dress . 452130_454555
and it seemed to be nicer than her stepsisters' . 454555_458820
so ‡ her stepsisters got jealous wrecked her dress &-uh made fun of her and everything . 458820_466325
and Cinderella was upset . 466325_468050
and then she couldn't go to the ball because her dress was ruined . 468050_471020
and the stepsisters just laughed at her and made fun of her . 471020_475801
so ‡ Cinderella stayed at home . 475801_478126
and the &+s stepsisters ended up going out to the ball . 478126_483270
&-uh meanwhile ‡ there was a magic mouse or &+s +... 483270_488100
I think it was a magic mouse that &-uh granted Cinderella a wish . 488100_493395
and Cinderella wished she could go to the ball and [/] and have a nice dress to [/] to go to the ball in . 493395_500348
and so [//] &-um oh it was a fairy godmother . 500348_504833
the fairy godmother granted the wish to Cinderella and gave Cinderella the most beautiful dress that there ever was and turned the pumpkin into a carriage so_that she could be escorted in <to the> [/] to the grand ball in a nice carriage with her nice dress . 504833_523906
so ‡ when she gets to the grand ball &-uh everybody's impressed with how beautiful Cinderella is and how nice her dress is . 523906_531931
and the prince asks Cinderella to dance . 531931_535098
and the evil stepsisters are there and are so jealous that Cinderella's there and now with an even nicer dress than she had before . 535098_543086
and now she's getting asked to dance with the prince which all the stepsisters wanted and [/] and were so envious of Cinderella . 543086_551885
so ‡ Cinderella was so enlightened and enthusiastic about being at the ball with the beautiful dress and now dancing with the prince . 551885_562950
and it was like a dream come true . 562950_564288
"but &-uh the fairy godmother said +""/. 564288_566663"
"+"" you hafta be home before midnight . 566663_567990"
"+"" so ‡ otherwise everything won't go back to normal . 567990_571526"
and so Cinderella noticed that it was almost midnight . 571526_575641
so ‡ she runs out [/] out_of the ball <in a> [//] right after her dance with the prince . 575641_580438
but the prince wanted to know more about Cinderella . 580438_583860
so ‡ the prince chased after . 583860_586016
Cinderella was running down the steps lost one of her slippers . 586016_589553
but she didn't care because she hadta get home before midnight . 589553_592260
and &-uh so she gets in her carriage and &+o gets &-uh escorted away back to her home . 592260_602050
&-um but she makes it home in time . 602050_604706
so ‡ everything turns back to normal . 604706_607131
her [//] <her nice> [//] her beautiful dress turns back to a normal just apron dress . 607131_612300
and the carriage turns back into a pumpkin . 612300_616425
and &-uh so the next day the prince still with the [/] the thoughts of Cinderella on his mind &+wa wants to find out who Cinderella was . 616425_627876
and all he has left is a glass slipper . 627876_630226
so ‡ he sends out &-uh his servant to find who the woman was with the glass slipper and makes everybody try out the [//] a glass slipper . 630226_640721
and <finally they find> [//] &-uh &+th they finally find someone who the glass slipper fits on . 640721_648473
and it's Cinderella . 648473_649448
and all the evil stepsisters are again so furious at Cinderella because she's the lucky one that fits the glass slipper . 649448_659061
and she had the greatest experience ever . 659061_661285
and &-um so &-um the prince oversees that Cinderella's just &-uh a lonely servant girl . 661285_672140
and the prince decides to marry her . 672140_674993
and they you_know get married and live happily ever after . 674993_678993
