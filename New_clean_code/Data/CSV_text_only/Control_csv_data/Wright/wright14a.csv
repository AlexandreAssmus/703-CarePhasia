okay . [+ exc] 2638_3088
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 3392_5792
first you would go to the fridge and get the bread . 6387_9817
then +... 9927_11827
well ‡ then you would take the bread and grab two slices . 12350_15790
and you would put peanut butter on both slices (be)cause I love extra peanut butter . 16360_20660
&-um then you would put jelly on both those slices . 20682_24762
then if you want you could put the banana in it but it's peanut butter and jelly so I wouldn't put banana . 25377_29237
and I would just put the two slices together &=hands
put in on a plate . 31691_32641
and then begin to eat it . 32665_34755
milk might go better but we're good . 36230_39110
"alright, I am . 46252_47642"

people are arriving . 60886_61906
and &-uh needless to say his birthday is ruined because his birthday cake is half eaten by the dog who is nonetheless sleeping under the couch after a nice fat meal . 62138_73258
we all know how that feels . 73594_74614
and so he sees that and he gets mad . 75817_78547
the mother gets worse [//] even more mad and wants to go &-uh you know get the dog out from under the couch and you_know use her broom and bop him on the head and teach him a lesson . 78566_87286
and &-uh eventually they realize well it's alright . 88593_92813
it's not the end of the world . 92949_93909
&-uh they love the dog . 94499_95539

so ‡ I was out_of football for like two weeks . 276684_280104
came back . 280608_281168
and that was about it . 281775_283405
you_know . 283832_284502
yes ‡ my brother . 297772_299282
okay . 308666_308756
well ‡ the person I have had trouble communicating or has had trouble communicating that I know of &-uh that first comes to mind would be my brother . 310190_318920
even_though I've worked with many autistic kids . 319111_320761
I useta do a_lot_of volunteer work &-um at camps with autistic kids and manic depressive all those different disorders . 320889_327119
&-um I probably know my brother best . 327377_330087
and my brother &-uh I diagnose it as just a social problem . 330273_336413
but when he was younger he [/] <he just> [//] you_know he couldn't really say what he wanted or tell you or [/] or you_know kind_of socially get along with my [//] me and my friends or anything of the sort . 336437_346947
and &-um you_know just take for example one time he wanted to &-uh you_know play on the trampoline with us . 347551_357691
and we weren't sure what he was wanting and he was just jumping on the trampoline . 358515_363815
"jumps, jumps on and jumps into the middle of our game and you_know kind_of frustrates everybody . 363869_367939"
and you_know I see that and [/] and after awhile +//. 368717_370847
this has happened before . 371032_371832
I [/] I understand what he's trying to tell me . 371850_374300

"so ‡ you_know I tell him +""/. 377055_377435"
"+"" alright well why don't you do this . 377660_380060"

and you_know we kind_of end up beatin(g) the hell out_of him on the trampoline . 384494_387634
and he still laughs even_though we beat him up . 387681_391021
and it ends up turning into a_lot_of fun . 391038_393298
and [/] and you_know he's happy . 393346_396166
and [/] and eventually he learned to communicate better . 396289_401149
"there have been times when I [//] you_know I've told him you_know +""/. 401561_404311"

my best friend Tal was with me . 428755_430325
we go to this party . 430404_431394
&-uh at this party &-um a friend of mine is playing beer pong . 432777_437457
his name's Harry . 437572_438272
he's a crazy crazy kid . 438515_439675

he's insane . 444099_444689
&-like he'll go off the walls . 444707_445687
so ‡ &-um he's playing &-uh beer pong at this party in the back yard . 446153_451433
and there's &=ges
and &-um he [/] he wins . 454831_457001

and I just listen and look and feel and try to take in as much as I can . 523980_528530
and I get ready . 528578_529128
and make a long story short &-uh the kid gets in his face . 529517_534257
and <I simply> [//] my &+f friend Tal's &=ges

&=ges
&-um &-uh I put my head kind_of closer to his near his shoulder . 542286_547986
