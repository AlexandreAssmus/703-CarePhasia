okay ‡ so ‡ one day &-uh I decided to go outside and enjoy the nice weather and go for a jog . 857594_864794
&-uh I noticed <that I had been> [//] that I was feeling kinda weak and feeling kinda nauseous . 865443_871313
&-um thinking that it was just &-uh part of getting back into exercise I didn't think too much of it . 871389_877739
however the following days it continued to get worse and worse . 878070_882400
&-um I started to get more nauseous and feel more weak . 882946_886876
and I was sleeping up to twenty one hours a day . 887367_891337
&-um finally I decided that I needed to go to the doctor . 891353_896153
and at that point I had become jaundice which is yellow [/] &+s yellow skin and the whites of my eyes had become yellow . 896344_903514
&-uh the doctor had sent me to the hospital and [//] where I was hospitalized for four days while they did tests to figure what might be wrong with me . 903592_915792
&-uh all of my family came to visit . 915854_918084
and they hadta wear gloves for protection since they didn't know what was wrong with me . 918722_923392
and after several tests and several visits from the doctor they discovered that it was Hepatitis_a . 923911_929311
and after several days of being on i_v and getting rehydrated &-uh I did recover as there is no cure . 929589_939419
and I [//] <after about> [//] about two months after that after I got out_of the hospital . 939636_939716
I was one hundred percent recovered and very happy that it wasn't something worse . 939716_948726
the end . 949419_950029
wait . 952679_952949
by <language problems> [//] &-uh communication problems does it mean someone that mighta had a disorder or is just it an issue communicating ? 956175_965015
okay . 966112_966302
alright . 966840_967080
okay [>] . 970136_970346
okay . 973225_973755
okay ‡ so ‡ a few years ago when I was in school &-uh I was taking a class where I was partnered up with &-uh a student from China <who had a very difficult> [//] who had difficulties communicating verbally in English . 979882_996622
&-um he [/] he was hard to understand . 996667_999047
but I did my best to communicate with him by &-um maybe not trying to understand his complete sentences but trying to pick out words out_of what he was saying and try to match that into the context of what was going on around us to piece together what he might be saying . 999604_1020444
and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on &-uh stating how I was understanding him so_that at some point if I didn't understand him he would realize that I wasn't understanding him . 1021544_1039304
and &+afrel after several weeks it just got easier and easier to understand what he was saying . 1042422_1045922
I would [//] just became accustomed to the accent and the words that he might choose to use . 1046231_1053031
and over time it got easier . 1054081_1055451
okay ‡ so ‡ <it was> [/] &-uh it was night time on Friday night . 1067825_1072525
and one o(f) my friends was having a small get-together over at her house . 1074312_1078392
just a few of us . 1078624_1079514
and she invited me over . 1079875_1080905
so ‡ I went over there . 1081752_1083072
and I got to the house . 1084404_1085074
and the few of us were just hanging around watching tv having a good time . 1085811_1090641
and &-uh we hear a knock at the door . 1091917_1094307
and just thinking that maybe it was &-uh another guest or not thinking much of it &-uh the [//] &-uh one of her friends answers the door . 1094934_1103244
and it turns out to be a guy in a mask &-uh attempting to either rob us or rob the house . 1103693_1110513
and &-uh the first thing that the girl who answers the door says is that he has a gun . 1111631_1117321
and he [//] so he comes in . 1117966_1119286
and there's another &-uh man behind him that stays outside . 1119619_1124519
but <one of> [/] &+th one of the guys comes in . 1125253_1128013
and he proceeds to take things from the house and take things from the people that are in the house . 1128519_1133129
just very quickly grab some things and runs out . 1133449_1136949
and that's [/] that's the end . 1137743_1138873
so [>] ‡ without getting too detailed . 1138932_1140582
but [<] [//] so I was pretty scared . 1141360_1142690
okay ‡ one late afternoon &-uh a woman is returning home from work &-uh struggling to get through the traffic as it is very rainy that day . 1151542_1163202
&-uh the traffic is very heavy . 1163321_1165971
the [/] the streets are beginning to get flooded . 1166228_1168508
&-eh so ‡ she decides to take a shortcut through a side street . 1169297_1173337
she gets into the side street and realizes that it is overflooded and her car gets stuck . 1174106_1179996

&-uh the young boy refuses to take the umbrella as he doesn't wanna carry the extra weight and doesn't wanna look uncool in front of his friends . 1280775_1290305
&+h he hands the umbrella back to his mother . 1290354_1292594
