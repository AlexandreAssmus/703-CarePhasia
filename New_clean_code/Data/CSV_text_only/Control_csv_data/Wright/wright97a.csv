so ‡ little Amina went outside to play with her cat . 55316_57596
and her cat (.) got excited and scared because the dog started to chase it . 58036_63316
which is what the neighbor's dog always does . 63338_64938
his very annoying dog . 64991_66161
and the neighbors just don't keep it in his yard like they're sposta . 66810_69810
and so the cat ran up the tree . 69893_71203

but then the ladder fell over . 80345_81985
and he got stuck . 82198_82798
so ‡ then the neighbors even_though they're very bad with their dog they were also very kind neighbors . 83140_87890
and they noticed he was stuck in the tree . 87975_89485
and they called the fire department which is kind_of an overreaction (be)cause they could've just fixed the ladder themselves . 90330_95020
<and the> [/] &+c and the bird was singing very contentedly over this entire scene . 95463_100053

I did &-um trail riding recreational trail riding on horses in Northern_California in college and most weekends . 110360_119300
and I went out &-um with the other riders . 119668_122918
and I actually fell off the horse and got a concussion . 123120_126830

Quasar was &-like sixteen hands or something . 134085_135985
and fell right &=ges
I lost consciousness for a few minutes . 139186_141276
and then when I came back to the college campus I went to the health clinic . 141436_145176
and they sent me to the hospital to get a cat [
and they kept me overnight . 149133_150523
&-um <I remember> [/] I remember one of the girls at the end of the hall . 151386_154526
I think it was &-like Thanksgiving weekend or something . 154543_156913
it was some holiday weekend . 156930_157910
there weren't a_lot_of people around . 157926_159036
and so Katie of all people happened to be around . 159056_161446
not a close friend but someone I knew . 161500_163160
and she was so nice . 163208_164088
she took me (.) to the hospital . 164141_166311
and it was the emergency room . 166333_168143
and it was just &-like crowded . 168160_169640
and I think it was maybe even a Saturday night . 169655_171755
and there were police bringing in &-like people with (.) &=ges cocaine in their stomachs . 171778_176068
I_mean it was an interesting +//. 176128_177018

I think there was &-like some &=ges gunshot wound „ you_know . 181388_184208

and they needed to keep me overnight . 189216_190916
they did the cat [
&-um they kept me overnight . 192658_195298
I remember I just really really wanted to go home and take a shower . 195350_197650
and the person I was sharing a room with <I think> [//] was having some sort of family difficulty . 197703_202833
or she was very unhappy and possibly very sick or in pain or something . 202938_207758
and so she was having a hard time and +... 207780_209780
I remember that my friends came the next day to pick me up . 210071_212791
and &-uh they forgot to bring clothes with them . 212841_214821
so ‡ I was wearing a hospital gown with a [/] a &=ges
&-um basically &-um that's the time I was in the hospital &=laughs . 223473_227533
&-uh certainly . 237361_239001
I'm going to recall „ yeah . 239500_240960
<frightened or scared> [=! whispering] +//. 245791_246161
oh &=slaps
&-um last spring right before summer vacation I was &=laughs in my house [//] <small apartment &-uh complex> [//] small apartment just doing some schoolwork or something . 248003_259933
and I suddenly started hearing this &=imit
&-um and I
and I went into the kitchen . 270693_271693
and I notice there's a bee <in my> [//] inside my house which I don't understand how +//. 271796_275736
&=covers
(be)cause it's absolutely closed all the time . 276936_279296
screens on the window . 280105_280855
there's no way . 280871_281491
so ‡ I thought that was odd (.) you_know trying to get out the window . 281668_285088
and I captured it . 285141_285951
and I put it outside . 285971_286901
and I noticed there were some bees flying around outside . 286950_288950
&=ges
I go into the bathroom . 290268_291428
and <my bathroom> [//] my shower stall has been invaded by about fifty bees . 292371_298331
I'm telling you it was like a horror movie . 298448_299778
it was the sound of &=ges &=imit
yes &=points
and I'm not overly phobic of bees . 303366_306316
I like them in their place . 307030_307950
I'm not like someone who runs away from them . 308020_309480
but a_lot_of them in my house in my bathroom . 309530_313510
and that feeling of going in . 313532_314682
and it was like a horror movie like &=imit
so ‡ &=ges
&=ges
&=ges and they're all trying to get out the window which was good . 321116_322796
they were focused on the window . 322843_323683
so ‡ yeah I [/] I freaked . 323743_325283
&-um I
I actually got a dirty towel and &-like &=ges
(be)cause you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes . 337623_339963
"and &-uh gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying +""/. 340385_345125"
"+"" &-um you needta get here now . 345361_346351"
"+"" we needta figure this out . 346848_347808"
"+"" what's going on ? 347905_348705"
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole &=ges
they were looking for a new &-um place to start a hive . 354598_357388
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting . 357890_360340
we hadta get someone &-um +... 360386_361956
you_know ‡ were they going in everywhere ? 363010_364440
how were they getting in ? 364486_365296
they hadta call a bee expert . 365345_366605
<so then> [//] but yeah that was a freaky moment . 366998_369368
and I was very creeped out . 369756_370916
I remember going into my closet and &-like &=ges
and I_mean &=ges they were very focused on the windows . 377291_379031
but it was a_little creepy to think that &-like it might be &=ges
&=points
&=ges
that was creepy &-uh for sure . 385576_387806
you_know ‡ and the bathroom is the last place you need anything +... 388151_390741
yeah ‡ you're vulnerable enough . 391340_392480
let's be honest . 392501_393161
&-like you just don't need anything coming at you with a stinger . 393285_396105
so ‡ yes <that was> [/] <that was> [/] that was scary . 396713_399243
certainly . 408421_409231
&=sighs <I'm trying to think of specific examples in the moment> [=! whispering] . 414400_417200
<it's interesting> [=! whispering] . 417215_418215
&-um (..) &-um I'm trying to think of
certainly while teaching &-um sometimes having students [//] particular students who really are struggling . 428097_435047
and you feel like there's not clear communication . 435743_439943
it's not &-uh a coherent reason for why it's not working and a resolution kind of thing . 439966_447946
and you're struggling to understand . 447970_449870
&-um certainly sending emails to find out . 449976_454216

i_e missing work or behavior in class or something like that . 482476_486076
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of &=ges where to go next &-um with that . 486538_496208
I'm trying to think . 496471_497101
<I've had> [/] I've had some really difficult situations with students of you_know basically just really disagreeing over the [/] the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences . 497198_509898
and &-um oh I'm trying to think specifically . 510578_514628
I_mean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because (.) then it's not just &=ges you and the other person . 514703_521823
&-um &=ges
is it just in this situation ? 536753_538643

one day after schoo
and he did an amazing kick that kicked so well that the ball went all the way through (.) the window of his house and right into his dad's lap . 571685_582035
his dad was very surprised and went to the window and looked out to see where the ball had come from . 582526_587856

"+"" goodbye „ Mom . 619836_620656"

and then lo_and_behold it started to rain a few drops . 623681_626491
he put his hands out &=hand
and all_of_a_sudden a_lot came down . 628940_630640
he was covering his (.) head <excuse me> [//] and running back to the house . 630690_633850
he was all wet . 634358_635508
he went into the house and he was soaking wet . 636961_638781
his mother was very displeased (be)cause she [
and this was something they were working on . 641770_643310
his ability to listen to her and accept her direction . 643333_646283
long term goal . 647505_648455
and then he took the umbrella and started walking back to school . 648475_651395
and it was okay because the umbrella kept him from getting rained on . 651496_654586
the end . 655326_656466
okay . [+ exc] 658785_659005
so ‡ &=slaps
and she loved her father very much . 661183_662523
but her mother died . 662665_663525
so ‡ her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl . 663848_667348
her name was Cinderella . 667396_668346
this woman came with two daughters . 670301_671641
but they were unpleasant . 672301_673291
and they were ugly . 673548_674198
we hafta be honest . [+ exc] 674648_675228
they were very ugly . 675280_676560
so ‡ there's a great deal of stress after Cinderella's father
she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters . 682181_684211
and they useta make her clean &=fingers
and they useta make her cook &=fingers
and they were very mean to her
and they made her live in the attic &=fingers
and they made her wear &+ug old ugly clothes &=fingers
but she was very very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative . 692246_696186
and she befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds . 697041_700321
and when she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of Fantasialand . 701163_710943
and &=laughs so she useta dream about going to the castle and going to <a fancy dress> [//] a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown . 711565_720135

seriously . 739725_740335
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men . 740400_744050
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day he's going to be the king . 744095_747605
and he needed to have children . 747621_748541
and he needed to have a wife . 748558_749428
so ‡ they were gonna have a big ball . 749948_751038
so ‡ they were having a ball . 752463_753403

and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes . 759580_763960
and Cinderella really really wanted to go . 764066_765806
she was very sad (be)cause she thought there was no way that she could ever go . 766863_769433
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds . 769835_775545
and they knew how to sew . 776196_777136
and they knew how to accessorize . 777156_779456
and they knew how to design dresses apparently . 779810_782490
so ‡ they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella . 782775_786415

<I wonder what was next> [=! whispering] . [+ exc] 789520_792140
then she

and it was just love at first sight . 799315_800725
the way it should be . 801166_801776
he loved her and she loved him . 802736_803866
and they had a wonderful time dancing . 804203_806503
and (.) then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there . 806563_814393
and they were pulling her dress . 814443_815563
and they were tearing her scarves . 815715_817395
and they chased her away and made her go home . 817811_819971
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry . 821026_826616
and so he sent out a message to &=ges
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry . 836068_841518
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper . 842541_851661
so ‡ the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out . 852443_859183
and then the prince did find her . 859445_860925
and then they got married . 861351_862141
and then the king was happy . 862188_863368
and we don't really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters . 863415_866905
the end . 866951_867341
