there's a little girl and she was playing outside with her bike and her cat . 810_5620
the cat got up in the tree . 5978_7378
and she couldn't get him to come back down . 7428_10428
so ‡ her dad went out to try and help . 10933_12873
got the ladder climbed the tree . 13010_14620
then the ladder fell over . 15063_16143
so ‡ he's now stuck in the tree with the cat . 17236_19366
and the dog is barking . 19498_20928
but he can't really climb the tree to help . 20946_23126
so ‡ the firemen have showed up with a tall ladder to save the man and the cat . 23646_28366
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need &-um some really good high quality sprouted grain bread . 29815_37045
maybe &=ges
so ‡ then you'd take two slices . 40255_42345
and you wanna get &-um a nice high quality peanut butter . 42906_46856
preferably just peanuts . 46905_48205
maybe a little bit of salt . 48670_50120
nice organic . 50730_51860
and then you can spread the peanut butter &=ges
and then for your jelly you could actually use a preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself so it's got really pure high quality ingredients . 56165_65135
and you would just &=ges
and then you would introduce the two slices to each other &=hands
and you have a sandwich . 71473_72793
in elementary school I was rollerblading with my aunt . 75755_79075
and she took off down a hill &=points . 79250_81160
and I went behind her &=points . 81986_83416
and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone &=touches
but I didn't really feel it at all . 87531_89091
I didn't feel any pain or anything . 89143_91003
I was just happy I had &-like avoided &=traces
but when I looked down and saw all the blood &=spreads
"+"" oh . 98435_98525"
and then I kicked into &-like a pain association . 98575_100595
so ‡ I hadta go get stitches . 100718_103558
and a large man carried me into a wheelchair . 103723_105673
and it was awkward . 109153_111043
&-um
and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front . 120220_125720
and <she was> [//] &-um I think she was pretty spun on something else . 126171_130851
and she was just shouting having fights with everybody . 130933_133203
so ‡ she came over and &-um attacked us . 133753_136813
and <my friend was> [//] she was trying to attack one of my friends . 137716_141236
so ‡ we were trying to get in the way and &-um &=ges stop her from doing that . 141485_146915
and during the whole commotion as we were trying to separate this really upset woman &-um a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with &-like just a &=ges
and [/] &-um and then he was actually +//. 159803_162703
(be)cause my friend then got really pissed off (be)cause that was her boyfriend . 162718_165488
and she was just kinda screaming . 165505_166645
and he was about to knock her out . 166663_167803
so ‡ that was a little bit high tension . 168325_170385
hadta break that up and call the cops and all that . 170721_177051
&-um I've had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they can't really have a genuine conversation with you because they can't get around their own +... 177948_189088
just very self oriented kind_of selfish in a way . 190038_192888
can't really have a two person conversation because they don't move past a certain point in their mind . 192906_199396
they just loop the track and go right back to another place . 199506_202216
yeah ‡ I try to just &-um be patient and &-um continually try to open those doors of communication . 207121_214081
so ‡ (.) it's [/] it's my mother . 215206_217066
so ‡ &=laughs it's a lifetime process . 217301_219421
but maybe in the next twenty years or something &=laughs we can talk . 219595_224765
so ‡ there's a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better . 225543_231533
and he still hasn't quite learned . 231585_234265
so ‡ as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house . 234376_238646
and there's a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened . 238845_247415
so ‡ there is a little boy getting ready for school . 250990_253970
"and his mom comes up and says +""/. 254116_255636"
"+"" don't you wanna take your umbrella ? 255993_257442"
"and he says +""/. 258005_258646"
"+"" no . 258988_259298"
he's asserting his independence and making decisions for himself . 259350_262790
so ‡ he doesn't wanna take his mother's good advice . 263478_265968
he goes out for the day and realizes that it's raining [/] raining very very hard . 266624_271544
there are puddles everywhere . 271811_272981
it's really uncomfortable to be that wet . 273003_275013
so ‡ he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels a_lot better (be)cause now he has some weather protection . 275471_284081
so ‡ there is a little girl whose mother has died . 287308_290868
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her . 291716_296796
so ‡ she's introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters . 296968_301898
she's excited . 302023_303033
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean . 303396_308456
and the stepmother is very cruel . 308501_311081
so ‡ all the years as she's raised with them during the beginning few years it's [/] it's okay . 311495_319455
it's not great . 319470_320210
and then her father dies . 320233_321213
and she's left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters . 321263_325093
and they basically make her to be a maid . 325163_327923
they're never very kind to her . 327968_329148
and she hasta do all the work on the farm . 329213_330903
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food . 330923_334373
so ‡ there's also in the same area &-um a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle . 335573_345233
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince . 345823_351093
so ‡ he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region . 351611_356691
so ‡ an invitation for a ball so_that the prince can choose a bride . 357560_362980
and they get this invitation at Cinderella's house . 363973_368743
the stepmother reads it . 369000_370330
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited . 370348_373518
they wanna go meet this handsome prince . 373568_375348
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess . 375725_381405
so ‡ they get ready for the ball . 382478_383908
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball . 384375_388355
she wants to go dance and have fun . 388403_390153
so ‡ she hangs out with all her little animal friends and &+s is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball . 390608_398498
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that she's not allowed to go . 400041_406671
she's not going to go . 406718_408008
they rip off all of her jewelry . 408030_409950
they tear apart her dress . 409970_411520
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as_well . 412215_419105
so ‡ Cinderella's very sad . 420323_422423
she doesn't know what to do . 422438_424278
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny . 424331_432481
"so ‡ she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride, creates a beautiful dress for her, gives her these delightful glass slippers, and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball . 433300_450400"
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was . 450695_454975
so ‡ Cinderella goes and is very excited . 456240_458910
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night . 458965_466905
and the stepsisters are very jealous . 467170_469140
they don't know who this woman even is . 469211_471051
and she's having a great time . 471795_472975
but then she realizes that this [//] the clock is about to strike . 472993_476473
and so she runs in such a hurry . 476535_478725
"and the prince goes after her like +""/. 478743_480633"
"+"" wait &=reaches"
"+"" you can't leave . 481316_481916"
"+"" why are you leaving ? 482028_482618"
"and she just says +""/. 482635_483305"
"+"" I hafta go . 483625_484265"
and she leaves . 485050_486280
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind . 486633_491263
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to (.) the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe . 491626_505546
so ‡ Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe . 506403_515753
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive . 516681_521431
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house . 522015_525126
but it doesn't fit the fat foot of the sister . 525180_527220
it doesn't fit the fat foot of the other sister . 527240_529200
and it sure doesn't fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother . 529215_531905
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella . 532493_534573
so ‡ they know that she's the one that was at the party . 534723_537313
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after . 537851_541141
