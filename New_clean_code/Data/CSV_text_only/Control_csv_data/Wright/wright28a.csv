this is a story about a birthday party gone awry . 240_3920
here was a beautiful birthday cake with candles on it . 3990_7700
and the neighbors were invited over with their children for Tommy's birthday . 8429_13679
apparently he was four years old . 14428_16168
there were four candles on the cake . 16192_18052
but Tommy's dog saw the cake unattended and took a big hunk out_of it . 18701_25691
and then he ran underneath the sofa to hide from the mom who got very angry and had her broom out and was gonna beat the dog with the broom for chewin(g) up the cake . 25768_36778
in the meantime all the guests were arriving . 37217_39497
there was a little boy guest with a (.) present and a little girl guest with the present and their moms . 39580_45070
and they were seeing the whole event unfold as they approached the room for the birthday party . 45460_51190
the end . 52086_52726
the boy was crying . 52832_53752
he wasn't very happy on his birthday . 53798_55388
<in order> [//] you take out your bread . 57722_59802
you lay out your two pieces of bread . 60071_62571
you can put your jelly on one piece and your peanut butter on the other . 62591_66421
flop (th)em together . 67066_68146
slice them . 68193_69133
and voila you have your peanut butter and &+beh jelly sandwich . 69719_73749
&-um I had a gallbladder attack on my &-um twentieth wedding anniversary . 75239_83409
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs . 83567_87897
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown &-uh gallbladder attack which is very very painful . 88003_94713
and so I went to the hospital . 95436_97486
I was beginning to turn green . 97536_99796
and &-um I had the surgery done . 100042_103092
I was in the hospital about three days . 103848_105208
that's before they did it with any kind of scopes . 105232_108202
you_know ‡ they did a regular open laparotomy . 108258_110958
so ‡ &-um +... 111347_112457
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work . 113374_117324
so ‡ &-um I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure . 117529_124509
and then once it's over you feel a_lot better that's for sure . 124740_127800
okay ‡ the problems are word finding and the ability to speak . 133065_137665
&-uh my mother's disability is apraxia aphasia . 138370_142640
and so she sometimes uses different words &-um to try to get her point across . 142853_149423
what I do is I offer her extra time . 150050_152510
sometimes extra processing time helps . 152810_155370
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the “is it this” and touch . 156221_161611
if it's an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever . 161656_165166
&-um sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a_little better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it . 165989_177229
and then because we live with each other and we're together so much I can kind_of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs . 178533_188723
&-like today with [//] &+th I knew she needed some kind of check (be)cause I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring . 188799_195189
and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card . 195238_198658
so ‡ for the most part I can kind_of guess so +//. 198742_202002
&-uh a little bit like Vanna_White . 202504_204094
is it this ? 204307_204897
is it that ? 204946_205626
does it begin with the letter ? 205703_206983
sometimes beginning letters help . 207120_209100
so ‡ that's how we work it out . 209313_211033
&-um my husband and I were in Washington_D_C doing some sightseeing . 214147_218637
and <it turned> [//] when we came off a [/] a boat trip it [/] it got a little darker . 219078_223958
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel . 223980_228440
and so we were walking along . 229183_230763
and it went [//] was pretty isolated street . 230813_233203
there wasn't a_lot_of people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station . 233223_237973
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us you_know maybe twenty yards back . 238705_247055
and it was <three young kids> [//] &+d &-uh three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough . 247106_252646
and so <I was very> [//] I [/] I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing . 252871_258741
and my husband said if they come after us I'm gonna take &=laughs the [/] the movie camera . 258791_263491
and I'll hit em [
and you run like hell . 264028_265078
&=laughs so ‡ we were picking up the pace . 266137_268267
as we picked up the pace they picked up the pace . 268286_270146
and as we turned the corner there was a bus station . 270203_273043
and people were waiting there . 273089_274419
so ‡ we were just so grateful to see other people . 274539_278579
and they backed off . 278626_279456
and they left us alone . 279582_280822
so ‡ I think it <was a> [//] could've been a robbery you_know . 281469_284649
and that's it . 286141_286571
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldn't . 289659_295379
and this lady was driving her s_u_v thinking she could get through the wash . 295783_301553
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along . 301640_305090
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her . 305108_311008
and so it appears as though the [//] <he's strapped> [//] he's got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot . 311159_322749
he's &-uh holding onto a branch that's hanging into the rushing water . 322796_328326
and he is attempting the rescue . 328515_330345
no ‡ I'm not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but I'm assuming that's the belt for helping her . 336036_342696
I don't know . [+ exc] 343086_343586
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer . 345636_352346
so ‡ he's kickin(g) a soccer ball down the neighborhood street and inadvertently kicks the wrong way and hits a bi
and the soccer ball goes through the neighbor's picture window . 361233_364183
goes through the window . 365648_366488
knocks over the lamp . 366541_367641
scares the neighbor . 367718_369028
the neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it . 369139_372179
and he's got the (.) soccer ball in his hand but he can't seem to find who kicked it . 372273_378933
but I'll bet ya [
the end . [+ exc] 383375_384685
well ‡ it's time for Joey to go to school . 387468_389728
"and his mom said +""/. 389777_390517"
"+"" you_know Joey I looked out the window . 390688_392298"
"+"" <it looks like in the> [//] looks like it might rain today . 392373_395143"
"+"" and the weathermen said that rain could be coming today . 395407_398567"
"+"" oh . 399500_399710"
"he said +""/. 399761_400011"
"+"" no Ma"
"+"" I don't wanna take that umbrella . 402256_403926"
"+"" only sissies carry umbrellas . 404388_406258"
"+"" not kids like me . 406435_407245"
"+"" I'm not gonna take that umbrella . 407500_408670"
"+"" and I don't think it's gonna rain anyway . 408765_410415"
well ‡ there he goes out . 410690_411740
and what's happening but his mom was right . 411763_414553
it starts to rain . 414601_415751
first just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder . 416235_420645
and the puddles are deep . 420699_422239
and when he comes home he is soaked to the skin . 422293_425223
his mother is very angry with him (be)cause &+sh he did not listen to her and take the umbrella . 425371_431151
so ‡ the next time that this occurs and there's rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry . 431887_439167
that was a lesson learned . 439560_440840

"Cinderella's mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls, her stepmother and her stepsisters . 446570_456290"
as time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls . 457317_465037
and she is very cruel to Cinderella . 465215_467475
she uses her as a servant . 467529_469049
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning . 469102_471122
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along . 471900_475580
and &-uh the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals &-um were not treated as well . 475627_482757
but Cinderella loved them all . 482843_484433
and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice . 484706_488116
and [/] &-um and they all loved her . 488244_490774
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle . 491417_501507
"&-um in the castle there was a wonderful prince, handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married . 502177_510907"
and the prince's servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife . 511306_516716
and so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball . 517738_524868
and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery . 525046_531316
and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time . 531598_536438
well ‡ the stepmother got the invitation . 537264_539384
she only considered her daughters and she didn't consider &+sa Cinderella at all . 539430_543860
so ‡ she got the [//] her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery . 544309_549789
and they were ugly stepsisters . 549837_551767
and Cinderella made her own dress . 551895_554805
and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress . 554858_559628
"and when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball, that they are gonna go to the ball but she is not . 560228_571458"
so ‡ she was <put into> [//] locked into a &-uh room . 572235_576735
and she was visited by the &-um fairy godmother . 576785_582505
and the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the [/] the ball . 583472_588572
so ‡ the fairy godmother &-um with her magic <bitty> [//] bippety_boppety_boo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown . 589243_598283
and out_of a pumpkin she made a carriage . 598653_600843
and out_of the mice she made horsemen [//] &-um horses to carry &-uh the carriage to the palace . 601151_610521
and she was <dressed in her> [//] the most beautiful woman <in the> [/] in the land . 611127_616437
but she did have a stipulation . 616705_618525
she said that &-uh she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear . 618579_625649
so ‡ she went to the ball . 626354_627934
and she was the bell of the ball . 628028_630198
and she caught the eye of the prince . 630267_632027
and the prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters . 632077_637927
so ‡ she danced the night away . 638256_640076
and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes . 640123_645283
and she knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the [/] the night would disappear at that time . 645328_651988
so ‡ she ran from the prince . 652154_654604
and as she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps . 655320_659550
and she ran and she ran . 659733_661103
and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night . 661153_667973
the pumpkin returned to its former self . 668379_670979
and [/] and the animals were no longer horses . 671099_674559
and everything returned <to theirselves> [//] to what they were . 674637_678857
when she returned home the &-um stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the [/] (.) the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace . 679365_693825
and they would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper . 694508_703648
so ‡ the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it didn't work . 704205_709735
and they [//] a mouse brought <her the key> [//] Cinderella the key . 709810_713600
she got out_of the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on . 713652_721682
she tried it on . 722274_723184
it was a fit . 723450_724280
and the prince then designated her as his princess . 724828_729458
and they got married and lived happily ever after . 729690_732930
we have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard .
but we also have a kitty_cat who loves (.) to go up the tree .
and the kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and couldn't get down .
so ‡ dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all .
it appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree .
he then took a ladder dad did .
put it up against the tree to climb and get the cat .
but the ladder fell down .
so ‡ after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree .
the fire department not police department &=laughs .
and there's also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree .
that's it . [+ exc]
