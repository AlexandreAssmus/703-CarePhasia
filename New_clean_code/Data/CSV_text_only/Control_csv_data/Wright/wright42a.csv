mom had planned a birthday party . 240_1890
it was gonna be the fourth birthday party for her [/] &+s her youngest boy . 3555_8955
she had set out a [//] &+m the most beautiful cake . 11578_14478
well ‡ the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake . 15880_20480
so ‡ he got himself a big mouthful . 20530_23540
and got his paws into it too . 23723_25953
and ran and hid underneath the sofa so_that the mom couldn't get at him with the broom . 26481_33781
the little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined . 33803_38403
and his mom was trying to hit his dog . 38426_40046
&-um in the meantime the guest started showin(g) up at the door (.) &-uh carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on . 40065_52745
you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by takin(g) &-uh two pieces of bread . 55763_61123
you [//] on one side you spread the peanut butter . 61853_64093
and on the other side you spread the jelly . 64114_66165
and then you put the two together . 66181_68321
oh_my &=sighs &-uh in about nineteen <eighty four> [//] eighty five . 68443_78133
it's been a long time . 79008_79858
&-um I had my four &=points
&-um <I had> [//] as a precaution I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so_that I wouldn't get an infection . 85183_92623
&-um (be)cause when I was seven years old I had rheumatic fever . 93135_96415
"you_know ‡ and they always told me +""/. 96470_98290"
"+"" well ‡ your immune system isn't gonna be near as strong so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery (.) including oral surgery . 98456_108516"
so ‡ I did that . 109036_109936
and <&+tha that evening I> [//] early evening my throat swelled up . 110935_119355
&-uh don't know if it was from the penicillin or what but &-um I ended up back at the dentist's office . 120608_127508
and they ended up having to take &-uh some epinephrine . 127561_133971
they gave me shots of epinephrine . 134025_135955
I think two of (th)em . 136008_137178
and they also took &+s a syringe &=points
&-uh shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called &+ang &-uh +... 145133_150713
they called it then angioneurotic edema &-uh but it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called &-uh hereditary angioedema . 150860_161820
&-um the difference between &=ges
hereditary angioedema cannot . 174245_176415
<it hasta be> [//] <the only thing that> [//] &+i until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that &-uh during an episode was the epinephrine . 177261_188701
&-uh during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up . 188746_196376
just out_of the clear blue . 196650_197740
&-uh I went to urgent care . 198616_200166
&-um in urgent care they started an i_v on me . 200976_206326
and the doctor +... 206716_208846
I don't know if she was a doctor or a p_a . 209090_210940
&-um anyway she ended up givin(g) me a shot of adrenaline &=ges
&+an and anybody that's &=head
it goes intermuscular [
&-um because <it takes> [//] within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred an(d) fifty or a hundred an(d) eighty beats a minute . 227048_237788
&-uh in my case I think I went over two hundred . 238533_240913
&-um and I remember my [//] &+th it felt like &=points
you_know ‡ at the base of my skull . 254160_256050
&-um &+j just from so much pressure . 256870_259390
and I'd &=head
I've been knocked out once you_know playing football but I never passed out . 262854_267074
&-um and I knew I was gonna pass out . 267128_271088
and I told the doctor that . 271110_272880
"and she said +""/. 272896_273336"
"+"" okay, lay back . 273525_274275"

"+"" I can't, I can't ! 276903_277953"
"+"" I don't dare ! 278325_279005"
so ‡ she put her hands behind me &=ges
and at that point I don't know what was goin(g) on externally but internally I was (.) fishing with my grandfather . 283063_292793
and <he was> [//] it was at a favorite fishing place <that I> [/] that I had &-uh when I was growing up . 292840_303010
and he was walking up the [/] &+r the stream bank wantin(g) ta [

so ‡ I woke up and later was told that &-um +... 318113_327843
<I [/] I can recall actually> [//] I don't [/] I don't know if this is something you want on tape or not but +... 327903_335793
I [/] I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was &-like looking at myself and looking at the doctor and you_know watching what they were doin(g) . 336811_345251
"and it was like +""/. 345266_345766"

"+"" oh ‡ yeah ‡ they're doing it to me &=laughs . 349268_350858"
&-uh (.) my wife hasta fill in the details you_know of other stuff that happened . 351068_361078
but apparently they brought in the crash cart . 361096_362916
and I guess you_know zapped me at_least once . 362936_366546
&-uh I did come back . 367386_368876
&-uh overall I was out for seven minutes . 370243_373253
&-uh not breathing for seven minutes . 373308_377898
and to this day have had little if any &-uh <effects you_know> [//] aftereffects from that . 377943_387043
you_know ‡ they [/] they say seven minutes your brain is dead . 387065_389975
well ‡ I have no idea why but it didn't affect me . 390020_394160
not [//] I'm sure sometimes it effects me you_know in some of my memory but that could be aging too &=laughs so +... 395115_404875
that is very vivid to me . 405960_408360
the [//] &=sighs probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee &-uh who was actually hired for me . 408431_424801
<he came in as> [//] &-uh I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe &-uh and needed an assistant . 424820_435990
the assistant was brought in . 436656_438496
"and (.) when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kind_of looked at each other and said +""/. 438601_447161"

&-uh he's Filipino . 450028_453088
&-uh he's [//] he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog [
&-um I don't know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently . 467440_480300
&-uh there's a_lot_of people that wouldn't give him the chance . 481048_484518
and you_know I actually was doin(g) some interpreting for him &+beca you_know at one time or another because I understood what he was saying . 484700_492670
&-uh and (.) <that was> [//] to me it was probably the most difficult &-uh one that I hadta deal with . 493668_505888
&-uh not because I didn't understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him . 506165_513895
&-um but I also spent some time in Mexico . 513985_517885
and there's people down there that speak no English . 517905_520376
so ‡ I've you_know hadta adapt . 521004_524394

and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico . 562235_567955
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see . 568080_574280
you_know ‡ to go to the [/] the island of Cozumel an(d) you_know travel around there a little bit . 574721_578881
(be)cause there's some ruins there and it's a really nice place . 578900_581960
well ‡ the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there &-uh apparently was an ex marine or somethin(g) . 582030_594080
he was just perfectly built . 594100_596710
&-um and <he had> [//] they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab they'd gotten near the port . 597445_609805
I think they were doing &-uh one of the Princess_Cruises or something . 610048_613568
