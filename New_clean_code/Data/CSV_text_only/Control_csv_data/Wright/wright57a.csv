an(d) (h)e sees that it starts to rain . 346940_348930

okay ‡ &-um (.) Cinderella's father married (.) a woman which was [//] became her stepmother . 380166_391306
and the stepmother had &-um two daughters . 392608_396198
and &-um so they all moved in together . 397780_400580
(.) an(d) then the father died . 400846_405456
(.) an(d) so Cinderella was &+l left in the care of the wicked stepmother . 407276_411436
an(d) she was very mean to her . 412381_414351
and &-um made her work very hard an(d) do all the chores . 414405_418845
and &=sighs they [//] the stepsisters were very mean also . 420434_424404
an(d) I think called her names an(d) made her do all their chores as_well . 424514_429664
an(d) so she [/] she made friends with all the animals . 430528_434068
an(d) [//] because she was lonely . 435740_438730
and [/] (.) <an(d) then> [/] &-um (.) an(d) then an announcement came . 438810_446010
someone came to the door and announced that there was gonna be a ball . 447600_452100
an(d) so they all got excited an(d) wanted to go to the ball . 453622_457202
an(d) since Cinderella was prettier than the other two &-uh stepsisters the mother (.) didn't want her to go . 459071_468571
because she wanted (.) one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince . 468683_474853
so ‡ she locked &-uh Cinderella in the tower . 476319_481579
&-uh and (.) they (.) went to the ball . 483392_488682
and (.) so
oh [//] oh_well ‡ this was before the animals made Cinderella a dress . 504676_508146
and it was real pretty . 508200_510260
an(d) that's what infuriated the stepmother . 510928_513018
an(d) she tore up the dress . 513038_514258
an(d) then locked her in the room . 514318_516707
an(d) then Cinderella was crying . 516727_518227
an(d) <then she> [//] then the fairy godmother came . 518241_521121
and &-uh let her out_o(f) the room . 521168_525008
and &-uh with the magical wave of her wan(d) made &-um her a beautiful gown an(d) glass slippers . 525025_533405
and fixed her hair all up nice . 534584_536604
an(d) turned a pumpkin into a coach . 536663_538943
turne(d) mice into white horses . 539670_542540
and &-uh the dog into a coachman . 543762_546452
and [/] an(d) so she was able to go to the ball . 546472_550722
an(d) she met the prince dance(d) with him . 550745_552345
an(d) the &-um fairy godmother told her that she hadta leave by midnight or she [//] everything would return as it was . 553650_562430
an(d) so (.) &=tongue
an(d) the clock started to strike midnight . 568282_569892
"an(d) she said +""/. 569911_570421"
"+"" I hafta go . 570623_571363"
an(d) he didn't wan(t) her to leave . 571384_572764
but she started to run away . 572787_574397
an(d) she lost one of the glass slippers . 574417_576427
&=tongue_clicks an(d) she ran an(d) ran an(d) got back in the coach . 577551_581141
an(d) they started goin(g) down the road . 581160_582500
an(d) then every ding when the clock struck twelve turne(d) back to the way it was . 582520_586620
an(d) she was very sad but she had a good time . 587687_590017
and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers . 590035_595135
an(d) so &=tongue_clicks she went home . 595183_597843
an(d) then the next day +... 597893_599883
an(d) the prince really liked her so +... 601078_603558
an(d) he had this glass slipper so (.) &-um +... 603579_607499
so ‡ he sent out a decree to find this woman with the &=laughs glass slipper . 608753_613983
an(d) so they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyone's foot . 615185_622025
an(d) it wouldn'(t) fit anybody . 622047_623507

an(d) they tried (.) the &-um slippers on the stepsisters an(d) [/] an(d) it wouldn't fit . 625710_632020
