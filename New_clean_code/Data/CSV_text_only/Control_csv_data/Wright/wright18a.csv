Dixie_Cup (.) Lisa's kitty (.) had gotten up into the tree . 1430_9330
and was caught up on one of the upper branches . 10869_14379
Lisa was calling for the little kitty to come down . 14433_18503
but the kitty was afraid so the kitty stayed up in the tree . 18550_22700
so ‡ her father got the ladder . 23087_24187
and decided to climb up the tree to see if he could get the cat down . 25483_30603
well ‡ while he was climbing up and the dog was barking (.) the ladder fell down . 30789_37239
and so he was stuck up in the tree . 37291_40231
so ‡ the mother hadta call the fire department . 41693_45203
and the fire department brought their ladder &+a on their fire truck . 45250_49570
and they came to rescue father and kitty out_of the tree . 51808_54958
and here's the bird up here watching all the goings on . 55011_58861
okay . [+ exc] 66966_68876
(..) remove two slices of whole wheat bread from the
put them on a plate (.) side by side . 82892_87592
go to the refrigerator . 87729_89219
and get a jar of peanut butter and a jar of strawberry preserves . 90050_95850
get a knife out_of the drawer . 95900_97940
<take &-um one> [//] take a knife . 98770_103760
and put it in the peanut butter . 103782_105482
and spread the peanut butter on the one slice of bread . 105620_108450
take a clean knife . 108622_110232
put the knife in the jelly . 110301_111851
and spread it on top of the peanut butter . 112114_114054
put the second slice of bread on top of the first slice of bread . 114108_120198
use one of the knives to cut the peanut butter sandwich in half . 120244_125344
and proceed to eat . 125364_126804
&+n i_c_us were not &-um known then . 130019_136289
and so I was put in a semi private room which was &-um what they used during those days . 137121_145731
and my &-um classmates specialed [
what do I remember about it ? 151943_153933
I remember being so ill (.) before I had the surgery that &-um I refused the baby because actually <we thought> [//] I thought that I had the flu . 153982_168232
and I was just feeling so badly . 169013_172183
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didn't know really what was wrong . 172621_179521
but they really didn't think anything was wrong . 179706_181586
they just thought that I didn't wanna take care of my little girl . 182000_186060
&-um finally after three days I had that +//. 186458_190988
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three a_m . 191010_195690
and finally I had surgery at &-um Monday evening . 195857_202947
so ‡ I was really very very ill . 204270_206400
in_fact ‡ I had &-um peritonitis . 206653_209573
and they really did not think that I would live . 209590_212770
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they [//] &-um that's just the way they did things . 212817_223537
<and I actually chose> [//] you could choose if you wanted to have the baby &-um to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby +... 223754_233384
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are (.) &-um healthy and not ill . 233720_242970
and I chose <the baby> [//] to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby . 243069_251799
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kind_of thought of her as their own . 251876_257576
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses . 257839_263769
and consequently from that &-uh I had ototoxic drugs . 266347_271217
so ‡ I lost my hearing that way . 271269_272519
(o)kay since I am hearing impaired &-um I understand that situation really well . 281431_288141
so ‡ I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing (.) and not admitting it or not having hearing aids . 289072_299402
because <you can> [//] you just notice &-um that they're not understanding or they're not interested in what is being said or they're just on a different page . 299417_311747
and what have I done about it ? 311902_313292
actually ‡ what you do is you just talk to them . 313514_316624
and you just go right in front of them so_that they can see your face and your lips . 316846_322576
and also if you're in a really noisy environment go outside and [//] &-uh where it's quiet . 322591_331531
okay . 338968_339058
oh don't put that on yet I hafta think .
+< &=laughs .
&=sighs (...) well the only time that I can really remember +//.
is it on ?
okay ‡ the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon .
and we were driving in Florida .
and seatbelts were new .
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car .
and we were just driving down a country road .
and all_of_a_sudden this truck just came right out barreling down the side road .
and came right out in front of us .
and we actually drove into the ditch .
and if we wouldn't have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured .
but since we had our seatbelts on <we just took> [//] &+th my husband just turned the car .
and we continued on .
and <that guy just never> [//] that truck just never stopped and just kept going .
I_mean he was oblivious .
okay . [+ exc]
well ‡ you sure like beginning middles and &=laughs ends don't you [>] ? [+ exc]
okay . [+ exc]
well ‡ it looks to me that it had been <raining for many days or> [//] raining very hard .
and (.) this [//] (.) hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream .
and managed to grab a hold of a branch .
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in .
and &-uh the man is there rescuing her .
and pulled her to safety .
well ‡ looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking .
well ‡ Johnny was kicking really too hard .
and kicked the ball right through the neighbor's window .
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair .
and the ball came through the window .
knocked over the lamp .
"and the neighbor went +""/."
"+"" oh !"
and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball .
(..) well ‡ it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school .
"and mother said +""/."
"+"" well ‡ you_know ‡ it's sposta rain today ."
"+"" you should take your umbrella ."
"and Johnny says +""/."
"+"" no ‡ I'm not going to carry that umbrella ."
"+"" I don't like to carry umbrellas ."
"+"" I'm going to go to school ."
and you can &+ha &+ke keep the umbrella at home .
so ‡ he started walking to school .
and sure enough it started raining .
in_fact ‡ it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands .
and run through the puddles .
and run home .
and by the time he got home he was really really wet .
"and mother said +""/."
"+"" see ‡ I told you it was going to rain ."
"+"" why didn't you take your umbrella ?"
so ‡ Johnny started off to school again in dry clothes with his umbrella .
okay .
oh &=sighs &+c +...
(..) when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters .
and so Cinderella &-uh grew up with two stepsisters .
but then the father must have died because all_of_a_sudden it's the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella .
and Cinderella became the &-um cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day .
&-um <it was> [//] (.) the [//] everyone had grown up and gotten older .
and they received an invitation <from the prince> [//] from the castle because the prince was &-um old enough to get married now .
and he was looking for a bride .
so ‡ they were having a big party at the castle .
so ‡ the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters .
and Cinderella overheard it .
so ‡ she ran to her room .
opened up her trunk .
and got out her special gown that she'd been saving for a long time .
she tried it on .
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was .
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart .
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball .
so ‡ the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball .
and Cinderella was left home all by herself .
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and (e)specially the mice were [//] felt very sorry for her (.) and were very upset .
and then all_of_a_sudden a [//] &+f Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared .
"and said +""/."
"+"" Cinderella we [//] you are going to go to the ball ."
and so she fricked [
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown .
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach .
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach .
and I think the dog became the footman .
and everybody went off to the ball .
an(d) she had a wonderful time .
oh and she had glass slippers .
that was the special thing .
the &+g fairy godmother had given her glass slippers .
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything [//] the coach would turn back into a pumpkin .
and she would not have her dress anymore .
so ‡ she had a wonderful time at the (.) &-uh party and &+s danced with the prince all night .
and then all_of_a_sudden the clock started striking midnight .
so ‡ she ran down the steps .
and ran into the coach .
and ran all the way home .
but [!!] she had lost her one shoe .
so ‡ the prince had found the shoe .
"and said +""/."
"+"" I will only marry (.) the (.) girl that fits into their shoe ."
so ‡ there was a proclamation sent around that the (.) &-uh prince's (.) &-uh footman would be going around with the shoe .
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe .
so ‡ &+s the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball .
so ‡ she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket .
and the mice connived and got the key out_of the pocket .
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe .
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe .
but they didn't make it as [//] &-um because their &+f feet were much larger than Cinderella's .
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave .
and &+th the mice had just gotten the (.) door open to Cinderella's room .
and she came running down the stairs .
"and said +""/."
"+"" may I try on the shoe ?"
"and the footman said +""/."
"+"" yes of_course ."
and he went over to (.) <try the> [//] put the shoe on her .
and the stepmother used her cane to trip (h)im .
so ‡ the shoe fell to the ground and broke .
"and so the stepmother said +""/."
"+"" well ‡ that's that ."
"and Cinderella said +""/."
"+"" no ."
and she pulled the shoe out_of her apron pocket .
"and said +""/."
"+"" here it is ."
and so the footman put it on her foot .
"and the prince said +""/."
"+"" oh ‡ Cinderella !"
and everybody was happy .
the mice were dancing .
and everybody was happy except the stepsisters and (.) the stepmother .
the end . [+ exc]
