&=lip_smack I'll get two slices of bread . 0_4020
preferably whole wheat . 4020_5500
because that's the most healthy &=smile . [+ exc] 5500_7292
and a jar of peanut butter . 7292_9141
I will (.) get a knife to spread the peanut butter . 9141_12725
and I will also get a &-uh knife to spread the jelly along with the jar of jelly . 12725_19006
I will first put the peanut butter on one slic
I will either put &=ges
well ‡ it looks like the little girl's kitten got stuck up in a tree . 34211_38833
and dad went up to help her out and get it down . 38833_41113
and then he got stuck in the tree . 41113_43625
so ‡ they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down out_of the tree . 43625_50000
okay ‡ &-um I'm going to tell you about the time that I had cancer (a)n(d) began my treatment . 50000_58957
&-um I was thirty seven years old . 58957_61449
an
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my &=shows
&-uh I had a modified radical mas(t)ectomy . 69684_72828
a
so ‡ within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo [
&=lips_smack they worry a_lot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects of_course . 80878_88659
so ‡ I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two . 88659_92040
I did not &=head
and &-um so after that first initial treatment &-um (.) &=head
&-um &=head
they told me not [//] to eat lightly on the days of my treatment . 109952_114296
&=clears_throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat &=laughs &=shrugs normally . 114296_119091
and [//] &=head
so ‡ evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses . 125529_130842
&=lips_smack &-um (.) the person <that I> [/] that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the condition's getting worse is my husband's mother . 135835_146300
&=lips_smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have &=ges
so ‡ it did affect her ability to communicate because she can't (.) hear what you're saying to her most of the time . 153400_159245
&=lips_smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her . 159245_164445
speak directly to her . 164445_165790
I think she's become very adept at reading lips and &=ges figuring out what you're saying without hearing it . 165790_171982
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation . 171982_176791
&=head
so ‡ that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad . 178086_182327
&-um she now has the beginnings of &-uh &=shrugs basically &-uh Alzheimer's of the dementia type . 182327_191336
&=lips_smack so
an(d) you can see her now and see her again in (.) thirty minutes and she won't remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually (.) as a normal rule . 196829_204778
she does recognize us you_know and is able to communicate &=hand
but basically
otherwise you're [/] you're having to repeat everything so many times . 216721_220880
you don't know if she's heard you or not . 220880_222601
so ‡ that's about all you can do with that . 222601_225145
is just (.) make sure you have &=ges
(.) (w)ell ‡ let me think &=laughs . 234283_238362
lots of (th)em &*INV
but how frightened or how scared ? 241242_243030
that's the trick . 243030_243994
&=laughs okay ‡ &-um I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young (.) girl . 248255_256954
and &=clears_throat <my parents &-um had a> [//] &+liv we lived on a farm . 256954_262832
and my sister and I slep(t) in the (.) bedroom that was farthest &=ges
and between the &=ges main part of the house &=ges and our bedroom was a long &=ges
so ‡ at night when we would go to bed we had &=ges
and I would &+la lay there and try to go to sleep . 294285_296749
&=ges
but then I would go to sleep . 302901_304266
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the &=points stairs . 304266_308650
and since the &=ges
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was &=ges next to the main part of the house . 318883_324110
and there was &=ges no way to get there except going by &=ges
&=lips_smack so ‡ I [/] I lived several years in fear . 327854_332271
I &=head
and eventually the [//] we &=ges
and &=ges
and &=points
so ‡ I hadta (.) &=points sleep next to the door . 344699_347556
and I hadta protect my &=laughs little sister . 347556_349604
so ‡ that was probably the most frightened that I ever (.) was that I can remember . 350519_355369
(...) okay . [+ exc] 364736_374974
this &-um girl (.) has fallen into the river from somewhere . 374974_384847
I'm not sure if she's had a car accident and got out_of the car or if she just fell into the river or the [//] was walking [//] swimming in the river and it swep(t) her away . 384847_393616
it looks like there's &-uh &-um a rescue person . 393616_397928
I don't know if it's a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the (.) limb to try to get her out_of the water . 397928_405609
at this point I think he's talking to her trying to get her out_of the water . 405609_411576
and she has her head out_of the water . 411576_414897
so ‡ I'm assuming she's (.) not in the process of being sucked down . 414897_418977
I think they're trying to figure out a way to &+saf safely get both of them back to shore . 418977_423721
(..) okay . [+ exc] 423721_429235
&=lips_smack son is out playing (.) soccer in the yard practicing kicking his ball . 429235_436006
it accidentally goes astray and breaks
"his father surprised gets up picks up the ball , looks out and sees the son . 446508_453565"
father's standing there remembering his days of youth when he accidentally hit a baseball into his parents' window . 453565_461777
(..) okay . [+ exc] 464574_472263
&=clears_throat mom's trying to get her son to take an umbrella to school because as &+sh you can see <it's raining outside or> [//] it's dark outside . 472263_482160
"son says +""/. 482160_482736"
"+"" no ‡ Mom ‡ don't need it . 482736_484272"
"+"" don't need it . 484272_484864"
"+"" I'll be fine . 484864_485576"
"+"" don't worry . 485576_486200"
son starts walking to school . 486200_488241
the rain starts coming . 488241_489361
he's getting soaking wet . 489361_490905
"he runs back home , stands by mom looking forlorn and says +""/. 490905_498678"
"+"" okay ‡ I'll take the umbrella . 498678_500246"
she gives him [/] him the umbrella . 500246_502324
he gets some dry clothes on and starts back off to school in a much happier mood . 502324_507617
okay . [+ exc] 513158_514757
a father &=clears_throat &=lips_smack met a woman that he liked . 514757_519054
they got married . 519054_520014
and he had a daughter by previous wife . 520014_523006
and she had two daughters by previous &+d husband . 523006_525678
&=inhales the stepmother to his daughter (.) didn't want her in the sa
so ‡ basically turned her into a scullery maid to do housework &=head
the father along the way had [//] (.) after a few years had died in the meantime . 543737_551198
so ‡ mom really took that to extremes and basically turned her into a servant to wait on her and the two sisters . 551198_558247
&=lips_smack &-um &=lips_smack it came about that the king and queen had a son . 558247_565618
a prince if you will who was celebrating his twenty first birthday . 565618_569738
and they decided to have a huge ball and invite all of the eligible (.) girls in the country to come to the ball . 569738_578362
so ‡ naturally the stepmother of Cinderella who was by then given this name by her mother and sisters since [/] since she tended all the cinders from the fireplace &-um &=lips_smack to come to this ball . 578362_594582
mom decided that her daughters were going and wearing the finest clothes possible . 594582_599150
so ‡ she got them their gowns and got them all set up to go . 599150_602766
Cinderella was very sad because she couldn't go . 602766_605629
and she really wanted to go . 605629_606893
she never got to do anything . 606893_608485
she happened to &-um stumble upon some clothes in an old chest and &-uh found that she actually had some friends <in the> [/] in the animal kingdom that came to her rescue and helped her make a beautiful ball gown . 608485_625063
&=lips_smack she also had a fairy godmother that she never knew about who suddenly appeared and (.) helped make everything right so_that Cinderella could go to the ball . 625063_635699
she had a beautiful gown . 635699_636995
she had a coach to ride in (.) with footmen and everything that she needed . 636995_642996
the only stipulation was she hadta be home by midnight because everything would go back to what it had been before . 642996_650133
"(.) &=lips_smack so ‡ Cinderella went to the ball , was having a wonderful time an(d) forgot about the time until she heard the clock striking midnight . 650133_658869"
she ran down the &+s stairs to try to get away and in the process lost one of her slippers which was a beautiful glass slipper . 658869_667338
&=lips_smack she did make it home on her own . 667338_670398
and noone ever found out . 670398_672510
but in the meantime the prince had become so smitten with this beautiful girl at the ball that he was determined to find out who lost their glass slipper on his staircase . 672510_682504
so ‡ he went door to door in the country with his (.) helpers trying to find who
noone's had so far . 692001_693892
but when he came to the home of Cinderella her two sisters of_course hadta try it on . 693892_698674
&=head
and Cinderella happened to overhear (.) &=lips_smack a
and the prince had found his princess . 708356_710468
and they got married and lived happily ever after &=laughs . 710468_715620
