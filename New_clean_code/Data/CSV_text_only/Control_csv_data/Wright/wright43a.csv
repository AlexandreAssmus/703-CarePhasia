you wanna hear it ? 292918_293628
well ‡ there's &+t &+t &+t &=ges
but the one I'll tell you <is the> [/] &-uh is &-uh +... 307586_311086
I was at church . 311413_312293
&-uh I help at [/] at church givin(g) out daily mass of Catholic . 312343_318763
and <I am> [//] I'm a minister plus &-uh I [/] I set up the altar and everything for the priest . 318963_326853
and on Ash_Wednesday about three years ago I set up and I was giving communion . 327676_333186
and &-uh I held a pat &=palm
and my arm just dropped &=drops
and somebody was there to &+c fortunately catch it . 340376_343496
and &-uh it turns out that I found out I had AL [/] ALS . 344666_347976
I have ALS here to here &=points
and I'm not able to hold anything in my arm like this &=holds
I have a very difficult time &=ges
so ‡ that's [/] that's what happened . 361076_363876
okay . 373766_374216
&+situ what the situation was hadta do with <my wife> [//] my second wife . 375483_379253
she's lovely [//] &+lo absolutely lovely woman . 379268_381388
and <we got> [//] we ended up gettin(g) a divorce . 381438_386808
however ‡ after my divorce I went to a [/] <a thing at> [//] &+w a seminar at a place called Landmark_Education . 389968_397888
an(d) I learned about &-uh +... 397980_400280
it was a weekend seminar started on Friday [/] &+m Friday morning and went through Sunday night . 401520_407050
there was about a hundred and twenty five of us there . 407320_409920
there was about fifteen men and a hundred some odd women . 410408_414348
mostly [//] maybe not exactly that but it was that kind of proportion . 414570_418070
and <I was> [/] <I was> [//] &-uh I'd felt very [/] &-uh very &+k &-uh kind_of down after my divorce . 418661_427301
and I had prayed and this was kind_of a [//] the Lord leading me to this session . 427390_432410
so ‡ I listened . 432896_434056
and I listened a_lot . 434126_436106
and the conversation dealt with abandonment . 436155_438165
and it turns out that in summary <I think most women> [//] I think it's fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do . 439105_449745
and [/] and I learned very significant things about the abandonment and how people feel and learned that you hafta forgive an abandonment . 449793_460843
&-uh but I also learned that what you +//. 460946_463446
this was reinforced . 463543_464383
<I'd been> [//] I was told by a priest back in the seventies &-uh that &-uh when your wife speaks to you just listen . 464551_471581
and <when you> [//] what you remember (i)s one or two things is what's important . 471840_476550
don't solve every problem . 476573_478333
well ‡ this reinforced that . 478355_480015
and &-uh it's very &+imp +//. 480220_483030
women have a +//. 483241_484281
that's why if you go back to that story I might've said this . 484486_487056
women have a [/] a need more +//. 487158_490628
men do too but <they don't> [/] they don't verbalize it . 491168_493078
but women verbalize it a_lot more &+than +//. 493100_494990
when things build up after a day they have a needta come home and dump . 495413_499003
they do . 499565_501245
and they need somebody to listen . 501491_502991
they don't need any o(f) the dialogue on it or not but they need somebody to listen . 503073_506683
so ‡ I learned to [/] to just sit and listen . 506900_509380
and what I remembered from it is to [//] &+m then afterwards after partner's finished what you remember one or two things you [/] you talk about that . 509573_519523
and then your partner is [/] is pleased because <then you> [//] that shows that you've listened to (th)em . 519546_525086
and that's makes more effective communication . 525133_528333
hope you listened . 531353_532363
okay ‡ when I was I believe around seven years old maybe it was five or six I &+mem this [/] this +//. 537465_544435
what happened in this occurrence has affected my life because I ended up being claustrophobic . 544545_548975
and <when I was> [/] when I was six or seven <I had> [//] the doctor said I hadta have my tonsils out . 548998_556468
so ‡ I went to this place . 556603_557743

he's probably two blocks away from home . 691363_694193
