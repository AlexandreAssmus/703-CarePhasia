&=lips_smack unfortunately he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom . 534593_539113

and then unfortunately he also passed away . 542586_545676
so ‡ the [/] the mom and the stepsisters made little Cinderella do all the work . 546533_551443
all the cleaning . 551560_552170
all the cooking . 552223_552783
all the sewing . 553091_553771
and she didn't have anyone to talk to . 554555_556905
so ‡ she made friends with the animals . 558736_560826
she'd go out and feed them . 562178_563378
and they'd talk together

"and they &-uh said +""/. 593313_594873"
"+"" you_know okay sure Cinderella you can go . 595498_597458"
"+"" but you don't have anything to wear . 597531_598791"

they made it look beautiful . 602900_604080
they sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball . 604261_612821
&=lips_smack &=sighs so &-uh when it was time to leave she came down . 614540_617940
