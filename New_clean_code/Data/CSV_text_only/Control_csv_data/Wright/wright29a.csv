one afternoon the little girl's cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch . 350_8990
and she was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down . 9199_14629
and her father (.) being the silly man that he is (.) decided to go up and take care of the cat . 14652_23552
try to &+ca get the cat . 24477_26077
so ‡ as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch . 27114_31264
and the ladder falls off of the tree . 31310_33880
at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and [//] which scares the cat all the more . 33939_41479
and the cat is not gonna come to the father . 41500_44150
but the father can't get out_of the tree anyway . 44169_46679
so ‡ they hafta call the fire department . 47286_50556
who comes and rescues the man out_of the tree . 50974_54304
and rescues the cat . 54327_55907

there are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . [+ exc] 59946_64486
&-uh one of (th)em is to get out the bread that's already cut . 65636_71156
and [/] &-uh and put peanut butter on it . 71703_76323
&-uh actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store . 77644_82314
and so all you hafta do is just use one . 82381_85701
and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed <into this> [//] into the jar . 85723_89773
and you can put it right on the bread . 89820_91930
and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 91949_94349
very lazy . [+ exc] 94769_95519
very easy . [+ exc] 96181_96801
the good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread . 97839_101579
cut it in six inch long pieces . 103091_104731
slice it longways so_that it's open . 105694_108324
it's nice and crunchy on top . 109417_110947
it's very soft on the interior . 110967_112797
you take your peanut butter . 112846_115076
crunchy and [!!] [/] &+so and regular . 115784_118894
you mix those together . 119728_120868
<you put it on the peanut> [//] (.) you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich . 121462_127452
you take the jelly . 127611_129441
&-uh I wouldn't use grape jelly . 130544_133295
but &-uh you can use other kinds of jelly . 134137_136147
and I [/] I like strawberry . 136197_138567
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together . 139243_141583
I put it on there . 141700_143160
and then I take that &+a sandwich . 143208_145558
and I put it in the microwave . 145688_147088
and I heat it so_that the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together . 147788_154538
I still have crunchy on the top . 154586_156836
but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm . 157410_160300
and then I eat that . 160584_161924
&-uh four years ago I &-uh &-uh had my knees replaced . 163020_172580
&-uh I had (th)em both done at the same time . 172627_176347
it was &-uh scheduled for July the fifth . 177338_180148
&-uh however they &-uh fouled up on the scheduling so it wasn't done until the next week which is <I think> [//] July the eleventh or twelfth . 180257_189937
&-uh we [//] I went into the hospital &-uh at &-uh <seven in the morning> [//] six thirty or seven in the morning . 190796_200346
&-uh they prepped me . 201133_203593
and I went into the operating room about eight . 203763_207833
and &-uh woke up about eleven eleven fifteen &-uh with two new knees . 207985_215495
&-uh they told me to go ahead and use the [/] &-uh the &-uh morphine drip for pain . 216212_228352
and so that's what I did . 228458_230638
I used the morphine drip for pain . 230660_232930
and &-uh &-uh unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them I have a sensitivity to morphine . 233004_242544
and I [//] &-uh as I'm using this little button that you push every ten minutes . 242596_250146
I [/] &-uh I begin to see rats coming out_o(f) of the wall . 250244_256524
&-uh I got real oozy . 256577_260257
&-uh and I passed out . 261116_264426
"and &-uh the next thing I remember was the doctor standing over me sayin(g) +""/. 264474_269554"
"+"" Bill Bill Bill . 270150_271690"
"+"" wake up wake up wake up . 271955_273465"
and I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again . 273484_279084
and &-uh they took me to the emergency room . 279305_281865
and I (.) hadta stay in the emergency room for a little while or wherever they take you . 281887_289317
&-uh &=laughs you_know it was not in the recovery . 289592_292232
they run me down the hallway . 292250_293700
&-uh &-uh they &-uh were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that &=laughs &=sighs . 294659_303849
so ‡ &-uh &-uh the next day I woke up . 305479_308099
and I was fine . 308120_308930
and &-uh they got me walkin(g) around . 308950_311180
and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees . 311227_314417
I did have some pain pills but it wasn't morphine . 315052_317882
and &-uh &-uh <my knees> [//] &-uh oh
ten days after I [/] I had my knees replaced I could walk . 335245_338565
do whatever I wanted to do . 338614_340174
&-uh I drove two weeks afterwards . 340329_343699
and &-uh I've had very very little problem with my knees since then . 343838_349638
except they don't have a_lot_of strength . 350420_352350
&-uh in getting up out_of this low chair that I'm sitting in right now I'm gonna have a hassle . 352744_358274
but &-uh &-uh it's [//] &-uh &-uh my knee replacement &+wa was very successful . 359000_365930
I would suggest ta [
that's it . 369795_370025
in October of nineteen ninety four my wife had a stroke . 371900_377230
and &-uh &-uh she was &-uh rushed to the hospital . 377329_382679
&-uh and &-uh then oh ambulanced [
&-uh <I went> [//] I followed her down and [//] &+s (be)cause I needed my car down there to go home . 393521_401511
and &-uh when we got there she was unable to move her right side and unable ta [
"&-uh all she could say was +""/. 408101_411261"

"+"" Bill Bill Bill . 412418_413448"
"+"" Bill Bill . 413969_414719"
&-uh I found out later that she thought she was carrying on a regular conversation with me . 415326_421966
and &-uh she thought she was sayin(g) all the words that she should have said . 422159_426089
"but all [/] &+cu all she could say was +""/. 426920_428250"
"+"" Bill . 428711_428971"
&-uh after about a week of that I told her that we were gonna hafta change the word that she knew . 429210_436170
so ‡ &-uh we sit down . 438279_438929
"and I says +""/. 438946_439436"
"+"" okay ‡ don't say Bill anymore . 439685_440835"

"+"" <bye bye> [/] <bye bye> [/] <bye bye> [/] bye bye . 445320_448040"
and &-uh that's what she still kind_of says sometimes when she gets &-uh flustrated [
but normally that's gone now . 455295_456785
she doesn't use that anymore . 456800_458480
she still has aphasia . 458498_459728
she still goes to the speech therapy . 459748_461708
she still cannot speak . 462264_463454
&-uh this is in two thousand and nine . 463580_465880
so ‡ we've lived with this for &-uh fifteen years now . 466330_470420
and &-uh &-uh we get along . 470501_474201
&-uh I kind_of know what she's gonna say . 474224_477334
you_know ‡ after you've been together long enough well [//] you kind_of figure out what the other one's wantin(g) to talk about . 477350_483130
and she's very good at using alternate communication skills . 483152_488892
&-uh spelling words . 489058_491268
&-uh &-uh inflections on the few words that she can say . 491530_496810
and &-uh doing things that &-uh allow you to figure out what she's tryin(g) to say . 496859_502299
&-uh she still has trouble (.) just saying the most simple words . 502353_507093
this morning when we got up why &-uh we were in the bathroom . 507140_512480
and she was trying to tell me I always put a rubberband around the bottom of the toothpaste . 512500_519400
and we had a new &+coo toothpaste (.) thing . 519447_522687
and it needed a rubberband at the bottom of it . 522706_525616
(be)cause <it had> [//] we hadn't started rollin(g) it up yet . 525632_528862
and it took her (.) two minutes . 528878_533158
when I get the newspaper in the morning I take a rubberband and put it on the handle of my chair . 533340_540300
and so it took her two minutes to tell me to go in and get a rubberband off my chair and put it on the toothpaste . 540347_550057
I had a rough time figuring out what she was tryin(g) to tell me (.) this morning to get . 550107_556677
"you_know ‡ she'd started spelling chair +""/. 556756_559436"

"and then she'd say +""/. 560860_562120"

and then she'd [//] you_know everything that had ch@q in it was the words that she used . 563590_568560
she'd never use chair . 568578_569968
and once she did get out chair I didn't know what the heck she was talkin(g) about . 570060_574600
and so &-uh then we finally understood I [//] &+s then she picked up the [/] the toothpaste . 574615_581215
and &-uh bent it over . 581268_583378
"and says +""/. 583466_584076"
"+"" chair . 584230_584850"
and then I knew that she wanted me to go get a rubberband off the chair . 584872_588412
and put it on the toothpaste . 588460_589460
so ‡ we still have trouble . 591140_592230
&-uh but &-uh normally we get along pretty good . 592444_596104
&=clears_throat I did tell her not ta [

and her father remarried to a lady that had two other daughters . 634132_639052

they made her clean up the house . 651969_654809
they made her do the cooking . 654937_656097
they made her do the mopping of the floor and everything . 656120_658510
Cinderella &-uh didn't [/] (..) didn't have a great life compared to the other daughters . 658729_666149

they really enjoyed her . 689253_690253
&-uh and she enjoyed them . 691488_693308
