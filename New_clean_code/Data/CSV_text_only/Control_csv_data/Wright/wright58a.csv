<a little girl has taken her> [//] <not neccesarily taken but> [//] a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree . 31796_31856
<and the> [//] &-uh apparently a man <has brought> [//] has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder .
and he's attempted to get the cat down .
and he himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down .
a dog may well have accompanied him .
there was a dog there . 31896_31936
and the &-uh fire department has also arrived (.) with their ladder .
and they are approaching the scene .
and they are certainly going to get the cat down <and well> [//] along with the man more than likely .
&=shrugs and everything will be just fine .
the first step is to assemble the items you need .
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a &-uh knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread .
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread .
and <you would> [//] how I would go about doing it <I was> [//] I would put [//] &-uh spread jelly on [/] on one slice of bread .
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread .
and I would put the two of them together .
and then &=shrugs &+m eat the sandwich . 85043_85443
my recollection I haven't ever been seriously injured but &-um one of the [/] &-uh the typical but more unusual things I've encountered would be chicken pox .
not that that's unusual but for me a seriousness .
and I don't recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that .
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience .
not excruciating pain but [/] but quite a bit of &+unc discomforts .
+< and the &+applica application of calamine lotion (.) to &-uh ease &-uh <the sores> [//] the itchiness [>] of the sores .
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didn't obey mother's advice fully of not picking at the scabs .
so ‡ that's my recollection of chicken pox .
the person who I've had the most difficulty communicating with was my father .
<and I> [//] in part due to he suffered from a [//] some type of ataxia .
and [/] and <he was> [//] well <I was> [/] I was born when he was in his forties so I_mean <he was> [//] <by the time I was> [//] he was <quite elderly by the time> [//] not quite elderly but up there in years [>] by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so .
but he [//] &-uh (.) <in part I> [//] he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of <his failing> [/] his failing ability to walk adequately and &-uh +...
but he was very [/] (.) very [//] &-um (.) little bit short tempered I'd say .
+< and <just wanting> [//] he badly wanted to do things himself .
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind o(f) thing .
but he couldn't do it . 189038_189138
so ‡ he'd ask for help . 190403_191053
and then you'd try to help . 192505_193005
and he would put his hands <in the> [/] in the project .
and it was just more trouble .
and &+wh when you tried to say you_know .
"+"" I hafta do this myself ."
he would get frustrated .
and it was just &-uh very difficult time trying to communicate [>] that we both can't do this .
so ‡ and just [/] just an overall (.) difficulty .
occasionally it would brew into an argument .
and there would be some walking away because it's either you do this or I do this .
and we both can't do this .
and you_know I know you'd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but &-um +/.
it's &+ju you [/] you just try to remain calm .
and [/] and just explain the situation as best you can .
and [/] and try to resolve it .
and of_course there were good days and bad days .
you_know ‡ days where he'd be more tolerant of [/] of that kind of thing .
but [/] but just &+a it was more of a communication issue (.) that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do .
"so ‡ even_though he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied &+wi &+j &+th &+s &+in &+a assistance because it was more +""/."
"+"" I wanna be able to do this ."
so +...
the [//] &-uh not too long ago maybe a couple of years ago .
my girlfriend and I had taken a trip to Flagstaff to go into the lava tubes .
there was something there called the lava tubes .
<it's a> [//] &-uh it's [/] &+na it's near &+fr Flagstaff .
and it's [/] <it's just an underground> [//] well it was produced by volcanic activity .
and it's a very large crevice in the ground .
kind_of a [/] a tunnel . 293113_293183
and &-um we had gone in it then . 295323_295733
I believe it was a Sunday afternoon .
and it was rather late in the day .
and by the time the &-um +...
and in the center of this [/] this thing +...
it's basically a straight tunnel .
+< but in the center there is a [//] &-um and [//] somewhat of a (.) I [//] &+re you'd call it a pole .
it's not really a pole but it's [/] it's +//.
the [/] &-um the tunnel splits off in the center [>] and goes around another chunk of rock .
<so you have it> [//] it splits into a wide fork .
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel .
well ‡ we didn't look at the map adequately .
and we got in there . 328190_328260
and [/] &+th &+h and the [/] the flashlight started to dim .
<and we were> [//] &+tur we had gone all the way to the end .
and we turned around . 333983_334083
and we were unaware of this thing in the middle .
and happened to be turning around it in circles .
and the flashlights were going dim .
and by that time the other people who had visited had left .
so ‡ we were in there alone .
and at that point going in circles in <the dark or> [//] the dim lights .
you're kind_of like you_know how do you get out_o(f) this place ?
and it became quite [/] quite fearful .
not [//] I wouldn't say terror but the [/] the &-uh belief that maybe we'll be spending the night in here .
and obviously it's you_know you don't think you're gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes .
but its certainly you don't have food you don't have +...
so +...
I cannot be certain of what happened . [+ exc] 378530_378660
this is a photograph . [+ exc] 380518_380718
but clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water .
it may be a creek a stream a river &=shrugs or just an extreme [/] extreme area flood .
but &-uh that's really irrelevant . [+ exc] 396598_396768
she is in trouble . 397008_397018
and someone has either noticed a passerby or has &-um +...
or she alerted somebody that [//] &-um of her [/] &+s her situation .
and the authorities were alerted because it appears that a [/] a professional is attempting to rescue her .
he has on rescue equipment .
and I really cannot give an end to the story because I don't know what the outcome of the situation was . [+ exc]
I assume she was saved . 427793_428033
but there's no &=shrugs telling based on this photograph . [+ exc]
there is <a boy and> [//] a young boy . 437230_437820
he's outside . 439598_439708
and he's kicking about a soccer ball .
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house .
shatters a window . 448003_448093
lands inside . 449805_450365
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it .
he is quite startled . 457890_458030
we then see him with the ball in his hand .
he's looking out the broken window .
&-uh he [//] I can't tell that he's glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption .
and he's certainly not happy .
I'm not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother (.) removed it from his hand .
+< and he is still asking for it .
and she is reluctant to give it to him .
he's then outside with +//. 487723_487843
well ‡ he has a backpack on so I assume he's headed off to school (.) but not necessarily .
and &-uh he's outside . 494930_495020
and he's walking .
and he sees raindrops falling .
and the rain picks up . 498825_498995
and he is getting soaked . 499911_500491
and &+h it &-uh appears he's turned around .
and he's returned home . 505215_505425
his mother is looking at his [/] his drenched body .
and then he &-uh was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain .
(o)kay the story of Cinderella .
<well Cinderella is> [//] &-uh (.) she's one of three sisters .
and two of them are (.) rather in modern terms stuck up .
and [/] and well they're high on themselves .
and they [//] &-um their mother is somewhat the same way .
and she [//] &-uh as the story progresses <there is a> [//] one of the wealthy gentleman .
the &-uh uppity ups in [/] in the area . 551066_551276
he &+b is trying to I believe marry off his son .
and &-uh there is a ball being held . 559763_559823
and Cinderella is not invited because she [/] she has been rather outcast by the family as just the [/] the servant girl .
and [/] and she's to wait on everybody else .
so ‡ she's rather lower class in the family .
and &-uh it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the [/] &-uh (.) the ability to go to the ball I suppose you'd say .
and she goes there in this fancy [/] fancy &-uh vehicle .
and she's [/] she's wearing glass slippers .
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the &-uh son of the [/] the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son .
so ‡ she's [/] she's dancing with the son and it [/] &+f it turns out that the son is [/] is rather enamored by her .
so [//] but &-uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by &-uh I believe it was midnight something &=shrugs .
or else she turns into &=shrugs a pumpkin &=laughs something like that .
I'm not exactly sure what the [/] the gist of it was . [+ exc]
but regardless she [//] &-um it gets close to midnight .
she realizes this . 621953_622073
and she darts off . 623031_623141
and leaves the [/] &-uh the prince &=shrugs or the son &=shrugs of the wealthy landowner whoever he was &-uh kind_of depressed that she hadta leave early .
and &-um she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers .
and these glass slippers are magical .
and &-um <then she> [//] &-uh the &-uh prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her [/] her foot .
so ‡ and then <he's again> [//] you_know they're together again .
and he's happy to have found her .
and the [/] the other sisters are [//] who had planned on one of them getting the [/] &-uh the guy they're kind_of left in the dark .
and [/] and everyone kind_of gets their [/] their comeuppance .
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after .
