"&-uh to make a &-uh peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter, &-um the jar o(f) jelly, a plate, a knife, bread . 6351_15521"
and so then you would take with your knife . 16256_18746
&-uh I would put the peanut butter on the bread . 19190_21090
and then I would take and [//] the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 21136_25536
to put the two slices of bread together . 25964_27984
cut it in half on my plate . 28512_30652
and go for it . 30852_32092
well ‡ I'm very lucky because I'm basically very healthy . 46543_50073
I was ill as a young girl . 50510_52880
and &-um so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health . 53085_57845
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did . 58251_61821
so ‡ going along pretty healthy . 62325_65235
you_know ‡ I had &-uh one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery . 65299_71439
no drugs no anything . 71489_72879
so ‡ I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains . 73434_79674
and they would be &-like between my waist and my boobs . 80164_85594
and they would last like four hours . 86112_88362
and they were bad . 88516_89526
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position you_know where I could just get some relief . 89579_97669
you_know ‡ and you kind_of felt sick to your stomach but <it was> [//] pains were terrible . 97684_102204
so ‡ this happened a few times and you_know you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out what's wrong . 102681_108821
"so ‡ you tell them all of this and they think +""/. 109126_111186"
"+"" &-hm"
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but they're not telling you a thing . 112023_115773
so ‡ they send me a for a sonogram . 116465_118305
well ‡ I've never had one of those . 118363_120423
"and so I told them at the place I said +""/. 120474_122304"
"+"" if you find a baby in there and I'm like sixty years old . 122570_125900"
"I said +""/. 125953_126283"
"+"" we both can make a_lot_of money . 126602_128102"
so ‡ it kind_of made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me . 128433_133973
well ‡ the report comes back later . 134563_136333
and so I have a gall bladder problem . 136424_138394
so ‡ you_know it's like what do I do about it . 138801_141861
"and &-um you_know nothing happens, few little simple attacks . 141960_146470"
but my husband and I are in Tennesee . 146521_148491
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks . 148933_153763
scared my husband to death (be)cause he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane . 153897_161377
so ‡ when we get back I go back to the doctor again . 161846_164706
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder . 165129_171219
and that's the way life goes . 171980_175830
yes &-um the other people &-uh would be my mother because I do feel like she's maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory . 183951_196121
and I want her to be my mother and &-like she always useta be . 196594_200914
so ‡ it's been very hard &-like in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently . 201408_210698
"I try not to tell her +""/. 211195_214155"
"+"" can't you remember ? 214545_215335"
&-um because I'm now learning that she can't . 215957_218567
&-um so ‡ it's difficult because it's a learning process . 219135_223405
it's changes weekly maybe even daily . 223515_227205
&-um that's the main communication problem right now . 227595_232995
&-um I [//] <I've been> [//] I was frightened or scared &-uh many times &+w when I was young and growing up . 252494_262514
&-um we lived in a small town like six hundred people . 262779_266569
but I did live in the town . 266949_268579
&-uh my [//] &+fa I guess I was &-uh scared maybe because my father &-uh would go away to work into the big city . 269069_276539
and he would leave &-like on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night . 276800_281110
&-um my father being that he didn't live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family . 282100_290000
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and [/] and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town . 290496_301006
then we had &-uh a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was &-um loud and &-um I'm gonna say verbally abusive even_though I didn't realize that at that time . 301419_316499
and &-um so he would scream and yell and &-uh maybe not &+som always treat our mother like we thought . 316911_323781
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and [/] and the difference . 324097_329147
&-uh well ‡ here in Arizona we sometimes have flash floods . 343851_347721
&-um we had one and a young lady and her vehicle decided that she could drive off across this wash no problem . 348171_358711
guess what . 359130_359660
there was a problem . 359848_360888
&-uh the &+s car stalls . 361314_364994
the water comes up to the sides . 365214_367254
she's able to get out_of the car and get on the roof . 367644_371234
but then she's stranded . 371489_373149
the water is just roaring like crazy . 373231_375681
&-um but people on the shore on the banks see her . 376025_379825
&-uh they call rescue people in . 380215_382635
&-um they have all the equipment . 383023_385783
they work their way to get out to her . 385836_388346
&-uh they're gonna rescue her with their [/] their ropes and their belts and their ties . 388701_394561
&-uh they're making sure that they can safely get her attached to them so they can get her to shore . 394947_402267
what a learning lesson for the young lady . 402741_405131
we have a neighborhood boy Billy who loves to play soccer . 417154_421464
&-um there is no playground nearby so he plays soccer in his front yard . 421913_426893
&-uh he's having a good time one nice day . 427395_430175
and oh_my_gosh he kicked the soccer ball further <(th)an he> [/] than he ever expected . 430224_435494
and it went right into the neighbor's window . 435693_438613

and all_of_a_sudden a soccer ball comes through his window . 444406_448006
"well ‡ he goes over, got the soccer ball, checking outside, and he's deciding what should he do . 448498_454898"
should he take it back to Billy and tell him not to do that again ? 455404_459904
should he just wait and &+les let Billy come to the front door ? 460503_464513
well ‡ who knows what the man will decide . 465261_468551
&-um the little boy is getting ready to go to school . 478267_487597
