one sunny day in June a family of rats decided to get all the family together and go for a picnic . 386393_394873
they packed the truck with all their toys . 396155_398555
and they gathered all the rats . 398630_400660
<they climbed> [//] some climbed in the front of the cab . 402286_404896
some of the younger rats climbed in the back . 405386_408136
off they went down the road up a great big hill with flowers and bushes . 410592_417662
it was a very bumpy road with lots_of rocks . 419396_422246
when they hit one particularly large rock a little girl rat <with her baby> [//] (.) with her stuffed animal flew right out_of the back of the truck . 422607_438697
the truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls . 439021_449551
she lay alongside the road watching the truck drive off in the distance . 450226_456036
the rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic . 458303_463583
and they all climbed out_of the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys . 463872_472962
some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water . 474873_480153
some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers . 481182_487692
it was a beautiful lake . 488295_489615
and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time . 489634_493034
grandpa rat played the fiddle while grandma sat next to her [
and mother and father rat watched their children play . 501098_504248
everybody was having so much fun except for the little rat who had fallen out_of the truck . 505003_511803
she sat alongside the trail hugging her stuffed animal (.) to her and crying . 512419_521169
she was so scared and lonely . 521921_525391
the woods seemed so big and scary . 525734_532864
she looked every which way . 533579_535419
and didn't know what to do . 535493_537793
the flowers were pretty . 537986_540186
and she looked at the red flowers around her . 541101_543421
and the yellow flowers . 544056_545726
meanwhile back at the lake father called all the little rats to come and have lunch . 547906_555856
back in the woods <the little rat> [//] the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her . 556062_574032
she found that they were very very yummy . 575034_578384
and she filled up on juicy red raspberries . 578760_582870
meanwhile back at the lake the family started to realize that something was wrong . 584811_591211
they were missing the little girl rat . 591829_594489
the children sat and waited while the parents searched and called . 594826_600676
but she was nowhere to be seen . 601112_604242
they looked in the water and along the edges . 604650_608070
they looked under rocks and in the grass . 608550_612440
they were sad . 613328_614478
some of the young rats were even crying . 615418_618288
they did not know what had happened to their little sister . 618409_622469
they decided that they needed to pack up and head back the way that they had come . 623911_628911
nobody was going to be able to eat or have fun until they were all together again . 629420_634770
the little rat back along the trail had filled up on berries and was laying down in the grass just looking up at the sky wondering what to do next . 634819_651939
the rats in the truck searched and searched as they drove back along the trail the way they had come . 652195_662765
the little rat thought she heard something . 662852_666942
she thought she heard the rumbling of a truck and her brothers and sisters and mother and father and grandma and grandpa calling her name . 667811_676241
she rushed through the grass back towards the road . 677153_680693
she ran out into the road just in time to see her father's truck cresting the hill . 681360_687310
and they spotted her . 687841_688711
and they all waved and were so happy to find her again . 689341_693121
but [//] and they hugged joyfully (.) did cartwheels and jumped and cried . 694661_702601
but the little girl realized that something was wrong . 705020_709140
she had lost the stuffed animal that had given her such comfort when she was lost in the woods . 709617_714797
she ran back through the woods . 715530_717430
"and in the grass there she found her bunny laying down, her stuffed animal . 717484_722014"
she hugged her stuffed animal to her . 722629_724429
and she was so happy . 724758_726518
they all climbed back into the truck again . 727949_730199
actually they all decided to set up and have a picnic right there where they had found their little sister . 732477_739957
so ‡ they started to spread out the blankets and get the food out once again . 740850_746950
but this time they were most certain to have a happy picnic because they were all together . 747006_753436

good dog Carl . 989541_990801
Carl <lived in a family> [//] lived in a house with a family that had a little baby . 994683_1001473
Carl was a big Rottweiller . 1002065_1005835
"and <he was> [//] when [/] when the mother went out shopping she said to Carl +""/. 1007030_1013420"
"+"" look after the baby Carl . 1014352_1016102"
"+"" I'll be back shortly . 1016477_1017787"
Carl was being left to babysit for a baby . 1019356_1023266
and he was just a big happy dog . 1024443_1028653
they waited as they watched the mother get into her car and drive away . 1031775_1036565
Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone . 1037328_1041228
the baby also waited expectantly . 1041931_1044421
when Carl was sure it was &+s safe he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed out_of the crib and onto Carl's back . 1046688_1058888
Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse . 1062435_1068365
they were going to have such a good time together . 1070872_1073822
they walked down the hall into mother's bedroom . 1074013_1077723
it looked so soft . 1079014_1081134
they jumped up onto the bed . 1081854_1083884
and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch . 1084659_1091059
afterwards they got off the bed and they went over to mom's vanity . 1094125_1100025
there the baby got into mom's powder [//] perfumed powder . 1102735_1108505
and he dusted Carl's nose . 1109283_1111743
it tickled Carl's nose . 1112068_1113868
but he liked the smell of the powder . 1113918_1116048
and he was having so much fun with baby . 1116343_1118863
they played dress-up . 1120153_1121563
Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can (.) on top of him just like a little purple hat . 1124223_1136733
baby had a hat too . 1137902_1139592
baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff . 1139688_1142948
they looked at themselves &+to [//] in the mirror and they smiled . 1143501_1146871
this was so much fun . 1146918_1149428
next Carl took the baby to the laundry chute . 1150908_1155308
uhoh . 1156768_1157408
what do you think is going to happen here ? 1158149_1160329
the baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down . 1162252_1166632
and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby . 1167974_1176304
he gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry . 1177469_1186809
"Carl jumps down the stairs, gets the baby on his back again, and <climbs back up &+th> [//] runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck . 1188873_1201603"
Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room scattering the newspaper every which way . 1205523_1212353
they walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish . 1215809_1222669
the baby decided that he wanted to go swimming . 1222886_1227676
and so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water . 1228073_1236783
the baby splashed and chased the fish . 1237038_1240818
afterwards Carl decided that he wanted to dance . 1245709_1251909
amazingly Carl knew how to turn on the stereo . 1253394_1257124
and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music . 1257599_1262849
and Carl danced and danced for the baby . 1263497_1266537
and the baby laughed and clapped his hands . 1266626_1270396
afterwards Carl and the baby were both very hungry . 1274411_1278161
so ‡ they wandered into the kitchen . 1278500_1280260
they got into the refrigerator . 1282601_1284651
and what did they find but bread and butter . 1285303_1289813
Carl got a package of whole wheat bread . 1291172_1293882
and he ripped it open . 1293897_1295337
and ate all the bread . 1295358_1299018
"meanwhile ‡ the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers, and tasting the salty buttery taste . 1299957_1310907"
they found grapes . 1314303_1315853
and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth . 1316245_1321715
they made chocolate milk with syrup . 1323095_1325565
what a mess . 1326275_1328045
you can imagine there was syrup and milk all over the floor . 1328489_1332539
and what's in the red jar ? 1334038_1335778
oh_my . 1338415_1339555
there was food everywhere . 1340755_1342815
and the baby was a mess . 1342867_1345277
the baby climbed onto Carl's back . 1345428_1350728
and they climbed back up the stairs leaving the mess behind . 1351995_1356005
"Carl, smart dog that he was, started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside . 1356518_1363568"
he got a washcloth a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap . 1364390_1369240
and he scrubbed the baby . 1370721_1372371
Carl's mouth was full of soap . 1374740_1376790
and he made bubbles when he breathed which made the baby laugh . 1378129_1382329
afterwards Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry . 1384787_1389007
he brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside . 1389741_1398291
then Carl had work to do . 1399377_1401217
he went back down to the kitchen . 1401986_1404266
finished off the bread . 1404616_1405826
put the wrapper in the trash . 1405874_1407454
licked up the milk . 1407536_1408906
he looked out the window . 1410218_1411448
mom wasn't back yet . 1412163_1413583
he still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away . 1413833_1418593
after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around and fun time he looked out the window and saw mother coming home . 1421015_1431815
the baby was laying in his crib quietly . 1431864_1436604
and Carl laid down next to the baby and waited . 1437798_1441278
mother walked in to see them just as she had left them . 1443203_1446893
she was happy that Carl was such a good babysitter . 1447596_1450786
"+"" good dog „ Carl . 1451908_1453498"
"she said +"". 1453547_1454167"

okay . 1576131_1576761
to plant a flower in the garden the first thing that you needta do is dig a hole <twice as big as the root or> [//] &-uh twice as big as the pot . 1577439_1589319
and then you needta mix some compost in with the soil that you just dug out . 1589771_1598731
put the plant back into the hole . 1599213_1603763
and fill around it with the mixture of the dirt and the compost . 1604768_1610758
and then you make a mound in the middle . 1611344_1615224
making sure that the root ball is just [/] just covered . 1615774_1619354
and then you can <make a little moat> [/] make [/] make a little moat around the &-uh dirt ball . 1619853_1627543
then you water it . 1628909_1630409
and as the dirt settles down you add more dirt if necessary . 1631253_1636133
and then saturate the soil to make sure that it has gotten all the way through <to the water> [//] to the roots and that the soil is settled . 1637049_1647209
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you get out all the ingredients . 1657716_1661586
two slices of bread a jar of peanut butter a jar of jelly and a knife . 1662789_1669989
you open the two pieces of bread . 1670962_1674352
lay them out next to each_other . 1674513_1676143
you open the jelly first . 1676913_1679573
and you scoop out however much jelly you want . 1680518_1685288
and spread it with a knife onto one slice of bread . 1685338_1690408
and then you take your knife and <you clean it on the other slice of bread> [% gpx=moves right hand back and forth] before you dip it into the peanut butter jar . 1692117_1701037
you open the peanut butter jar . 1701085_1702985
dip &=ges
get a nice big glob of peanut butter . 1707492_1709932
and then spread that onto the other slice of bread . 1710423_1714093
then you close your two pieces of bread together with the peanut butter side facing the jelly side . 1714609_1721849
lay it down flat . 1723203_1724493
cut it in two or four pieces . 1725202_1728512
and then enjoy . 1729586_1730176
on my last vacation we joined my best friend and her family in their r_v going to the Grand_Canyon . 1766028_1777288
there were seven of us . 1780363_1781853
four in my family and three in her family . 1781945_1784535
we loaded into the r_v on a very stormy night here in Phoenix . 1785582_1790772
as we head north towards the Grand_Canyon the rain stopped <but that wasn't> [//] but we weren't in the clear . 1792525_1801105
a trucker passing us waved at us indicating that something was wrong . 1802210_1808030
and so we pulled over alongside the road . 1808388_1810668
and found that the vehicle we were towing behind the motorhome had blown a tire and ripped up the whole front side of the truck we were towing . 1811669_1824389
while the children slept in the motorhome the adults got out . 1827130_1832300
and changed the tire . 1832719_1833829
and did the things that we needed to do . 1834162_1836022
and we proceeded on to Flagstaff . 1837194_1839344
we stayed in the Walmart parking lot that night so_that the very next morning we could wake up and get the tire fixed . 1840218_1849218
and proceed with our vacation . 1849899_1851579
the next morning after the tire was fixed we drove up to the Grand_Canyon . 1851860_1859720

and after dinner which we had outside on the patio we went back inside and gathered around the Christmas tree that we had cut in the forest a couple weeks earlier . 1929277_1942277
everybody said it was the funniest looking but most beautiful Christmas tree they had ever seen . 1943398_1948238

last weekend we went into the Tonto_National_Forest <in Payson> [//] outside of Paysin to cut firewood . 2001550_2011160
I had gone to the ranger station in Mesa and bought a firewood cutting permit . 2011722_2017992
and so we packed up without any motorhome . 2019140_2022430
just tents and sleeping bags and trailers [//] &-uh trailer and a chainsaw and axes . 2023162_2032712
and lots_of food and cooking supplies for my mother in-law . 2033735_2036865
and early Saturday morning we drove up to Payson . 2038177_2042157
we [/] we followed along a dirt road that the ranger had recommended . 2043319_2047939
and we found a nice place to camp with lots_of dead trees around us . 2048081_2052201
after we set up camp we unloaded our a_t_v . 2053348_2057487
and we started dragging huge logs back up the hill to our camp . 2058149_2063559
<we cut the logs> [//] we cut the [/] the long tree stumps into logs and laid them next to the camper where we would load them the next day . 2064813_2074194
but mother in-law was gonna be sleeping in <the camper or the &+t not the camper but> [//] the trailer so we couldn't load (un)til the next day . 2075074_2080935
my husband and I stayed in a tent on a air mattress . 2081478_2084649
and it was so nice . 2084899_2086168
it rained as we were going to sleep . 2086815_2088466
but we could still hear the crickets . 2088512_2090302
and &-uh the [/] the popping of the fire just outside the tent . 2092387_2097547
<and some> [//] and so that's [/] that's how I went to sleep . 2099899_2102799
it was beautiful . 2102821_2103421
sometime during the night <I woke up> [//] we woke up because there was a coyote howling close_by . 2103499_2109239
so ‡ we got up . 2109900_2110770
and we opened up the tent . 2111031_2112131

when the children finished playing and realized that mom and dad were gone they went back to the picnic basket . 2338338_2344438

Suzie was out playing in the yard (.) with her dog and her bicycle . 2537130_2544100
she was havin(g) a good time until she noticed that the dog was barking at the tree . 2547177_2553247
she looked up into the tree and there she saw her cat Muffy sitting way out on a branch . 2555364_2563934
Muffy looked happy enough . 2566560_2567810
Muffy didn't look concerned . 2567869_2569479

and so she called to her father . 2575796_2577456
and her father came running out and climbed up the tree with a ladder . 2578959_2582579
he climbed out on the branch . 2584225_2585915

and he couldn't go any further . 2591036_2592436
he was immobilized . 2592681_2594271
the dog barking at the base of the tree accidentally knocked the ladder down . 2594381_2600041

and first they helped father down . 2627380_2629290
and then they reached up and very gently took the cat and brought the kitty_cat back down to Suzie . 2630535_2638455

a man and a woman went for a drive in the country . 2854398_2856908
they were going to see the woman's sister who lived on a farm . 2858478_2861548
they had brought a map with them but at some point realized that they were lost . 2865734_2872154
they saw a farmer standing alongside the road getting ready to plant a tree . 2873857_2878927
they stopped to talk to the farmer . 2881601_2883461
the man showed him his map . 2884684_2887014
the farmer looked at the map and knew exactly where they were trying to go . 2887568_2892528
"he told them to go up the road two miles, take a left, and then another right . 2893861_2898741"

they smiled and [/] and thanked him and drove away . 2905215_2908415
the farmer went on planting his tree . 2908469_2913929
before he had even finished digging the hole he looked up . 2916286_2921896
and there was the same man and woman stopping alongside the road again . 2923070_2928340
he had given them directions that led them around in a circle . 2930323_2936113

I was riding a quad . 2982796_2984416
I was thirty years old . 2984468_2986278
and we were at Little_Sahara sand dunes in northern Oklahoma . 2987780_2993390
it was nineteen ninety four . 2995954_2997874
<right before> [/] &~Thanks right before Halloween . 2999297_3002057
and my husband and I were out riding . 3004119_3006679
he was on a performance quad that had big shock absorbers . 3007930_3014530
<and we were> [//] and I was on a utility quad like a hunting quad that's more made as a workhorse and not for racing . 3016650_3024480
we went over a hill . 3025967_3027317
and sped down the other side of the hill . 3028862_3030762
and at the bottom there were bumps . 3031147_3033557
and my husband's bike just went right over the bumps . 3036663_3039753
but mine hit the bumps and +... 3039805_3041485
as my body was coming off of a bump my bike had hit another bump and came back up . 3044874_3050114
and I heard a loud and felt a really loud pop . 3051140_3053830
and (.) I stopped the bike or the bike stopped itself . 3059522_3062892
and (.) I realized I was in a_lot_of pain . 3064407_3068857
couldn't move . 3069866_3070886
so ‡ my husband came back . 3071849_3072759
and he took me off the bike . 3074442_3075932
and laid me on the ground . 3076702_3077952
and I remember making sounds . 3078201_3079961
I remember I was embarrassed at the same time that I was in pain because I was making sounds like an animal . 3082439_3087809
it was embarrassing . 3089391_3090451
and &-uh I told my husband I could not get back on the bike . 3093281_3096351
that I couldn't do it . 3097289_3098029
I couldn't move . 3098118_3098708
and I was in too much pain . 3098822_3099812
and he was annoyed . 3102163_3103123
"and he said +""/. 3104598_3104898"
"+"" if you don't get back on that bike we're gonna hafta get a ambulance crew out here for you . 3105843_3110583"

"+"" no . 3112836_3113036"
"+"" I don't . 3113500_3114050"
so ‡ he lifted me back on the bike . 3115235_3116945
and he put both of my hands on <the steering wheel or> [//] the &-um handlebars . 3117476_3125166
and he put my feet on the pedals . 3125567_3127697
and (.) <he drove> [/] he drove ahead of me . 3131401_3133451
and he [/] he went as quickly as he could back to the car . 3134295_3137085
meanwhile ‡ it took me about an hour to get three miles . 3137131_3140851
and I made it back to the car . 3141466_3142646
and he hadta lift me off . 3144829_3145789
and put me in the seat . 3147034_3147754
it took three hours for us to get <home or> [//] to the hospital . 3147855_3153085
and x-rays and everything +... 3156403_3158813
broken back +... 3158862_3159342
"&-um and when my husband called me that night from home and I was in the hospital not having any idea when [//] you_know <what our> [/] what our future was going to be like, he told me he was very sad . 3159977_3173027"
&=laughs very sad and very sorry . 3173197_3177347
oh yeah &=laughs . 3186661_3187541
yes . 3203100_3203690
my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia . 3209573_3212623
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia . 3214079_3216919
so ‡ her first language is Mandarin Chinese . 3217744_3219994
and then her second language is English . 3221815_3225775
and (.) I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods instead_of really understanding things . 3231247_3241117
and it's taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her even_though she insists she understands . 3241945_3250875
you_know ‡ and the the very next day she'll not have a clue what I had told her . 3251502_3256742
and so I have just learned to &-um &-uh watch for cues that she's not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding . 3257578_3268398
and I've hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase in_order_to make sure that she understands . 3269119_3280179
I was in the military . 3297510_3306040
I'd just come to Phoenix from Korea . 3307333_3309873
and I didn't know anybody yet . 3313359_3315209
and so I got a part-time job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard . 3315504_3323764
"and I worked middle of the night shift, all night shift . 3325029_3329509"
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed . 3330716_3336356
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes . 3338168_3342758
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons . 3343106_3346196
we weren't allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon . 3346333_3351233
there's actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for self-defense or as a weapon . 3351285_3356285
so ‡ on this fifty acre site there was one light pole . 3357010_3360410
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds . 3361539_3368079
so ‡ all around you it's pitch black . 3368445_3370465
and you're just under this light pole . 3370820_3371790
and you can't see <beyond the darkness or> [//] beyond the light . 3372058_3377158
and so I would sit there at night . 3378404_3380864
and &-uh (.) one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work +... 3381793_3392543
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning . 3393277_3396427
and this time it was around three in the morning . 3397159_3400009
and I didn't realize that they were going to be coming that early . 3401562_3409292
and I was &+s sitting where I shouldn't have been sitting . 3412105_3414715
I was just outside the light so_that I could see . 3414768_3418048
(be)cause it's creepy . 3418095_3418995
very creepy all night long . 3419562_3420932
and so you_know by three o'clock in the morning I was already on edge . 3421224_3423904
and all_of_a_sudden +... 3424855_3427545
and I hadn't seen anybody approaching . 3428921_3430511
but all_of_a_sudden a man jumped out from behind a close_by Port_a_Potty . 3430618_3435268
he yelled . 3435347_3437207
and he had a rope in his hand . 3437432_3438482
and he was stretching the rope in_between his hands like this . 3439261_3442571
and he yelled . 3443150_3443750
and I screamed . 3444932_3446012
and he laughed . 3447147_3447857
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up . 3449140_3455100
and he continued to laugh . 3458042_3459162
and I cried because it had scared me so badly &=laughs . 3460268_3463058
&=laughs as it turns out he was just one of the construction workers that showed up early and maybe got dropped off along the road . 3465634_3472214

and the [//] there were roads that were impassable . 3523205_3526095
there were roadblocks up everywhere . 3526149_3527969
but every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads . 3529615_3536565
they don't realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water . 3537392_3541912

one father <had gone across the or> [//] had attempted to cross the road . 3545151_3554311
he thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine . 3555655_3559205
then as they entered the water very quickly the &=hand
and pushed his truck right off the road . 3569593_3571573
he and his daughter were the only ones in the truck . 3574537_3578317
daughter was in her seatbelt . 3579761_3581171
he was able to get out_of his seatbelt . 3581553_3583553

okay . 4026187_4026577
once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella . 4027062_4029692
her mother had died . 4031722_4032772
and her father (.) married a new wife who had two children of her own . 4033393_4043363
they came to live in Cinderella's house with Cinderella and her father . 4043570_4047720
"her new stepmother <and her> [//] and the stepmother's two daughters, Cinderella's stepsisters now, didn't like Cinderella because she was so beautiful . 4049676_4061266"
and they were mean to Cinderella . 4062490_4063880
and <the mother> [//] the stepmother decided that Cinderella <would be the maid> [//] would be like a maid . 4065322_4072532
and she made Cinderella do all kinds of work . 4072637_4075077
she made her scrub the floors and do all the cooking and cleaning . 4075168_4080338
and she hadta serve the stepmother and the two stepsisters . 4081265_4085335
one day an invitation came . 4085541_4093221
the prince was having a ball . 4093273_4095463
and all the eligible women in the city were invited to the ball . 4097703_4104884
the &+m stepmother and the stepsisters were so excited . 4105064_4109424
and they started planning right away for the ball . 4109559_4112899
Cinderella was excited too until the stepmother told her that she couldn't go to the ball until she finished all of her jobs . 4113667_4121607
and the stepmother gave her a particularly long list of [/] of very long difficult dirty jobs knowing that Cinderella would never be able to finish them in_order_to go to the ball . 4121761_4132991
Cinderella was so sad . 4134995_4136425
and she went in her room and cried . 4136813_4138313
and her animal friends gathered around her . 4139292_4141872
she was friends with all the animals because she was so nice . 4142859_4145630
the animals loved her . 4146091_4146941
the animals helped her do her chores . 4148468_4150287
and they all worked very hard . 4151268_4152528
and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball . 4152729_4156660
when it was time to go to the ball she went downstairs . 4157898_4161938
and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress they just went crazy with rage . 4163290_4171710
"and they tore the dress off of her, the pins out_of her hair . 4171848_4175018"
and they pushed her down . 4176907_4178397
and told her that she didn't deserve to come to the ball . 4178939_4181529
"crying, she went back to her room where her animal friends comforted her . 4184305_4188835"
and then fairy godmother appeared . 4190593_4193483
and took pity on Cinderella . 4195318_4197598
with a wave of her wand the fairy godmother (.) produced a dress for Cinderella that was more gorgeous than any dress anybody had ever seen . 4199307_4214267
and Cinderella looked beautiful . 4215672_4217352
<the stepmother or> [//] the fairy godmother said that Cinderella was to go to the ball . 4218083_4222203
but she hadta be back home by midnight . 4222425_4224975
because at midnight her clothes and her carriage and everything were gonna disappear and go back to normal . 4225967_4233227
so ‡ she took some mice and with a wave of her wand she turned them into horses . 4235255_4242595
and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage . 4244504_4246844
and Cinderella climbed in in her beautiful gown and went to the ball . 4247053_4250943
everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom . 4253302_4257942
and the prince fell in love immediately . 4258353_4259873
they danced all night . 4259923_4261433
she was having such a good time Cinderella was she didn't realize how late it was . 4262584_4267634
and as the clock struck the first bell for twelve o'clock she looked up and realized how late it was and what was gonna happen . 4269759_4280659
"with a gasp she ran out_of the ballroom, leaving the prince shocked not knowing what was going on . 4280707_4290807"
she ran out_of the ballroom and down the stairs . 4290918_4293088
she hadta get out_of there before the last bong . 4293718_4297628
before the twelfth bong [//] bell . 4298121_4300251
on the way down the steps she tripped and lost a slipper . 4301311_4304081
a beautiful little glass slipper . 4304805_4306675
she made it home . 4309172_4310092
and all the beautiful dresses and pumpkin coach and horses turned back into what they had been before the fairy godmother visited . 4311223_4320883
so ‡ she had made it home safely without anybody quite figuring out who she was . 4323931_4327331
and <she went> [/] she went to her room and went to sleep dreamin(g) about the prince . 4327465_4331835
the prince wasn't happy because he didn't know who she was where she lived . 4331889_4336119
and he didn't know when he was gonna see her again . 4336288_4337938
so ‡ he took the glass slipper and had his [/] his servant go to every house in the city . 4338974_4349374
and all the girls hadta try on the slipper . 4349957_4352727
he knew that whoever the slipper fit was gonna be the girl who he had fallen in love with <at the dance or> [//] at the ball . 4353337_4360317
<the two girls> [//] the two stepsisters tried to fit their feet into the slipper but their feet were too big . 4360589_4370009
"and the servant said +""/. 4372644_4373294"
"+"" isn't there anyone else ? 4373390_4374740"
"+"" I've searched all the houses . 4375112_4376472"
"+"" there (ha)s gotta be somebody else . 4376618_4377878"
and just then Cinderella appeared in her work dress . 4378752_4382452
"and he says +""/. 4384255_4384375"
"+"" ah . 4384633_4385053"
"+"" here's another girl . 4385205_4386015"
"+"" she needs to try on the slipper too . 4386654_4388294"
so ‡ Cinderella placed her foot into the slipper . 4389691_4392901
and it slid in very easily . 4393175_4395175
and she smiled . 4396201_4397271
"and the servant smiled and said +""/. 4397712_4399112"
"+"" oh ! 4399314_4399654"
"+"" at last I found you . 4399910_4401740"
and he brought Cinderella back to the castle . 4402223_4403973
while the sisters stared after her with anger in their eyes . 4404723_4409223
the prince was very happy that his servant had found Cinderella . 4409276_4415106
when they got married Cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them . 4416347_4423147
and she was kind to them . 4425508_4428348
<and they all lived> [//] and they were sorry for how mean they had been to her . 4430440_4433100
and they all lived happily ever after . 4434020_4435900
