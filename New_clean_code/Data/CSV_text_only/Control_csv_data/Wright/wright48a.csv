and you <spread peanut butter> [//] take a knife and you spread peanut butter on one side . 15298_21188

today is Johnny's eighth birthday . 30126_32676
and all of his friends from school are coming over to sing happy birthday and have a piece of birthday cake with him . 32830_41200
&+a as [//] when mommy and Johnny stepped out_of the kitchen they walk back into the living room to find that <there was a big chunk of cake taken> [//] chunk [//] there was a big bite taken out_of the cake . 42543_57563
and they looked to see that the prints led right to the dog under the couch . 59468_63798
mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guests arrive . 64257_70868
and Johnny cried . 71041_72141
"<the guests> [//] as the guests walked in they said +""/. 73120_75250"
"+"" oh_my . 75635_76235"
"+"" what are we gonna do now ? 76481_77771"
but the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything . 79356_84046
so ‡ the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home . 84591_91331
in fourth grade I was outside &-um during recess in New_York . 93403_99143
and as you may or may not know <they have> [//] &-um we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city &=laughs . 99630_108830
we don't have a playground . 109160_110460
so ‡ they put up the barriers . 110476_112076
and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street . 112675_115505
so ‡ &-um I was standing against one o(f) the cars . 116115_119265
and a friend of mine ran right into me . 119738_121978
and &-uh my wrist went right around the [/] &-um the rear view mirror and broke . 122000_128600
so ‡ &-um they &-uh called my mom . 129217_132968
and my mom came . 133163_134853
and I was just crying . 134868_136788
and she rushed me to the doctor . 136803_140033
&-uh <we took> [//] I think we took the bus because she didn't wanna pay for an ambulance . 140368_145228
so ‡ I'm in pain on the bus . 145248_147458
I'm crying . 147508_148028
I'm trying to keep it still . 148051_149671
and &-um (w)e got to the hospital and they hadta put a cast on me . 150203_154213
and that was my first time having a cast . 154575_156505
and &-um got back to school and all my friends signed it . 157218_161438
and &-um so that was cool . 161458_163628
and the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside . 163673_167983
and so I remember one time my mom used &-like &-uh one of the &-uh straws from the broom to try and itch . 168005_175435
and it broke in there . 175743_177073
so ‡ then that was even more annoying (be)cause I couldn't get to to it . 177351_181611
&-um and that was about all I remember about that . 182293_188673
and I +... 188690_189160
oh ‡ and then I remember using it as a weapon too &=laughs . 189906_192086
if somebody bothered me I'd hit (th)em with it . 194188_196268
but then I would feel it too &=laughs . 196730_198640
so +... 199046_199216
yeah ‡ that was my first experience with a cast &=laughs . 200696_202996
+< as far as language barriers or +..? 217170_219220
&-um I'm sure I have . 225876_230016
I can't think of anything off the top of my head though . 230148_232688
language yes . 234890_236070
sure . 239133_239983
well ‡ most recently you_know when we call to pay a phone bill or something &-um we get somebody in another country . 240796_249346
and so a_lot_of times &-like they can't pronounce our names . 249730_254040
so ‡ <we'll be like are you> [//] first we hafta figure out if they're calling the right house . 254236_258226
and then you_know after they say it a few times then we do understand . 258338_263078
&-um and just to switch really quick +//. 263566_266366
actually when we've called to get help with &-like computer service or something that's when <it becomes a really> [//] it becomes difficult because we're trying to first understand what they're saying and then do what they're saying and trying to figure out if they understand what we're asking what for we need . 266446_286516
so ‡ yeah that's a interesting experience . 286661_289361
plenty . 298625_299015
&=laughs &-um (...) scared . 304353_309263

"and so in New_York it was like you_know you don't trust anybody, you don't go with any strangers, you_know everybody's bad in New_York . 355758_364158"
we had the completely different view of California . 364663_368243
"California was like this fantasy land you_know awesome place to be, you can trust everybody, and everybody loves everybody . 368296_375086"
so ‡ <when we moved here or> [//] when we moved to California from New_York I would sometimes walk home from the babysitter's or what have you . 375823_385253
and one time this &-um man stopped . 385918_389958

he pulled up in front of my house . 463606_465446
and he was still kind_of rolling . 465501_466871
and I just kind_of opened the door and just kind_of jumped out_of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house . 466893_475723
(a)nd nobody was home . 475770_477910
so ‡ then I'm knockin(g) on the door . 477930_479410

"+"" oh_gosh ‡ what if he's &-like just still &-like right there waiting for me . 482140_484950"
(a)nd so when I thought he was gone I ran over to my neighbor's house which is my [//] you_know my best friend's house at the time and stayed there until I knew my mom was home . 484970_496200

and they came &+a with all their gear and &-uh tried to figure out how they could get to her . 543973_550103
and &-um one of the firemen was able to jump into the water and grab onto a branch and pull the girl to safety . 551521_559801
the little boy went outside to kick his soccer ball around . 581460_586610
and innocently he kicked it right into his neighbor's house . 587113_593023
it shattered the window and fell right into the neighbor's lap or actually in [//] hit the lamp right next to where <the neighbor> [//] his neighbor was sitting . 593866_606086

the little boy ran away because he was scared . 626165_628475
the little boy is ready to go to school . 639158_643848

Cinderella was a little girl who became an orphan at a young age . 707871_715421
her uncle decided to take her to live with who &+be later became her stepmother and two stepsisters . 715473_726173
as the years went on Cinderella was treated poorly by her stepsisters and her stepmom . 727550_734410
"they would make her clean, wash all the dishes clean the floors, wash their clothes, &-um scrub the floors, do everything that they didn't wanna do and treat her badly . 737016_755716"
then they got an invitation to go to the ball . 757416_761606
and Cinderella and <her mo(m)> [//] her stepmom and stepsisters were all invited . 762110_768430
and so right away all &+th her little friends the little animals &-um decided to sew her a beautiful gown . 769043_777753
and the [//] Cinderella was so excited about it and going to the ball . 778223_781623

"+"" and you're going to cook and you're going to clean and you're going to make sure that this house is spotless by the time we get back . 788250_795110"

she was really looking forward to going . 800983_803143
and &-um she was sitting there crying . 803645_807285
she was sitting there crying and then along comes the fairy godmother to save the day . 808775_815705
and she touches Cinderella with her wand and she's in a beautiful gown . 816673_821203
and then she touches the pumpkin and it turns into a beautiful chariot with horses . 821538_826288
and off Cinderella goes to the ball . 826993_828863
unbeknownst to her stepmother and sisters Cinderella's at the ball dancing and having a ball having fun and dancing with the prince . 830563_843863
and then she turns around . 844563_846083
and the clock strikes twelve or one &=laughs . 846501_852841
I can't remember &=laughs . [+ exc] 853693_854513
