and the birthday cake was in the room . 9565_13355
and nobody was paying attention . 13376_14456
and so the dog ate part of the birthday cake . 14501_16551
and tracked it across the floor . 16631_18081
is under the couch . 18403_19053

&-hm
&-um what happened +... 117526_118556
oh I went skiing and I fell &=laughs . 118895_120595
didn't think I had done anything but somehow or other I managed to break a bone in my wrist . 121793_125963
and so I hadta go to the hospital . 126038_128168
they hadta x-ray it twice before they figured out where it was . 128186_131126
it hurt like cra
&=head
happened in Colorado . 136206_137146
came back home . 137341_138071
hadta put a cast on it ten weeks . 138388_140238
atrophy . 140658_141098
the most painful thing I've ever had in my life . 141118_143058
you can't move your hands &=laughs afterwards . 143123_145053
so ‡ I hadta go through physical therapy but now it's perfectly fine . 145516_148546
&-um well ‡ it's interesting to try to have a conversation with somebody who &-um English is their second language and their first language is Spanish . 154353_163023
and <I don't know> [//] I know &-like almost zero Spanish . 163043_166163
and so to try to have a conversation of &-um any depth or anything you can really just get the basics . 166255_173225
so ‡ it's very interesting to try to communicate with a s
I think I'm communicating just fine . 187225_188885
I think they're not &=laughs listening . 188903_190333
but [=! laughs] do you mean &-like they couldn't understand what I was saying to them &*INV
&-um can I tell you how that was ? 197659_199189
do you mean &-like what was I feeling ? 199521_200501
what [//] how did I experience that ? 200520_201780
oh_my_gosh ‡ oh ‡ I guess the only time was when I traveled to Mexico . 204091_206951
and &-um &-uh oh they [/] they stop you going down there sometimes . 206975_211435
and they'll pull you over . 211488_212258
and they'll ask you &-like what do you have in your trunk or things like that . 212280_214400
or they'll say something to me . 214423_215393
I have no idea what they are saying to me . 215411_216841
and then finally they'll find English words . 217253_218823
and I'll be [//] &-like &=head
and so <it's just> [/] <it's just> [//] it's [/] &-um it's a little scary because <you don't know> [//] &+w you really don't know what they're trying to say . 223306_230956
and you could get in trouble if you don't respond the right way . 230975_234555
&-um because of communication like that ? 243605_248165
+< or just when was I frightened or scared . 248585_250070
&-um . 250858_251548
you know what ? 256510_256829
it was the strangest thing . 256850_257630
I [/] I made a right hand turn &=ges
and I thought that I looked but I didn't see the car . 259916_262506
and so when I turned once I was turning then I did see the car . 262703_266023
and I thought I was going to get hit but I didn't . 266613_269293
but it's amazing because my entire body flooded with adrenaline . 269355_272645
I felt like I had gotten hit . 272666_273926
nothing had happened but <it just> [//] it scared me like crazy (be)cause I just knew for sure they were going to hit the back of me but they didn't . 274020_280620
<there was> [/] &-hm there was a girl that was out hiking with her family . 287013_292563
and &-um all a sudden there was a storm that came up . 292926_296906
and &-uh in Arizona we get a_lot_of flash floods . 297463_299903
and unfortunately she got in a part where there's the flash floods . 299956_303066
and she got caught out in the water . 303143_304873
she was able to get a hold of a stick and hang onto that . 305356_307506
and so they called the &-uh rangers . 307556_310186
and they came out . 310321_311091
and they rescued her from the water . 311256_313436
&-hm there was a little boy that was outside playing &-uh with his soccer ball . 328038_331948
and he was practicing his kicks and kicked it . 331963_334293
and it got away from him . 334353_335093
and it went through the window of the neighbors house and landed in . 335111_338751
and the neighbor was sitting in his easy chair . 339021_340721
and he got up and saw the hole in the window . 340743_343663
and looked out and saw the little boy . 343678_345448
"and said +""/. 345903_346293"
"+"" well ‡ I guess you're gonna hafta mow my lawn for the next fifteen years to pay off the window . 346430_351300"
www .
okay . [+ exc] 372076_372336
&-um there was a little boy who was leaving to go to school with his backpack . 374153_378463
and his mom told him to take the umbrella . 378541_380021
"and he said +""/. 380036_380466"
"+"" no no I don't need the umbrella . 380923_381873"
so ‡ he waves goodbye to his mom and he heads off to school . 381890_384130
and sure enough it starts raining a little bit . 384151_386281
and then it rains really really hard . 386300_387810
and he's drenched . 387831_388831
so ‡ he decides he better go back home and get his umbrella so he can maybe stay a little bit dry . 389311_393751
okay . 399550_399760
so
and they were mean to her . 405858_407038
they made her do all the chores . 407388_408678
and she became friends with all <the &-um animals> [//] (be)cause we're in the Disney version the animals <in the> [/] &-uh in the &-uh house and outside the house . 408788_417728
and so &-uh there came the announcement <that there was going to be a ball> [//] that the prince was gonna have a ball . 418880_424820
and all the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball . 425051_427521
so ‡ they got all ready to go . 427588_428758
and Cinderella couldn't go to the ball . 428773_430373
but her little friends decided that they would help her . 430390_432970
and her fairy godmother came along and wanted Cinderella to go to the ball . 433288_436058
so ‡ she turned &-um let's see a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses and got her a gown and glass slippers and sent Cinderella off to the ball . 436145_447825
and she met Prince_Charming there . 448455_450375
and she danced with him . 450390_451530
and just had a great time . 451581_453111
but she hadta be back before midnight because everything would go back to pumpkins and mice and everything would disappear except for the glass slipper . 453910_461580
so ‡ <she runs out_of the> [//] &-um she runs out and loses her glass slipper . 461633_466943
and so the prince decides he's gonna try find her by going through the land and taking the glass slipper around . 467375_472415
and &-um trying it on everybody . 472438_474388
and they lock Cinderella up in the tower because the stepmother doesn't want her to try on the slipper in case it fits . 474406_480146
she tries to get the [//] her daughters to cram their feet in it but it doesn't fit . 480165_483505
and their little friends get her out_of the tower . 483526_486006
she comes down . 486573_487223
tries on the slipper . 487241_488051
and it fits . 488071_488661
and then she marries Prince_Charming and lives happily ever after &=laughs . 488736_492056
&-um there was a cat that went up the tree and got stuck .
and the little girl wanted her father to get the cat out .
so ‡ he got the ladder out and climbed up the tree to get the cat .
and then the ladder fell down .
so ‡ he's stuck in the tree .
the cat's stuck in the tree .
and the dog's barking below them .
so ‡ they hadta call the fire department who's coming with a ladder so they can get the cat and the man both out_of the tree .
