oh okay . [+ exc] 1328_2088
first you take two pieces of bread . 2260_4330
and you get out the peanut butter and a knife . 4803_7323
and you smear the peanut butter on one side of the bread . 7345_9795
and then you get out the jelly and a knife . 9841_12141
and smear the jelly on the other side of the bread . 12161_15261
then you take the &=ges
and that's your sandwich . 18033_19753
&-um you dig a hole in the soil . 22975_26535
and then you take the flower out_of its pot . 26556_29226
and you hafta loosen the roots . 29248_30788
and if you want you can put Miracle_Grow &=laughs underneath . 30805_34705
I love gardening . 34785_36535
and you put the flower in the hole . 36613_39283
and then you fill it back up with dirt . 39300_41310
and then you water it . 41333_42543
it is the little boy's birthday . 44446_47776
he's having his birthday party today . 47793_49553
but the dog found the cake . 49573_52653
and ate a big chunk out_of the cake . 52840_54560
and left caky doggie footprints &=laughs all the way under the couch . 54575_59905
the mother is ma
she's got the broom . 62320_63350
I think she's gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why it's hiding . 63365_67615
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived . 67638_71748
so ‡ they are coming in with their presents &-um seeing a [/] a mangled cake for the birthday . 71818_78278
oh ‡ and it looks like the little boy is crying . 78330_81140
&-um okay ‡ so ‡ I was hospitalized well sort_of &-um in November for abdominal surgery . 82306_93006
and &-um I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before . 93028_101588
but it kicked in really fast . 101605_103475
&-like they tell you to take three deep breaths . 103613_105923
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out . 106013_108393
&-um and it was kind_of like taking a long blink . 108470_112420
and then I opened my eyes . 112441_113681
and it was like three hours later . 113700_115290
which was really strange because usually &-like you_know when you sleep you can feel time passing . 115680_120840
&-like it didn't feel like any time had passed . 120860_122690
so ‡ it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that you_know three hours had gone by . 122711_128390
everything was all over with . 128411_129701
&-um and then I was on pain meds [
I stayed overnight . 134438_135738
&-um and then I went home . 135911_139161
I was on pain meds [
&-um but then I [/] I was able to go off of those . 142223_145333
&-um I'm not sure what else you wanna know about it &=laughs . 145356_152346
&-um no not off hand . 153968_157608
&-um okay ‡ so ‡ I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator . 157655_163805
&-um she would hold things in . 163828_166828
and you_know you could just feel the energy that she was upset . 166845_171095
but &-um she wouldn't talk about it . 171113_173933
I asked her on numerous occasions to [//] you_know if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her . 173953_180043
"she always said +""/. 180621_181051"
"+"" no . 181186_181856"
&-um and then &-um she kind_of passively aggressively started you_know not participating in things or you_know just kind_of being rude „ I guess &=laughs . 181903_196553
so ‡ it finally you_know broke my last little straw . 197510_201280
and I yelled at her one day . 201300_203220
and kicked her out_of the group . 203270_204900
so ‡ &=laughs that's what I did about it &=laughs . 205065_209105
okay ‡ well ‡ I'm afraid of heights . 209675_211695
even little heights . 211793_213053
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder . 213186_215646
so ‡ I decided &-uh one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving &-um <you_know thing> [//] you_know jump [//] <I guess that's what you call it a jump> [//] for his birthday . 215670_227620
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too . 227636_230526
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights . 230548_232998
so ‡ we went sky diving . 233540_236590
and it was terrifying . 237115_238345
and <when I> [//] when we jumped out_of the plane you_know you're attached to someone else . 238390_243810
so ‡ when we jumped out_of the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute &=laughs while we were free falling because I was just &-like &=ges
&-um and then the parachute opens . 255495_258295
and then you start gliding which is kind o(f) nice . 258373_260413
<that was> [/] that was better . 260430_261721
it was a little bit more like being a bird you_know and flying . 261745_265445
&-um so ‡ that was nice for a little bit . 266041_267641
and then we landed . 267660_268490
and then that was that . 268508_269418
and I said I'm glad I did it . 269436_270506
and I'll never do it again &=laughs . 270530_272660
and I'm still afraid of heights &=laughs . 272680_274740
&-um so ‡ the story starts with the flood . 275576_280086
there's lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city . 280101_284611
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went <looking for her cat> [//] &-um to save her cat from the flood and the rains . 284660_295790
so ‡ she got caught in the flood . 295813_296763
she got swept downstream . 296781_298381
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out . 298403_302473
and she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her . 302493_306193
&-um someone saw her . 306353_308153
called the fire department . 308203_309553
and now the [/] the firemen are there . 309686_312536
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on . 312553_317383
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him <I think that's what that looks like> [//] &-uh to get her out_of the water . 317430_325360
and that's the end . [+ exc] 325380_329530
okay ‡ the boy is playing soccer outside . 330268_332998
he kicks the ball really hard . 333016_334586
it goes crashing into the window . 335116_336906
&-um it crashes through the window into the lamps [* m
&-um he jumps up . 343483_344833
he grabs the ball . 344853_345893
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it . 345916_348736
yep . [+ exc] 351848_352008
the boy is leaving for school . 352796_355716
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella . 355736_359376
it might rain . 359400_360080
"and he says +""/. 360101_360501"
&=head
"+"" I'll be fine . 362493_363093"
"+"" bye mom . 363203_363853"
so ‡ he leaves . 364356_365426
he goes outside . 365476_366376
and it's sprinkling a little bit . 366396_367936
and then it's r
and there's puddles all over . 370265_371565
and mom was right . 371668_373028
so ‡ he's running back home in the rain . 373178_375288
he comes home all sopping wet . 375340_377520
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face . 377761_380661
and he gets the umbrella . 380685_382815
and leaves again for school with the umbrella . 383086_386016
okay ‡ well ‡ the father his wife dies . 388440_391590
and he is left in the care of his &-um single daughter . 391613_395803
and he remarries . 395821_396961
and he remarries &-um &-uh evil [//] but &+ee she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella . 397013_404353
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own . 404376_408096
and they live together . 408165_410135
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen . 410185_418145
and the dad is kind_of nowhere in this <part of the story> [=! laughs] &=laughs . 418906_423536
and then &-um there's [//] Cinderella [//] let's see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them . 423880_434160
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream . 434176_439536
so ‡ then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married . 440046_446426
and he must have a ball to find his wife . 446441_448571
so ‡ they send out invitations to [//] around the town . 449091_453371
and the stepmother gets the invitation . 453421_455821
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince . 455845_460175
so ‡ they get ready . 460820_462290
Cinderella has the [/] the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress . 462308_466628
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them . 466651_469951
but her sister's say no she can't go . 469973_472593
she hasta stay and clean . 472666_474126
and they rip her dress . 474148_475248
she goes back up to her room crying while her <sisters and> [//] stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball . 475908_482098
&-um then the [//] &+fair her fairy godmother appears . 482816_485926
and says she will create (.) the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball . 486033_493533
but she has back by midnight or she'll turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin . 493556_500296
so [//] and she gets glass slippers . 500978_502688
so ‡ she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers . 503168_505188
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her . 505395_508755
and her stepmother and the sisters don't know who she is because she looks so different . 508773_514143
and then it gets to be midnight . 514164_516254
"and she says +""/. 516476_516916"
"+"" oh ‡ I needta go home . 517265_518515"
so ‡ she runs away from the prince . 518635_520135
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs . 520265_523615
and she runs home . 523668_525428
and the [//] her dress turns back to rags . 525443_528973
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin . 529066_530626
but she still has her glass slipper . 530645_532225
then the next day the prince sends out &-um someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was . 532275_547675
so ‡ they show up with the slipper at her house . 548108_550548
and the stepmother <locks her in the room> [//] locks Cinderella in the room . 550665_554145
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsister's feet which it doesn't fit because they have big feet . 554165_560255
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room . 560300_566630
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper . 566651_570191
and lo_and_behold it fits . 570243_571813
so ‡ they bring her back to the prince . 572210_574990
and they get married . 575045_576275
and they live happily ever after . 576291_577851
&-um the little girl's pet cat is stuck up in the tree .
she's gotten off her tricycle and is concerned .
jumping up and down trying to get the cat to come down .
the father decides to help .
so ‡ he gets the ladder .
climbs up the tree .
and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down .
and the dog is barking at him .
and is probably going to bite him when he comes down .
&-um but in the meantime the fire department is coming .
they're on their way with the ladder to come save both the man and the cat .
