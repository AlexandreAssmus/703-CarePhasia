if I &=points
&-uh I like &-uh peanut butter butter an(d) jelly on white bread .
so ‡ two pieces of white bread .
an(d) then &-uh you put a layer of peanut butter on one slice of bread .
and you put a layer of butter on the &=laughs other slice .
and then you open up the jelly .
put <a slice> [//] a layer of jelly on that slice .
an(d) then you <fold or> [//] put the two slices together .
an(d) then if I'm really hungry I put a second layer an(d) make it a double-decker .
&-uh it's little Jonathan's seventh birthday an(d) he's having a birthday party .
he's invited his friends and his friends' parents over &-um for [//] to open presents and have cake .
and &-um right before everyone is sposta arrive .
&-um the dog smells the delicious cake on the table .
an(d) jumps up on the table .
starts to eat the cake . 68901_70171
an(d) little &+th Jonathan comes in an(d) finds the dog (.) &-um eating the cake .
an(d) begins to cry .
an(d) the mom gets &-uh really angry an(d) grabs a broom to punish the dog .
an(d) the dog sees the mom with the broom .
gets scared runs under the couch .
trailing icing on the carpet after him .
and for all the &+sc screaming and crying going on the [/] the birthday guests arrive at the door .
an(d) they open the door to see what's going on .
an(d) they come in living room .
an(d) they see an angry mom an(d) little Jonathan crying an(d) cake everywhere .
an(d) they wonder if there's still gonna be a party or not .
you'll probably laugh (be)cause &-uh this is kind_of a unique story .
&-um I [/] &-uh I once &+st owned &-uh two black-tailed prairie dogs .
and we [//] &-uh some friends of ours liked &-uh our prairie dogs so much that two &=hand
so ‡ we had &=hand
an(d) then one o(f) them was going out_of the country and needed us to watch their [/] &+dum their prairie dogs .
an(d) so &-um (.) we did . 144940_145010
and &-uh one of them was a male . 147033_147083
an(d) he was a_little aggressive . 167703_167713
an(d) he didn't like me very much .
and &-uh so I was trying to &=hand
&-uh &=hand
and &-uh so I was trying to pet him .
an(d) I was rubbing his chin &=hand
an(d) he was getting all &=hands
an(d) I really didn't read the warning sign very much .
an(d) he bit me . 167713_167803
and took out a good chunk of my &=shows
so [/] &-uh so ‡ I'm actually home &-um alone . 174045_175975
an(d) I &=looks
an(d) I can see &=shows
it's pretty good bite . 180236_180656
"and &-uh I realize well +""/. 182516_182716"
"+"" <I should probably not> [//] &-um I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it ."
an(d) I [/] I don't always do well with the sight of my own blood .
&-like I have no &=hands
but I got &=ges
"an(d) then like +""/."
"+"" oh_boy what do I do ? 196933_197013"
so ‡ <ironically or> [//] &=hand
so ‡ I hadta wrap &=hand
and interrupt &=points her class . 210146_210386
and [//] &=laughs to get her &=hand
and &-uh so I was standing there when she &=hand
you_know ‡ I'm standing there . 222000_222040
"I'm like +""/."
"+"" &-um the prairie dog bit me ."
"+"" can you drive me to the urgent care ?"
"an(d) she's like +""/. 225070_225120"
"+"" okay . 225465_225515"
so ‡ she hasta &=ges
an(d) then I get to urgent care for stitches .
an(d) prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona .
&-um &+w I had bought it in Texas .
and you can also buy them in Washington state .
&+ah but they're [/] they're considered restricted wildlife here .
an(d) so I hadta completely lie about the entire +//.
(be)cause they ask you how you got the bite an(d) was it an animal an(d) whatever .
and I hadta &=hand
they probably would have come an(d) taken the prairie dogs away .
so ‡ &=laughs all_(of)_a_sudden it became a [//] &-uh &-um like I think I said a [/] a ferret . 264946_265056
(be)cause you're allowed to have ferrets here .
a ferret bite &=laughs .
anyway &=shrugs &=laughs that's my experience .
&-um &-uh my grandmother who's almost eighty is in a nursing home .
and &-uh she's slowly been losing her mental &=points
an(d) I'm actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama .
and &-um so every time I visit her I'm never quite sure what mental state she'll be in whether she recognizes me .
she [/] &-uh <she usually> [//] she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year .
and &-uh those people that she doesn't &=hand
so ‡ usually [//] &+i sometimes I'm me her grandson .
but other times I'm other grandsons who see her more often .
and &-um so [/] &-uh &-um so <you just hafta sort_of> [//] &-uh it's easier to just sorta [
an(d) <get her> [//] you_know sort_of &-uh force &=laughs her to realize who you really are .
&-um <so you're> [//] so you just sort_of play along .
an(d) you basically just ask her how she's doing .
an(d) she kind_of &-um makes stuff up or doesn't make a_lot_of sense .
&-um although I_mean &+h <you can under> [//] <you can> [//] she [//] &=hand
an(d) you can understand what she's saying .
it's just that the [//] it's not coherent sometimes .
an(d) so you just kind_of hafta &-um (.) take it as it goes an(d) stay for about ten fifteen minutes .
an(d) then [/] then you leave .
an(d) it's kind_of sad . 345916_345986
but I think she at_least is somewhat happy to have a visitor .
so ‡ there's some solace in that .
&-um this is when &-uh my parents were still married .
an(d) <we were> [//] I was a little &=hand
I was probably like (.) &=exhales seven .
and &-uh we we're all camping at a lake in [//] north of Dallas .

an(d) a really bad storm came .
we were camping &=hand

and &-uh <blew the tent> [//] started to blow the tent &=hand
off its +/. 390006_390116
and &-uh actually started rolling all the way .
so ‡ we were all in the tent .
and it was &-like rolling &=hands
an(d) as it broke &=hands

&=laughs and [/] an(d) my mom's screaming . 402521_402621
an(d) my dad's freaking out .
an(d) &=ges
&-um I probably would have handled it different now as an adult .

an(d) my dad was able &=hand

an(d) [/] an(d) it was just a really bad camping experience .
an(d) luckily I [//] we kept going an(d) I had better experiences so I'm not afraid o(f) camping anymore .
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid .
&-um <I'm going to (.) assume> [//] I'll [/] I'll say <this is> [//] &-uh this takes place in Arizona .
and unfortunately [//] I_mean it was in monsoon season .
an(d) &-um there was a huge storm .
and caused &-uh what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent .
and &-um this poor woman decided that &-uh while she had gone that way home every day .

an(d) started to tumble the car .
an(d) she managed to get her window down .

an(d) she got swept off the top of her car .
an(d) it was floating downstream .
an(d) they were able to &-uh shimmy out on a [/] a limb .
an(d) she was able to get close enough to (h)im .

an(d) she was okay . 546236_546306
