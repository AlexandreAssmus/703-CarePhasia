yeah ‡ well ‡ get your slice of bread whether wheat or white . 903_3713
&-uh what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first . 4395_7105

<take it out_o(f) > [//] &-uh open up the jar . 7870_9560

&-uh and then I open up a

&-uh put that on the other slice of bread . 22819_24769
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter . 25053_27403
spread it over the bread . 27490_28630
and put the two slices together . 28737_30457
a little girl was &-uh (.) riding through the neighborhood on her bike . 32232_37913
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree . 38541_41181
&-uh (..) &-uh her father came along . 42180_46850
"and said +""/. 46870_47080"

"+"" Dad ‡ my cat's in the tree . 48610_49580"
"+"" well ‡ I can get the cat out . 49670_50580"
"+"" let me go get my ladder . 50710_51630"
father &=sniffles went and got the ladder . 52497_54077
climbed up the tree . 54130_55240
and then a neighborhood dog came by . 55454_57314
and noticed a man up in a tree . 57330_58850
and started barking at the man up the tree . 58940_60900
and accidentally knocked down the ladder . 60923_62463
so ‡ the man was stuck in the ladder along &=laughs with the cat . 62849_65519
and the fire department hadta be called to &-uh rescue them both . 66052_69202
&-uh it was <about I guess> [//] about seven years ago I really hurt my back . 70373_74283
there's this family that I go and visit that has a little child . 74520_78260
and from the time that child was born as a little boy &-uh I always picked him up and swung him around . 78774_85184
&-uh but <as this boy was getting older> [//] as I was getting older <I [/] I guess> [//] I can't do some of the things that [/] that &-uh I &+n normally do . 85840_96010
&-uh this particular &-uh time I picked the boy up . 96518_99928
and I was swingin(g) him around . 99973_101743
&+m &+b swingin(g) [//] pickin(g) him up by the arms . 102311_104381
and I spread my legs wide open . 104524_106594
and I was swinging him &-uh backwards and forwards . 106648_108948
and I felt something snap in my back . 109333_111633
&-uh I was in excruciating pain . 112687_114657
I almost dropped the kid &=laughs . 114679_115819
&-uh I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids . 117022_124032
but this was pain like I have never felt before . 124088_127188
because even just to walk or [/] or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms it's all tied into the back . 127238_137288
it would be like a knife was twisting so . 137440_139770
that's [/] that's the injury . 140778_141678
and it put me out_o(f) commission for a couple o(f) weeks . 141700_143700
&-uh and &-uh the thing that comes <to the> [/] to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating wit(h) someone else . 147277_154097
&-uh it's the family that I described earlier with a child . 154703_157783
they're Hispanic . 157800_158670
and their English is not very good . 158839_161249
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school . 161294_165444
&-uh but whenever &-uh oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want +... 165929_172829
I help them with their homework . 172844_174194
my wife she speaks Spanish . 174209_175589
so ‡ it's alright when she goes over there . 175606_177196
but when it comes to me trying to convey my thoughts . 177735_180735
&-uh and &-uh trying to convey my wants and desires . 180791_184501
and also me trying to listen to theirs . 184555_186625
I don't always understand what they're talking about . 187039_190449
or [//] <and then> [//] and they don't understand what I'm talkin(g) about . 190970_193170
yeah ‡ in high school <a friend of mine> [//] myself and a friend of mine we ditched &-uh class so_that we could climb Camelback_Mountain . 195441_201921
neither one of us had ever climbed Camelback_Mountain . 202297_204537
so ‡ we didn't realize exactly you_know where to go or where to start . 204637_208567
&-uh we just picked a spot on the &-uh northern side of the mountain . 209519_214279
you_know ‡ walked in between some of those &-uh very expensive homes . 215125_219425
and started climbing . 219495_220615
little did we know &-uh we really had gotten ourselves in [/] in a_lot_of trouble doing that . 221316_227546
&-uh there were times where we were actually &+ch hanging onto cliffs or tryin(g) to c(l)imb up cliffs you_know &-uh &-uh <just to> [/] just to get from one point to another . 227563_239113
&-uh about halfway up &-uh we're sittin(g) on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot . 239580_246240
"and &-uh I said to him I says +""/. 246833_248693"
"+"" man there's no way we can go back the same way we came . 248828_251118"
"and he says +""/. 251658_251938"
"+"" I know . 252290_252490"

"he goes +""/. 253456_253576"
"+"" so am I ! 253767_254477"
and so <we knew the only way> [//] <the only thing> [//] we [/] we figured what we hadta do is &-uh make it to the top . 254948_260017
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side . 260072_263042
but then we would still hafta hike all &=laughs the way back around the mountain to get to our car . 263540_267200
&-uh (.) to make a long story short . 267254_271214
&-uh you_know ‡ we were all scuffed [/] &+k scuffed up . 271381_273471
we were tired scratched up &+chlor clothes torn . 273522_276782
&-uh but &-uh we could finally see we were kind_of getting to the top . 277842_280992
as we were approaching the top we saw more people &-uh up there . 281159_284639
and &-uh older people younger people . 285425_288375
&+a we couldn't believe it that you_know <these people> [//] all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time . 288722_294742
"so ‡ when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we [/] &+sa we asked them +""/. 295372_299172"
"+"" how'd you get up here ? 299358_300268"
"they said +""/. 300574_300704"
"+"" oh ‡ we took this trail you_know down here on the other side . 300910_303550"
&+a and &=laughs we couldn't believe that there was a trail . 303649_306609
&=laughs so ‡ &-uh &-uh after that experience &-uh you_know I thank God for helpin(g) us through it . 307188_313538
&-uh because it [/] &-uh <it really> [/] it really made me understand why people hadta be rescued from Camelback_Mountain . 313987_320177
and I understand how people can get stuck . 320200_322240
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges . 322488_325768
but prior to that experience &-uh I [/] I [/] I couldn't understand how could people &+n get to a certain place and not get back down the same way . 325815_333645
&-uh a couple decided they would go &-uh white water rafting . 338379_344539
&-uh (.) and so (.) &-uh they were white water rafting . 345200_351830
the man told his girlfriend to put on her vest . 351853_355503
"and she said +""/. 355623_355913"
"+"" I can swim . 356246_356716"

"and he goes +""/. 358000_358210"
"+"" well ‡ I'm gonna put mine on because I think that's just a safe thing to do . 358431_361561"
so ‡ as they're white water rafting the further down they got the rougher the water &-uh became . 362140_367510
and &-uh as [/] &-uh as they continued to go down &-uh the water got so rough that <her life vest> [/] &-uh &-uh her life vest fell out_of the boat . 368073_381283
and seconds later the boat tipped over . 382070_384550
so ‡ both of them are [/] are [/] are [/] &-uh are in the water <with the rapids> [//] <in the> [/] in the rapids hitting rocks &-uh with the heavy flow of the stream goin(g) [/] going by them . 384603_397723
fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to [/] to stay afloat &-uh &+a and last long enough to [/] to float to the edge and grab a branch . 398075_408575
his &-uh girlfriend was coming quickly behind him . 409174_411954
and as he's hanging onto the branch he's reaching for her . 412033_415003
&-uh early one morning &-uh &+s it's time for little Johnny to go to school . 416806_422706
little Johnny's about to walk out the door . 422723_424893

"and says +""/. 426371_426691"
"+"" Johnny &-uh you better take this umbrella with you because I heard the forecast . 426896_430986"

at first a little bit and then harder and harder . 448126_450576
and as Johnny is walking he's putting his hands over his head trying to stop all the wetness from falling &-uh on his face . 451029_458269
and he's hating himself <for not having to> [/] &+n for not having &-uh to get that umbrella . 458675_463985
so ‡ <he races back home &-uh you_know> [//] he races back home . 464390_469570

so ‡ Johnny took the umbrella . 482805_484655

he was outside in his front yard one day just practicing kicking the ball . 501626_505556
&-uh he kicked it so hard boom@o ! 506571_508581
it went right through his neighbor's window . 508630_510880

knocked over a lamp close to where a man was sitting . 515101_519301
it startled the man . 519554_520764

there was once a girl called Cinderella . 530088_532298
