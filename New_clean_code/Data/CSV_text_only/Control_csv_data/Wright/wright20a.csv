okay ‡ there's a home &-um with a little boy and a very upset mother . 231080_241800
it looks like the little boy was going to have a birthday party . 241850_246370
and (.) the mother had placed the birthday cake on a table . 246393_251073
and the family dog had come in . 251241_254921
and gotten into the cake . 254971_256690
eaten part of it . 256861_257880
and retreated under the couch because the mother caught him in the act and was chasing him with a broom . 258043_267883
so ‡ he's under the couch . 267933_270293
the mother's very upset . 270338_272128
the little boy is crying . 272146_273606
and the guest are starting to arrive . 273653_276213
&-um there's &-um another woman with probably her son bearing a gift . 276230_283700
and then another mother coming with a daughter with a gift . 283750_287240
and they're just standing in the doorway &-um watching what is going on .
I take two pieces of bread from the loaf of bread . 292786_299876
put it on a plate . 299923_301603
I open the peanut butter . 301618_304908
and get a knife . 306253_308503
and spread the peanut butter on the bread . 308733_310973
I would put the two pieces of bread together . 311020_316110
and cut them in two . 317220_317860
and I have a peanut butter sandwich . 318291_320141
okay ‡ the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago . 1282770_1290580
I had vertigo . 1290641_1292461
extreme vertigo . 1292511_1294721
and I was working at the time . 1295533_1296763
&-um I couldn't walk without bumping into things . 1296895_1303365
&-um I was afraid to drive . 1303901_1306631
and I went through all this testing . 1306950_1309170
I was never hospitalized . 1309415_1311345
but I hadta take six weeks off from work . 1311365_1313625
I never miss work . 1314085_1315715
and I've never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me . 1316243_1320433
&-um I did cat [
and they could never find any reason for it . 1332336_1336176
&-um all the blood work was fine . 1336348_1339658
&-um it's very frustrating because they don't know how to treat it or what to do . 1340011_1345251
you just hafta wait it out . 1345336_1347256
so ‡ I &-um stayed at home . 1347935_1350825
&-uh went through all the testing . 1350840_1353120
went to the doctor's . 1353170_1354760
&-um finally decided to go to a chiropractor . 1354976_1359616
and my doctor agreed that was fine . 1359733_1362753
so ‡ I went for massage therapy and &-uh muscle and nerve stimulant . 1362801_1370811
and that helped . 1372490_1373150
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck . 1375310_1378210
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium . 1381336_1385446
now that's not proven . 1385465_1387595
my regular doctor of_course doesn't go <along with it> [=! laughs] . 1387656_1391776
my chiropractor thinks that's the answer [=! laughs] . 1391796_1394536
but it was just a terrible ordeal . 1394585_1397175
and &-um I've not had it return . 1397541_1400041
&-um just a little bit once in awhile . 1400356_1403286
but I find that when my back is out_of alignment and my discs are compressed that it kind_of slows down your [/] your functioning . 1403360_1412480
so ‡ anyway that was the worse thing I've probably experienced . 1412503_1416793
&-um somewhat yes . 1427830_1429240
well ‡ my husband &-um has been treated for lung cancer . 1436385_1443845
and he had extreme &-um hard core treatment . 1444950_1449090
he had chemotherapy and radiation . 1449255_1452535
and he had brain radiation . 1453346_1454636
&-uh they do that to &-uh ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain . 1454655_1462225
but in the process of doing this my husband's been on a_lot_of medications . 1462271_1467361
and he's a very bright man and very articulate . 1467970_1472080
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow . 1472095_1478415
his thought process was very unlike him . 1478511_1483161
he just didn't process well at all . 1483215_1486065
so ‡ you hafta be very patient . 1486480_1488820
hafta listen . 1488835_1490595
hafta try not to lose your temper . 1490680_1493660
try not to be argumentative . 1493726_1496456
&-um tried my patience as much as it's ever been tried . 1496865_1500415
&-um just kind_of wait [/] wait it out . 1500645_1503205
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self . 1503593_1510333
and &-um you work back into it from there . 1512181_1513731
&-um he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment . 1514671_1519581
but it [//] his
and &-uh the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me &=laughs . 1523183_1532593
&-um it's just a matter of speaking distinctly . 1532773_1538453
I hadta repeat my [//] myself . 1538470_1540130
I hadta make decisions for him . 1540846_1543036
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it . 1543395_1550185
so ‡ we did work through that . 1550270_1552250
actually ‡ it went pretty well . 1552406_1553716
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be . 1554403_1556783
and &=head
&=head
I do not wanna be a <care giver> [=! laughs] . 1561758_1564588
but you work through it . 1564766_1565806
you do what you hafta do &=laughs . 1566001_1570221
(..) oh yes . 1576328_1582308
&-hm let's see . 1582581_1584211
&-um I guess the most frightening time would be &-um I lived in Colorado . 1589135_1599795
and I worked for the telephone company . 1600236_1602926
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley . 1603330_1606300
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down . 1607835_1612875
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities . 1612990_1617920
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne . 1617968_1622018
that [//] once they closed my office I commuted first to Fort Collins . 1622063_1625903
we closed that office . 1625926_1627166
Boulder we closed that office . 1627446_1629116
and then I went to Cheyenne . 1629260_1631260
and that's about &-um just under a seventy mile trip . 1632973_1636323
and it's on i@l twenty five . 1637226_1638066
it was winter time . 1638083_1639533
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible . 1640658_1644548
&-um I was on the road and a storm came up . 1644713_1648503
I slid off the road . 1648548_1650838
ditched my car . 1650890_1651890
and I hadta call for help to come and get me . 1653106_1656106
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up &-um transmission . 1656503_1664483
so ‡ I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley . 1664500_1668140
and he came with a tow truck and got me out . 1670433_1671853
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there . 1671868_1675828
and it's very frightening (be)cause you're not really sure what's going to happen &=laughs . 1676691_1680431
but he did get me . 1680483_1682243
we got back to town . 1682296_1683696
they got my car back . 1683720_1684990
and &-um I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne . 1685406_1691746
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over &=laughs . 1691766_1699096
okay ‡ I'm not real sure . [+ exc] 1702923_1707333
is that ice ? [+ exc] 1708451_1709581
it looks to me like there's water with ice on it . 1710360_1715930
and a young girl has fallen through the ice . 1716925_1720685
and she's unable to get out . 1720920_1723090
and there's a rescue person probably a firemen &-um that is holding onto &-um a stick or an overhang of some kind . 1724351_1736921
and he has on a life jacket . 1737311_1739121
and he is going out to rescue her . 1739316_1741736
and it looks like he is very close to getting her . 1742846_1745176
&-um and it looks to me like he's within reach of [/] of grabbing her out_of the water . 1745301_1757141
very scary . [+ exc] 1757301_1759931
there's a young boy playing with a soccer ball . 1765770_1773400
and he kicks it . 1774496_1774686
it goes through a window . 1774956_1777276
breaks the window . 1777581_1779341
goes inside a house . 1779513_1782343
knocks a lamp over . 1782360_1784800
and there's a man sitting in a chair by the lamp . 1786123_1789193
he gets out_of the chair . 1789256_1792306
retrieves the ball . 1792323_1794343
goes to look out the broken window . 1794388_1798398
but I don't think he finds the young man who kicked the ball . 1798416_1803306
he's just standing there looking out the window wondering where the ball came from . 1803351_1808881
there's a mother with an umbrella . 1814066_1818336
and her son with his backpack going to school . 1819650_1822310
&-um he is trying to leave . 1824520_1826300
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella to take . 1826946_1829356
but he doesn't want it . 1829478_1830708
so ‡ he waves goodbye . 1830758_1832418
goes off without the umbrella . 1832546_1834406
gets outside and it starts to rain . 1834428_1836018
and it starts to rain really hard . 1838816_1840236
it's coming down . 1840260_1841470
and he's getting quite wet . 1842193_1843233
so ‡ he turns back . 1843373_1845523
goes home . 1845545_1846305
and he appears to be quite soaked . 1848173_1848633
his mother is scolding him . 1848656_1851696
he then evidently leaves with the umbrella . 1851716_1856246
and walks to school in the rain with the umbrella . 1856693_1860113
mother does know best . 1860176_1862396
www .
okay ‡ &-um Cinderella lives with her father . 1866165_1870985
and her mother had died . 1871586_1872586
and her father decides to remarry . 1873568_1875118
so ‡ his wife and her two daughters come to the house to live with them . 1875718_1882428
and <the mother> [//] the stepmother of Cinderella is very mean to Cinderella . 1883948_1890048
and the stepsisters are very mean to her also . 1890910_1892910
and the father is away . 1896641_1896871
he really doesn't know this is going on . 1896895_1897865
but Cinderella hasta clean the house and feed the animals . 1899488_1905358
and she becomes more of a chambermaid than a daughter while the stepsisters are pampered and get lots of nice clothes . 1905490_1912980
&-um Cinderella makes friends with all the animals in the yard . 1913475_1918975
and she longs to be part of the family and to be happy again . 1919701_1925321
she's looking out the window one day . 1925440_1928430
and there's the castle where the [/] <the beautiful> [//] the handsome prince lives .
and she daydreams about being pretty and meeting the prince someday . 1936043_1939353
well ‡ the prince is in the castle . 1939376_1939716
and his father says it's time for him to marry . 1942951_1944591
he needs to take a wife . 1945231_1947081
and in order to find a nice young wife for him they're going to have a ball and invite all the [/] the eligible ladies from the kingdom to come to the ball . 1947393_1958543
so ‡ they send out invitations . 1958560_1960860
and an invitation goes to Cinderella's house . 1961145_1963625
but the wicked stepmother gets it . 1964550_1967130
and she reads it . 1967593_1969603
and the daughters of_course are going to go . 1970886_1972616
and Cinderella thinks she should get to go also . 1974410_1975980
so ‡ the stepsisters <get all the> [//] get these beautiful gowns and get prepared to go to the dance . 1976031_1984701
and Cinderella goes to the chest where her mother had her things . 1984873_1989283
and she gets herself a dress ready to go . 1990023_1992383
and is going to go to the ball along with the stepsisters . 1993353_1996423
well ‡ they get ready to go . 1996915_1998635
and the stepsisters tear her gown . 2000815_2002535
and they're very mean to her . 2003246_2004816
and they tell her she can not go . 2006510_2006990
so ‡ she hasta stay home and clean the house . 2007040_2011040
and <the mother> [//] the stepmother takes off with her daughters to the ball . 2011906_2015646
well ‡ Cinderella is crying . 2015695_2018665
and her fairy godmother appears and wants to know what's wrong . 2021323_2024943
so ‡ Cinderella tells her she wants to go to the ball . 2024960_2027950
"and the fairy godmother says +""/. 2030030_2031450"
"+"" I will grant your wish . 2031871_2034781"
and she gives Cinderella this beautiful gown with some beautiful slippers . 2035491_2042121
and turns a pumpkin into a coach . 2043903_2045233
and the mice into beautiful horses . 2046400_2048380
and she sends Cinderella to the ball . 2049495_2050485
"but she cautions +""/. 2050635_2051605"
"+"" you must be home before midnight because if you aren't the magic will go away . 2052429_2057489"
"+"" and the coach will become a pumpkin . 2057991_2059650"
"+"" and the horses will become mice again . 2060487_2063438"
"+"" don't forget to be home by midnight . 2064005_2065935"
so ‡ Cinderella goes to the ball . 2066100_2068300
and she is the most beautiful girl at the ball . 2068530_2072139
and she dances all night with the the prince . 2072431_2074380
and he is very taken with her . 2075271_2077451
and they are dancing . 2078206_2079036
and all_of_a_sudden she sees that it's going to be midnight . 2079250_2082969
and she runs away from the prince down the stairway . 2083344_2086514
and she loses one of her glass slippers . 2086926_2089126
she gets to the coach . 2089176_2091466
and they barely get back home before the magic goes away . 2092178_2095558
and she returns to her life cleaning the house . 2095748_2100728
and the wicked stepsisters and the mother come home . 2101686_2104846
and they're very distraught about this beautiful girl that was at the [/] the ball but she disappeared .
well ‡ a notice goes out to the kingdom that they have a slipper that they wanna fit to the beautiful girl who left the ball . 2110616_2120926
and the prince visits all of these women and tries the slipper on all of these women . 2123060_2130100
nobody can fit into this beautiful glass slipper . 2130281_2133141
he comes to the house of Cinderella . 2133345_2135425
well ‡ the stepsisters of_course wanna try on the slipper . 2135448_2138858
well ‡ it wont fit either one of them . 2138873_2140973
and the prince asks if there is anyone else in the house . 2141550_2145700
and they don't want Cinderella to come out forth . 2145811_2149501
but she does . 2150371_2150501
and she tries on the slipper . 2151261_2152371
and it fits . 2153053_2153493
and she turns into this beautiful princess again . 2153971_2157791
and the prince marries her . 2158818_2159248
and they go away and live happily ever after . 2159583_2162093
