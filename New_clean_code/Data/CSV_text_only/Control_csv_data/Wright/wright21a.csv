well ‡ in about <I think it was> [//] two thousand and one I became ill with a fairly serious strain of viral something . 630_14930
they couldn't really tell me . 14945_16295
but it was highly contagious . 16311_18141
I hadta stay out_of work for a week . 18256_20476
&-um kind_of isolated . 20848_22058
I was allowed to stay home . 22170_23580
I wasn't hospitalized per_se except for the initial &-um diagnosis in the e_r because I had spiked a hundred and four temperature and was having difficulty seeing . 23595_34145
&-um the one e_r doctor that came and saw me thought I might have meningitis . 34191_40631
but then his superior came and said it wasn't meningitis . 40650_43500
it was just a really bad viral infection . 43523_45673
so ‡ I was laid up in bed . 46223_48523
&-um and what happened throughout each day and evening varied anything from spiking temperature to chills and hot flashes . 48800_59090
&-um there was some vomiting of_course . 59206_61586
&-um a_lot_of nausea . 61633_64393
my husband was great . 64447_66988
he [/] &-um he wasn't my husband at the time . 67010_70440
we were living together . 70455_71515
but he made chicken soup for me and [/] and did you_know the clear liquids and [/] and apple juice and things like that and made sure that I was eating . 71573_81953
it was kind_of frightening actually (be)cause I didn't know what was actually happening . 81976_86126
a viral infection doesn't really describe much . 86146_89206
but &-um I came through it okay . 89758_92008
I was really weak . 92028_92948
I would say that after that week had passed it took me couple months really to feel like my old self again . 92965_100965
&-um but I was okay &=laughs obviously . 100983_105673
I'm okay . 105905_106355
that's it . 108410_110070
sure &=laughs . 112055_112395
what I specifically did about it ? 123388_127528
(..) oh_my_gosh ‡ I am trying to remember a specific incident . 127918_139878
&-um (..) holy_moly ‡ I can't think of anything right offhand . 139926_151796
I know I have been in those situations before . 151980_154700
of_course ‡ I witnessed . 154843_156143
it's not always me that solves the problem . 156178_159158
<let me think> [/] let me think . 159178_161648
well ‡ yeah ‡ that has happened . 167825_171585
on the phone usually . 171635_173595
&-um just because_of cultural differences too . 174148_180308
okay [>] . 182088_182318
&-um well ‡ in the couple instances that I remember I hadta just keep repeating myself . 184248_199368
&-um I would try to slow down my words . 199428_202788
speak clearly . 202805_203955
try to find related words to what I was saying if they didn't understand exactly what I was saying . 204298_209968
and ask them leading questions to see if they understood what I was &-um asking of them or trying to explain to them . 210068_219888
&-um and I believe resolution came about . 219936_223646
from what I recall it sounds like it . 223665_226005
again I can't remember a specific instance with who I spoke to and what we spoke about . 226273_232643
but in those cases you_know the couple +... 232658_242988
<I remember you_know> [//] some time ago &=laughs it worked out okay ‡ I guess . 243060_244660
no . 244708_245218
oh ‡ yeah &=laughs . 254186_254666
oh ‡ &-hm ‡ so many to choose from . 258964_264855
she says trying to remember . 264878_269248
&-um okay ‡ frightened or scared . 269481_274781
&-um (...) well ‡ there was a time I was actually afraid for someone else . 286270_304520
&-um my husband and I when we first started dating he was involved in a group &-um that did medieval reenactment . 304806_315686
and part of their &-um events and &-um group gatherings involved a [/] a large gathering where the people could take on personas of warriors . 315898_332468
and they would dress up in you_know armor and things like that . 332630_335430
and go out and hit each_other with sticks and stuff „ you_know . 335866_338406
no real swords or anything like that . 338430_340830
that's not legal . 340846_341526
but &-um you_know &+i like I said it was a reenactment . 341546_345276
and at one point <during &-um a battle> [//] at this particular battle he was &-um basically tackled by several members which isn't usual . 345293_358283
and when he fell he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor . 358340_363580
but they decided to step over (h)im . 363626_366346
and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids . 366405_370715
and it wrenched &=ges
they hadta call the paramedics &-um from a nearby &-um emergency center . 373325_380435
we were out on the outskirts of town out on the [/] the country side of Phoenix [//] west Phoenix . 380906_386656
and so the closest place was several miles away . 386863_390193
and they called the ambulance . 390238_391778
they came out put the neck brace on . 391800_393680
loaded him . 393698_394308
he was in a_lot_of pain . 394330_395910
I was freaking out . 396311_397291
I didn't know what was going on . 398006_399256
I heard things like convulsions . 399523_401653
I heard neck broken . 401953_403823
<I heard just> [//] it was craziness . 404208_406318
so ‡ they loaded him up on the ambulance . 406941_409811
I ran back &+f to my tent because I was out there camping with him . 410500_414260
grabbed my car keys and hopped in the [/] the car we had taken together . 414575_419785
and &-uh met him in the emergency room . 419835_422375
when I got there they had him in the x-ray taking x-rays of his neck . 422611_427331
it turns out he did not break his neck which was a great relief . 427350_431020
but &-um he was pretty badly bruised and banged up . 431041_435181
he had severe &=ges
I was very grateful that it wasn't worse than it was . 444825_447985
but that time in_between you_know what happened and finding out from the doctors was +... 448000_455260
I [//] yeah I was off the charts . 455645_457295
