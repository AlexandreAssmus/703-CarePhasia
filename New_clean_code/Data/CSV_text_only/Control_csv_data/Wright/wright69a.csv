&=lips_smack (.) well ‡ at our house we take the bread out_of the freezer &=laughs &=inhales . 4630_7640
and toast the bread . 9160_10890
and then &-um put about (.) a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter . 12103_18303
the chunky kind . 18321_19571
on (.) the peanut butter (.) sandwich &=lips_smack . 19870_21790
on one side . 22430_23190
then on the other side &=ges
(.) and smooth it clear across &=hand
&=inhales and then we smack &=hand
the two pieces of bread . 38808_39948
cut it in half . 40770_41880
and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts . 42490_45480
but if we're gonna eat it we eat it with the crust . 46020_48270
(.) that's about how to make a peanut butter sandwich . 49350_51130
(.) the dog and the cat were fighting . 51970_53440
(.) and the cat climbed up the tree . 54420_56010
(.) and the do
&=inhales and the little girl happened upon the scene . 61860_64319
and realized (.) that the cat was in the tree and she's &+f gonna need her dad . 64896_68286
so ‡ she got her dad . 68770_69680
(.) and her dad got the ladder . 69700_72100
and they were trying to get (.) the cat out_o(f) the tree . 72710_76150
(.) but the ladder fell down . 77383_78753
(.) but just in the nick o(f) time (.) the firemen who were called by the neighbors (.) came . 79780_86130
(.) and helped &+th get the cat and the dad out_of the tree . 86670_89320
&=lips_smack [<] .
&=inhales well (..) yes I remember being hospitalized . 95780_101720
the most recent (.) one was (.) in New_York_City . 101740_106190
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt_Hospital . 107060_110340
&=inhales and &-um my right lung had filled up with (.) fluid . 111540_115870
and &-um so they kept me . 115920_117710
&=inhales &=sighs (.) I realized how important it is to have someone with you (.) when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked . 119040_131020
the towels were like sandpaper . 131808_134268
you were lucky to have a towel (.) if you were to take a bath or a shower . 135180_140840
(.) &-uh they didn't come . 141865_142915
so ‡ I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel . 142936_147116
&=inhales &-um I have veins that are very difficult to get blood . 148315_153205
"so ‡ I'd always say kiddingly to the people +""/. 154155_156305"
"+"" are ya really good at this ? 156446_157616"
(.) and one man named Joe_L told me . 158610_162060
&=laughs &=head
he'd [/] he'd shay [
"+"" I've &=head"
"&=inhales after about twenty pokes in my hand I said +""/. 166963_169783"
"+"" could you find someone else (.) to draw blood because we're not gettin(g) it done here . 169991_175671"
and &-um &=lips_smack (.) it was really all I &+ha could do to get better so I could get out_of the place . 176663_185493
because (.) it's too bad (.) that the staff is so overworked . 185973_191413
and prob(ab)ly underpaid . 191965_194615
and that facilities (.) &-um are having trouble today (.) &-uh getting the help that they need . 195455_204015
I could also tell &=laughs you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night . 205286_209736
(of)_course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things . 209790_212900
(.) and she couldn't find the bathroom . 214141_215731
so ‡ &=laughs she just used whatever facilities she could find . 215790_220710
"&=inhales and when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved (.) they just said +""/. 221380_226140"
"+"" well ‡ you'll pro(bab)ly hafta go on with a cancer patient that's dying . 226280_229220"
so ‡ (.) I was so unaccustomed (.) to hospitals . 230125_234655
"and I'm probably unaccustomed to (.) the treatment (.) there because (.) I'm going back to Iowa thinking +""/. 234878_244808"
and &-um I was sort_of on my own to try to figure out (.) how to get help and how to get out_of there . 248801_256271
(.) so ‡ that was my experience . 257274_259015
that's probably the worst experience I've ever had in a hospital . 259149_262790
&=inhales because everything else is always been won [//] done very well . 263203_266103
(.) it was crazy . 268173_268783
if you know Roosevelt Hospital ? 268800_270070
(.) and <it just felt> [//] <I did> [/] I did learn though . 271601_274711
when I was at Roosevelt_Hospital I was watching Jeopardy on television . 275296_278296
"and they ask +""/. 278856_279636"
"+"" &-um who was the first Supreme_Court justice ? 280340_284670"
(.) and I looked out the window . 285810_287330
(.) and I saw the school at Fordham_University . 288613_291873
and the first Supreme_Court justice was named for (.) the one that is named in that school as the law school . 292673_301863
(...) &=lips_smack &=exhales .
(...) .
(..) &=lips_smack I'm not sure if I was frightened or scared (.) in this situation . 345680_349970
but (.) I was frightened for my daughter . 351446_356006
in <September of> [//] &+ninet &-uh September two thousand six . 358363_362893
on the nineteenth day . 364398_366148
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom . 367610_371330
that her husband had threatened to kill her . 371378_373048
(.) and within (.) twenty hours (.) I was in Rome_Italy . 374935_381255
(.) and (.) my husband and I decided that one of us should go (.) to help her . 383215_391805
and to help her (.) with her husband . 392290_395550
(.) and (.) I arrived hoping that I could do something (.) to get them counseling (.) whatever . 397510_406770
within (.) twenty four hours (.) he had called (.) the police (.) of Rome . 407940_416200
I was alone with him in the house . 416356_418846
and I had (.) &=exhales no help . 418980_423610
but I didn't know how to get ahold of my daughter . 423630_425710
&=sniffs and the police were coming to get me (be)cause he was trying to get me in jail . 427303_431063
"&=sniffs and (.) I immediately thought +""/. 432478_436028"

so ‡ (.) I sort_of (.) you_know +... 448990_452230
&=inhales and then I started trying to call my daughter's friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan . 452680_457530
(.) and I kept dialing &=finger
&=sniffs because I think when you're nervous (.) you dial the wrong thing . 462296_465326
I finally got ahold of my daughter . 466338_468288
(.) and (.) she (.) came . 469440_471540
and we called the carabinieri@s
and the carabinieri@s
(.) and I'm not sure if I was afraid +... 479890_482270
&=inhales I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail . 482880_490580
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth (.) to make it happen &=head
and I [//] since then (.) we were trailed . 501196_505146
our phone was tapped . 505850_507280
<the computer was> [//] &=sniffs oh the computer was compromised . 508170_514260
we [/] we wrote to each other (.) sitting on the sofa . 515255_519705
&=hand
&=inhales and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time . 524390_527340
and (.) I'm not sure if I was really afraid . 528340_532110
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening . 532820_535390
but that was probably (.) the most (.) resourceful that I ever hadta be (.) to protect my daughter and grandson . 535900_545780
&=lips_smack so ‡ (.) I'm not sure I share that with everyone . 548540_551810
but if you wanna know when I was really (.) drawn to action &=head
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating ? 560715_565195
&=lips_smack &=head
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it . 568420_571810
(..) &=inhales I think it's not so much communicating it as it is understanding . 577316_582326
&=inhales because when I was in Italy (.) trying to communicate with people (.) I used my hands . 583830_592550
I used any kind of framework I could think of . 593450_596900
(.) &-uh another language . 597860_599200
(.) &=lips_smack &-uh to communicate with anybody . 600560_602690
so ‡ &-um I learned street Italian . 603480_607130
(.) &=lips_smack I &-um became pretty &+cl clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me . 608620_615120
(.) and I learned the words that I needed to use . 616300_618280
but I think (.) communication is so vital . 618466_622286
(.) and when you don't know the language of someone else (.) it's (.) hard to communicate . 623693_630303
(..) do you want us to be creative with it ? [+ exc] 650840_652580
do whatever . [+ exc] 653548_654188
&=inhales well this could easily have happened in Iowa . 656878_659358
(.) the Des_Moines_River (.) was rising (.) in (.) &-um (.) nineteen ninety three . 661025_669535
and also in (.) two thousand eight . 669900_673300
and people were warned not to be near the river . 674185_677585
but people do that . 678785_680425
and the water has an undertow &=ges
and it can (.) catch &=ges
that could have happened in this picture . [+ exc] 689365_691095

(.) and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it . 721381_724791
it went through the window . 725180_726840
(.) and the man (.) was not so happy about it . 727968_731478
because he was sitting there . 732175_733225
and it knocked over his lamp . 733240_735190
and then (.) I'm not sure what he's doing in the last picture . 736670_740610
(.) but he's looking at the window . 744365_746165
the man is looking at the window . 746211_747791

I don't know . [+ exc] 752590_753140

once upon a time . 807405_808775
&=inhales there was a woman with two ugly (.) girls . 809931_813681
and a father with a beautiful (.) daughter . 814260_817080
(.) and they got married the [/] the man and the woman . 818831_820891
so ‡ the families were united &=ges
(.) and the wicked stepmother (.) with her two daughters (.) made the little girl . 824490_831600
