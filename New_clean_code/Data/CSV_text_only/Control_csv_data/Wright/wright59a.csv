well ‡ you go to the cabinet . 800_2360
get the peanut butter and the jelly . 2380_4540
the jelly's usually in the refrigerator . 4561_6811
and a slice of bread . 6910_8590
an(d) &-uh put the jelly and the peanut butter on the bread . 9306_13146
an(d) fold it over . 13163_14083
an(d) eat it &=laughs . 14106_15226
the cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog . 15388_22138
"and the dad said +""/. 22630_23740"
"+"" well ‡ . 23941_24411"
to the little girl (be)cause she was crying her cat was out in the tree . 25008_27818
"+"" I will get the cat down for you . 28381_30731"
so ‡ the dad got up on the ladder to <get up> [/] get up the tree to get the cat . 30748_36378
but the ladder fell down . 36400_38020
and so here [//] <the dog> [/] the dog is &-uh barking at the tree to get the cat . 38833_43303
the dad is &-uh caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down . 43326_48326
so ‡ <the police> [//] the firemen have been called . 48346_50936
and they're coming in to bring another ladder (.) to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy . 51360_58320
and &-um there is a bird singin(g) in the tree . 59296_61786
so ‡ the bird is happy . 61875_62985
so ‡ it all ends when the firemen get &-uh the dad and the cat down . 63000_67290
okay [<] ‡ I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had Guillain_Barre syndrome . 75340_83440
and that's a type of &-uh (.) paralyzing +//. 84218_87498
<it's kind_of> [//] &+g it's [//] I think it was called French polio (be)cause the men were &+f from France . 87520_92320
and &-uh I was on a vacation out over in San_Diego with friends . 92831_97741
and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet . 98140_102400
and &-uh I was stumbling . 103328_105178
I was having a hard time walking . 105200_107310
and I knew something was wrong . 108195_110165
and <I just> [//] &-uh I really kind_of thought it was fate . 110465_115095
I thought maybe I'd a brain tumor or something really pretty serious . 115148_119368
but my daughter was with me . 119833_121713
and we had planned on going to &-uh Universal_Studios . 121736_127536
and I wasn't in pain . 127551_129451
so [//] but I was just having a hard time walking . 130298_132908
Guillain_Barre starts at your fingers and toes . 132930_135240
and then works [/] works in . 135260_136510
so ‡ <I can't> [//] I can remember this going to Universal_Studios in a wheelchair &=laughs . 137448_144848
so ‡ by that evening by the time we all go back to &+th [//] our hotel I was really &-uh quite concerned . 145505_153425
I did sleep . 153441_154261
and the next morning they took me to &-uh Scripps_Medical_Center in the San_Diego area . 154281_160381
and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Guillain_Barre &-um &+a affects [//] it's [/] it's a autoimmune disease . 161140_172200
and he asked me if I had had the flu recently . 172310_175890
and I had . 176315_177035
and so the [/] the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system . 177675_184695
and this was what was happening . 185113_186703
so ‡ <they told> [//] first they wanted to admit me to the hospital . 188345_190985
"and I said +""/. 191100_191640"
"+"" no way . 191795_192285"
I [/] &+w &=laughs I was going back ta [
&-uh oh ‡ and <they did> [//] &+cer they asked me to &-like shuffle a deck o(f) cards . 195145_198905
I couldn't do that . 198980_199790
&+m and &-uh snap &=ges
I couldn't do that . 201955_202625
so ‡ &-uh got back in the car with my friends . 203851_207161
and &-uh my daughter was with us . 207256_209276
"and &-uh he said +""/. 209430_210880"
"+"" if you have trouble breathing . 211060_212590"
because it can go all the way in . 212611_214351
it's [//] &-uh you_know <affects your> [/] &+mus affects your muscles . 214370_217270
"+"" to &-um find the nearest hospital . 217985_220385"
but I got back home . 220433_222283
and &-uh it took me about oh six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery . 222565_231895
for about six weeks I couldn't drive the car . 232428_234818
<I couldn't> [//] &-uh I could feed myself but I couldn't cut &=ges
I could shower but I couldn't &=ges
I had no strength in my hands or my feet . 244721_246911
I couldn't &-uh stand on my toes . 247488_250568
any of that kind o(f) thing . 250590_251490
<so then I started> [//] <&+i it> [//] wherever it goes you_know &=ges
and then it stops and <it's just> [//] your body stops [//] starts healing again . 259803_264243
then it was a slow &-uh recovery . 264860_267250
I would start walking just out around the block a little bit . 267460_271710
but I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister . 271726_278686
she was living with us at the time . 278731_280531
and I just felt like an old lady . 280578_283948
and this was (.) over (.) twenty years ago . 283966_287766
so ‡ I was in my forties . 287855_289035
and I was just holding &=ges
and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over . 296628_299948
but it [//] &-uh I recovered . 300520_303270
I still have a little weakness (oc)casionally in my hands . 303820_306250
I [/] I can occasionally have a hand tremor . 306568_309558
but I feel like I'm ninety nine percent (.) better . 309573_313173
so ‡ that was it &=laughs . 314073_315773
yeah . 316860_317240
oh yes . 323778_324428
well ‡ okay . 328019_328348
&-uh my mother who I lost about a year and a half ago had Alzheimer's . 328846_333616
so ‡ we went through this process . 334903_336653
and &-um &-uh she was oh about eighty when we first +//. 336708_342988
and it was kind_of interesting . 343056_344266
my daughter +//. 344290_345180
like I said my kids come just every other year for Christmas . 345200_348060
and my daughter from California was home . 348670_350620
and within two hours . 350671_352571
they were all at my house . 352655_353715
"Susie came up to me and said +""/. 354088_355488"
"+"" Mother something is wrong with Grandma . 355583_357773"
and we had noticed a little bit . 358501_360351
but it [/] it just got worse and worse . 360396_362216
and then [/] then &-uh my mom and dad were in assisted living out in Fountain_Hills . 362271_367651
then we lost dad . 367671_369751
so ‡ we put mom into a [/] &+n &-uh a nursing home &-uh up in Flagstaff where my sister lives . 369803_376723
and she was up there for four years . 377448_379188
and at first she could talk . 379260_381310
she went through all the different stations [/] &+stay &-uh &-uh stations of you_know aggression and meanness . 382508_389228
and she would call me or dad would actually (be)cause she couldn't really dial . 389370_393540
but dad would call . 393558_394478
and she'd grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes . 394500_400390
and she was much thinner than I was so . 400436_402426
or taking money . 402738_403838
dad would call and [//] (.) hiding in the garage and this mother who's &+mak &-uh maybe a hundred and ten pounds at the most you_know . 404436_412596
he was kind_of frightened of her because she got really mean . 412620_416180
but then she got back into a very calm (.) &-uh state . 416195_421465
and &-uh slowly (.) began to really make no sense whatsoever . 421705_427045
but I've [//] I learned . 427883_428993
and [/] and Dad and I went to a Alzheimer's support group which really really helped us . 429011_433791
&+a (e)specially dad . 434478_435698
and &-um because my mom had done everything . 435828_438518
I_mean she had been the one to do all the shopping send out the cards . 438536_442746
and I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards . 443255_446905
but &-uh finally there was a point where [//] &-uh when dad died that she needed full care . 447001_453371
so [//] and the last six months she [/] she couldn't talk or do anything . 453968_459098
&+sh and she broke her hip had a fall . 459343_461703
and the saddest thing was that up until the last year she was very [//] physically very healthy . 462376_467476
so ‡ she died at age eighty seven . 468105_470285
+< so ‡ that's my story &=laughs on that . 472073_474333
&-uh
so ‡ (.) &=sighs . 485595_486395
I guess &+l a long time ago . 489525_492575
+< xxx .
<tell me the story start from the beginning> [>] .
<I was in an &+er &+er earthquake> [<] in California . 494675_497045
and one of the major ones . 497666_499276
this was in (.) the fifties . 499510_502580
and &-uh <it was> [//] it [/] <it was> [//] &-uh we were visiting <my dad's aunt or> [//] my dad's sister my aunt out in California . 503076_512336
and it happened in the middle of the night . 512356_514446
and <it was> [//] &-uh it [//] it's listed . 514994_517953
I think it was maybe a seven pointer (.) somethin(g) . 518169_520690
<I_mean it> [//] the house was definitely &=laughs moving . 520710_523520
the bed was moving . 523788_524668
I was &-uh sharing a bed with my cousin . 525371_528391
and &-uh when I woke up at first I just thought she was shaking the bed around . 528411_533001
but it was dark . 533018_534028
it was early early morning . 534046_535786
and so there was a_lot_of flashing because the transformer's going off . 536623_540223
and &-uh &+ma &-uh my aunt and uncle had a [/] a doorbell chime . 541510_546580
the kinds that two hang &=ges
and &=ges
so ‡ &-uh we were up for the rest of the morning . 551186_554456
this probably happened (.) oh five o'clock in the morning something like that . 554473_559273
there were a_lot_of tremors afterwards . 559290_561350
and &-uh I remember back then (.) in the fifties the newspapers useta do extras . 561641_568031
and there was an extra out that day on the earthquake . 568341_571571
so ‡ it was [/] it was a_little frightening at the time (be)cause you just don't know what's going on . 572356_577196
so ‡ it scared me . 577856_578446
but I haven't had too much to frighten me in my life . 578671_581411
yeah &=laughs . 582828_583368
well ‡ there was a flash flood in the deserts of Arizona which happens frequently . 585645_592705
and people are a_little careless . 592770_595020
and they think they can drive their car out through this dry wash bed that all_of_a_sudden has a trickle o(f) water . 595238_602988
and they get their car out there . 603485_605015
and the trickle becomes a flood . 605030_607180
and they hafta get out_of their car . 607698_611198
and they are standing on the roof . 611885_614665
and <the paramedics> [//] &-uh <the or> [//] the &-uh firemen come . 615313_619863
the rescue people come . 619890_621260
and the little girl &+ca falls off of the car into the raging flood waters . 621633_627133
and she's holding onto a branch . 627231_630091
and the &-uh firemen come out and rescue her . 630720_635540
she's extremely scared . 636568_638278
the boy is playing soccer out at his yard . 649113_652443
and he kicks the ball . 652508_654008
and it breaks one of the windows . 654806_657436
and it lands in the living room where the dad is sitting . 657458_660818
it breaks the window . 660836_663006
but it also breaks the lamp . 663030_665490
and the dad (.) gets up . 666230_669840
and holds the soccer ball . 669903_673133
and looks out the window . 673230_674590
"and is yelling out to the boy +""/. 675118_676628"
"+"" get in here right away . 676741_677951"
the little boy is going off to school . 689613_691243
he walks to school . 691260_692440
"and his mother says +""/. 692456_693306"
"+"" well ‡ it looks like it might rain today . 693561_695001"
"+"" you better take the umbrella . 695070_696690"

"+"" oh ‡ no I don't need an umbrella . 697221_699121"
"+"" I [/] &+d I [/] I don't think it's going to rain . 699203_701793"
so ‡ off he goes with his backpack . 702208_704408
and sure enough it starts raining . 704596_707006
and he gets soaking wet . 707711_709211
it's raining very very hard . 709230_710940
and he runs back to the house . 711521_713271
and [/] and looks at his mother . 713405_715165
and he is soaking wet . 715181_716661
and the mother is a_little disgruntled at him for not taking the umbrella . 716731_721641
but she gives him the umbrella . 721665_723085
and back out he goes to school with the umbrella keeping him dry . 723105_726985
okay ‡ this is the story of Cinderella . 731491_734541
and Cinderella lost her mother . 735126_737136
and her father married a new person [//] a [/] a woman . 737701_741861
a [//] and so Cinderella had a stepmother . 742401_744681
but the stepmother also had two girls . 745368_747728
so ‡ they came in and were living with Cinderella . 747746_750506
the father didn't realize this but the &+m stepmother was really treating Cinderella mean . 751220_756560
and he [//] she had her cleaning and washing while her daughters were being treated very very nicely . 757238_763728
and Cinderella felt very sad . 763750_767160
well ‡ there was a prince in the land . 767612_769612
there was the [/] &+c the castle . 769633_771453
and the king and the queen wanted their prince to get married . 771770_774960
and they were looking for the best wife for [/] for him . 775411_779181
and they were going to have a ball to introduce him to all the single ladies in the (.) kingdom . 779911_785691

"but the stepmother said +""/. 788376_790036"

so ‡ the [/] the stepsisters were getting ready . 794680_797820
and Cinderella was very very sad . 797843_799753
and &-uh the book talks about her going up in the attic or down in the basement finding this chest with a book . 800898_809418
this part I don't know but anyway . 809438_811768
she calls on a fairy godmother to come and [/] and help her . 812760_818170
and the fairy godmother gives her this beautiful dress . 818186_821816
does up her hair . 821903_823133
and she has a coach . 823713_825213
and off she goes to the ball . 826838_829158
but she is being told that everything is going to go back to the way it was at the stroke of midnight . 829208_835908

and she dances with the prince . 844220_846080
and she falls in love with him . 846146_848006
but then she hears the clock stuhtriking [

but she has lost one of her slippers on the stairway as she ran down from the castle . 867333_872393
so ‡ the prince wants to find this beautiful young lady . 873195_877465
