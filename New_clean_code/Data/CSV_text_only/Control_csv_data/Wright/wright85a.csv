an(d) the stupid thing is not healed yet which is (.) usual for me . 170300_175280

and for a reason I don't remember (.) &=lips_smack the children (.) told me that there was a big animal (.) looking out_of this (.) &=ges area . 304038_318568
so
"+"" well ‡ &=hand"
but nevertheless I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn('t) get out . 325240_328980

because if someone gets bit I will sue the city . 382218_385458
&=lips_smack so
