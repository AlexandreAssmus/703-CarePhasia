white is always the tastiest but wheat is better for you . 94337_98487
and take the bread . 99839_102859
and you first put some butter on one side of one piece . 102909_107059
and then you spread some peanut butter over that . 107437_111807
and then you pick a good jam maybe strawberry . 111822_116012
and put that over the peanut butter . 117461_120111
and then slap one more piece of bread on top of that . 120189_123669
and you've got a peanut butter jelly sandwich . 123693_125663
okay . 159816_160136
well ‡ &-uh I remember when I was young . 160958_164858
"I think it was probably in the the fall because we were playing football down in the next block on the corner house, the Larsons . 165668_175338"
they had three kids . 176258_177938
Christine was the oldest . 178783_180443
and she was their natural daughter . 180557_182647
and then Joanne a year older than us was &+a their adopted daughter . 182876_187206
and Bruce Larson was my buddy . 187397_190187
and we were playing a little game of football in his front yard . 190850_195290
and we had some older kids with us who joined in our games . 196542_201912
my brother was three years older but he didn't play a_lot in the neighborhood games . 202142_207662
but one of (th)em was &-uh a jock . 208069_210999
his parents were phy [
and he tackled me right at [/] <at the> [/] at the goal line or the +... 214734_221064
and &-uh I got hurt . 221118_222848
I had the football in my hand . 223278_225538
it was a little fake football . 225982_228232
and he landed here &=points
I had a sweatshirt on . 230878_231748
and I just got up . 231996_232936
and I was kind_of crying a little bit . 233150_234610
I felt kind_of sick to my stomach . 234830_236270
"and I just said +""/. 236725_237055"
"+"" well ‡ <I can't> [//] I gotta go home . 237422_238992"
"+"" I don't feel good . 239200_239900"

and the [/] the wrist &=points
"I_mean you_know you could tell it was broken, you_know . 250095_252805"
we're taking you to the hospital . 252854_254294
so ‡ I went down to the Vista hospital the hospital I was born at and &-uh got checked in . 254350_261630
and the next thing I remember I'm on the operating table . 262017_266008
and they're telling me to to count back from a hundred . 266128_268288
seems like I made it maybe to ninety seven or so . 268303_271433
and next thing I know I'm waking up in my hospital room with I think my dad was there . 271744_276844
and I have a &=points
and I had that for the next six weeks or so in school . 281408_285488
and I remember I would still play &-uh tetherball . 285552_288802
because I was big into tetherball . 290190_292010
but that's [/] that's that illness . 292241_293931
&-um a little bit with my dad . 303277_309467
but it was over the phone . 310159_311779
and &-um he had a stroke around the end +/. 311824_316724
okay . 323199_323539
&-um just he slurred his speech and just had a little difficulty saying his words and stuff . 323996_332746
and just by being patient +//. 333174_334894
it wasn't that bad . 335105_336105
so ‡ I just listened and tried to be patient with him . 336547_343437
and it [/] it &+wa wasn't terribly difficult . 344005_346735
and he recovered quite well from his stroke . 347718_350388
so ‡ &=shrugs +... 352445_352655
&-hm
I guess in &-uh the army in my airborne training . 373049_377249
&-um one of the first things we hadta do was it was called the thirty four foot tower where we were connected to harnesses . 377299_389589
but you hadta go [//] &=ges
but just that jumping out into nothing was scary . 404662_408762
but I was excited and I did it . 408998_413128
but we looked back and there were some guys that couldn't [/] couldn't get past that leap to [/] to do the jump . 413270_420400
and they'd wash out_of the program at that point . 420646_422576
&-uh one day <the &-uh paramedics or> [//] the rescue team was called out to &-um a popular <rafting area> [//] river rafting area where young Sally a thirteen year old who was out with her family rafting had fallen out_of the raft and was caught in the river . 462634_494344
and &-uh Joe the fire rescue man climbed out on a branch and rescued Sally . 495734_507174
and everybody lived happily every after . 508321_510461
alright . [+ exc] 533591_533841
Billy was playing soccer with his friend Joe outside their house . 535520_543410
and he kicked it . 544235_544925
and the ball apparently flew out into his next door neighbor mister Smith's window crashing though the window and breaking the lamp . 545341_554521
mister Smith was startled . 555473_557143
but he had kids of his own and wasn't too upset . 558375_563195
he knew the window could be fixed and luckily he hadn't got hurt by the broken glass . 563212_567862
the end . [+ exc] 568572_568852

the story of Cinderella starts where her father must leave to a foreign post for twenty years . 641860_657420
so ‡ he takes his daughter over to his sister's house who has two children of her own to take care of her and bring her up . 657710_667960
and once the father's gone the sister takes advantage of Cinderella by making her do all the work and treating her like a second class citizen in her own home . 698142_698212
treating her two little daughters like princesses but dumping all the work on Cinderella .
and she grows up finding solace in the animals around the house because they're the only ones that treat her well and love her . 698212_698222
and she loves them back . 698222_700722
and she grows up to a fine beautiful young lady whereas her cousins are spoiled brats .
and she is working one day when she hears her aunt reading a invitation to the prince's ball .
and she wishes she could go . 721111_722711
but no she can't because she doesn't have any good dresses to wear .
"but the little animals that live around the house, the mice help make her a dress ."
but then the stepmother finds out about it and destroys it .
but here comes a little old lady which turns out to be &+cinderell Cinderella's fairy godmother and provides her with the dress and makes a coach out_of a pumpkin and makes horses to carry the coach out_of her little mice friends .
