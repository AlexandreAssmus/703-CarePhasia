&-um well I have a way of making people feel comfortable I feel . 54375_57655
and there are some people that just really bottle up their emotions . 57706_61106
and then don't wanna you_know express how they really feel . 61487_64797
or they'll give quick short answers . 64819_66900
&-um you_know that they're really emotionally distraught . 67509_69939
but they don't wanna cry because for some reason <they've been> [//] you_know that's just the way they were brought up or something where they can't you_know bring out their emotions and cry . 69958_80168
