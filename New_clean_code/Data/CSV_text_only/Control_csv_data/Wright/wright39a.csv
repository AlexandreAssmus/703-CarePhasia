it was a spring day in Bluefield_West_Virginia . 126848_129978
and my best friend Grace and I were at the Seven_Eleven which was new to town . 130000_133770
enjoying a Slurpee because every Friday we got to go to Seven_Eleven to get a Slurpee . 134225_138465
my mom decides to cross the road . 138513_141513
and fill up her gas tank . 141558_143378
&-uh Grace and I decide we got our Slurpees so quickly we'd go across and meet her at the gas station . 143480_148330
&-uh &+g we cross one lane no problem . 148730_151880
get across to the other side . 151900_153230
Grace decides to cross back because she doesn't like the traffic going across the next road . 153695_159385
&-um I stay . 159685_161075
and there's a_lot_of traffic . 161266_162276
and I decide to cross . 162293_163243
sure enough I cross . 163963_165073
there's a blind side . 165096_166176
&-uh I'm hit by a car . 166283_167873
flipped . 168176_168456
an(d) we find out later my leg is broken . 168510_172130
it happened so fast I didn't remember any of it . 172180_174400
my mom &-uh unfortunately got to witness the entire thing . 174773_178533
and &-uh called an ambulance . 178981_180951
they took me to the hospital . 181000_182550
set my leg . 182830_183620
I had a cast up to my hip . 183666_184916
I went home . 185136_186016
and was homeschooled for about three weeks . 186033_187953
but all in all it was very comfortable . 188410_191060
friends came to see me . 191080_191970
and it turned out it was a student teacher at our school &=laughs that hit me . 191998_194988
that was kind_of &-um an odd coincidence in our town . 195335_198435
but I healed very well . 198486_200016
and that's my story &=laughs . 200038_201838
can you imagine how the poor +... 202278_206788
I take a class . 213153_214153
and at the class I noticed a
and then I heard him speak to the teacher . 222170_223850
and &=ges
it was &+s slightly impaired . 227135_228775
but you could understand (h)im . 228791_230001
but it was &-uh &-uh very kind o(f) nasal in the back of his throat . 230055_233065
&-um this is a tap class . 233650_235410
so ‡ we dance . 235463_236773
and I was amazed to find out later that he actually was deaf . 236831_241871
&-um and he wears &-um heavy duty &=ges
I don't know much detail about it . 245905_247065
but yet he can feel the rhythm . 247300_247800
and he can tap dance . 248721_249821
but to understand him I just hafta look at him . 250230_253460
and listen very closely . 253526_255076
and I can understand (h)im completely . 255186_256586
he's a responsible adult . 256603_258473
holds a job . 258491_259231
&-um and it hasn't affected him negatively in any other way . 259695_262675
&-um <it just> [//] you jus(t) hafta take time . 263143_265013
and listen carefully . 265036_266896
and watch him . 266920_267630
and that's how we've overcome it . 267653_269383
okay . 278290_278680
&-um my friends and I decided to go for a hike . 278981_283481
&-uh one is especially adventurous . 283940_286380
&-uh his name is Leo . 287086_288316
and my roommate Suzette and the man I was dating at the time was named Lee . 288766_293336
we took off on a hike . 293738_295148
well ‡ equipped with backpacks full of snacks waters . 295193_298803
it was an beautiful day . 299261_301681
&-uh coo
and we planned to spend the whole day . 305018_306528
a_lot_of it [//] &-uh our plans were based on Leo . 306745_310695
he was &-uh more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy . 310793_315673
so ‡ we went not knowing where we were going . 315688_318008
we just trusted him . 318031_319051
we got along . 319655_321075
had a snack . 321095_321835
and been gone about two and a half hours . 321853_323683
and nex
ready to head back &-uh to our destination . 328323_331333
and we're lost . 331356_334106
&-um three of us have absolutely no clue no concept of where we are . 334701_338681
we're surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look . 338700_343070
so ‡ there really was no direction . 343140_344870
and we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend Leo . 344920_349500
&-uh Leo doesn't panic . 350488_351928
I started to feel a_little panicked because I had &-uh twisted my knee a little bit . 351993_356643
so ‡ I had a_little compromised gait . 356665_358915
and it was a_little tender . 358975_360455
but I didn't wanna complain . 360795_362425
and I knew there's nothing we could do about it . 362446_363666
we just hadta get back home . 363683_364783
so ‡ for the first time I really felt quite &-uh afraid that we might not make it . 364800_369670
and what to do about my knee . 369685_370975
we persevered . 371568_372568
we trusted Leo . 372585_373655
he [/] he &-uh went off on a couple wrong paths . 373676_378186
but he got us back on track . 378323_380263
got us back to the car . 380381_381741
my leg was fine . 381801_382881
and it all ended very well . 382933_384743
it was a great memory . 384761_385871
we laughed about it . 385893_386943
and &-um I won't go hiking with Leo again &=laughs . 387040_390350
the end &=laughs . 390371_391791
it had been raining for days and days . 398400_401800
and everyone knew the river was rising . 401885_404325
residents in the area were warned to leave town . 404373_408633
and to find shelter elsewhere [/] elsewhere until the &+r river [/] river waters went down . 408721_413901
&-uh one family the Jones would not leave . 414003_418953
they were not afraid . 419013_420883
they'd seen the river ride for many many many years . 420906_423696
and never felt like they were threatened . 423761_426431
well ‡ this day the river rose up . 426476_428556
and came up to the bottom level of their house . 428715_431865
they decide to move upstairs . 432268_434238
and the water was still rising . 434291_436441
the rain was still coming down . 436456_437636
it was becoming &+nar nighttime . 437656_439186
they moved up to the top of their house where they were able to sit on the roof . 439276_442866
and &-uh Mister and Missus Jones looked aroun(d) . 443580_447690
and they didn't see their daughter . 447748_449628
their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddy_bear . 449796_453126
and the water had already risen that high . 453180_455600
so ‡ she had been swept away by the river . 456110_458460
the parents suddenly realized . 458573_461633
they heard a yelling and a screaming . 461681_463931
they looked from the rooftop . 464010_465890
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river . 465936_470976
luckily with our technology the Jones had a cellphone . 471828_475088
they dialed nine-one-one and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid . 475106_480636
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out . 480685_485865
they threw out a line across the river . 486111_488181
it was secure . 488241_490461
he climbed out clinging to the rope . 490521_493351
and saw the Jones' daughter . 493443_494213
he reached down . 495408_497058
grabbed her . 497110_498590
she grabbed ahold of his arm . 499363_500633
he wrapped a &+th &+s &-uh device around &+hi her waist to secure her body to his . 500650_505260
and climbed back across the rope back to the riverside . 505495_509615
Jessica was safe . 509666_511926
the family were delighted to see that she was okay . 513299_515570
but they learned a lesson . 515592_516693
next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home . 516715_521835
the end &=laughs . [+ exc] 526335_526585

okay . 799135_799485
there was a young woman and her father . 800181_805151
and they lived in a town all alone . 805343_809463
her mother had died . 809951_811091
the father was lonely . 811798_812988
and one day he met &+a another woman . 813101_815611
and decided to marry . 815665_817325
make a new family . 817411_818261
&+s the woman had two daughters . 818473_822453
and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created . 822601_825961
well ‡ sadly the father died . 826096_828376
leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and <the two> [//] her <two halfsisters [
the stepmother was not happy about this . 839465_841095
and she did not see Cinderella as her own . 841145_843815
so ‡ she made her more of a house servant than a daughter . 843990_847920
and she made her wait on &+th her [/] her two daughters . 848588_852108
and clean house . 852253_853783
and take care of them . 853918_854988
Cinderella was not happy about this . 855003_857703
but she felt like that was her destiny . 857750_859920
so ‡ she (.) cleaned and cooked &+an and did everything that she was told to do . 860006_866166
Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart . 866745_868655
she made friends with the animals . 869153_870663
they were her only friends . 870741_871691
she was so busy . 871710_872510
she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends . 872561_875271
Cinderella's &-um gentle heart would carry her a long way . 875525_883955

&-uh let's see &-hm . [+ exc] 884705_887355
let's back up a little bit . [+ exc] 887370_888110
&-um I ain't [
&-um on the other side of [/] of &+th the town &+the was a castle . 890971_899121
and &=clears_throat the town was ruled by a king . 899185_903495
the [//] &+kin this king had a son . 904295_905475
and the son was of age to be married . 905520_908050
<they needed> [//] <when he> [//] they needed a new heir to the throne . 908101_911421
&-um and if he wasn't married he could not become king . 911485_914555
so ‡ the [/] the [/] &+fath the king decided to throw a ball inviting all eligible young women . 915030_922760
so ‡ he would have a large [/] &-uh &-uh large number to pick from for his future bride . 923496_931056
&-uh the invitations were delivered . 931076_937466
and certainly the stepsisters were invited . 937518_941968
in_fact ‡ every young eligible woman was invited . 942065_945295
Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation . 945755_948515
but the stepmother was not about to let her go . 948561_951461
so ‡ she &-um was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses . 951983_957353
and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives . 957398_960748
once in a lifetime opportunity . 960950_962320
but she was unable to go . 962343_963673
so ‡ off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball . 964523_967893
and Cinderella stayed at home very sad very lonely . 967980_972020
when suddenly &-uh &-uh some &+m magical event appeared [//] &-uh &-uh occurred . 972190_980600

"+"" do not cry . 985211_986071"
"+"" you can go to the ball . 986243_987273"
and Cinderella was very concerned about her dress . 987571_990451
and the stepmother [
and &-um turned a pumpkin into a carriage . 994311_998561
and the mice into horses . 998576_1000906
and Cinderella had [//] &-uh was ready to go to the ball . 1001075_1004575

so ‡ she goes to the ball . 1022338_1023568
has a wonderful time dancing with the prince . 1023616_1026096
and he is entirely taken with her . 1026116_1028096
noone knows who she is because she's never been dressed this way . 1028580_1031451
the stepsisters didn't even recognize her . 1031646_1033356
well ‡ it's getting close to midnight . 1033624_1037864
and Cinderella knows she must say goodbye . 1037935_1040106
and the clock starts to strike . 1040183_1043242
one two three four . 1043313_1044782
all the way up until it's almost twelve . 1044828_1046637
and she flees . 1046685_1047474
she tells the prince she hasta leave she hasta leave . 1047492_1049723
she takes off . 1050083_1050923
and as she's running away her clothes begin to change . 1051040_1054210
&+an yet one of her &+s glash [
she gets back to her house . 1060166_1061596
and finds that she still has one of the glass slippers left . 1061845_1065315
but she had a wonderful time . 1065556_1067286
it was a wonderful memory . 1067303_1068383
so ‡ magical she can hardly believe it happened . 1068451_1070691
"well ‡ the next day <the king set out to> [//] &+fin the king &-uh realized &-uh that his son said +""/. 1070783_1080633"

she must live in the community . 1098625_1100085
&-uh and the only way <they know> [//] they'll know if she's the one is if the remaining glass slipper that was left on the stairwell would fit her . 1100315_1109335
so ‡ the [/] the &-uh prince's men take the slipper and visit from house to house in the town . 1109531_1118441
they come upon &+th Cinderella's home . 1118518_1122708
yet the stepmother in no way is goin(g) to allow Cinderella to try on the slipper . 1122731_1127511
only [//] she only wants her two stepdaughters . 1127528_1129788
because she wants one of them to marry the prince . 1129976_1132056

Cinderella &-um is able to escape from the locked room . 1138881_1145991
and comes down . 1146008_1147388
and they try on the [/] &+sl the slipper . 1147435_1149725
