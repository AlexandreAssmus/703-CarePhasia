one [//] &-uh Cinderella's father remarried and married a lady who had two daughters already . 379286_388416
but the lady did not like Cinderella . 388955_391205
she was &-uh a very mean stepmother . 391220_394790
and as the kiddos grew up Cinderella was made to do all the housework . 395565_400115
everything . 400500_401190
and she befriended the animals &-uh around their house . 402500_406500
they became her friends . 406518_407338
she could talk to them . 407358_408768

she could look out and see the castle where the prince lived . 411415_414085
and as the prince got older <it was time for him> [//] his [/] &+fis his &-uh family decided it was time for him to take a wife . 415441_420701
and so he was hosting a (.) ball for all the &-uh eligible ladies in the kingdom . 422496_429316
and Cinderella was also invited but the stepmother would [//] was mean and would not provide a gown for Cinderella . 430981_437551

the handsome prince sees her . 477325_478835

and after she was &-uh away from the view of the [/] the prince everything did turn back into the pumpkin and the [/] the mice and the original animals . 491041_499411
but Cinderella had got to keep one of the glass slippers because it did not &-uh go away . 499433_504823
