it's a beautiful day in the country . 14841_17041
and the mouse family +//. 18211_19611
looks like they have about nine children . 20287_22427
"+, are all going into the forest to look for a place to have a picnic . 22966_26406"
they all pile into (.) a red truck . 27930_32490
we think it's dad's but it could be Grandpa's . 32512_34622
and up they go up a hill . 35326_37286
and then they go across another fairy area . 37307_40267
and oh it's green and it's beautiful . 40314_42634
but all_of_a_sudden the truck hits a boulder in the road . 42773_46413
and the little mouse falls off the back of the truck which has no tailgate . 47887_53137
and in the little mouse's arms are his [/] his little pet mouse . 54471_60441
well ‡ there he is flat on his back in the trail all alone with his little toy . 61037_65717
and all he sees the &+re truck and the rest of his family disappearing into the distance . 66298_71398
and he doesn't know what to make of this . 72438_74738
now we follow the family in their red truck . 76610_79860
they found a beautiful spot . 80332_82532
"so ‡ they all get out_of the truck carrying their picnic things and their toys, their baseball bats and (.) all sorts of toys, cameras, everything they have with him . 82819_95929"
now we have them in a perfectly beautiful glen by a small lake that actually has a pier . 96407_102707
some of them are swimming . 103606_105086
"one is on the pier <getting ready to> [//] thinking about diving, not [/] not too sure . 105327_110127"
two other of the children are dancing in the grass . 111022_114072
another one is picking flowers . 114363_116663
another one is carrying the thermos . 116759_119589
and bigger ones are carrying the picnic basket . 119670_123010
and mom is shaking up the tablecloth . 123169_126379
and dad has his banjo . 126508_128838
and grandpa's getting ready to take a walk . 128889_131420
everybody's getting ready for a wonderful time . 131468_133798
beautiful beautiful lake in the beautiful forest . 134417_137417
next we see them playing baseball . 138521_143171
the older folks relaxed playing the banjo and just sitting and watching the younger ones play . 144494_149814
and one little one has [=! laughs] a rubber tire . 151069_153899
he doesn't know quite what to do with that . 153914_156664
and then we go back and we see the little one all by himself in the middle of the road . 157291_163081
little tears running down his cheeks clutching his pet . 164431_168221
xxx pet mouse . 170079_170479
he gets up . 171619_172259
he looks around . 173168_174148
he doesn't know what to do . 174201_175651
he's all alone and everything around him is very tall . 177465_180905
the grasses and the bushes +... 181355_183065
oh there are berries on the bushes . 183769_185629
maybe he could eat some of the berries . 186496_188506
now we go back to the rest of the family . 191504_193594
they're photographing each other . 193737_195317
they're frisking about in the lake . 195367_197637
they're sailing a boat . 198001_199241
they have a beautiful picnic spread out with watermelon and salad and sandwiches and cheese . 199628_207748
well ‡ they are mice you_know . 207941_209051
then we go back to the little guy . 210957_212317
he reaches up and he finds that he can reach the berries . 212795_216205
so ‡ he pulls them down . 217334_218704
sets <his little> [/] his little friend down on the ground . 219471_222031
and he starts eating the berries . 222400_224210
suddenly we go back to the picnic and there seems to be something amiss . 226566_235416
there are only eight (.) little mice when there should be nine . 237629_242939
and mom is kind_of rubbing her hands together . 245525_249405
and dad is shading his eyes looking off into the distance . 249691_254121
and Grandma and Grandpa are looking every which way . 254246_257656
noone knows what to do . 257704_260574
and they're not eating their picnic . 261550_263100
<they're just all sitting> [//] the little children are all sitting with their hands folded looking very worried . 263466_269686
where is their little brother &-hm
"well ‡ <one of them is> [//] one of the &+m brothers, the bigger ones, sits on the edge of the pier and is calling and calling his little brother . 275328_283308"
the little mouse who was sailing the boat brings the boat in and starts to cry . 284648_288668
the other little mouse is crying . 289272_291452
a bush with flowers on . 292467_293967
&+ev <all the children seem to be> [//] they're all looking but they can't find +//. 294563_299403
they're looking behind rocks . 299748_301088
they're looking among the tall grass . 301974_303444
they can't find him . 303489_304579
but they know he's missing finally . 305276_306836
so ‡ they pack up everything . 307210_308700
"the baseball bat, the banjo, the picnic basket . 309567_312387"
and they all load up in the little red truck . 312787_315557
now we go back and we see the <little missing> [/] little missing boy mouse laying on his back with his hands on his tummy . 317060_324640
maybe he ate too many berries . 326094_327814
we don't know though . 327865_329265
so ‡ the truck comes back and everybody is looking . 330878_334118
they're looking out the windows . 334408_335728
they're looking over the back of the truck . 335780_337500
they're looking every which way . 338574_340374
they are looking for their little brother . 340501_341991
little brother stands up . 342926_344636
he thinks he hears something . 346245_347245
he looks and looks but <he's in> [/] he's in the tall grass and he can't see anything . 349034_353544
&=gasps suddenly he finds his way back to the road . 354849_357689
and he sees his family . 357765_359965
and they are all cheering . 360522_362672
and there's a hat thrown in the air . 362689_364599
and all of his little brothers and sisters are &+s screaming with happiness . 364618_369038
and mom and dad are just big eyed . 369058_370938
they can't believe they found their little one . 370986_372606
then they all get together in the middle of the road and everybody hugs little brother . 372716_378136
he is so happy . 379323_380903
and then he looks around . 381727_382927
something's missing . 383000_383870
"he looks, he goes back in the grass . 385794_387784"
"he looks and he looks and he finds his little pet, little pink mouse . 387831_394151"
gives him a hug . 394800_395630
and the family is united . 398271_400371
everybody is back together . 401184_403524
so ‡ they have a picnic right there . 404119_406149
they don't go back to the lake . 406171_407561
they're just too happy . 407669_408899
they just stay where they are . 409101_410811
and all nine mice children and the little pet have a wonderful wonderful picnic . 411364_417674

this is a story about a little baby and an amazing dog named Carl . [+ exc] 635701_641851
the first picture shows us with mom . 643179_646749
and she's getting ready to go shopping . 647203_648773
the little baby is in the crib covered up . 649232_653612
and Carl is on the floor guarding . 653854_656014
"and mother says +""/. 657257_658377"
"+"" now <you look> [//] be sure you look after the baby Carl . 658632_661092"
so ‡ when mom leaves Carl immediately goes to the window and looks out to see if there's anything out there that could be a problem . 662623_671553
and also to make sure she's gone . 671847_673097
then Carl goes over to the crib and stands up right next to it so the little boy can climb over the crib and right onto Carl's back . 673887_685007
now we're having some fun . 686421_688071
the little boy rides &~C Carl . 688219_691859
and they go into mom's and daddy's bedroom . 691941_693941
and they both +//. 694494_695154
well ‡ really it's Carl who jumps up on the bed but baby goes with him . 695796_699506
and so Carl stands watch while the baby bounces up and down on the bed . 700159_704549
then we see the baby on mommy's dressing table . 705913_710963
and the baby has a powder puff . 711050_712970
and the baby gets powder in Carl's nose . 713275_716015
in the next picture <we see> [=! laughs] the [/] &=laughs the baby with a fancy hat . 717492_724422
it's [/] &-um it's a handkerchief with a powder puff on top . 724711_729041
but Carl is wearing beads around his head between his eyes . 729914_735764
<and he also> [//] actually he has one ear sticking up . 736618_740048
and he has the powder box lid on his head . 740640_744790
they're very proud of themselves . 746066_747156
they both look gorgeous . 747251_748851
&=gasps the next picture shows the little boy . 750828_753098
he has found his way to the laundry chute . 753271_755571
now he is up on the second floor and the laundry chute is down on the basement so Carl's a little bit nervous . 756195_763285
Carl is looking over the door to the laundry chute . 763371_767681
he's not sure what's gonna happen . 767703_769573
the little boy disappears . 769766_771796
Carl races down two flights of stairs . 771859_774079
he's into the basement and there's our little boy safe and sound sitting on the soft pile of clothes waiting to be laundered . 774138_782598
now we see the little boy on Carl's back up [//] back up stairs . 783945_789145
and we go into the living room . 790939_792749
oh_my_goodness . [+ exc] 793624_794684
he sits down and there are papers (.) flying all over the place . 795090_801170
he's gotten into the newspaper . 801842_803312
"not the little boy, Carl . 803914_805474"
now we have Carl getting up with the little boy on his back going to look at the fish in the fish tank . 806664_812754
I don't hafta tell you what happens next . 815169_817409
next thing we see the little boy is in the fish tank . 818931_822071
"and Carl with his paws up on the side leans over and grabs the little boy by his shirt, the back of his shirt and pulls him out . 822790_832060"
well ‡ safe again . 833543_835013
now we have him all dried off . 836333_837773
and Carl goes into the room with the stereo . 838001_840691
and he starts playing . 840907_842017
"turns it on, chooses some music and he starts dancing . 842571_847771"
so ‡ Carl is dancing in the middle of the room with his hind legs . 847973_851123
and the little boy is just thrilled . 851467_853027
he sees this and he just giggles and laughs . 853405_855325
and he can't quite dance yet but he really loves to watch the dog dance . 855932_859672
uhoh we've gone to the kitchen . 859773_861233
Carl has managed to open the refrigerator door . 862120_865880
and the little boy is really interested . 866295_868595
next picture we see a loaf o(f) bread on the floor and yes Carl has opened it . 869684_874474
we see an empty butter . 875528_877848
and the little boy has a stick of butter that he is squeezing with great joy . 878146_884016
then Carl comes up with a bunch of grapes which he holds up so the little boy can take them and eat them one at a time . 884858_893298
then we have Carl . 894837_895847
he gets the Hershey syrup which has two holes already punched in the top so you can pour it . 895900_903380
holds the can in his mouth and pours the syrup into a little cup . 904541_908941
then Carl goes and gets the milk . 910333_913783
opens the milk container . 914363_915793
pours it with [//] in on top of the Hershey syrup . 917244_920374
and now we have chocolate milk . 920966_922526
now we go to the cookie jar and Carl takes the lid off . 923784_926684
the little boy knows exactly what to do . 926734_928524
that little right hand goes in that cookie jar so fast . 928620_931140
and out it comes . 931820_932630
now we have a real pile in the middle of the kitchen floor . 932684_935524
"we have a Hershey's syrup can, we have an open cookie jar, we have &-um milk or with [//] what looks like cream not milk . 935867_944327"
"open on the floor we have pieces of bread, &+tha we have a stick of butter, and we have something that looks like it might be jam in a big puddle in the middle of the floor . 945058_955488"
of_course ‡ the little baby has chocolate all over him . 955534_958394
and he has strawberry jam on his knees . 958413_960333
and he's just a picture . 960356_961546
"so ‡ the next picture, he's back up . 962554_964714"
dirty little boy . 964880_965900
back up on Carl's back . 967090_968650
they're going upstairs . 968934_969964
they go into the bathroom . 970377_971277
Carl turns on the water in the tub . 973744_975874
takes the baby by the back of his shirt . 977277_979557
puts him in the tub . 980769_981579
gets a soap and a washcloth . 983004_984654
lathers it up . 985101_985821
washes baby . 986934_987874
"&=laughs he gets some soap in his mouth, Carl does . 989446_992066"
and he starts blowing bubbles . 992578_993848
oh the little baby thinks <that's just> [/] that's just really funny . 994235_996655
so ‡ then Carl gets the blow dryer out . 997597_1000777
he dries the baby who thinks this is fun . 1001502_1004082
he just looks at that he just loves it . 1004316_1006116
and then the next picture we have the baby being boosted over the side of the crib by Carl . 1006655_1016195
now baby's back in his crib . 1017078_1018808
Carl starts to clean up . 1019450_1020570
okay ‡ he picks up the sandwich bread and the pieces of bread in the sandwich wrapper . 1020719_1025479
he licks up the milk that's spilled on the floor . 1025848_1028979
and he goes to the window to see if anybody's coming back yet . 1029000_1031970
no he's still got time . 1031992_1033061
he goes into mom and dad's bedroom . 1033108_1034808
he straightens up the bed . 1034950_1035910
he puts the powder puff back in the powder box . 1036280_1038839
and he's looking out the front door . 1040318_1041688
here comes mom . 1041733_1042413
oh ‡ mom comes in and there's her boy back in his crib all covered up . 1044753_1049454
and there's Carl guarding the little boy on the floor where he was when Momma left . 1050343_1056663
"and so (.) mommy says +""/. 1057869_1062179"
"+"" good dog „ Carl . 1062759_1063519"
and Carl cuddles up and puts his big head in Momma's lap . 1064710_1068700
and she pets him and gives him love . 1069465_1072305
and that's the story of Carl and the little boy and mommy . 1073234_1077094
www .
first we go to Lowes . 1200961_1202271
and we decide what kind of flower we're gonna buy . 1202984_1205054
so ‡ we decide to get pansies . 1205154_1208054
and we want a six pack because they're already started and easy to plant . 1208761_1213411
each one has its own little square of soil . 1213953_1217483
"so ‡ we go home and we say +""/. 1218061_1219221"
"+"" where are we gonna put them ? 1219363_1219963"
so ‡ we're gonna put them around the birdbath . 1220153_1222203
so ‡ we dig little holes around the birdbath evenly &=ges
and when we have &=ges
and &=ges
&=ges
then after we &=ges
"or the [//] beneath the pansy, &+he her roots and her root ball I'll call it . 1249663_1253173"
&=ges
&=ges
now pat &=ges
pat it down so_that the pansy stands up . 1264664_1266834
<I'm talking like that book> [=! laughs] &=ges
stands up big and tall &=laughs . 1269148_1271808
and &=ges
and after that's done we water gently . 1277106_1279676
and then they're planted . 1280283_1281413
and happy . 1281782_1282122
well ‡ first you need bread . 1288008_1289108
and you need peanut butter . 1289888_1291118
and you need jelly . 1291894_1293064
and you need a knife . 1293756_1294926
so ‡ I would take two slices of bread . 1296082_1298232
and I'd put them on the bread board . 1298250_1300030
and on one side I would spread peanut butter &=ges
and on the side I would spread jelly &=ges
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place . 1307624_1311064
so ‡ then &=ges
&=ges
&=ges
&=ges
and I serve her . 1326185_1326575
I'm going back to my kids . [+ exc] 1330946_1332596
my daughter's fifty three . [+ exc] 1332974_1334504
and <her sister> [//] her younger sister's already retired . [+ exc] 1338365_1341995
well ‡ I am seventy four almost seventy five . [+ exc] 1344134_1346344

yeah ‡ <I can> [/] I can tell you what I did . 1379016_1381026
I went into the hospital <the day after Christmas to have major surgery> [=! laughs] . 1381471_1385691
but getting ready for that is [/] is &-uh much more of a story . 1386069_1389579
because &-uh &-uh my daughter and her husband came from Florida &-um two days before Christmas . 1390505_1399255
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife . 1400024_1407404
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan . 1408185_1412715
and there were seven of us for Christmas . 1414115_1416895
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldn't let me drink wine because [//] but I snuck some in . 1417148_1422628
then five o'clock the day after Christmas &-um we went to the hospital . 1424262_1432362
and the rest wasn't that much fun . 1432379_1434239
&-um the rest of it +//. 1435337_1436517
the [/] the reason my daughter was there was to <take me> [//] look [/] &+aft look after me because she's a registered nurse . 1437027_1442467
and so she was there for about a total of seven days . 1443068_1446078
and then the cousins stayed on . 1446146_1447936
but that's what I did over the Christmas holiday &=laughs . 1448961_1451691
and I don't plan to do that ever again . 1452861_1455491
no . 1459433_1459723
it was a new experience however . 1460249_1461789
last weekend +... 1467015_1467935
oh ‡ last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida . 1468028_1475198
and they're arriving tomorrow evening . 1475514_1477974
so ‡ I moved the car out_of the garage . 1479206_1483796
and I got my &=ges
and I &=ges
and I took my chamois and some pail o(f) water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing . 1490760_1496390
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday . 1497239_1500209
Sunday I vacuumed the living room . 1500648_1504828
moved all the furniture . 1506648_1508338
put &=ges
I've found if you &=ges
so ‡ I did that to &=ges
then having [/] &+sss &=laughs having vacuumed forwards &=ges
"because you_know if I don't have everything looking just right, they'll think +""/. 1543882_1547542"
"+"" &-mm things are getting ahead of her . 1547702_1550782"
"+"" time to put her in the home . 1551598_1552998"
you_know ‡ &=ges
so ‡ then I discovered the spots in the rug . 1556640_1558850
so ‡ now I go out and I do the spot rug thing . 1559404_1562264
upstairs made sure everything was ready <in the> [/] in the &-uh guest room . 1562792_1567882
generally I didn't have a whole lot of fun . 1569023_1571523
&=laughs you_know . 1572304_1572624
"oh and I [/] I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing &-uh the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker, the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason they're coming . 1572850_1599450"
so ‡ all in all I worked the entire weekend . 1600309_1603639
and I'm tired &=laughs . 1603885_1605105
oh_my_gosh what [//] when did I have my last vacation ? 1612684_1616554
it was probably in +... 1617036_1620676
well ‡ you_know when you're retired it's hard <to tell when you're on a vacation> [=! laughs] . 1621259_1624759
but I did go to Florida . 1625210_1626540
I think it was in June . 1627951_1629041
it was a sad time because +//. 1630577_1632627
yeah . 1632747_1633087
and you_know it's a sad time but I did have fun . 1633150_1635760
the reason it's sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years . 1636208_1640498
they were litter mates . 1640513_1641493
and one became very ill and hadta be put down . 1643023_1647243
and &-um I think it was (.) well February or March . 1647297_1653857
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down . 1654710_1663050
so ‡ <those were> [/] those were not fun . 1663823_1666193
those were not fun . 1666812_1667702
but had [//] I did have fun in [/] in Florida . 1667748_1670358
because we always do . 1670375_1671175
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx . 1671199_1673519
and we go out to dinner . 1673930_1675280
and we have wonderful gourmet meals . 1675300_1678810
we just kind_of play family . 1679528_1680708
because we don't see each other that often . 1681745_1683875
but we do things . 1685293_1686243
we [/] we go to the Everglades . 1686364_1687914
we take an airboat ride . 1688050_1689460
and &-uh [/] and that kind of stuff . 1689507_1691187
and <they have> [//] they once had two dogs and three cats . 1691202_1694932
they're down to two dogs and one cat now . 1695289_1696919
so ‡ that [/] &=laughs that keeps me happy . 1697043_1699703
but pretty much that's it . 1699750_1700970
www .
okay . [+ exc] 1767305_1767725
we'll [/] we'll set the scene first . [+ exc] 1769251_1770781
we're in a lovely little rural location here . 1771317_1775047
&-um the banks of a very tranquil lake . 1775512_1779052
and we have a sailboat in the lake . 1780317_1783117
and <we have> [//] actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite . 1783824_1788924
a boy [//] little boy playing with a kite . 1789342_1791572
so ‡ it's [/] it's windy . 1791654_1792854
it's windy enough to keep the flag fluffering [
now we have a cozy little house on the shore . 1800193_1802753
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade . 1803433_1806793
and the car is parked in front of the garage . 1807379_1809879
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach . 1810140_1818450
now the beach is very very narrow . 1819319_1821789
but it's wide enough that the little girl out there can play and &+sh she's making a sandcastle . 1822148_1827438
and it also has a pier . 1828405_1830645
that's where the sailboat comes when it's tired . 1830971_1833131
and looks like dad's on the edge of the pier . 1833183_1836593
or maybe it's Grandpa . 1837386_1838506
we can't tell from here . [+ exc] 1838522_1839702
but he's fishing and he's caught a fish . 1840107_1842097
now the boy who's flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog . 1842977_1848417
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass . 1849149_1853949
"shoes beside them, radio playing, dad reading a book . 1854289_1858179"
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine . 1859207_1864237
and then they have a picnic basket between them . 1865657_1868257
so ‡ all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home . 1869025_1878715
www .
now here we have a rural scene . 1930994_1933474
we have just a two lane highway . 1934548_1936238
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees . 1936913_1941593
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front . 1942903_1953653
and the man has a map in his hand . 1953820_1957650
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree . 1958513_1965523
well ‡ it's clear . 1966050_1966970
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is . 1967285_1974775
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story . 1975019_1980279
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the car's headed . 1981226_1987696
off they go . 1988563_1989233
we see them receding into the distance . 1989386_1991416
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole . 1992138_1995628
and suddenly there's the car back in front of the farmer . 1997872_2005632
it looks like they just went around in a circle . 2006188_2009888
who knew ? 2014027_2014397
www .

we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boy's birthday party . 2077358_2082878
and the little boy looks to be about six . 2083375_2085475
and &-uh what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table . 2087159_2092179
we have the front door open . 2093130_2094719
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in . 2095649_2098899
obviously they're guests . 2098920_2100340
and they're carrying presents . 2100467_2102197
each one accompanied by the mother . 2102247_2103707
and they all stop and they look at the cake . 2103727_2106007
well ‡ there's a big chunk taken out_of the cake . 2107934_2111754
and one of the candles . 2112324_2113624
looks like the little boy's fifth birthday according to the candle count . 2114968_2118188
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints . 2119171_2124671
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug . 2125992_2129402
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa . 2129466_2132436
and there's a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa . 2132952_2139682
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom . 2140705_2149365
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this . 2149656_2154206
the little boy is crying . 2155376_2156586
doesn't look like we had much fun at this birthday party (be)cause it leaves it right there . 2159036_2166576
but there she is . 2167529_2168609
everybody's unhappy . 2169003_2170343
but I'm gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down . 2171464_2175754
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out <that was> [//] that the dog chewed on . 2176255_2183645
and the little boy stopped crying . 2184835_2186235
and everybody came in and they had a wonderful party . 2186286_2188296
don't you wish real life was like that ? [+ exc] 2190972_2192162

we have a little household setting here . 2255673_2257703
we're in the living room . 2257814_2258824
and husband and wife . 2259498_2260728
"husband's sitting in the chair trying to read his newspaper, clearly angry, mouth wide open . 2261167_2267237"
"and what we assume is his wife is standing in front of him, pointing at him in a very menacing way . 2268123_2275023"
in the next picture we see husband with <paper up> [//] &=ges
and the wife heading for the door with her coat on and a suitcase . 2283644_2287684
she has had it . 2288288_2289018
looks as though as soon as she goes out the door the door closes husband was sad . 2291569_2300019
possibly remorseful . 2301152_2302452
thinking of the things he should have said . 2303229_2305269
thinking of the things he should not have said . 2305314_2307664
and all that kind o(f) stuff . 2307762_2308752
what's he going to do ? 2309140_2309650
he doesn't know . 2310058_2310498
it shouldn't have gone this far . 2310731_2312691
door opens . 2315205_2315525
he looks over his shoulder . 2316736_2317556
it's his wife . 2319397_2319757
she's back . 2320054_2320274
he can't believe it . 2321742_2322622
she forgave him for whatever it was he did which he doesn't really know it was . 2323372_2328152
so ‡ they embrace . 2329619_2331019
and they're both very happy . 2332431_2334371
and in the middle of the embrace the husband looks out the open door . 2334598_2338998
and he sees the family car &=throat

okay . [+ exc] 2415936_2416366
set the scene here . [+ exc] 2416825_2417775
here we have what [/] what appears to be an emergency . 2418540_2421750
and how do we know this ? 2421999_2423149
because we have a fire truck on the street and [//] &+f that goes by this large tree . 2423264_2429464
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder . 2429666_2434416
&-hm ! [+ exc] 2435826_2436126
so ‡ we look at the tree . 2436579_2437789
and we have a dog barking up the tree . 2438348_2440518
bark@o bark@o bark@o <what's he> [//] what is he barking at ? 2440738_2442828
well ‡ there's a little bird up there but <I don't> [//] &+th he's not barking at the bird . 2442847_2446227
&=gasps we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree . 2447204_2451814
well ‡ what +//? 2452093_2452233
wait a second . [+ exc] 2452491_2452881
what is he doing up there ? 2453198_2453878
so ‡ we look a_little further and we see a kitty_cat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man . 2455983_2466933
"and beneath the kitty_cat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying +""/. 2467131_2473341"
"+"" go kitty jump . 2473663_2474543"
"+"" come kitty come down . 2474740_2476030"
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder . 2476651_2481021
now this [/] this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree . 2481982_2487292
can't get down . 2487803_2488693
dad went up after the kitty_cat . 2488757_2490717
got stuck up there . 2490949_2491869
the dog is yelping . 2492637_2493547
he's barking . 2493600_2494280
and someone called the firemen . 2495437_2496527
and then they're coming to rescue first the father and then the kitty_cat . 2496768_2501408
and it's a happy ending (be)cause the little girl gets her kitty cat back . 2501882_2504692

I better pay attention . 2555953_2556813
that is an easy one because it's fairly recent . 2579728_2583268
<the the> [/] &+s the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes . 2584619_2595109
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition . 2596162_2608482
