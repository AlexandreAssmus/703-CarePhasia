well ‡ I was out_of work for about eight weeks . 50439_53959
I was in the hospital for about fourteen days . 55210_56750
yeah . 58869_59089
I was pretty sick . 59795_60375
my current favorite story is &-um a day last year ? 73551_79101
it might have been the year before last . 79486_80956
it was <Christmas time> [//] getting towards Christmas time . 81199_83599
and I was to meet some friends for lunch at Zaytinia downtown . 84335_89215
and I realized when I got down there that I was an hour early . 90703_93623
it was kinda cold . 94965_96185
DC sets up a &-um a kind of a Christmas bazaar down on G_Street ? 97384_104214
I guess it's G_Street . 104705_105595
and they had closed the street to traffic . 106843_108933
and there were wonderful little kiosks along the street with really nice stuff . 109051_114451
and I was kinda cold so I bought a wool beret . 115263_118753
and then I felt fine . 119600_120990
I walked around . 121740_122410
and <I walked> [//] I was walking up Seventh_Street . 122607_124867
and up ahead of me on the right in descending letters it said Regal_Cinema . 126468_132978
just across the street was another sign also descending that said Legal_Seafood . 135578_140498
and on the window of the bank facing me right below that sign was coming soon Eagle_Bank . 142276_150446
<I love> [/] I love Washington . 155012_156692
okay . [+ exc] 170168_170288
I make up a story ? [+ exc] 170361_171161
okay . [+ exc] 172274_172554
okay ‡ we've got a [/] a [/] a perfectly okay little boy playing with a soccer ball . 178843_185443
and he kicks it . 185956_186146
"and it goes through the window of the house , probably his own house . 187139_192749"
"and it breaks the window, knocks over a lamp, and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father . 194043_203463"
"who then picks up the ball, stares out the window, and probably swears <at the> [/] at the little boy . 204344_211534"
&-um this is another little boy . 216760_218450
they're a_lot_of trouble . 219116_219906
&-um this little boy does not want to take an umbrella to school . 220589_227449
you can tell he's going to school because he's got his backpack on . 228799_231879
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella . 232078_233268
"and he's saying +""/. 233808_235538"
"+"" nope . 236668_236748"
and he walks out the door and waves goodbye . 237104_238304
and it starts raining on him . 238484_240614
and he runs home . 241543_243053
and he's soaking wet . 244165_244845
and his mother is frowning at him . 245968_248048
and the next thing you see is him &+wi with [//] walking with an umbrella . 248867_252007
okay . [+ exc] 263270_263780
the cat went up the tree . 265392_266772
the little girl wants her kitty_cat down . 268042_271172
and the father clearly tried to go up the tree and get it . 272698_277788
and he got up there . 278845_279405
and the ladder fell . 279597_280647
okay . [+ exc] 283809_284389
&-um Cinderella's father married &-um for the second time when &-um Cinderella's mother had died . 285280_293120
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters . 293740_298610
"and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her &-um clean the fireplaces , hence the name Cinderella . 299680_315250"
and do other menial work . 315634_317434
"+"" &-um at some point the prince of the (.) whatever (.) principality it was &-um was in need of a wife . 318623_331273"
"said his father and the <I don't know> [//] (.) minister of whatever (.) marriages +"". 331325_340445"
so ‡ they cooked up a scheme to have a ball . 341369_344499
and &-um they sent out invitations to &-um all the eligible young women (.) in the principality . 345699_359269
Cinderella got one but she of_course <could not> [//] did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation . 361075_372335
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with &-um white horses and a footman and so_forth . 374102_391382
so ‡ she was able to go to the ball . 391814_393624
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight . 393806_397576
she went to the ball . 398659_399679
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated . 399805_404525
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love . 404786_409566
midnight came . 411716_412936
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be out_of there . 413171_418651
so ‡ she hurried away . 419728_422598
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her . 422856_433386
&-um she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth . 435277_446417
but she managed to get home anyway . 447052_449082
and &-um later (.) the [/] &-um the prince was very depressed . 450169_458789
he had fallen in love with this woman . 458883_460613
and she had disappeared . 460726_461576
all he had left was a glass slipper . 461838_463838
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else . 464147_468417
"so ‡ the [//] his father , who I guess was the king , and the minister of marriages &-um went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on . 469457_487297"
and of_course it would not fit anyone at all (.) including the two unpleasant stepsisters . 487726_494776
even_though I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit [//] try to fit in . 496220_502900
but it still didn't work . 502951_503911
and it got blood all over the place . 503934_505414
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper . 506215_514365
it was Cinderella . 514465_515525
and of_course she was just &-um &-um a sladey@n . 515609_520019
but he insisted that she try it on . 520764_522884
and sure enough it fit . 523025_524416
so ‡ he had found his bride . 525057_527087
and there was great celebration throughout the land . 527143_528993
and they got married and lived happily ever after . 529067_531487
how I would make a peanut butter and &+je +... [+ exc] 538008_539598
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it . [+ exc] 540025_543215
but I [//] <you would> [//] I would take two pieces of bread . 544124_546144
and I'd put peanut butter on one using a knife . 546160_549140
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread . 549948_555488
and then I'd put the two together . 555507_556867
and I would probably slice it . 557417_559027
(be)cause it would be for a kid I'd probably slice it in quarters . 559251_562021
