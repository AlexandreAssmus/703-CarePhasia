and they made her do all the cleaning . 212512_213462
and they made her do everything . 213562_214782
and she just kind_of had a sad isolated life where I think her mother died when she was very young or something . 214884_220414
and &-um then &-uh one day I think a fairy godmother granted her &-um three wishes . 221179_229959
