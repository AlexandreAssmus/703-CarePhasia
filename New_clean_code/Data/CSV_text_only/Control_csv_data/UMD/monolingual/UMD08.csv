well ‡ here's a neighborhood guy playing soccer . 16892_20612
kicking the soccer ball . 20666_21676
and oops ‡ he kicked it too hard . 21699_24029
and it went right through his neighbor's window into the neighbor's lap while he was relaxing . 24242_31212
and so then the neighbor looked out the window with the ball . 32040_37181
and that's the end of these pictures but I imagine that he found the guy and asked him to <repay or> [//] correct the mistake . 37756_47716
(..) oh . [+ exc]
okay . 110576_110606
I guess mom offered (.) a young child an umbrella to go out .
"and the boy of_course said +""/."
"+"" no ‡ I just don't need this umbrella ."
and he goes out .
and he starts walking .
and &-um he may be walking to school (be)cause he has a backpack .
and it's starting to rain .
and it's starting to rain really hard .
and he's getting really wet .
and he's really unhappy .
so ‡ then he goes home to mom . 110606_146763
and he walks in really sopping wet . 146810_149700
and mom doesn't look too happy either because he is really sopping wet .
and finally he takes the umbrella and goes to school .
okay . [+ exc]
&-um the dog chased the cat up the tree as often happens .
&-um and the girl is very upset .
and she wants to get the cat down .
so ‡ she tries to get her dad to the climb the tree to get the cat .
and he's not too successful .
