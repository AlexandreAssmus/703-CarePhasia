okay . 22102_22382
I do very well speaking English . 26346_27666
I'm a native English speaker . 27711_28761
"I've been speaking since , I guess , the normal age . 28782_31982"
when do kids start to speak ? 32118_33158
a couple of +//? 33472_33902
"young , very young . 34772_35482"
and I've been reading pretty young . [+ gram] 35497_37047
I've learned [//] sort_of self-taught myself to read when I was about four . 37099_42339
so ‡ I was reading pretty well by kindergarten . 42407_43917
"my speech is , I think , fluent and generally understandable . 45894_50204"
I talk a_little fast sometimes . 50251_53011
that's about it . 53065_54075
no ‡ not really „ no . 60410_61530
not that I know of . 67198_67908
yes ‡ my mother had a stroke . 70719_71799
and my grandfather had two small strokes . 72326_74206
my grandfather's strokes or my mother's ? 76942_78222
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four . 79278_80828
so ‡ she was very young . 81014_81784
they think it was because she had &-um blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx <in her> [/] &-um in her atria . 82158_93248
and &-uh then she you_know unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid . 93652_99882
and it basically took out essentially a fist-sized portion of her left hemisphere . 99933_103743
&-um so ‡ it's left her pretty severely impaired . 103765_107055
&-um my grandfather's strokes were smaller . 107648_109698
I believe they were right hemisphere . 110334_112104
he had some serious apraxia . 112262_114002
but he had no evidence of aphasia . 114189_115979
he was still able to read and write and did not make a_lot_of effort to speak . 116025_121025
I was fairly young . 121326_123276
&-um and he was [*] &-mm hemiparesis and used a wheelchair . 123325_129764
but again he also just was very stubborn . 129818_131868
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all . 132022_136342
he just sort_of refused to do it . 136644_137964
so ‡ he kind_of just lived in his own head for the last &-um maybe ten years of his life . 138130_142570
she's been pretty good . 148113_148883
"&-um it's been ten and a half years now , almost eleven years . 148933_152963"
yeah ‡ it's been a long time . 153775_154755
&-uh she's been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then . 155046_158626
&-um initially she did &-uh about a month +... 158971_161431
<initially she was> [//] after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute . 162459_166979
so ‡ she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname . 167142_173652
she was there for about a month . 174317_175437
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks . 175620_177470
&-um and actually no sorry ‡ she went home . 178721_182531
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a &-uh hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting . 182550_189730
"&-um and then , after that , went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks . 189781_194501"
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT &-uh and got to about the +//. 194828_200258
she was not as cooperative with that . 201108_202548
she found it very uncomfortable . 202718_204048
and [//] right ‡ and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress . 205718_212818
especially given that she was not willing <to> [/] to work at home besides doing &-um range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own . 212938_220798
she's very good about that . 220849_221789
so ‡ we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay out_of physical therapy . 222128_226878
and she [//] she's doing that . 226895_228705
<and then> [//] but we [/] we continue to do speech therapy . 229130_231180
"we've done it here for at this point , I guess , almost ten years . 231200_234670"
and &-um she's done a mix of group and individual . 235211_237551
and she goes to an adult daycare program where she's very social . 237687_241057
we don't spend a_lot_of time with friends outside of that . 242686_245956
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then . 246010_247960
but we hafta make an effort unless she's sick or has something else going on to get out_of the house at least once a day even if it's just for a small short activity . 248016_255736
<it can> [//] it's [/] it's hard . 262194_263794
it takes a_lot_of time and effort . 263843_266333
"and for her , &-uh not every activity is easy . 266350_269480"
&-um so +... 270357_270857
see ‡ now you make me wanna think of a really good story . 283807_285927
well ‡ I've told you about my mom . 286381_287811
that's probably the [//] like the singular event that's most significant . 287862_291162
okay ‡ I'll tell you a story . 292229_293059
this is a story &-um about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird . 295054_303064
but it's so clear in my mind and it still doesn't make any sense . 303595_307015
so ‡ <my first semester of> [//] my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname . 307062_312502
but my family was from DC . 312521_313701
and I had a car . 313977_314977
&-uh so ‡ I would drive back and forth over break time with my car . 316441_319661
&-um it's about a thousand miles . 319990_321360
so ‡ it generally takes about two days . 321412_322592
"&-uh so ‡ the first semester back , &-um it's winter and I'm driving across I_Eighty which is [//] goes through a bunch of very flat states with a_lot_of corn . 323614_332874"
so ‡ it is an extremely boring repetitive drive . 333170_336210
there is a_lot_of you_know driver tunnel vision that happens . 336233_339863
and it's cold and gray so it's not even pretty green fields . 340575_343705
it's just empty empty empty fields . 343812_345352
&-um but I'm [/] I'm kind_of proud of myself because it's [//] my first semester went well . 346252_349742
"I was you_know independent , excited . 349833_351673"
&-um so ‡ I'm on I_Eighty in sort_of the middle of Illinois . 352141_356011
and there is a slowdown . 356968_358448
and it's very flat so I can see ahead . 359076_361076
I don't see that there is construction . 361129_362239
I don't really see an accident . 362796_363906
"but I you_know figure something's happened , probably a minor accident . 363970_366940"
it looks like it's a rubbernecking delay . 367022_368382
it's kind_of pissing me off . 368429_369239
I_Eighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction . 369437_372557
"&-um and there's &-like no exits , nothing , built along it . 373429_377279"
and we get closer and closer and closer . 378172_379412
and I still cannot see what's going on . 379464_381614
"I'm just like +""/. 381637_382867"
"+"" what could this be ? 383541_385091"
and we get a_little closer . 386402_387402
and I see okay it looks like I'm in the left lane . 387419_391019
&-um and then there's a median between the you_know east bound and west bound routes . 391759_396189
and I'm going east . 396349_397019
&-um and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left . 398314_404244
"and it looks , as I get closer , like an animal . 404318_406578"
and I get closer . 406861_407781
and it looks like a fairly large animal . 407829_409189
"and I'm thinking +""/. 409236_409576"
"+"" is it a cow ? 411694_411824"
"+"" is it a moose ? 412679_414389"
I_mean ‡ there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois . 415124_416644
but <it looks> [/] it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it . 416690_419780
so ‡ I'm a_little more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay . 419827_422727
"but I'm still kind_of internally rolling my eyes going +""/. 422751_424581"
"+"" why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal ? 425137_427547"
"+"" wasting my time . 427621_428121"
"+"" I just wanna get home . 428757_429877"
&-um and I get closer and I can see that there's these kind_of large hind legs . 430555_436855
so ‡ it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car . 436906_441426
and there's kind_of a long tail . 441476_442906
and it's brown . 442925_443765
and it's this big hump . 443816_444826
and I'm getting closer and closer and closer . 445045_448355
"and I [//] you_know my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern matching , going +""/. 448428_452318"

"<and I'm literally> [//] as I'm passing it , &-like my head is &+tu +//. 459295_463895"
you_know ‡ we're just creeping along . 463951_464791
my head is sort_of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view . 464845_468045
"and it's only until it's &-like at my shoulder and I passed it that it [//] my mind kind_of pattern matches and goes +""/. 468339_474119"
"+"" it's a kangaroo . 475027_475947"
and then you_know again I hafta turn around and look at the road . 479810_481400
and everything's cleared up behind me . 481479_482709
"and I spent like the next five miles going +""/. 482733_484743"
"+"" that's no way it was a kangaroo . 485577_487237"
but it wasn't anything else . 487331_489191
it was a kangaroo . 489880_490420
it was clearly a kangaroo . 490577_491407
I saw the ears . 491614_492224
I saw the big massive tail . 492276_493106
I saw the big hind legs . 493286_494416
I saw the little tiny front legs . 494706_495786
it was a kangaroo . 497041_497701
and so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know . 497891_500681
I just don't know . 500823_501903

I'm pretty sure it was a kangaroo . 527469_528589
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that . 528611_532081
so ‡ it's not a significant story . 534977_536127

I don't know . 572068_572508
I don't know . 572663_574053
if it wasn't a kangaroo there'd be no story of it . 574408_576318
it couldn't be anything . 578445_579075
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo . 579127_581127
I_mean ‡ it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind [//] I_mean massive hind feet . 581148_587818

alright so ‡ there's a little boy named Ralph . 626067_629207
Ralph is a science geek kid . 630449_632239

well ‡ I remember Cinderella but I will &-um give it a first shot . 948034_950794
oh_boy . 952367_952697
it's very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella . 957424_968874
okay . 987584_987824
once_upon_a_time there was a little girl named Ella . 990255_992275
she was the &-uh daughter of two loving parents . 993202_995352
"only one day when she's a little girl , her mother dies suddenly . 995773_999173"
it's very tragic . 999410_1000020
everybody cries . 1000262_1000982
everybody loved her mother . 1001031_1001821
"&-uh her father , in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom , goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own . 1002892_1011252"
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures . 1012369_1015719
&-um he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they &-uh immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps . 1016921_1025621
"until the father , partly out_of heartbreak and partly out_of just a really bad diet , also dies . 1025776_1030846"
&-uh at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy . 1031567_1036717
"&-um they make her run around working all the time , then begin mocking her for being dirty . 1037777_1041757"
and they call her Cinderella . 1041810_1042720
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are . 1043963_1047903
so ‡ one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with <all the other brides> [//] all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people . 1048894_1059734
or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball . 1060142_1062092
&-um and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball &-um to meet and hopefully find a match . 1063037_1071287
so ‡ the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this . 1071712_1075242
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns . 1075302_1079332
&-um Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to you_know get out_of the house and to have a bit of glamour . 1080084_1088204
&-uh but of_course they won't let her . 1089143_1090123
