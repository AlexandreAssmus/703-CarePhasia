"when I was a little girl, I may have been eight or nine . 126181_130691"

and I said this line . 151340_155040
"I gave the dog a biscuit , a bone , a biscuit , a bone . 155090_159500"

&-um goes right through the window practically on top of the lap of this guy who's sitting there . 241748_248888

and I don't know whether she's taking it away from him (.) or giving it to him . 276710_283740
in the second one it looks like he's reaching out for it &-um (.) although maybe he just gave it back to her . 283943_291413
and he's outside now without the umbrella . 292461_295871
