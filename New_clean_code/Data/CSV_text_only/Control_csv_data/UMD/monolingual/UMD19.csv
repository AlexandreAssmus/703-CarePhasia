I think I do fairly well . 9737_10997
I think very well . 16508_18008
not fluently . 22334_23634
I've not had a stroke . 28188_29188
"and I guess , no , I've not had a serious illness . 29211_31151"
&-um my sister had a mild stroke years ago . 38556_41366
and this is the same one who just had &-um cardiac surgery &-um about a month ago . 41552_46322
mhm . 47152_47572
well ‡ she's still in the process . 54858_55978
<she's still> [//] she's in a nursing home now . 56000_57400
they took her . 57421_58151
and that was all part of the plan . 58174_59604
she had the surgery . 59828_60898
she had mitral valve whatever (.) or a leaky valve or something . 63447_65747
and &-um so she's in a nursing home now . 66456_68396
and she's feisty as ever . 68909_69849
&-um so ‡ yeah ‡ she's recovering and probably driving everybody crazy . 73204_74954
that's off the record . 75000_75800
a happy memory . 89812_90662
and I've done this in training so I [/] I didn't pull this one <out from> [//] out_of the air . 90795_94435
&-um I was &-um the president of the black alumni association at Collegename in &+m +//. 94601_100331
no ‡ I was the vice [!] president many years ago . 100355_102675
and we had the first black president of Collegename while you_know I was in the post of this &-um office . 103383_110093
and so we invited him <for the community> [//] to meet the community . 110720_114160
and I literally organized everything . 114664_117474
and my father had a liquor store then . 117524_119434
and I had the people in <the liquor &+s store> [//] &-um the liquor business contribute . 119487_123687
and I think people smoked then . 126717_128227
Phillip_Morris contributed cigarettes . 128430_130310
and &-um I had the chemical bank contribute money and had all kinds of you_know cheese . 130809_134269
it was one of the best events they have ever had at the school . 137077_139157
and they have said that . 139206_139946
it was well attended by the whole community of Collegename . 140503_143363
we did an instulement [
we did everything for this guy . 144892_146392
it's still one of the things I like best . 146855_148875
it really was . 151423_152003
exactly . 154952_155412
"and even the president said +""/. 158608_160208"
"+"" you should really have been the president . 160594_161504"
and I could have been . 161667_162417
I just didn't want the job . 162440_163470
I didn't realize I was gonna do his work anyway . 163486_165406
right . 167549_167819
so ‡ the little boy went out to play kickball that day . 180898_184168
<I forget what> [//] it's a soccer ball „ I guess . 184770_186670
and he never expected to [//] when he kicked the ball that it went through <the window> [//] somebody's window and broke it . 186715_192545
went in . 193590_194140
the gentleman who was in the house was shocked by the noise he heard . 194187_198067
and he sees a ball coming . 198335_199845
and he went to the window to find out who did this (be)cause he was gonna go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games .
"oh ‡ okay ‡ just the beginning , middle , and an end ? [+ exc] 213777_215567"
okay ‡ so ‡ then I hafta look at it so you don't hafta hear all my thoughts . [+ exc] 216143_220383
&-um there's a mother getting ready to send her child off to school . 223709_226539
she tried to urge him to take an umbrella . 226921_228361
obviously she's heard the weather report . 228384_230274
he went and he didn't listen to his mother . 231113_232253
so ‡ he went out and got wet . 232491_233741
when he came back he looked very sad . 234640_237690
and his mother looked very annoyed . 237906_238736
and the next time he took an umbrella . 239225_239975
there's a whole lot going on here . [+ exc] 254954_258434
&-um well ‡ okay . [+ exc] 258933_261373
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside . 261732_266812
<and he> [/] and he [//] he's up on a tree for some reason . 269041_270361
oh ‡ there's a ladder so he was obviously trying to do +//. 270633_273693
oh ‡ he was trying to get her cat and [//] &-um from the ladder . 273754_278014
and he [//] the ladder fell . 278859_279449
he's stuck up in the tree . 279726_280676
the daughter is still upset because the cat's still up the tree . 280872_283482
the dog is barking because everything's out_of sorts for him . 284095_285775
"and so the fire engine comes with a ladder , ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them +""/. 287207_292997"
"+"" don't do that again . 293134_293934"
yeah . 301013_302723
not one of my favorite . 304744_306524
I forgot all about this the wicked witch and her stepdaughters . 322873_325673
okay ‡ you hid the text . 326826_328576
you don't want me to know the text . 328685_329985
<I gotta> [/] I gotta make up my own . 330005_330915
and cinder@q means she's sweeping up the cinders from the chimney . 332124_335124
and the ugly stepsisters . 337016_338256
I don't remember this . 339449_339899
they are talking about how there's some young lady they've never seen before . 340782_344122
I don't really remember . 344171_344981
"oh ‡ the invitation , whatever . 345121_347301"
I don't really remember it too well . 347476_348556
not one of my favorite stories but anyway . 348926_351156
&-um so <she> [//] the wicked witch talks about the party . 351965_354585
the sisters don't want her to go . 355757_356677
isn't that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly ? 359069_362509
and then the xxx fairy godmother helps her go . 364405_369245
she captures the eye of the prince charming . 369490_372460
she hasta leave before midnight . 373195_375415
he doesn't know where she is . 375568_376458
she's in her tatters . 376508_377498
and her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin . 378237_380247
the wicked godmother locks her in . 380716_382436
but then they bring the key . 382484_385044
and they take the key to the cellar . 385331_386391
"they try every maiden in the &-um town, whatever they call those old things, parish, to see who the shoe belongs to . 387877_394847"
and it belongs to Cinderella . 396339_397109
and she marries <the prince and gets> [/] prince and gets +... 397245_399415
lives happily ever after . 399984_400544
<Cinderella is this> [//] &-um she's living with <her wicked> [//] the wicked stepmother . 407840_409079
I guess it's her stepmother . 409794_410624
I don't know where her father is . 410642_412852
&-um and the stepmother has these two &-um not attractive daughters . 412868_418298
"and Cinderella , she's very pretty but she's left in tatters and rags . 420135_423725"
her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the [/] you_know the cinders from the whatever$n . 424041_429191
and the fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor . 429330_431810
and so one day there was going to be a ball . 433085_434485
the king +... 435236_435726
and he makes this announcement . 435944_436914
and she wants to go as_well_as <his daughters> [//] her daughters . 437870_442800
&-um but they're figuring whom you you_know . [+ gram] 442975_445515
but her fairy godmother comes along to the rescue and tells her she will make [//] &-um you_know turn +...
get me a pumpkin and some rats whatever . 445768_448398
and the pumpkin will be your coach . 453025_453865
other rats will be your coachmen „ I think . 454001_455581
she gets her a great dress or something to wear . 455640_457630
"her hair , they don't even talk about all that . 458763_459973"
and so she goes . 462829_463019
and &-um the prince is dancing with all the young ladies but she captures his eye . 463565_467125
and &-um he dances with her . 468609_470119
and of_course it's love at first sight . 471292_472242
and she realizes at the stroke of midnight she hasta be home . 472538_474748
so ‡ she runs out there before he can find out who she is . 474768_477928
and &-um in running she drops one of her slippers . 478094_481534
she runs into the coach which turns into a pumpkin before she can get home „ I think . 481662_486452
<the rats &+t turn> [//] the coachmen turn into rats and whatever . 486521_488651
so ‡ the [/] <the king> [//] the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to . 489043_495433
he's gonna go to every house and &-um see if the shoe fits .
and the fairy godmother <is like> [//] she's trying to get her daughters <now I remember this> [//] their big feet into the shoes . 500673_505563
no ‡ it doesn't work . 506078_506988
"and they say +""/. 507338_507738"

but it's her „ you_know . 511061_511281
it's [//] &-um so ‡ she sits down . 512070_513470
and they [//] the shoe fits perfectly . 513818_515628
he knows he's found his princess . 515777_517227
and he whisks her off . 518020_518740
and they get married . 518916_519626
and they live happily ever after . 519778_520568
that's a long story . [+ exc] 521905_523304
okay . [+ exc] 526859_527669
how I would make it ? [+ exc] 534909_535959
from the word go@q . [+ exc] 537515_539385
go to the cabinet and take down a jar of peanut butter . 539742_542542
I'd probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something . 543967_548887
so ‡ I'd go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out . 548939_550719
and go to the refrigerator where I also keep my bread . 551535_554025
take out two slices of bread . 554041_555071
I'd <put them> [//] open them there . 556367_557277
I would take the peanut butter first . 557328_559018
and smear it <on the> [//] on one side of the bread . 560432_562672
pretty thick though . 563700_564260
I like a_lot_of food . 564320_565160
then I'd take the jelly and put that on (.) over top of the peanut butter (.) still on the same side . 565684_573754
and I would take the other side and put it down . 574078_576168
and then I would take it and cut it in half . 576276_578036
and then I would start eating it . 578799_579559
