well ‡ not bad . 36639_37669
I've given several speeches . 37720_39300
&-um haltingly . 46692_48032
&-um (.) I've had &-um (.) &-uh prestroke incidents . 54159_60659
TIAs . 61887_62627
serious illness „ yes . 63287_64456
I was &-um flat on my back for a year at age ten with &-uh rheumatic fever . 65194_71215
the days before there were antibiotics . 72282_74652
so ‡ there was no way to cure it . 74809_75959
and I was one of the few who survived at that time . 77616_80016
that was one of the close calls . 81122_82312
&-hm well ‡ I [/] &-uh <I was> [//] &-uh when [/] when they told me I could get up I &-uh was very happy . 88827_96977
and I was gonna go out and play baseball . 96997_99097
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed . 99145_102165
I hadta learn to walk again . 102339_103439
&-um (.) so ‡ (.) I got into all sorts of athletic activities . 105022_110672
&-um my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again . 112586_117476
and &-uh he also bought a &-uh one arm printing press (be)cause he wanted me to exercise on this printing press . 119086_126006
so ‡ I went into business &-uh printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve . 127142_134572
&-uh but I [/] I maintained &-uh some form of athleticism all the way <up until> [//] &-uh up [/] up [/] up until the time that I &-uh enlisted <in the> [/] in the navy . 136423_151183
I was a &-uh long distance runner in school . 151245_154375
I played basketball with half hour quarters . 155047_158497
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time [=! laughs] . 160386_165046
&-um (.) and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and (.) got into as much of that as I could . 165979_173299
and &-uh I think it (.) had a salutary effect . 174939_178789
that's the &-um naval air core flight test which is the toughest &-uh physical . 182431_187001
it's four days of &-uh physical examinations &-um as_well_as &-um &-um academic . 188202_197762
you hadta be at the top [/] top ten percent of your class to get started . 198548_202258
then came the physical . 202478_203638
that was a challenge . 205347_206267
and so that's why I got into the navy . 206744_208574
ye(a)h ‡ <there's no> [/] there's no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever . 214085_217605
&-um <the few other people who survived> [/] the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort . 218987_229507
"and &-uh the first time I went through the navy exam they said +""/. 231166_234226"
"+"" well ‡ you've had rheumatic fever . 234566_235256"
"+"" you have a heart condition . 235469_236089"
"+"" get out . 237561_237891"
so ‡ when I went back again I [/] I checked to make sure I didn't . 238163_242893
and then I went back again . 243194_244474
and I didn't fill out the paper first . 244539_246579
"I went through the exam and <got through> [//] got to the end and they said +""/. 246783_251523"
"+"" &-uh well ‡ have you had any conditions ? 253019_254719"
"+"" yes ‡ rheumatic fever . 255031_255921"
"+"" well ‡ you [/] you can't be here then . 256059_257829"
"and I said +""/. 257875_258336"
"+"" well ‡ I just passed your exam . 258531_259382"
"+"" well ‡ alright ‡ if you wanna go , go . 259858_261849"
oh ‡ there's so many . 275109_275919
what kind of a story do you wanna hear ? 276942_278192
&-uh (.) well ‡ there [/] <there was> [/] there was one &-uh interesting time &-uh <when I was> [/] &-uh when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasn't working . 281142_298102
we [/] <we had a> [/] we had a good program by all appearances . 298508_302608
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms . 303412_306542
and they looked like an army . 306565_307855
and they'd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight . 307872_311492
and still malaria . 311511_312701
why ? 312773_312913
so ‡ I went out looking for answers . 315092_316782
and on this one occasion I drove for [//] across this desert area for <about oh> [//] musta been six hours . 317597_326007
I'd been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark . 326911_329781
and I'm getting a_little concerned . 331149_332009
I was also warned about the Danakil people &-uh also called Afars . 333657_338597
very &-um (.) no &-uh I don't think you'd call it hostile . 339917_346297
but they didn't have many friends because their [/] their [//] &-uh the way they qualify for marriage +//. 346432_353352
they had these mass weddings that were made . 353758_355828
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body . 356599_365069
"so ‡ (.) after about six hours &-uh we happened upon this little group of tuples@n , round mud houses . 366970_376340"
and we stopped the &-uh Landrover . 378449_380349
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys . 380463_384203
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars . 384295_386565
"I thought +""/. 386617_388217"
"+"" boy ‡ I shouldn't be here . 388492_389122"
"and it turned out that about a third of the community , maybe more , were down with malaria . 391433_396323"
and they assumed that I was a physician because they'd [//] &+on the only white people they had seen before were physicians . 398930_405000
just by sheer accident I had a car full of (.) medication . 406188_411728
so ‡ for about the next two hours I was a physician [=! laughs] . 412962_415852
peering under eyelids and [/] and baby bottoms and [/] and administering this medicine . 417429_423049
and &-uh at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy . 423101_428711
and suddenly the chief appeared . 429071_430911
"seven feet high , long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice . 432527_439457"
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests . 441432_448442
"I said +""/. 448527_449587"
"+"" what's that ? 449729_450049"
"they said +""/. 450094_452004"
"+"" smoked camel's milk . 452798_453728"
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days . 455221_457971
"I said +""/. 458018_458248"
"+"" apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but +... 459790_463570"
"and the driver kicked me and he said +""/. 464819_466509"
"+"" you've been doing fine up until now „ FirstnameJ . 466651_468331"
"+"" don't ruin it . 468450_469230"
so ‡ we had smoked camel's milk . 470371_471581
it's better than Pepto_Bismol . 472782_474502
it really works . 474623_476353
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds . 476406_478286
and the chief got a big smile on his face . 478307_480187
it all ended well . 480237_482267
I don't know whether this is in your interview or not . 496431_498491
but &-um at my age I very often &-uh forget the word that I want to say . 498538_506428
and it's getting a_little worse [=! laughs] . 509083_510613
names especially . 541805_542765
well ‡ the dad sends the son out to get a_little exercise . 562325_566425
and (.) he finds the soccer ball ending in his lap . 566821_573011
"and he looks out there and he says +""/. 575240_576530"
"+"" good shot „ son . 576951_577681"
end of story . 577704_581034
oh ‡ this reminds me of my childhood . [+ exc] 606694_609084
&-um (..) mom wants son to take an umbrella with him . 614598_617548
"and he says +""/. 617570_617920"
"+"" I don't need that . 618222_619012"
"+"" &-um it's just something to get in the way . 623115_626215"
and is surprised on his trip by running into a rain storm . 628278_633948
he comes home drenching wet . 637259_639419
"mother says +""/. 639809_639969"
"+"" I told you so . 640595_641485"
and son has learned a lesson . 642760_645500
just like my childhood . [+ exc] 651600_652500
&=laughs this [/] this is an instant right out_of my life . [+ exc] 656870_665280

"and the dad says +""/. 672166_672386"
"+"" well ‡ I'll go fetch it . 672689_673949"
why is the dog barking ? 675665_676655
I don't know . [+ exc] 676709_677189
possibly because there's a man in the tree . 677476_679246
&-uh and in the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder . 681184_688434
somebody called for help . 690930_692280
here comes the firemen to get him out_of the tree . 692565_695405
this happened to the fellow next door to me . 697648_699088
&-uh when I had a house nearby he got up on the roof to repair it and &-uh accidentally kicked down the ladder . 700016_709946
"and he called me over and said +""/. 710000_711860"
"+"" can you pick the ladder up ? 712135_713365"
"and I said +""/. 713441_713641"
"+"" well ‡ not for a while . 714678_715498"
"+"" I wanna call the neighbors here . 715633_716673"
"+"" maybe I can charge admission to see this . 716760_718530"
mhm . 729113_729443
vaguely . 730506_730856
this goes way back . 736135_737265
wow ‡ I don't remember this version . 748752_751012
ye(a)h . 755150_755320

something missing here . 825744_826714
oh ‡ there it is . 828016_828756
&-hm ‡ what's with the key ? 839128_840378
I don't (.) remember that part . 840527_842127
0 [=! humming] . 848753_848963
and I don't remember those (.) first two pages . 856214_862854
but I gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who (.) lives on an estate . 862971_874471
"and &-uh (.) <is &-um> [/] is to have a &-um ball , maybe coming out party . 874491_885521"
I don't know . 886839_887119
is that the way the story goes ? 888112_889772
mhm . [+ exc] 898331_898671
"well ‡ as I recall , Cinderella and [/] and her (.) sisters were all workers in this estate . 901177_911327"
"and &-uh (.) she, being the youngest one, was the most discriminated against . 912637_921287"
the others &-uh &-uh treated her badly . 921335_924715
"she always got the worst tasks to perform , (.) and longed for a different life . 924732_934642"
"&-uh (.) I don't remember the bit about the key , &-uh her +/. [+ exc] 937194_940914"
her sister locks her in the room . 944308_946428
I don't know . [+ exc] 946481_946911
&-uh (.) well ‡ that comes a_little later . 947080_953230
a fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because she's been such a (.) good person . 953488_960858
and &-uh &-uh (.) the arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight . 960912_972012
and &-uh (.) at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her . 972032_982782
&-uh but then hasta flee &-uh on schedule to avoid (.) the [//] &-uh (.) being converted back into a chambermaid . 984289_996549
"and in the process , loses her shoe . 998988_1001898"
"the &-uh handsome gentleman , &-uh upon [/] upon discovering the shoe , determines he's gonna look for a person that [/] &-uh that that fits . 1003837_1015517"
&-uh (.) and the evil sisters are determined it's gonna be one of them . 1017455_1022875
so ‡ that must be where the key comes in . 1024694_1027145
they lock her room . 1027425_1028376
<I don't know> [//] I don't recall how she gets out . 1029434_1031914
but at any rate &-uh it's eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits . 1033224_1040855
and everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters . 1041080_1044911
almond butter . [+ exc] 1056408_1056998
