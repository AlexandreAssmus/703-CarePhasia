&-um a little boy is out playing ball . 224222_227872
and he's kicking the ball . 227925_230255
and the ball goes through a window . 230270_233240
and we see that it goes right into a person's home . 233289_240549
the person is sitting only a few feet away . 240568_242978
and it knocks over the lamp . 243029_247279
&-uh and the person gets up and looks to see what just happened . 247337_254507
&-um okay (.) <I> [//] well (.) a mother and a little boy . 278575_283165
and the mother is trying to give her son an umbrella . 285277_287587

"and he tells his mom +""/. 291544_293624"
"+"" no ‡ I don't want the umbrella . 294060_295180"
and he walks outside . 295333_298373
and it's raining out . 298425_300095
and it starts raining even harder . 300154_302864
and he runs back home . 306523_308113
and was soaking wet . 308166_309136
"and his mom's looking at him like +""/. 309199_310519"
"+"" I told you to bring an umbrella . 311661_312781"
and so now he has the umbrella . 312804_315264
and now he's much happier . 315283_316663
&-uh (.) okay <I> [/] I see +... 333088_338658
there's a little girl . 339790_341100
and she sees there's a man stuck in the tree . 341148_344328

and there's a cat stuck in the tree . 350913_353473
and there's a man stuck in the tree . 353490_355400
and the little girl is (.) in distress . 355545_360135
and &-um it looks like the [/] the man was trying to rescue the cat but he got stuck too . 361483_368473
and now the firemen are coming . 368519_371449

okay . 455028_455118
&-um (.) alright . [+ exc] 456282_458542
so ‡ Cinderella is the story of a young (.) woman who &-um +... 458558_463208
she is very poor . 463369_464119
and she lives with her aunt and her &-uh three &+steps +//. 464142_470792
well ‡ (.) no ‡ actually it was her stepmother and her three stepsisters . 471421_477041
and &-um they [/] they treat her very badly because she's the [/] the steprelative . 477145_486055
"and they make her do all of the work around the house, the cooking, the cleaning, and [//] while they sit around and eat bonbons and take baths . 487178_495718"
&-um and one day they (.) let her come to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing this lavish party for his son and is going to be looking for a bride . 495769_511869
and the stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince will want to marry one of her three daughters . 511918_520498
and Cinderella hears about it . 522044_525404
and the stepmother says you_know she's gonna hafta help to make the dresses <for the> [//] for her daughters . 527449_533839
and [/] &-um and she can stay at the house while they go to this fancy party . 534066_540306
and they you_know all get all excited and get ready and go . 541844_546264
and while &-um Cinderella's at home (.) cleaning up her fairy godmother comes and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball . 546309_559939
and she waves her magic wand . 559991_562501
and &-um the pumpkin turns into a stage coach . 562522_569132
and her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown . 569232_573152
and &-um she's whisked away to this lavish party . 573168_579778
and [/] &-um and she's &-uh also given these glass slippers to wear . 581076_588286
and [/] &-um <and she> [//] (.) of_course (..) she comes into this party . 589407_598627
"and nobody recognizes that it's her , including her stepmother and her stepsisters . 598649_604829"
&-um and so she's this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party . 606182_610102
and of_course the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the (.) stepsisters .
he dances with her . 616945_618335
and they immediately fall in love . 619272_620472
<and she> [//] &-um and they have a [/] a dance . 621531_626351
and (.) in the middle of this dance she remembers her [//] &+god her fairy godmother's instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken . 627362_640082
and so she realizes that it's almost midnight . 641886_644316
and she runs from the palace . 644706_645956
and in doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes . 646180_650810
and &-um <she goes> [//] she gets home just in time . 652333_655663
and &-um (.) you_know she [//] <when the> [/] when the stepmother and the stepsisters come home she you_know is [/] is home in her tattered clothes again . 657893_669983
and she's cleaning . 670345_671265
and she asks them how the party went . 673242_673912
and they [/] they're not happy because the prince didn't notice them of_course . 676685_678815
&-um but then <the prince> [//] he wants to find this mysterious girl . 679706_686446
and the only way that he has to find her is the glass slipper that he found . 686943_692703
and [//] but he decides he's going to go <to every house> [//] to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on . 693991_705501
and that will be the way he will identify this girl . 705870_708100
and so he eventually arrives at the stepmother's house . 709546_714086
and of_course the three girls run right over because they [/] they know <that they're gonna one> [//] that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly .
and of_course none of them do because their feet are too big . 728780_729830
and they [//] the stepmother figures out that the [/] the shoe belongs to Cinderella . 733818_739368
and she tries to hide Cinderella . 739491_740141
<but the> [//] I think it was the fairy godmother who (.) who comes along and rescues Cinderella . 741316_747186
or maybe it was the mice . 749213_750923
anyway they [/] (.) they free Cinderella . 750943_753683
and the prince sees her and has her put on the shoe . 756916_759366
and of_course it fits . 760235_760525
and everything is just wonderful . 762749_763209
and they get married . 763421_763741
okay . [+ exc] 773102_773542
&-um I would get two slices of bread . 773558_777638
and I would put peanut butter on both slices of bread . 777941_785991
and then I would take the jelly . 786228_789038
and I would put it on one slice of the bread . 789397_792387
and then I would put the one slice of bread on top of the other . 792576_798876
