(.) I do great speaking English . 6143_7163
that's my native language . 7382_8682
I speak a little bit of Spanish . 13916_15516
I've never had a stroke . 21701_22771
&-um serious illness ? 24160_27240
I don't consider it a serious illness . 28852_30522
"ongoing , I guess , chronic pain . 31571_33851"
yes . 43184_43694
<I have had> [//] yes . 44636_45876
&-um (.) a serious illness ? 51492_55862
&-um my mother has had Eosinophilic Fascitis . 58109_63399
&-um years ago at age forty eight . 65494_67914
&-um and has slowly gotten better from that . 68663_71883

oh okay . [+ exc] 133701_134131
okay ‡ so ‡ I just tell you what happened in picture one ? [+ exc] 135534_137604
okay . [+ exc] 144465_144575
so ‡ there was a little boy who was kicking a soccer ball . 145214_150064
and he kicked it (.) outside . 150422_150542
and it went into a window . 154955_159165
and then it broke the window . 160223_163653
oh ‡ I see . [+ exc] 166518_167148
and then it hit a lamp . 167720_169280
and (.) then (.) this man +... 174860_177650
oh okay . [+ exc] 180707_181277
the ball landed „ I guess . 181500_184980
the man that caught the ball . 185042_186242
<and he saw> [//] he looked out the window at the broken glass . 187648_191648
okay . [+ exc] 215402_215672
<so in the first &+pi picture> [//] okay ‡ so ‡ the mom is gonna hand (.) a little boy an umbrella . 217852_225362
&-um it looks like he's gonna go somewhere (.) with a backpack on . 226863_230143
then he goes outside . 231101_233391
and it starts raining . 233501_234321
oh ‡ he steps in a puddle . 236650_238100
and his hair's wet . 241683_242763
oh ‡ he came home . 244501_245831
<his hair> [//] his mom is angry at him . 248037_251257
I think his mom is angry at him . 252189_253469
maybe she's angry at him because his hair is wet ? 255155_257404
<then he went> [//] maybe he forgot to use the umbrella . 257846_262206
I'm not sure . 263465_263535
then he went back outside . 263698_264728
and he used the umbrella . 266298_267428
was that right ? [+ exc] 272133_272563
okay . [+ exc] 301473_301753

<I see a> [//] and there's [/] there's a cat in a tree . 308181_311671
and let's see . [+ exc] 316530_316860
the girl is trying to get her cat down . 318122_319982
so ‡ maybe the dad climbed up the ladder to help get her cat down . 320287_328247
oh ‡ then the ladder fell +//. 328728_331568
maybe he used the ladder to get the cat down . 331634_333484
then the ladder fell down . 333676_337066
she's trying to catch this cat maybe ? 339019_341509
I don't know why these people are here . 343524_344884
maybe they're comin(g) to help get the cat down . 346710_348790
and (.) I don't know why he's upset . 354678_356908
I don't know what the dog is doing . 360986_362416
is that it ? [+ exc] 367404_367884
how I would make one ? [+ exc] 377810_379060
I would use two pieces of bread . 380599_382929
and I would put them down on the table . 384338_385858
and then I would take the peanut butter out_of the cabinet . 387947_391287
and I would take the jelly out_of the refrigerator where I keep it . 392229_393819
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread . 394901_398161
and then I would use a knife for that . 399284_400884
<and I would probably use the same knife and put it in the &+jel or> [//] I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread . 409797_409897
and I put the two pieces of bread together . 409907_411437
and then I would cut them either in half or on a diagonal . 412575_414985
and then that would be it . 416838_417558
and then I would wrap it in cellophane . 419645_421845
for one of the boys to take to school . 424826_426236
and then I'd put it in the freezer . 426529_427259
because I make five at a time . 428192_428792
