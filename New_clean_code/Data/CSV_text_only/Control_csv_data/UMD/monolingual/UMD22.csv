sure ‡ &-um happy memory &-uh when I got married and when I had children . 76669_83379

living the dream ! 101529_102489
I would first get the peanut butter out_of the cabinet . 120046_124556
I would get the jelly out_of the refrigerator . 125033_127293
I'd take them back over to the counter . 128148_130138
"I'd pull out a plate, come over and get a knife, then go over and get the bread out_of the bread bin . 130152_138573"
take out two slices . 139307_140417
and I would &-uh put the peanut butter on first one slice and then the jelly on the other . 148400_149400
and then fold them and combine them together . 149530_151290
okay . [+ exc] 159526_160106
&-uh I see a boy out on the field . 161259_163579
and he is (.) kicking a soccer ball . 164916_169026
and the boy is kicking the ball into the air . 170016_172716
and it seems like the ball is (.) in the second picture going through <a window> [//] &-uh the window of a house . 174733_183183
not sure if it's his house or a neighbor's house . 184035_186475
but it's breaking the window and going inside . 188655_189465
to the third picture where there is a gentleman who is sitting in a chair . 190106_194436
"don't know if that's a family member , father , or a neighbor . 195308_198618"
but it breaks through the window . 199203_201103
and the ball comes right at him . 201784_203334
and the man in the picture seems to be &-uh a_lot older . 204348_209248
probably very scared and startled . 210188_212228
and he (.) going into the fourth frame picks the ball up and looks out the broken window to [/] to see if he could see who (.) kicked the ball through the window . 213556_223946
I see a [/] (.) &-uh a lady and a smaller child . 232939_234029
"I do not know if it's a mother , daughter . 234118_236598"
the lady is holding an umbrella . 237704_239364
they seem to be talking . 239624_241264
and in the second it seems to be a little girl but not sure . 243051_247331
"the second frame , they seem to be continuing the discussion . 248298_251648"
and the older lady seems to be holding the umbrella and listening to the child . 253543_258053
and it seems like the child is discussing the fact that he or she does not need the umbrella . 258992_264802
and the child goes out (.) &-uh into the &-um outside in frame three . 265857_270657
and <they notice> [//] he or she notices it's starting to rain . 272260_275790
and he or she puts her hand out &-uh and feels the raindrops . 276665_280515
and this child's going somewhere (be)cause there's a backpack on his or her shoulder . 280784_285404
and in frame four the rain is coming down a_lot harder . 286245_289975
the child is &-uh panicking and turns the other way and puts their hand over their head and is running presumably back to the house . 290980_301940
in frame five &-uh the &-uh little &-uh boy or girl meets the lady again . 302747_309377
I'm presuming it's the mom . 309489_310849
and he's soaking wet . 312713_313803
and the mother (.) presumably gives &-uh the child an umbrella . 315342_319722
and the child goes back outside in the rain with the umbrella open and goes off to wherever they're going . 320393_326243
okay here . [+ exc] 334236_335126
&-um it is a picture of a man in a tree . 341902_342742
along with the man in the tree there's a cat and a bird . 342866_346916
and there's a dog at the base of the tree barking up . 347324_350134
and there's a little girl &-uh underneath the branch where the cat (.) is sitting . 351287_356397
and her tricycle is there along with a (.) ladder . 357959_361319
and to the right of the tree the <fire department> [//] two fire men are bringing a ladder (.) presumably to rescue the cat from the tree which the older gentleman (.) seems to be trying (.) to rescue . 362537_376877
&-uh but from the look on his face has not succeeded . 382049_383069
and the little girl is very upset because (.) she thinks the cat is endangered . 383973_389163
okay ‡ Cinderella (.) &-uh was a young lady who lived with her two (.) &-uh stepsisters and stepmother . 406323_414123
and they treated her very badly and &-uh made her do a_lot_of work . 415071_420761
and one day a gentleman came to their house and announced that there would be a ball that the (.) &-uh king was having for the prince to find <a wife> [//] a princess (.) for the &-uh prince . 421752_435582
and they were all very excited . 437329_438809
and Cinderella thought she was going . 438931_440431
"&-uh but her mother [//] &-um stepmother said +""/. 441471_445681"
"+"" no ‡ she's not going . 445880_446720"
just the two other sisters were going . 446788_449768
and she was very sad . 450044_451274
and (.) they got ready to go to the ball and left . 451689_456439
and as Cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses . 461783_471813
and they went to the ball . 472600_473890
"but the fairy godmother said +""/. 473908_475458"
"+"" you hafta be home &-uh by twelve o'clock or everything will disappear at twelve o'clock . 475580_481820"
so ‡ she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time . 482357_486907
and the prince fell in love with her at the ball . 487802_490802
and it was just about twelve o'clock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes [//] &-uh crystal shoes at the ball . 491633_501923
and she barely made it home . 503493_504633
and poof (.) &-uh the carriage and horses turned back into the pumpkin and mice . 504735_511155
the prince wanted to find her . 512745_515065
took the shoe and made a decree that they'd check every &-uh girl in the village until &-uh Cinderella was found . 515216_523966
and they came to the house . 525181_526281
and her two stepsisters (.) they tried the shoe on but it wouldn't fit . 527323_530773
and they finally found Cinderella . 531686_534036
and they put the shoe on Cinderella . 534288_536168
and it fit ! 536358_536628
and Cinderella was reunited with the prince . 537927_540177
they got married and lived happily ever after . 540200_542730
