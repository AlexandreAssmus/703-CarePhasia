&-uh and I was paralyzed . 68656_70636
so ‡ I did hafta hire someone to help me . 71322_74112

it did take several years . 90381_92471
and I did hafta have rehab which was not very effective so many years ago . 92536_98316
&-uh and I [/] I guess I must have had a residual from that because &-um I was doing reasonably well . 99200_108600
as a matter of fact I [/] I was leading groups (.) &-uh as we traveled and organizing trips and so on for Montgomery_County . 108615_117625

and we were extremely poor . 158367_160567
and &-uh we were dispossessed from our apartment . 161480_165230
and it was ice on the ground . 165754_167604
and at that time when that happened I made up my mind that I will never be poor again . 167625_174365
and that I will not rely on a man . 174929_178319
that I can make it on my own . 178340_179850
and I certainly have . 179874_181404
okay ‡ here's a little boy who's having a good time . 205128_208338

"&-uh I would try and get good bread , like whole wheat bread or something like that . 619947_625727"

and then get &-uh raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on . 633081_641611
