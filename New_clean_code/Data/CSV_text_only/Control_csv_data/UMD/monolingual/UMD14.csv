okay ‡ the boy kicked the soccer ball . 18057_22157
and it (..) flew into the (.) window on the house next door probably and broke the window . 29546_29886
and it fell inside (.) the man's house . 29886_31556
and it hit the lamp and broke it . 34515_35665
and the man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid .
<trying to> [//] and the kid probably ran away . 45824_48344
"he's gonna go knock on his daddy's door and say +""/. 50213_52783"
"+"" pay me for my broken window . 53216_55136"
"mama said to the little boy +""/. 70336_75246"
"+"" it's supposed to rain today . 75342_76672"
"+"" take your umbrella with you to school . 76746_79196"
"and the little boy says +""/. 79378_80118"
"+"" ah no . 80586_80906"
"+"" I don't need an umbrella . 81154_82124"
"+"" it's not gonna rain on me . 83062_84582"
and then he walks to school . 85551_86651
and it starts to rain . 86930_87890
and it rains really hard . 87986_88116
so ‡ he hasta run back home .
and he's all soaking wet . 90776_93176
and he's not happy . 93921_94891
and his mother's not happy either . 96815_98275
and he hasta change clothes probably . 99369_100379
it's hard to tell . 101739_102209
and then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry . 103824_106234
well ‡ the little girl has a cat that (.) the (.) dog chased up the tree . 120685_123645
"and then a nice man , maybe her daddy , came along ."
and he had a ladder . 134350_135220
and he climbed up in the tree to get the cat . 136590_139440
and then the ladder fell down . 141703_142873
and then he's stuck in the tree . 144250_145680
so ‡ (..) somebody else watched this whole deal while the dog's still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody .
and they came with their truck and ladder . 160172_161492
not quite there yet but they're getting there . 163247_165497
and there's a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them . 169075_171495
the cat's on the other side of the tree . 172307_174237
"says +""/. 175860_175980"
"+"" I'm gonna catch the bird and eat her . 176870_177400"
and the firemen rescued them all . 180788_182628
yes . 189027_189257
&-hm that's interesting . 203976_211016
I don't think I remember the beginning . 214655_215635
(...) I obviously don't remember a_lot_of this . 239218_240738
(...) I don't remember any of these things from when I was a kid .
I used to read science fiction . 271836_273666
I still do .
well ‡ (.) let's see . [+ exc] 313665_315735
"if I remember, Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl . 316262_320102"
the nice man took her home to his family or somebody . 323210_325820
and the stepmother had already had (..) daughters . 331358_336548
and they took her in . 339250_340150
but they treated her like (..) a servant . 341107_344697
and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff . 348113_353033
and she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out (.) to wear . 354127_360247
and she was usually in the kitchen cleaning . 363157_371867
and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball I think in honor of &-uh (.) Prince_Charming or somebody . 375378_382128
and the &-mm evil stepmother wanted her daughters to (.) get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and (.) be rich . 384466_402676
and &-um so they all got fancied up to go to the ball . 404738_409438
and Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go . 411686_413676
and she wanted to go . 414538_415448
and she was crying about it . 415866_416966
and (..) a good fairy godmother came along . 420692_425052
I'm not quite sure how she got there . [+ exc] 426442_430212
&-um and she (.) was able to (.) turn ordinary (.) things and creatures around her into fabulous ones . 430972_445442
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses . 451594_454364
and (.) she turned the mice into something . 456516_458506
anyway [//] and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers . 459216_463686
and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left . 466216_469536
and when she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her . 470708_475388
and they danced the night away . 476966_477626
and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry . 479188_481818
then the &-mm fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning . 486138_494598
and so she hadta be sure to leave by midnight . 496507_497557
and she was a little late . 497748_498598
and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach . 501378_507598
and she lost a glass slipper . 508196_510086
"and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her , I think . 515275_517765"
and she jumped in the coach . 521042_524342
and <it ran away> [//] they ran away from the ball . 525022_526592
and it turned back into a pumpkin . 530150_531330
and her clothes turned back into rags . 532700_534800
and she had one glass slipper on her foot . 535556_538896
and then the prince was very sad . 541370_542370
and he wanted to find her . 542642_543012
and he [//] they took the glass slipper <she had> [//] that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs . 548142_554192
and they went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit . 555128_560338
and the evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper .
and it wouldn't fit cause they had big feet . 563488_565088
and &-uh finally Cinderella got to try on the slipper . 566088_570448
and it fit . 575448_576088
and the prince <and the> [//] was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry . 577636_582896
he was in love with her . 583954_584524
so ‡ he found out . 586532_586992
they told him „ I guess . 588542_589492
and (.) all the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of Cinderella then .
and she married the prince . 600442_601672
and they lived happily ever after .
the end .
&-um so ‡ we're gonna do something a_little different . 605952_608802
well ‡ oddly enough I never had peanut butter and jelly growing up . [+ exc] 612188_615348
I still haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich . [+ exc] 618578_619558
it was not part of my growing up . [+ exc] 622374_623824
but I'd take two pieces of white bread . 624526_626766
<and I'd put peanut butter> [//] probably if it were me I'd put it on both pieces of bread . 628736_635046
and then I'd put jelly in the middle . 635946_638056
<and I happen to like> [//] (.) well ‡ grape jelly I think would go good with peanut butter probably .
strawberry is nice too . 643266_644546
and then I'd smush it together . 645594_646864
and then I'd cut it in half diagonally . 649060_650400
I believe . [+ exc] 652556_654116
we didn't eat peanut butter growing up . [+ exc] 654168_656168
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all . [+ exc] 657578_659008
occasionally I eat peanut butter out_of a jar because it's a protein . [+ exc] 660108_662468
and I [//] my stomach is growling at me „ you_know . [+ exc] 662988_667808
adequate . 678026_678326
a few words of French occasionally . 683434_684504
I listen to people speaking Spanish . 686620_688760
and you_know I picked up a word or two . 691737_694187
and I usually can figure out what they're saying when they're trying to speak English . 694757_698327
and people who speak (...) . 700868_702068
I don't know what language is &+pakis that Pakistan . 703278_707398
and that there's multiple languages . 707908_709568
and I hear Arabic I [//] people wherever I go . 711135_715215
so ‡ I hear English that's accented that way . 717198_720178
most of the time I (.) can figure them out too . 721578_724228
no . 729236_729296
illness . 735306_736036
well ‡ my daddy died of a heart attack . 742080_742190
and my mother probably died of a stroke although they said heart attack . 742190_744910
strokes ran in her family and heart attacks in his . 746120_748860
and &-uh my mother had emphysema . 750806_752316
I guess these days they call it COPD . 752954_755284
she [//] well ‡ her family were coal miners . 757440_761140
and you talk about secondhand cigarette smoke . 762530_764390
well ‡ my family's got secondhand coal dust . 765232_767372
(be)cause they carried it in . 768072_769282
"and by the time she was (.) in her early twenties , she already had stuff that showed up on the tv x-rays that they do (be)cause she worked in a school cafeteria . 771268_783788"
back in the days where they actually cook real food . 784918_787308
<that's mostly> [//] I_mean I've got glaucoma and you_know those kind of things but +... 788822_794152
that's [//] well ‡ I have diabetes . 795248_798068
that seems to run in the part of (.) my daddy's family . 799668_804378
&-hm well ‡ I always wanted to do horseback riding . 818457_829947
and a friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at Rockcreek_Park_Stables in the district .
and she wanted to go but she didn't wanna go by herself so she asked me to go with her . 844182_848762
and since I'd always sorta wanted to do that I went with her . 860978_863668
and they taught &-um English_style riding . 864242_864642
and we took this introductory group of &-uh lessons . 867162_869992
and she quit and I kept on . 873078_874338
"and &-um in fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids , my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp . 876758_895188"
yeah . 897148_897538
but it was lots_of fun . 898120_899970
I learned a_lot . 900532_902942
and &-uh I enjoyed that for a couple years until I had sort_of a accident . 903042_906622
they tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy . 907902_913032
you_know ‡ we'd be &=gestures . 913692_914172
and he'd go like that &=gestures at sound . 916318_918688
and I usually went right off „ you_know . 919710_922090
and [//] &-uh <so a couple of times> [//] and I don't land on my feet . 922518_925788
so ‡ I sorta landed on my lower back and so that's caused me problems . 927834_932954
and &-uh I didn't go back after that . 936000_937070
but it was really nice while I did it . 938746_940866
little bit of (.) almost jumping . 942203_944823
the best part was riding the jump trail in Rockcreek_Park which is a [/] a horse trail that they've let the <little> [/] little usually trees fall across .
and it's rough . 946682_951292
<and if you take> [//] and my horse because he didn't like his neighbor horses . [+ gram] 959020_963020
we were always at the end of the line . 964646_965626
that's not a good place to be when other horses are moving along . 966170_968060
"because horses being herd creatures , they wanna catch up . 968136_972636"
and stay with their good buddies . 973486_974746
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles . 976568_980688
and I'm in the back of the line . 982430_983070
and he's running to catch up . 983190_984280
and &-um it's a_little more exciting being at the end of the line . 986056_989676
but <it was really> [/] it was really good . 989880_990760
but now I do helicopters and it's better . 994336_996226
