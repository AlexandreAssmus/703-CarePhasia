okay . [+ exc] 14962_15082
the boy's kicking what looks like a soccer ball . 16027_18817
only it goes through the window . 19311_21011
breaks the window . 21470_22520
and it alarms this man who notices what's happening . 22540_26450
he &+s looks out the window to see who's done it and what's happened . 26867_30287
okay . [+ exc] 39510_39740
well ‡ the boy <I believe it's a boy> [//] is leaving home . 40516_47916
"and his mother , probably his mother , is &-um suggesting that he take an umbrella . 48312_52312"
she [//] I think she's suggesting pretty strongly . 52535_54775
he says no he doesn't need an umbrella .
probably says it's not gonna rain . 57590_58940
walks out and it is raining . 59491_61461
walks along further and it's raining even harder . 61989_64819
even perhaps windy (be)cause the rain is slanted . 65262_68152
he's walking through puddles . 68364_69774
he gets home pretty wet dripping . 70052_72222
and his mother or the woman is pretty mad . 72486_74666
got hands on her hips . 75014_76284
"she gives him the umbrella again , I assume . 76668_79718"
and now he's walking out a_little happier with the umbrella over his head . 80300_84010
this is a switch kind_of . [+ exc] 93208_97268
okay then ‡ &-um <the little> [/] the little girl here who's riding a tricycle apparently . 98646_105386
and her [//] <the cat went up> [//] she either notices the cat up the tree or saw him go up . 105754_110624
&-um I think her father or somebody was trying to get up there to get the cat . 111273_116253
but he got stuck . 116639_117829
and he looks kind_of dismayed . 118337_119627
the dog here is barking up at the man &-um <in the tree> [//] stuck in the tree . 120050_126020
and for all of this they [//] the fire department has come out to rescue everyone with a ladder . 126663_132643
and rescue the man and the cat . 136055_138745
