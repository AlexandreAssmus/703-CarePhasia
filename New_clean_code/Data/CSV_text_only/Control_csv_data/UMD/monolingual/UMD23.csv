it was just you_know the progression of the disease . 84172_89502
oh ‡ &-uh the birth of my children which is <a happy> [/] a happy occasion and one of the best things in my life .

okay ‡ &-um (.) a young boy is out in the yard playing soccer . 160559_167889
he's in his front yard playing soccer . 168088_169868

and it goes through his neighbor's window &-uh into the neighbor's family room where the neighbor is sitting there watching television . 187149_188549
and it goes right in to where the neighbor is sitting . 188549_193369
and the neighbor is jumping up . 193769_194529
he jumps up to find out where that soccer ball came from . 195001_198991
he looks out into the yard to see who kicked the soccer ball . 201305_204055
okay . [+ exc] 232360_233140

"<and his mother as> [//] as he's getting ready to walk out the door his mother says +""/. 237756_241666"

he gets outside . 251701_253311
he's walking . 253331_253911
and it starts to rain . 254745_255775
and it rains harder and harder and harder . 257611_260031
so ‡ he turns around . 260413_261223
and he runs home and goes inside . 261930_264600
and he's drenched . 265361_266421
"and his mother asks him +""/. 269390_270790"

"+"" I need my umbrella . 272569_273639"
so ‡ then she gives him the umbrella . 274281_275841
and he takes it and goes out [//] back outside in the rain where he isn't going to get wet anymore . 276395_282665
but I believe he has changed his clothes first before he goes back outside (be)cause he goes outside dry . 283547_290067
and he stays dry with the umbrella . 291402_292902

"and little Lucy , whose cat it is , sees her cat up in the tree and tells her dad who comes out and climbs up into the tree with a ladder . 342741_355391"
but the ladder falls down . 355414_357464
so ‡ he's stuck up in the tree . 357592_359212
the cat is still up in the tree . 359903_361263
the firemen come to help get the cat out_of the tree and her dad out_of the tree . 362306_367786
&-um so ‡ the firemen have arrived . 367806_374336

so ‡ I can use details even_though there were no pictures about them . [+ exc] 516317_519876
+< oh okay . 525214_525794
so ‡ &-um Cinderella +... 525896_529556
her father &-uh remarried a woman after her mother died . 531696_536866
and this woman had two daughters . 538050_540000
and so Cinderella came to live with &-um her father and her stepmother and two stepsisters . 541100_547800
and then her father passed away . 548373_549703
and she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters . 550205_553655
so ‡ &-um they were very mean to Cinderella . 555279_559119
and she became like (.) a housekeeper for them . 559373_565523
she did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked . 565661_569131
and [/] and they treated [//] mistreated her . 570467_573147
"so ‡ one day there was a ball given by the king and queen &-uh to find a suitable wife for their son, the prince . 573962_583492"
&-um so ‡ the invitation came . 585721_587761
and the stepsisters were all excited . 588376_590146
"but poor Cinderella, she couldn't go . 590431_592551"
she didn't have the clothes . 592695_594485
her stepmother and stepsisters said she wasn't invited to the king's ball . 594577_598347
so ‡ she [/] &-um she wished she could go to the ball . 599571_603531
but &-uh she had no way to do that . 603548_607018
and she was very sad . 607315_608195
"and so the night of the ball , the stepsisters get to go to the ball . 609662_613562"
they're all dressed up . 613585_614485
they're very fancy and [/] and ready to go to the ball . 614506_617126
and out the door they go . 617247_618217
Cinderella is down in the basement . 618864_620704
and she's crying . 621244_621914
and all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appears &-uh and asks why she's crying . 622111_628481
and she says she wished she could go to the ball . 629356_631286
and so the fairy godmother said that she could . 631473_636173
<and she> [//] &-uh fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into &-um &-uh carriage drivers . 636418_649858
and &-uh <they had> [//] she had horses for the carriage . 651180_653780
and she &-uh casts the spell . 654164_657064
and Cinderella has a beautiful dress . 657489_659669
and &-um she [/] her hair is beautiful . 660820_665010
she has a beautiful dress . 665033_666143
"and she says +""/. 666565_666775"
"+"" you will go to the ball . 666930_668230"
"+"" go to the ball . 668338_669448"
"+"" but one [/] one rule is that at twelve o'clock midnight you must be home by twelve o'clock because all of this magic is going to go away . 669561_679371"
Cinderella goes off to the ball . 680607_681887
she gets there . 682577_683157
the prince becomes smitten with her when he sees her . 683846_686216
he's dancing with her . 686929_688209
her stepsisters are just seething because <who is this> [/] who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with ? 688231_696681
they wanted to be chosen by the prince . 696698_699508
and the night is going wonderfully . 702134_704024
and then she hears the clock strike twelve . 705527_708317
and she remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken . 709025_713855
and she runs out and down the stairs leaving the prince behind . 714554_719154
and as she's running down the stairs one of her glass slippers comes off . 721011_724871
because when the fairy godmother &-um cast the spell she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing . 724892_732092
one of them gets left behind on the steps . 732877_735257
and she runs home . 735516_736506
and she [/] &-um she gets home before [//] you_know as the spell is being broken . 737419_742709
well ‡ the prince is very smitten with her . 743952_745972
and he wonders who this beautiful woman was . 746532_749052
and he wants to find throughout the kingdom <where this &+wom> [//] who this woman is . 749781_753981
so ‡ <he sets out> [//] he finds the glass slipper on the steps . 754293_758603
knows it belongs to her . 758648_759848
and he sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper . 760406_763966
who does that shoe belong to ? 764015_765565
so ‡ they go throughout the kingdom trying the glass slipper on all of these women . 766025_771605
and noone can wear the glass slipper . 773033_775103
it fits noone . 775212_775942
so ‡ they finally get to the house where Cinderella is living . 776688_781648
but she's downstairs . 782393_783473
and they're keeping her in the basement because they know that the prince is coming . 783659_787209
"and they don't want her out [//] you_know out and about , where she could talk with him . 788802_793132"
&-um and he tries the glass slipper on her two sisters . 793708_797808
and it does not fit . 799247_800117
and he's wondering . 801376_802046
is there anyone else that <this could be> [//] you_know this shoe could fit ? 803029_806459
and so Cinderella [//] they realize that Cinderella is there . 807766_811106
<and he asks the [/] the [/] &-uh the [/] the &-uh king's> [//] &+a the prince's assistant asks for her to try on the shoe . 812389_824119
she tries the shoe on . 824379_825609
and it's a perfect match . 825862_827112
and he takes that news back to the prince . 829255_831505
the prince summons Cinderella . 832547_834507
he realizes she is the [/] the young lady that he was smitten with . 835135_840385
and they are married . 841565_842695
and they live happily ever after . 843213_844813
and she never hasta be the housekeeper for her stepsisters again . 845098_850328
and so ‡ they live happily ever after . 851023_852703
I would get a loaf of bread . 868508_874708
and (.) get the peanut butter out_of the cabinet and the jelly out_of the refrigerator . 880652_882392
and I would &-uh remove two slices of bread from the loaf of bread . 883486_888396
I would open the peanut butter jar and take peanut butter on a knife and spread it across the bread . 894851_896841
then I would spread [//] open the jelly and spread jelly on top of the peanut butter . 896859_902339
and then take the second slice of bread and put it on top of the first slice that has the peanut butter and jelly on it . 903816_910206
