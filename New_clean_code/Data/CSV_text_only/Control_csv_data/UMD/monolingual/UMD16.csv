did you want something to (.) raise it up ? 220_4280
oh ‡ I think I'm a very good English speaker . 41298_43018
everybody tells me I'm very articulate . 43040_44540
"just like a smattering of Spanish , just really a few words . 49350_52840"
no . 55999_56369
&-uh well ‡ I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from New_Mexico to the east coast . 65364_73164
it was such an immense change culturally . 73295_76885
and we [//] also we lived in a very &-uh rural area in New_Mexico up in the mountains . 76932_81652
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all . 81703_86403
so ‡ when we came here it was absolutely shocking . 86456_89726
I_mean ‡ just the fact that they had sidewalks alone . 89778_92198
they just amazed us . 92221_93961
and the street lamps and everything . 94051_95791
I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money . 95807_102187
it's so much richer . 102234_103444
and they can afford to do all of that you_know +... 103495_105605
we had a_lot_of unpaved roads out there . 105629_107629
of_course <there's> [//] <the> [//] there's a_lot &-um &-uh sparser population . 107677_112627
so ‡ a_lot_of times they're not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place . 112680_115830
"but here it was just amazing to us , all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city . 115887_122457"
it was just (.) indescribable the impact that it had on us . 122475_126455
I think it took us years to really kind_of overcome the culture shock . 126470_132150
so ‡ I [/] I_mean I remember that period of my life all the time . 132169_136289
what [//] just the immense change that we underwent . 136308_140018
in fact we had &-um &-uh Spanish accents . 140041_143571
very heavy . 143621_144451
my parents always did their whole lives . 144506_146266
"but we had such a terrible time at school , people teasing us and everything . 146311_150561"
and we really tried hard to emulate &-um English speakers especially . 150585_156145
I used to listen to David_Niven for some reason . 156163_158703
I was really crazy about him . 158841_160461
and I wanted to sound like him . 160514_162184
"so ‡ you_know <and it really was a> [//] <it really> [//] it had a huge impact on us , each in their own way . 162207_168297"
okay . [+ exc] 184619_187299
alright . [+ exc] 189766_190906
&-um this little boy Tommy found this ball . 190929_196399
oh yeah . [+ exc] 199348_199598
found a soccer ball and decided to try his luck at kicking it around . 199646_204816
so ‡ he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick . 204833_209213
and sure enough it went through the [//] his neighbor's window . 209402_211882
his neighbor was watching television . 211897_214047
"and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window , knocks over his lamp . 214065_218885"
he looks out the window but there's nobody there . 218908_221598
okay . [+ exc] 229218_231458
there's Tommy again . 231532_232792
his mother &+s that morning knew that it was gonna rain . 232810_236780
she'd been listening to the weather channel . 236800_238230
she told him to take his umbrella . 238250_239900
no ‡ he's positive that there's not gonna be any problem . 239920_242680
also he doesn't wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella . 242704_245254
and he says goodbye to his mother . 245275_246875
and he'll be fine . 246895_247605
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain . 247626_251746
so ‡ he runs back . 252194_253504
his mother's quite annoyed with him because she'd argued with him . 253519_256379
and he said it was not gonna rain . 256399_257759
he feels bad . 257777_259017
finally takes the umbrella and goes to school . 259040_261800
okay . [+ exc] 270236_271006
Susan was out playing with her dog . 272259_273889
and &-uh the dog chased a [/] a cat up into the tree . 273906_279266
and [//] oh ‡ I guess it was actually her [!] cat . 279312_281762
so ‡ she became quite upset about it . 281778_283888
"and her neighbor came out and said +""/. 283907_285337"
"+"" well ‡ that's okay . 285504_286124"
"+"" don't worry about it . 286242_286832"
"+"" I have a ladder . 286903_287573"
"+"" and I'll get up there and get your cat . 287671_289061"
so ‡ he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb . 289364_293654
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground . 293671_296711
and then he couldn't get down . 296734_298324
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree . 298347_303167
so ‡ somebody hadta call the fire department . 303215_305685
and they came out and rescued the both of them . 305704_307594
oh yeah . 313156_313646
&-uh yeah . 315334_317244
I don't remember these animals . 324081_335431
I forgot what an involved story it is . 335620_355300
okay . 355351_372161
okay . [+ exc] 375269_375579
&-um Cinderella &-uh lived with her father and her mother in this little village . 375600_381380
&-uh when she was very young her mother passed away . 381516_383786
it was just her and her father . 383807_385467
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry . 385491_388511
he met somebody there in their village . 388534_390104
and he remarried . 390309_391519
and &-uh then sadly he passed away very shortly after that . 391536_396846
so ‡ she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters . 397459_400499
and it [//] they turned out that <the stepmother was not very nicely> [//] she was not very nice to Cinderella . 400518_405188
so ‡ &-uh she made Cinderella into kind_of a little maid who hadta sweep out the +... 405242_411112
sorry . [+ exc] 411947_414047
yeah . [+ exc] 426893_427753
it's another one of these turtlenecks . [+ exc] 427806_431806
these are my favorite things . [+ exc] 431823_432923
&-uh so ‡ &-um they turned her into a little maid . 433183_439223
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on <her sisters> [//] her stepsisters and her stepmother . 439271_444271
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant . 444292_447692
she was very unhappy . 447716_449116
but she didn't really know what else to do . 449138_450498
there was nothing else she could do . 450546_451316
"then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son , the prince , who was +//. 451361_457201"
&-uh they were trying to find a suitable bride for him . 457271_460941
so ‡ they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoi_polloi of the area . 460963_465933
so ‡ the sisters decided they'd go . 465979_469199
and (.) &-uh (.) at first Cinderella thought that she might go . 469222_472572
and they laughed at her . 472626_473406
told her she didn't have anything to wear . 473427_474907
she was not pretty . 474931_475981
so they went to the ball . 475999_478319
she was very sad sitting among the cinders . 478339_480519
"and her &-um fairy godmother shows up , appears and tells her she'll get it all set for the ball . 480536_487246"
so ‡ she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses . 487806_494666
and I forget what she made her dress out_of . 494684_496614
so ‡ she goes to the ball . 497163_498073
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers . 498093_499823
so ‡ she goes to the ball . 500248_501008
and she meets the prince . 501032_502442
the prince falls madly in love with her because she's the most beautiful girl there . 502465_505075
but the (.) fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was . 505123_510443
so ‡ she saw (.) midnight approaching . 510467_513107
so ‡ she hadta leave suddenly the prince . [+ gram] 513126_514905
"you_know ‡ she hadta run away from him and hide , run away , jump in her carriage . 514961_518331"
and just as she got back she jumped out_of the carriage . 518354_520984
and everything turned back to what it was before . 521003_522643
"so ‡ she &+real thought +""/. 522720_524240"
"+"" well ‡ that's gonna be my one night of happiness . 524814_527194"
"+"" but I'll always remember it . 527316_528246"
<but the> [//] &+pri <she had left behind> [//] the way she was running out_of the castle she had left behind her glass slipper . 528268_534908
the prince had run [//] been running around trying to find her . 534955_537295
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper . 537317_539187
so ‡ he told (.) &-um his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper . 540051_545761
so ‡ they went around to all the (.) villages . 546074_548384
and they [/] they <had them try> [//] had the women who might possibly be (.) that [//] &-uh Cinderella try on the glass slipper . 548435_556375
so ‡ they got to the house of Cinderella . 556395_558105
"and they asked her +""/. 558120_559680"
"+"" how many girls do you have ? 559822_560682"
"+"" no ‡ I only have two . 560776_561876"
(be)cause they had found out what was going on . 562157_563697
they were having them try on this glass slipper . 564204_566014
so ‡ she <hid Cinderella> [//] forced Cinderella to stay inside her room . 566077_569967
and she [//] they tried the slipper on to the [/] (.) &-um (.) &-uh the stepdaughters . 569991_574661
and the first one was [/] (.) &-uh (.) was [//] the heel was too big . 574754_579284
"so ‡ the mother said +""/. 579473_580043"
"+"" no ‡ no ‡ that [//] it'll fit . 580304_581714"
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel . 581734_583624
but it still didn't fit . 583648_584708
and they tried <on the> [//] for the second woman . 584724_587284

"and the mother says +""/. 588981_589521"

"so ‡ they said +""/. 593932_594652"
"+"" no ‡ <this isn't her> [//] these aren't their shoes . 594936_596806"
so ‡ then they were leaving . 597402_598642
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there . 598659_602659
I don't remember exactly (.) who [//] what clued them into that . 602680_605690
so ‡ they insisted on (.) looking around . 605744_608694
and they found Cinderella . 608739_609769
and sure enough they tried her [//] the shoe on her . 609787_612537
and it fit . 612560_613340
so they took her back to the castle . 613469_615009
she married the prince . 615181_615861
and she was very forgiving . 615911_617301
she brought her sisters to live with them . 617321_618981
"&-um well ‡ when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, I toast the bread . 627932_631862"
and then I let it cool off . 631879_633839
and then on one side I smear the peanut [/] peanut butter . 633857_636827
then on the other side I smear the &-um jelly . 637213_639843
and then I put them together . 639867_641387
