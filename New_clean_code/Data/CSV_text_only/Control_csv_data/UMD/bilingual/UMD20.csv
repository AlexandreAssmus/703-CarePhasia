a man was trying to dress up to go out and play with his ball . 254761_260261
I see young [/] &+ma young man going with his ball . 260764_263814
and he's kicking the ball . 264348_266018
and he's very happy . 266826_268366
and then he came back . 268381_270231
and he's sitting down <for a> [//] &+w &-uh with his ball <in his hand> [//] <in his> [/] <in his side> [//] on his side . 270960_277330
and &-um &+th then he [/] he [//] <he's up> [//] he's standing up . 278020_283970
and I think he's planning to go out and play again . 284480_287030
I think I can see the sun shining . 287602_289582
so ‡ &-uh more or less I think he's ready to go out and play again . 290126_295556
he had a rest break in_between . 296424_298524
and then he's going out to play . 299161_300751
+< this is what I can see about the picture . [+ exc] 301482_303882

<and his mother> [//] it's a rainy day . 355815_358475
so ‡ mother is getting him ready to go with his umbrella . 358932_361992
but for some reason the boy didn't take his umbrella . 362671_365901
so ‡ he's really closing his &-uh head with his &+ha arms . 366198_371108
and &-um then at [/] &-uh at the end of this picture I can see him . 371515_376905
I don't know from where he got the umbrella . 377158_378818
but he has an umbrella again . 378837_380267
"beginning of the story , he doesn't have an umbrella . 380769_383589"
his mother is trying to give him but he's not taking it . 383826_386506
he's walking . 386840_387490
and then he's getting wet . 387506_388996
so ‡ I think mother ran out and gave him an umbrella . 389395_391995
so ‡ he's walking to school with his umbrella to protect himself from the rain . 392590_397440

and &-uh she saw a kitten stuck <in the> [//] <on the tree> [//] on the top of the tree branch . 437129_443629
so ‡ I think she called for help to <get the kitten out> [//] get him down from the tree . 444476_452296
so ‡ there came the &+m fire [/] fire engine . 452919_456419
&-um two men came . 457230_458840
and they were trying to get the cat help to come down . 459525_462885
&-uh so ‡ they have a ladder . 463600_464740

and &-uh the girl is anxious to get the cat down . 477315_481255
and I see a man going up and sitting on the [//] a branch close to the cat . 481553_487173

so ‡ they were going <dressed up> [//] really dressed up . 650334_652834
and then Cinderella was not allowed to go with them . 652920_655400
and Cinderella was very sad about it . 655931_657971
but &-um she just took it easy . 658016_661116
and then she was sitting down . 661131_662521
and mother and the two girls got dressed . 662834_666314
they were going . 666659_667379

but somebody else was coming around at [//] &-uh and gave her a shoe [//] nice &-uh pair of shoe . 678848_684658
and then she was going to the gala . 684676_687106
and for their surprise &-um she was going . 687768_690998
and &-um <some in the way> [//] on the middle of the way I think she lost her [//] &-uh one of her shoe (..) &-uh going around . 691605_701015
and then the shoe was found by a prince . 701312_703522
and &-uh <the prince> [//] they were looking for [/] &-uh for everybody who will fit to the one shoe . 704123_710013
she [//] Cinderella had one shoe . 710550_712140
and then the next the shoe was with the prince . 712854_714894
and then he came . 715391_716221
when he came . 716778_717508
and they were coming around to the houses to check and see who will fit . 717532_720952
and the mother and the daughters were very surprised to see that fitted &-uh Cinderella . 721480_726890
so ‡ the [//] &-uh I think the shoe became a pumpkin . 727341_731261
<I see> [/] I see a pumpkin . 731277_732677
