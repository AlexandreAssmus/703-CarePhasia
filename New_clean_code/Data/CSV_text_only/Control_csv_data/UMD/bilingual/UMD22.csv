so ‡ it has been a &+gra gradual +//. 30049_31859
I useta speak English then and then even now . 31883_35253
but then I think the accent and the vocabulary has evolved . 35865_40145
and &-hm it has conformed to the place and culture . 40200_44300
I still may need to work more on it . 45057_46847

that's hard . 110616_111466
I [/] <I need> [//] I think the saddest thing <that happened to &+m was> [//] that comes immediately is the sudden death of my father in nineteen eighty three . 111518_122518
and &-uh that was very shocking and xxx +/. 123266_126516
"he died of a massive heart attack , the first heart failure . 127065_130145"

oh ‡ I need to make a story by looking at the pictures ? [+ exc] 196153_199173
&+s &-like a boy's playing ball . 201981_211761
and then in front yard or &+back backyard of a house . 212251_216981
and then the ball smashes the window . 217031_219651
and it hits &-uh the &+l table lamp . 219672_224562
and &-uh the man sitting next to him picks up the ball . 225085_230405
and it seems he's not happy . 230420_232580
and he turns back and looks out <of the> [/] of the window . 232597_236537
and I don't see his expression so I don't know if [/] if he's happy or sad . 238555_242235

and &-um I guess he's leaving for school . 267713_271213
and &-um &+hi think his mom is telling him to take an umbrella <but there> [//] because there may be a forecast for rain . 272216_280326

and it starts to rain . 285789_288129
