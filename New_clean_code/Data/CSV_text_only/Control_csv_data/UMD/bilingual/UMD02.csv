nope . 44220_44550
not a stroke . 48676_49526
and not a serious illness . 49876_51566
my dad had a heart attack . 52500_53790
yeah ‡ so ‡ about fifteen years ago he had a heart attack . 56723_60443
and &-um &-um xxx . 61707_65427
&-um &-um my dad's recovery . 72831_76241
&-um he [//] first of all he got excellent care because my brother who's a doctor was also +... 76801_80281
&-um he took care of him . 80412_82022
and the fact he probably was a xxx . 82773_84913
he had low residual effect . 85084_86704
and he was essentially back to normal life &-um within a month . 87682_91802
he was back to working twelve hours a day <as he> [/] as he does . 91979_96689
and &-um everything else was normal . 97477_100467
"the most important thing that happened is you_know &-um my selection into a medical school and the top medical school , which I had not expected . 125806_134386"
&-um &-um it appeared &-like you_know +... 135050_138420
or even for &-um <going for> [//] appearing for the exam &-um was like a fluke . 138495_143995
I just went to give the exam only because my friend had decided . 145034_149134
my friend pushed me to going and giving <an exam> [//] <a test> [//] the entrance test . 149322_152772
"and then finally when the results came out, it was my friend actually who told me that I had got into one of the top medical school . 154127_161887"
"and unfortunately the friend who had pushed me to do all that, she didn't get in that year . 162387_165537"
she got in the following year . 165620_166700
but &-um that was one of the exciting things . 167766_172426
&-um my parents were very happy . 174497_178187
and it [//] at the time about &-um twenty five to twenty seven years ago &-um females in India going into medical school was a very very rarity . 179075_190405
so ‡ that really made getting into med school &-um (.) &-um +... 191282_196482
really was <a turnover> [//] a turning point you_know not only in my life but other [/] other cousins and all who followed suit . 198610_207960
&-um <they looking> [//] they looked at me getting educated . 208670_212040
they also then got the opportunity to get education . 212153_215473
I'm ready . [+ exc] 260265_260555
the kids are playing soccer in the &-um field . 261664_265954
I'm sitting on my chair relaxing . 266856_268626
and &-um so &-um one of the kids hits the ball . 270076_274956
and the ball goes and hits the window . 274974_279834
the window cracks . 279885_280765
the ball comes and hits me . 281540_282910
and you_know I kick the ball . 282927_286427
"and I look outside to see that even_though my window is broken , my glass's pane , I want to return the ball . 286445_294265"
"but the kids who were playing , seeing that the damage has been done , they all run away . 295067_299357"
and the field is totally empty . 299442_300912
and I'm left with the ball in my hand . 301585_303715
so ‡ &-um (..) the kid is ready to go to his school . 325325_333385
he says bye@q to his mom . 333813_334673
the mom says +/. 335319_335809

"+"" the forecast says that it's going to rain today . 337516_339956"
the kid as usual argues with the mom and said +/. 340929_343429
"+"" no ‡ the forecasts are never true . 343808_345168"
"+"" why should I take the umbrella ? 345276_346496"
<and so xxx> [//] and so he doesn't listen . 347351_349971
and he goes out . 349986_350876
and he has walked only a few yards when it started pouring . 351442_354932
and he realizes he's getting wet . 355585_357295
so ‡ <he goes back> [/] he goes back to the house and [//] wet . 357342_361762

"in the meantime, the other people <in the> [/] in the playground see this . 429818_433548"
and they call nine-one-one . 434135_435235
