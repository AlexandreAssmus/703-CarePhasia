oh okay . 10770_11580
&-um I guess the [//] one of the earliest memories that I have is
it was a wonderful experience because &-uh I was living in a small
and there wasn't the opportunity to partake in any sort of
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports . 61600_65590
&-um they had rowing . 65775_66975
"and they also had arts and handicrafts , music theater which I"
&-um and so ‡ that gave us the opportunity to have a really full
and also what I really &=laughs enjoyed was the fact that they
&-uh we could eat &+we if we wanted . 96290_98430
if we didn't feel like eating we didn't hafta eat . 98449_100069
there was never anybody saying that you_know you weren't allowed
so ‡ <that was> [//] I was in &-uh my glory because I would have
and that was enough for me . 109987_110807
&-um also &-um we &-uh resided in these cabins &-uh in the woods .
and every morning the &-uh counselors would take us swimming before
and it was always really [/] really chilly in the morning . 124510_126920
and so ‡ this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water . 135700_139720
I don't know . 140210_140470
I can't remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to
but it was always freezing cold . 144237_146497
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake &=laughs . 147141_149561
used to attach themselves to your leg . 151337_154027
of_course suck on your blood . 154890_155900
and that the only way that you could get them off is [//] was if
and then you could pull them off your [/] your leg . 159422_162302
"&-um and then we'd all go back , get dressed and then go and have"
and &-um in the evenings of_course you_know we useta sit around the
"everybody used to sing songs and tell stories , ghost stories and"
and then &-um you_know that would be the end of the day . 183730_187180
and <it was just> [/] it was glorious . 187500_189150
<I just> [//] I loved camp . 189303_191723
&-um and arts and crafts was really good . 192368_195368
we [//] they always had lots_of materials and &-uh somebody who had
and there's painting and things that we useta create with &-um wood
and then I_mean I think I was only there for a week . 211650_214260
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity . 214348_217538
(be)cause the days were just so [/] so [/] so full . 217588_219668
and then at the end of the week you_know they'd bring in the school
&-uh I was living in Montreal at the time . 227670_229600
"+, go back to Montreal . 230170_230940"
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it
and I made such good [/] good friends and people that I really
and &-um once home I kept in contact with a_lot_of the people that
a_lot_of the [/] the girls that I met at the camp . 245826_248426
so ‡ that was kind_of nice . 248894_249744
and then I went to you_know every year I'd go back to that same
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back . 253320_256380
and so you would meet the same people over [/] and [/] over and
so ‡ <it was> [/] it was nice xxx . 259062_259812
every year it's you_know looking forward to seeing FirstnameE or
and &-um yeah <those were> [/] those were some really really really
it was just so nice to be away from the city and living in the
mhm . 281777_282117
&=laughs well ‡ &-uh today [/] &=laughs today I'm here . 291793_294563
&-uh no ‡ <usually I've> [//] &-uh I retired as_of last year . 294980_298770
&-um so ‡ at the moment I'm involved in &-uh renovating our house .
we haven't done anything to the house in the last twenty five years
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by
and being elderly she wasn't able to do any of the housework or
so ‡ &-uh it was pretty run down when I bought it . 329200_332510
and she musta been a real cat lover because &-uh there were stray
inside the house the [/] the carpets just reeked of cat urine . 342354_346904
the walls were crumbling . 347397_348677
the plaster was cracked . 348727_350087
there was water damage everywhere . 350940_352360
I guess she'd left the windows open . 352520_354010
and the rain had come in . 354057_354957
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck . 356100_358640
so ‡ anyways ‡ we did a little bit of renovations . 358770_360470
but we haven't done much since then ? 360520_362290
and that was twenty five years ago . 362335_363945
so ‡ anyways ‡ we hired somebody to you_know put together some
and [/] &-um and hired a contractor . 369820_373860
and at the moment what's happening is that the contractor and the
&-um so ‡ they're arguing about everything . 384720_387160
the [/] the [/] the [/] the guy who designed the space you_know
"+"" that's the way it hasta be . 391176_392256"
the contractor says [//] is arguing that it can't work that way
"+"" if you're gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support"
and all this kind_of stuff . 399719_400499
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera . 400957_403577
so ‡ I've been dealing a_lot with that on a daily basis at_least
&-um so many issues . 411520_413830
so many details . 413854_414704
&-um you_know and I can't really afford a designer . 414751_419681
but I know I should because I'm not very good at it &=laughs . 419780_423250
&-uh <but anyways> [//] so ‡ just trying to figure out you_know
that's [/] that's the major thing in my mind at the moment . 432830_437210
