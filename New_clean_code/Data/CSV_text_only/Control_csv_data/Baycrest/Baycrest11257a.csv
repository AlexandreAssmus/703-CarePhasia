"okay ‡ I was running to my class at the university , to my finance"
"next thing I knew I woke up , looked at my wristwatch . 26024_29644"
it was still on . 29766_31266
shockproof by the way . 31748_33168
it said eight twenty . 33213_34783
and the clock on the wall said five to nine . 35261_37791
so ‡ I assumed something had happened . 38469_40979
yes ‡ something had happened . 41750_43030
I had two broken legs . 43490_45530
and I was in the hospital emergency . 47200_49150
&-uh I remained there for three and a half months and was able to
and walking down the hall I lost my balance on my crutches . 60584_65114
and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again . 65221_69452

and I went to the operating room was put in a body cast from under
and I had to remain in that for another eight weeks . 96600_102580
and I finally got out_of bed and learned to walk again of_course .
(be)cause you can't walk when you're in bed for that long . 113355_116945
I came out_of the hospital . 117578_119118
my accident was October twelfth . 119303_121503
came outta the hospital March twenty ninth . 121549_124039
and that night I went to university to write a test . 124955_127995
so [//] &-um and then I hafta really learn to walk (be)cause I was
and I learned to walk . 137794_138744

but I took the approach that <there's nothing> [//] when you [//]
move on . 177160_177930
and make the best of the situation . 178322_180802
