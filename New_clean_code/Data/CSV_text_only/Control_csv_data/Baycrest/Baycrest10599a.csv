sounds like a ten minute interview . 10860_12000
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk
&-um it was important to me to get into law school . 20720_24150
that was something that happened that was very important . 24930_26920
I have no idea why I was accepted because I don't think I met any
thirty two . 43310_43980
I was thirty two when I started . 45060_46160
so ‡ I guess I was thirty one when I applied . 46176_47946
and in my year the median age was twenty two . 48596_53406
"so ‡ I was one of the oldest in the class , had nothing in common"
I_mean they still remembered high_school . 64066_65867
who thought about high_school ? 67523_68613
and they all knew each_other from high_school . 69920_71830
and they were there because they didn't get into medical school or
and I was just flummoxed . 83970_85880
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came
they were just there because +//. 96740_98140
well ‡ I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the
and I was there (be)cause I just really cared . 104040_106060
and so ‡ I really didn't fit in &-um really . 107340_112220
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real
up until then I was friendly with people but I didn't understand
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what
&-like they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious .
why would anybody say the obvious ? 139881_143161
so ‡ people said the obvious . 143695_145205
and they were rewarded . 145300_146040
so ‡ those were the people sought after to be in the study groups .
not me . 150337_150957
so ‡ I did almost everything alone for the entire year . 151522_155042
and when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she
"so ‡ I said +""/. 168136_169106"
"+"" thanks but no thanks . 169505_170575"
"+"" don't bother . 170724_171134"
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didn't
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it . 176425_178585
so ‡ that was me &=laughs . 178601_179291
so ‡ I was part of that group for some classes . 181263_183613
at the end of the year &+i in the subway station I met someone who
&-um but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy
and she was in the other group . 196055_197125
so ‡ I never saw her . 197178_198128
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I
and that was good . 206490_208510
&-like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the
"and he said +""/. 232517_234077"
"+"" please ‡ when you write your exams don't think that your mark is"
"and I thought +""/. 243557_243957"
"+"" wow it is so amazing to hear something like that . 244459_248399"
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged
it was in law school that I learned that competent@q was a
"+"" oh he's a competent lawyer . 262344_264374"
and that the positive term was bright@q . 265775_268115
if you weren't bright you were nobody . 268219_269969
so ‡ &-um because he wasn't bright the students didn't respect him
"and I &+th made the mistake of saying to someone +""/. 276690_280330"
"+"" you_know yeah &+h okay but he's decent . 282140_284780"
"+"" &-like he's a decent person . 284920_286270"
"+"" he has a heart . 286361_287091"
"and she said +""/. 287903_288523"
"+"" a heart ? 289079_289539"
"+"" I didn't come to Oz where this one doesn't have a brain and this"
"+"" I came to law school . 293906_294846"
didn't talk to her again . 296870_297870
U_of_T . 302094_302734
U_of_T was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada . 303989_307599
I don't know why . 308774_309554
and I also didn't understand that law schools had their own kind of
&*INV
but <I didn't> [/] I didn't know that . 324080_325400
I didn't even get it (un)til after I left . 325558_327118
so ‡ really it wasn't the right school for me . 328690_330950
I really should have gone to York . 331002_332832
"but when I came to Toronto people were saying +""/. 334511_337921"
"+"" oh U_of_T . 338188_338978"
"+"" it's the best school . 339121_340311"
"+"" and why would you wanna be way out at York ? 340889_342829"
"+"" you're in Toronto . 343019_343489"
"+"" you wanna be downtown . 343638_344458"
"so ‡ I thought +""/. 345260_345500"
"+"" okay I wanna be downtown . 345706_347066"
so ‡ I was downtown . 347462_348562
boy kicks the ball . 357540_359090
"flies into a glass window , breaks the window and falls into the"
it knocks over the lamp . 366730_368020
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see
it looks like he's got his gun in the &+pock pocket . 376355_377955
okay ‡ the mother tells the child to take an umbrella . [+ exc] 382920_386390
and the child doesn't want one . [+ exc] 386411_387611

and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother who's not
well ‡ &+w what's happening is that &-um firefighters are rushing
but it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat . 448380_450890
and then he got stuck . 451383_452453
and then the firemen are coming to save the man . 452902_454992
maybe the cat was chasing the bird . 456000_457210
no ‡ I think the dog was chasing the cat . 457229_458709
am I allowed to make it a xxx ? [+ exc] 460490_461660
"the bane of feminists everywhere , Cinderella's story about a"
and I don't think we find out how she got to that situation but
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a
<she always> [//] she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking
and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes . 496673_498723
and she wasn't given the best food to eat . 498792_500912
and anyway she was just treated horribly . 500960_502860
one day &-uh the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an
"Cinderella , thinking she's a member of the family thinks she can"
but she can't . 516650_517571
so ‡ she &+h has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get
and then they go . 523981_524691
after they leave she's very disappointed because she really wanted
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her
"so ‡ she gives her a beautiful dress to wear , lovely new shoes and"
and the only rule is be back by twelve . 549104_552044
so ‡ Cinderella went to the ball . 552810_554560
she had a wonderful time . 555300_556210
nobody knew who she was . 556393_557333
"everybody was saying +""/. 557416_557936"
"+"" oh who's that woman ? 558112_558742"
"+"" who's that woman ? 558815_559285"
the prince danced with her the whole evening . 559596_561156
she had a lovely time . 561209_562369
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta
so ‡ she ran out . 566400_567380
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper
"&-um following that , the prince found the missing slipper . 578196_582946"
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper . 583203_585623
so ‡ he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's
it didn't fit anybody . 591400_592700
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly

it didn't fit any of them . 600098_601328
