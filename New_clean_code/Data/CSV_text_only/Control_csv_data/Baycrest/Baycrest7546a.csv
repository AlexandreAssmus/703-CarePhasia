so ‡ I do tend to sleep in . 66310_67670
&-uh usually I have breakfast around ten or ten thirty . 68420_71490
&-um I might read for a while and go the library just to email
and &-uh then I have &-like what's essentially my evening meal
and then I have maybe &-uh one or two &-uh lessons with students .
and that takes me to nine . 94170_96480
"and then come home , might have a snack , might watch television ,"
this boy was &+t kicking the soccer ball around . 109620_112180
he <hit a> [/] hit a neighbor's window and smashed it . 112500_115980
&-uh the neighbor was &-uh sitting in his living room as the soccer
&-uh the neighbor looked out with the ball in his hand accusingly
&-uh the mother was just lecturing her son about &-uh the need to
&-uh the son reassured her that he didn't need one . 146460_149450
then it started to rain . 149490_150540
it started to rain even harder . 151130_152470

&-uh because_of two emergencies the [/] the fire department was
&-uh this [//] &-uh the girl's cat ended up climbing a tree and was
and in the same tree &-uh there was this man who &-uh climbed up it
"and someone , probably the girl , brought a ladder . 189382_191852"
but &-uh for whatever reason it didn't reach either cat or the man
so ‡ the fire department hadta come with a larger one . 195340_197460

&-uh at one point &-um the handsome prince arrived in the house . 216540_222680
and the &-uh stepsisters wanted to go to the ball with him and so
but &-uh Cinderella made a wish . 228260_231440
&-uh she wished for a carriage . 231780_234540
but &-uh whoever granted her the wish <I don't really remember>
&-uh so ‡ Cinderella and the prince went to the ball . 242930_245360
of_course Cinderella was concerned about the time . 245820_248230

and &-uh there was some sort of prophecy that &-uh it would fit
and it turns out that it fits Cinderella . 264068_266078

and they got married . 270865_271545
