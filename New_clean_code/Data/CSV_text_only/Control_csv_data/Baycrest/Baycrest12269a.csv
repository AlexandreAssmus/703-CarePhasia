and all the &-uh young ladies were invited to come to the ball . 364938_371298
and &-uh &-uh Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated . 372350_379050

the [//] &-um so ‡ <the [/] &+t the day of the> [/] the day of the
and &-uh she never had any time <to work> [//] <to [/] to
so ‡ &-um the +... 428160_432640
yeah meanwhile the other &-uh two &-uh stepsisters were [/] &-uh
and so ‡ &-um they were all prepared to go to the ball . 453514_456864
"and then &-um &-uh the [//] on the day of , I believe &-uh"
and &-uh so ‡ the [/] the birds and the mice and <all the> [/] all
and <they were stealing> [//] I remember they were stealing &-like
and <she was discovered> [//] that was discovered . 481117_482757
and the &+moth &+s &-uh stepmother basically gave her more jobs to
and somewhere in the story there's [//] &-uh a fairy godmother
yeah so ‡ this is her still doing all of these jobs . 495624_498084
and &-um yeah so ‡ she's all &+s &+s sad and unhappy that she (i)s
&-um and then &-um her &+y fairy godmother appears and &-um waved
and basically &-um <the [//] &-um some [//] something gets turned
and I think the mice turn into &+s horse [//] &-uh either &-uh
<and so > [//] then [/] then she creates &-uh &-uh a nice &-uh gown
and &-um &-uh off she goes to the ball . 554123_560733
but she hasta be back by midnight (be)cause the spell ends at
and so ‡ the sisters of_course they see Cinderella there in their
<and they're wondering how she> [//] <and the> [/] &+step and the
anyway midnight approaches . 580450_581810
<the bell> [/] &-uh the stroke of midnight comes . 581856_585206
and she remembers that she's gotta &-uh leave by then . 585229_590129
and so +... 590147_591187
oh yeah . [+ exc] 593448_593708
in the meantime +... 593986_594936
&-uh I think that's the prince . 595801_598481
and that's his father . 598540_599800
&-um and anyway he [/] he [/] he [/] &+dan he only wants to dance
and &-um anyway when [//] as [/] as [/] as midnight approaches &-uh
and so ‡ she in her running out she loses her &+s glass slipper and
&-um but she's of_course still missing her one slipper . 634510_638240
so ‡ the next day the [/] &+pr the prince <wants to find out> [//]
and &-uh he knows that he [//] the [/] &+ru <the lost slipper> [//]
so ‡ he announces to all of his subjects that &-um he's [//] &-uh
and so ‡ <he [/] he come> [//] he goes throughout the village
he &+fen eventually comes to [/] to &-uh their [/] &+hou their [/]
and it's [//] of_course it's not gonna fit on the &-uh evil sisters
and &-um he finds that it does fit Cinderella . 684353_688673
but I think in their anger the sisters grabbed the slipper and they
but he sees that it fit her . 694750_696150
