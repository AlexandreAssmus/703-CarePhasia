&-hm well ‡ it was when I was a kid . 11970_16910
and I went with a group of my friends . 17440_19390
I think I was <maybe about eight or> [//] between eight and ten . 19524_24304
something like that . 24370_25170
and we went down to this local creek . 25550_27200
we lived in a small village . 27420_28900
and it was about a mile down to the creek . 29401_31401
and it was springtime . 31416_32345
and we were cautioned not to go down because <it was> [//] you_know
not a river . 40420_40880
it was a creek . 41093_41843
well ‡ anyhow we [//] boys will be boys . 42366_44556
and we defied &=laughs all odds . 44622_46932
and we went down . 46970_47760
and we always had &-like hammers and nails that we bore from our
so ‡ &-uh we went down . 53790_55090
and we &-uh found some logs and some odd boards . 55135_58755
and we put together a raft . 58777_60027
and we went rafting . 60095_61305
and the water was a very free flowing . 61508_63368
and it was fantastic . 63414_64304
but of_course we hit one point . 64891_66661
and there was a ice floe . 66685_67915
and the raft went sideways . 67963_69753
and we all went into the water . 69800_71800
so [//] &-uh you_know and at that time we wore rubber boots . 71960_75440
but they were no help because the water was more &-like &-uh waist
and &-uh we got soaked from the waist down . 79785_82295
water went in the boots . 82790_84140
and [/] and then we finally made it to shore thank_goodness . 84404_88864
otherwise it coulda been more serious . 88912_90502
and &-uh when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots . 90908_94828
but &=laughs we still had our socks on . 94875_96735
and we were wet . 96788_97868
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road . 102117_104987
and it was like slosh_slosh_slish_slosh@o you_know . 105486_108636
and it was getting colder because when you're wet like that +... 109248_111918
and we got home . 112200_112940
and &-uh you_know unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in
"+"" where have you been ? 118233_118933"
"+"" what happened ? 119085_119585"
so ‡ we [/] we got a huge reprimand you_know . 119945_123245
so ‡ &-uh but &-uh thankfully we made it home . 123266_126706
but because the temperature was dropping our sort_of &-uh jeans or
they were starting to freeze . 137412_138792
so ‡ it was like walking [/] &=laughs walking along like a robot .
but &-uh we made it home . 144000_145150
and &-uh everything was fine . 145202_147142
but it was sad in_that we got reprimanded . 147166_150366
but we were happy when we were doing the [//] &-uh you_know the
so ‡ we had a good time . 154911_156121
and you_know we laughed about it . 156510_158230
and you_know we were all chummy . 158326_160576
and we walked back . 160598_162098
<we didn't> [/] we didn't think too much of it . 162117_163927
but you_know when we got home it was kind_of sad &=laughs . 163988_166528
thank_you . 170440_170620
&-um typical day I would &-uh go for a walk &=throat
I would go shopping . 182657_183787
&-um I would try to get involved in some local activity . 184510_189450
we have community gardens . 189499_190469
we have a recreation center on site where I live . 190769_193979
so ‡ there variety of activities . 194461_196661
if it's a very hot day I would choose to maybe go downtown to &-uh
sometimes it's kind_of neat to pretend you're a tourist &=laughs
and the tourists seem to be very polite you_know . 209142_211162
up in my neck of the woods where I live right now you say hi to
"and they look at you kind_of strange like +""/. 215906_217426"
"+"" what do you want ? 217590_218120"
whereas you_know tourists &-uh they seem to be friendlier . 218560_221400
so ‡ I'll go to Harbor_Front . 221491_222711
if I've got the funds [//] available funds I'll go to the islands .
and that's time consuming . 226940_228800
but during the week it's the best time to go . 228900_231400
on weekends you hafta stand in line . 231453_233363
and it's a &=throat
you spend more time travel downtown and going across in the ferry
and &*INV
"and &-uh you_know there's bicycle rentals , canoe rentals . 246320_249890"
there's &-uh lots to do . 249907_251747
miles of walkways . 251792_253252
so ‡ yeah I try to keep busy . 253890_255770
I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities . 255794_259264
otherwise I find you_know doing the same thing it's like being a
and you have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day
so ‡ it's kind_of nice to try different activities . 270500_273010
I like &-uh the you_know variety . 273240_275790
yeah &=throat
there's no Cinderella in these . [+ exc] 293920_295060
okay . [+ exc] 296990_297180
looks like the boy is kicking what appears to be a soccer ball . 297980_301880
"and unfortunately it goes and breaks the window , a shuttered"
and in number three the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in
"the man picks up the ball , looks out the window , &-uh glances it"
can I just scan the whole story &*INV
okay . [+ exc] 331233_331563
see the progression . [+ exc] 332450_333360
"looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy ,"
"he says +""/. 344758_345368"
"+"" no no no no . 345620_346200"
"+"" I don't want the umbrella . 346556_347296"
"+"" it's not going to rain . 348400_349300"
and upon leaving for school with his backpack it appears that the
and then he's [//] looks like he's on his way home or way back with
and &-uh stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down
and she doesn't look too happy . 373907_375947
and he probably got a reprimand and was told to <go out again> [//]
okay ‡ there's a_lot_of action here . [+ exc] 393824_395254
&-uh looks like there's a girl who's reaching up into a deciduous
there's a tricycle . 407098_408238
perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle . 409552_411942
there's a man up in a tree &=throat
perhaps &-uh he was climbing up the tree . 417102_419512
and now there's a dog barking up the tree at the man . 419966_422936
he looks very &-uh perturbed [//] upset because he can't get down
meanwhile firefighters arrive in their truck . 429642_432632
two firefighters are running with a ladder to [//] probably in an
<and there's> [//] oh ‡ and there's a bird &+s &+sing chirping on
okay . [+ exc] 460950_461100
it's a fairy tale . 461150_462300
that's Cinderella . 464116_465056
and it's about &+si Cinderella and a prince . 465435_470395
Cinderella lived with her mean say [//] stepmother who had two
they were not too fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she
and she was made to do all the work . 491399_493049
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person . 496553_499683
and she lived I believe in the attic . 500176_503876
and she would talk to the birds . 504695_506395
okay . [+ exc] 510262_510562
she was always working . 515750_518970
but she would think of you_know how she was made fun of by the
she was overworked . 534950_535900
she'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the
there was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse . 547794_554344
"Cinderella was always mopping , mopping cleaning you_know cooking"
Cinderella &+h received a delivery . 568175_571195
it was sealed . 571912_572792
and the delivery went to the stepmother . 575314_577324
stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read
Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited . 586444_589714
but as it turned out she was not . 589790_593510
so ‡ the stepmother denied her that . 593958_596108
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the
they were invited to a ball . 605750_606980
the prince was having a ball . 607134_608304
Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the
in fact she <tried on or> [//] looked at a dress that she would
she mentioned the dress . 625861_627081
and then she looked at pictures of the dress . 627343_630893
she was friends with all the &=throat
they decided to &=throat
so ‡ they sewed . 645743_647993
and they spun . 648042_648682
and they weaved and you_know appliqued the bows on the dress . 648728_653068
she didn't know this was happening . 655910_657200
she &=throat
the birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special
she was so delighted with the dress . 674432_676392
meanwhile the stepmother and the &+t two sisters were &-uh prancing
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her
I believe that they may have been responsible &=throat
she cried . 703971_704851
"everybody was sad , her friends the animals , small creatures"
the fairy godmother heard her pleas and [/] and her sorrow
and she came and waved her magic wand and turned pumpkin into a
&=sobs it's a sad story . [+ exc] 739498_746688
into a magnificent coach for Cinderella . 755238_759238
then she was off in the coach with the blessing of the &=sighs
she arrived at the ball and was greeted at the door by two of the
there she met the prince . 788686_790086
but the fairy godmother had brɑɪst@u [
in her haste when she heard the clock dong dong dong she ran off .
and behind she left her glass slipper . 816297_818257
meanwhile she raced home before the entire dream disappeared in the
and [/] and then she made it back . 834538_836898
the dress disappeared . 838123_839643
the angry godmother met her . 842960_844510
and she &-uh was very annoyed at her that she came home so late . 847680_853560
meanwhile the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom
<they tried> [/] &=throat
it wouldn't fit . 873942_874732
however they finally came upon Cinderella . 875890_882690
