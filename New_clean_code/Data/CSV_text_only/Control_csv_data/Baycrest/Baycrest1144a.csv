okay . 25280_25470
okay . 41590_41800
well ‡ &-um <one of the big> [//] one of the very important things
that was &-like very positive experience . 53000_54650
and I was a teenager at the time . 55230_56800
and &-um it was a significant change . 56820_59570
it was quite a drastic change . 59960_61290
and [//] &-um but it was &-uh interesting in the sense that it was
it was just <a big> [/] a big change and a big transition . 68310_70890
and &-uh it was you_know with all these expectations and [/] and
learning [//] you_know getting used to a whole new culture . 76640_78770
not language because I spoke English &-uh where I came from . 79253_82523
&*INV
and [//] &-um but just getting used to whole new culture and &-um
&-like &+s &-like you_know we spoke differently from how we &+s
and [/] &-um and so ‡ just getting used to everyone and the culture
<it wasn't> [//] well ‡ <one of the> [/] one of the things &-uh
<we drive on the> [//] we drove on the left <in the other> [//] in
it's former British_Guyana . 116291_117431
and &-um you_know just getting used to consumerism . 118380_121620
that was one of the big shock you_know . 121669_123539
<we didn't> [/] we didn't spend money there like we [/] we did here
&-like my parents certainly didn't spend money and buy clothing and
&*INV
and there was just <money that was> [//] money that's so
right ? 140635_140795
it is just a dispensable commodity . 140830_142540
and I guess it's just like everything else today . 142560_144330
especially in the last fifteen twenty years you_know . 145093_147613
it's like everything has become dispensable . 147898_149738
you_know it's like you buy a shirt . 150340_151800
you wear it a few times . 151817_152807
and then you can go get another one because it's so inexpensive now
&*INV
and [//] &-um but there's a premium on education . 158200_161370
and that's where I invested my time . 161422_163192
and &-um I spent many years in education while [/] while working
I just did it because I felt I could do it . 168270_170020
and it was immensely challenging . 170065_172225
but I struggled through it . 172246_173836
and I was very successful . 173944_175234
"a typical day , a workday . 183013_185003"
I'll describe a typical workday . 185051_186391
I'm up at five a_m . 186413_187553
<I'm just> [//] I just got useta getting up really early . 187751_189981
and I would &-um have a cup of coffee . 190813_193463
and I would &-uh brush my teeth and shave and shower . 193478_197518
and then I would put on my sweatpants and t-shirt . 197920_200270
and if it's the wintertime I'd get on my jacket and &-uh winter
and I would go around the block for a walk <a couple> [//] two
&+espe especially when it's colder you kind_of &*INV
and so ‡ by the time I'm [//] I've done I would <go out> [/] go out
by then I'm sweating . 219951_221271
&-um so ‡ <that gives [/] gives my [/] my> [//] it revs up my whole
and that's [/] that's great because it just jumpstarts my whole
and then &-um I'll just undress and cool down and &-um then get
and I don't typically have a morning breakfast . 237420_240080
it's just something I got used to . 240098_241388
and it works really well for me . 241450_242670
&*INV
I [/] I don't consume dairy products because I'm lactose intolerant
and &-um so ‡ I'll walk to work . 250710_253340
"it's about a twelve minute walk , twelve to fifteen minute walk"
and then when I get there <and I> [//] &-um I'll have another half
well ‡ maybe almost a full cup but with brown sugar again . 264430_267000
and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative
and you check your email and other [//] voicemail and all these
so ‡ administration consumes a_lot_of time . 280419_282299
and by then it's eight o'clock . 282340_284030
then I'm ready to get into my work &-like for another half an hour
I'm ready to get into my [//] you_know the chargeable work
but it's the auditing or accounting or tax work . 291308_294208
<whatever is> [//] whatever I have on my desk or <whatever is> [//]
and so ‡ that will take up [//] consume most of my morning . 299680_302320
I tend not to eat or snack <in the> [//] during the day . 302369_305079
I [//] &-um I'm [/] I'm a little bit disciplined with that . 305094_308034
because I used to . 308085_308865
and I useta be very &-um +... 308888_310288
and it didn't work well for me . 311017_311997
I was very overweight at one time . 312018_313428
and I [//] it didn't work well for me . 313448_314668
so ‡ I [//] and [/] and then I sit down all day . 314687_316497
and so ‡ that's [//] &-uh that became a problem because I was
so ‡ I really hadta &-uh get rid of the weight . 322040_324320
and <it changed> [//] it made a huge change . 324870_327300
so ‡ I'm actually a pure pure vegan now . 327321_329211
and for the last three years +//. 330246_332106
well ‡ a total of five years now but mostly so the last three years
and &-um so ‡ lunchtime will come around . 335767_337797
and I take my lunch . 337820_338610
so ‡ I [/] I make my own lunch . 338980_340700
and [/] &-um and so ‡ I'll have lunch between eleven thirty and
&-uh I actually go out for a walk . 345658_347128
"I always get up and go for a walk , get some fresh air, and come"
not a long walk but a short walk . 350650_352000
and then I'll have lunch . 352890_353550
and <by twelve thirty> [//] between twelve thirty or one o'clock
but in the middle of the day again you might have some
"you gotta check your emails or voicemails , deal with any other"
and [/] &-um and then around one o'clock then I really get back
and you_know so ‡ <one to> [/] one to three . 374821_378511
so ‡ I give it a solid two hours one to three . 378570_380410
and then I take a break at three o'clock to three fifteen . 380431_383551
and I did get some water or [/] or go downstairs and go for a walk
"and &-um any other issues that come up again , <the same> [/] the"
administrative [/] administrative stuff goes on all the time
and then between three fifteen to five o'clock I xxx the chargeable
and then I try to get out_of there right after five o'clock . 401520_404560
so ‡ I'd pack up at five o'clock and &-um you_know do the routine
it depends . 412490_412920
it could be personal stuff . 412938_413758
it could be client related matters . 413779_415209
and &-um then I try to get outta there right at five o'clock or
&*INV
and I make sure I'm there at that time every day . 424200_425850

"and the soccer ball went through the glass pane , broke the glass"
"and he's gotten up , the fellow who was sitting at the [//]"
it looks like it entered in someone's house through the broken

and he's picked up the ball . 476060_476880

and he did not take the umbrella . 497200_498480
but then when he went out it started to rain . 498497_501627
