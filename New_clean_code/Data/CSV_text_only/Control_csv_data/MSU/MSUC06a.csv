&-hm I can remember &-um when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing . 30951_39101
I was swinging with a friend . 39117_40807
and we were standing facing each other . 41408_43428
and I hit my head . 44072_44822
and I did have a concussion . 44871_46311
&-um and I remember feeling quite ill . 47178_49958
and my mother was taking some nursing courses . 50617_53707
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight . 53925_59145
but &+sh I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache . 59223_63443
and then I was fine +//. 63655_64535
"+, after a day or so . 65251_66231"
no ‡ I think just rest [/] rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes . 71934_78794
yes . 89594_90354
&-um all different people who've had +... 97246_100856
I think &-um you_know I've encountered people who stutter . 103903_107153
and I will usually just try to &-um let them finish . 107436_112436
I'm pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them . 112717_116157
and I've encountered people with aphasia . 116700_118430
and I'll often do the same . 118544_120124
unless they really look as though they're struggling . 120584_123164
and then occasionally I'll try to give them a cue . 123480_125930
&-um yeah so I would say that's the most that I can think of . 125990_131170
and children with &-um speech and language difficulties &-um . [+ gram] 131354_134814
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words . 134835_140955
mhm ‡ I can remember &-um when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas . 169166_177436
it was a couple weeks . 177453_178763
she had been in the hospital . 179071_180131
and she had not been ill . 180149_182099
but she was diabetic . 182620_183890
and you_know periodically she would be in the hospital . 184058_186688
and it was Christmas eve . 187271_188631
and we got a call that she had passed away . 189005_191195
and it was terrible . 191977_192807
my dad was at work . 192860_193980
and my mother hadta contact my dad . 194561_196541
and &-um it was a really very difficult time . 197237_200767
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry . 200788_203668
so ‡ it was really something that I think I really remember . 204142_207882
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father . 207906_213276
&-um and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve . 214272_218282
we put everything up then . 218417_219637
and then we would get up . 219660_220440
so ‡ my mother did have all of us do that . 220539_222969
but I remember thinking how sad my mom was . 223070_226080
and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers . 226305_229925
and my dad didn't come home (un)til very late . 230509_232759
and then he was there of_course on Christmas morning when we got up . 232879_236739
but it was a difficult Christmas . 236794_238244
and I do remember that very (.) vividly . 238340_241560
"yeah, mhm . 241877_242817"
one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball . 286606_291076
and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbor's window . 291764_297494
his neighbor was sitting watching television . 298969_302039
and the ball came through knocked over his lamp <and caused quite a> [/] and caused quite a loud noise . 302057_308867
his neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off . 309789_314239
one cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school . 340595_345205
"he said +""/. 346071_346261"
"+"" I will not need the umbrella . 346436_348026"
&-um however when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard . 349062_356112
it rained and rained . 356298_357128
he hadta run through the puddles . 357236_358516
and he got wet . 358647_359257
he tried to cover his head with his hands . 359275_361275
"when he got home his mother said +""/. 362692_364132"
"+"" look at you . 364444_364684"
"+"" you're soaking wet . 364849_365839"
and he thought about having an umbrella . 366738_368718
&+psh and the next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson . 370030_375620
(...) one day a girl was riding her bicycle . 400901_403111
and she saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard . 403395_407555
she looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat . 409445_414225
she went and got her dad who brought a ladder . 414918_418128
he started to climb the tree . 419519_420749
and the ladder fell . 420767_421887
so ‡ now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree . 423602_426892
&+sh someone called the fire department . 427664_429704
and they were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad . 430075_433985
Cinderella's mother passed away when she was a little girl . 525629_529339
and her father was raising her . 529465_531125
and he met a woman that he thought would be a good wife . 531841_534741
and she had (..) three daughters of her own . 534977_539097
&-um and they got married . 540047_541997
and they lived together . 542013_543143
but Cinderella was not treated fairly there . 543197_545487
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores . 545994_548714
"and the stepsisters would say +""/. 549587_551867"
"+"" Cinderella get my lunch . 551968_553458"
"+"" Cinderalla clean the laundry . 553560_555260"
"+"" Cinderella you_know do everything . 555471_558201"
so [//] and the stepmother was not kind to Cinderella . 558754_562724
and one day &-um an invitation came that all of the <unmarried women in> [//] &-uh young girls in the (.) village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince . 563405_575995
they needed to find (.) a suitable (.) wife for the prince . 576213_581053
so ‡ Cinderella heard about it . 581623_583573
and she dreamt of going . 584170_585720
and she was a friend to the animals . 586506_588486
she was a kind girl . 588503_589673
and the mice and the animals helped her . 590114_594604
and they made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night . 595350_597660
but when it was time to come they said that she could not go . 598126_600936
and the wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly . 601413_604393
they were very very mean to her . 604416_605796
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go . 606286_608416
and they locked her (.) away . 609086_610996
but the mice came and they helped her . 611766_613036
they got the keys . 613056_614116
and they opened the door . 614162_615132
and all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother was there . 615622_618142
and she helped Cinderella . 618628_620008
and &+sh there was a beautiful dress for her . 620538_622968
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen . 623594_627134
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight . 627593_631473
so ‡ Cinderella went . 632146_633036
and she danced . 633531_634541
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her . 634732_644592
but then the clock struck twelve . 645396_647806
and out Cinderella ran out_of the ball . 647962_650612
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes . 651224_654424
&-um and then &-um <she turned> [/] &-um she turned back into Cinderella . 655629_659479
and she made it back <to the> [/] to the [/] &-um the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters . 660105_668405
and a few days later &-um some of the prince's men came . 668872_672942
and they had (.) Cinderella's shoe . 673302_675692
and they said we can try this on . 676029_677609
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince . 677626_680526
and all of the stepsisters tried it on . 681024_683624
and Cinderella I [/] &+th I believe <she was> [/] she was locked away then too because <they had noticed> [//] they knew [//] <the stepmothers [* m
they realized . 694219_695139
so ‡ I think they had locked her away at that point as_well . 695572_698322
and they helped her get out . 698794_700614
and she tried on the shoe . 700960_702260
and sure enough it fit . 702347_703567
and &-um she was able to see the prince . 704294_706504
and they lived happily ever after . 706677_708227
aw . [+ exc] 708978_709568
you're welcome . 710482_710942
well ‡ first you would get out your bread <and you> [//] and a knife . 735731_740501
and you would open your peanut butter and spread some peanut butter on the bread . 740599_743829
and then <you would get> [//] I would get a clean knife . 744430_747080
I don't mix my peanut butter and jelly . 747200_748690
and I would open the jelly and spread the jelly on top of that . 748869_752119
put another piece of bread on top . 752828_754388
cut it in half . 754776_755496
my mother said if you cut it in half it's a little extra love in that sandwich . 755861_759531
so ‡ we would always cut that in half as_well . 759975_762685
