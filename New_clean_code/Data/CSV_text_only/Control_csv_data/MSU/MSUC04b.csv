&-um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst . 33117_36087
and my doctor had told me that I could just (.) do normal activities and nothing would happen . 36398_40738
and unfortunately &-um it did rupture . 41127_43107
and it burst . 43125_43835
and it was February . 44303_44833
and it was an ice storm . 44849_46329
and it was the middle of the night . 46689_47539
and it was very treacherous getting there . 48353_50943
but I [//] we did . 50966_53366
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic &-um operation . 53529_57199
and they couldn't do it that way so it was a full-on operation . 57216_59936
and I remember <it was> [//] I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time . 60456_64616
and eventually I just got back to my own [//] my old self . 65105_68465
&-um I don't remember too much about what I did to get better . 79125_81735
I do remember though that &+th I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk . 81751_85441
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown . 86061_91841
and it required crossing a very busy street . 92308_94428
and there was no traffic light . 95038_96498
and I remember them being able to cross very easily . 96572_98682
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in [/] in either direction to inch my way through . 98705_104395
&-um but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to [/] to move . 104817_111987
and now I don't even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but &=gest
yes . 117182_117482
okay ‡ thank_you . 117497_118437
yes my first experience was &-um back in the late nineteen nineties . 129419_135299
&-um I worked with &-uh a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges . 135316_146216
and the [/] the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they (.) had been . 146760_156560
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse . 157015_162095
so ‡ that was my first experience was [/] &+t was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually &-uh substituted for words <that could> [/] that could not be understood . 162487_171587
and [/] &-um and the [/] the kids were great . 172044_173944
and <they were> [//] you_know they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do they would just start to cry . 174131_178551
and &-uh <you'd hafta> [/] you'd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just &-like I don't wanna do this . 178864_186854
and &-um now of_course fast forward to here &-um this has been an amazing experience working with both children and [/] and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate . 187385_197025
and what they're doing you_know to [/] to make themselves better . 197047_200517
and I'm [//] I've taken cues from the people &+w &+f with whom I'm working &-um what not to do and [/] and what to do . 200533_206243
and [/] and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps . 206260_211080
so &=ges
yes <I'd like> [//] it's something I love talking about . 239338_241848
&-um my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park &=clears
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year . 251526_255536
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in [/] in the south and then the midwest and +... 255916_261555
and &-um even_though we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had . 262065_272245
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something . 272323_275943
and we were also very sad that it was finished . 275965_278505
"&-uh but every time they build a new ball park, &+w we'll be going . 278946_282156"
so ‡ &-um and [/] and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created <our Christmas cards> [//] our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling . 282494_291284
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with &-um with the [/] the trip itself . 291663_297493
"and the first one &-um it said +""/. 297591_300221"
"+"" from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home . 300423_304313"
which [/] which was mine ! 305243_306513
&-um but it was nice . 306883_307923
and &-um it [//] in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen . 307946_312816
we saw cities we never would have seen . 312836_315166
and we interfaced with people that we never would have you_know communicated with (be)cause they're very different when you leave the New_York area . 315185_320615
so &=ges
okay ‡ &-um this story begins with a boy playing soccer . 349922_354402
and he's kicking the ball in the air . 354924_356584
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction . 356606_359316
and the ball goes crashing through &-um the window of a home . 359479_364849
and there's a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window . 364990_372950
"and at the end he picks up the soccer ball and looks outside to see who (.) kicked it, from whence it came . 373373_378953"
okay . 398704_399094
&-um a little boy is leaving the house . 399110_401170
he does not want the umbrella . 404974_406464
he says “bye mom” and leaves without the umbrella . 406686_409386
and as he starts walking it starts to rain . 409884_412214
and then it starts to rain even harder . 412238_414358
so ‡ he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake . 414838_419768
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet . 419790_422550
and then he (.) takes the umbrella and starts out again . 422840_425610
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree . 444121_447861
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down . 448319_452269
"so ‡ her dad takes a ladder, climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat . 452702_457942"
unfortunately the ladder falls . 458317_459477
he can't get down . 460017_460987
there's a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really can't get down . 461002_464422
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree . 465015_470745
&-uh Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters . 541574_548994
and even_though they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family . 549580_554120
in_fact ‡ her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders . 554461_559051
and she is kept down at heel even_though they are (.) wealthy and &-uh (.) snobby . 559616_565796
and an invitation comes to a ball . 566252_568532
and the [/] the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going . 569177_572407
but it's quite clear that she will not be going to the ball . 572454_575694
&-um the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife . 576506_581216
and Cinderella's &+f friends from the field make her a dress . 581868_587398
"and she's all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say +""/. 587788_590888"
"+"" you're not going . 591039_591969"
and they destroy the dress . 592274_593344
and she's devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball . 594078_598938
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears . 599758_602118
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress . 602498_604598
&-um she turns a pumpkin into a carriage . 605493_607313
she turns four white mice into four horses . 607328_609678
I could sing it but I won't &=laughs . [+ exc] 609728_611678
I really could . [+ exc] 612854_613604
&-um and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken . 614064_620314
and everything will turn back to the way it is . 620446_622536
&+sh she goes to the ball . 623434_624454
she meets the prince . 624810_625370
she dances with the prince . 625601_626921
they're falling in love . 627051_628301
and the clock strikes twelve . 628324_630784
so ‡ she hurries out . 631528_632308
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her . 632324_637654
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman he's fallen in love with . 638376_642776
so ‡ they set out to try the [/] &+r the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in <the town> [//] the village . 643412_650082
"and even_though the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it, they eventually find that it fits Cinderella . 650656_656526"
and they live happily every after . 656546_658706
okay . 673082_673532
&-um <I would take> [//] I would open both jars . 674224_676524
I would find a knife . 677046_678086
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread . 678219_681389
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread . 682178_686478
and since there is only one piece of bread <I would just> [//] I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich . 686773_691203
