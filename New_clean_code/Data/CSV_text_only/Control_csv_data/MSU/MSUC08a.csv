(...) &=click the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in <my breast> [//] my right breast . 20223_26773
and (.) our son Joseph had just been born &-uh <a year ago> [//] a year before the [/] &+di the diagnosis or the concern anyway . 28045_37375
and so &-uh I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him . 38143_45633
but there was surgery required . 46063_47513
and there was a waiting period . 47560_48870
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him <not on> [/] not on me so_that I could get back to &-um taking care of him . 48889_58109
as it turned out everything was fine . 58678_60568
the lump was removed . 60592_62452
it was benign . 62547_63377
and everything was alright . 63425_64614
so [//] but it was a scare for awhile . 64867_66987
and &-uh important that I kept the priorities that I thought was [//] were important . 67470_74030
there was very little recovery . 79357_80677
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasn't too sure whether they had removed the breast or not &=laughs when I first woke up from &-um the anesthesia . 80700_89480
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright . [+ gram] 89756_96446
and I was so busy . 96468_97418
I don't recall anything special &=laughs other_than (.) a dressing and &-uh (..) keeping up with <whatever med(ication)s> [//] &+o whatever they told me to do . 97487_107757
but I [//] &+di nothing was [//] &+in was bothering me after it was &+o over . 107780_111470
yeah . 114624_114894
mhm . 123038_123638
&-um I useta teach English as a second language . 124754_130174
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation (.) exercises that we did . 130359_136969
I always &-uh tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew . 137628_141978
but &-uh yeah there's difficulty when someone is not fluent in [/] &-uh in your language . 142000_149000
&-um &=click &=sigh sometimes with elderly . [+ gram] 149584_154694
&=click I &-um took care of my mom and my dad &-uh as they were really in advanced years . 156397_162477
&+l nineties . [+ gram] 162586_163206
and &-uh sometimes my father would go back to Italian . 163469_167149
&-um it was a place of comfort <I think> [//] especially as he was &-uh maybe dying . 167893_173943
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow . 174254_178094
<all I> [//] &+real but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking . 178113_183263
but &=click it was &-uh memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another . [+ gram] 183278_188608
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too . [+ gram] 189495_193535
but I was very interested in where he was going with [/] &-uh with the Italian at the end . 193890_199220
(.) with my mom she was more [/] more grounded . 200803_204183
sometime <it was hearing> [//] it was her hearing problem . 204200_206350
was a_lot_of shouting &=laughs going on . [+ gram] 206468_207608
so ‡ it's [//] sometimes for me it's that . 208421_210341
it's like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive . 210360_217450
yeah . 220036_220236
you're welcome . 221138_221448
oh I've had so many happy things . 234473_235783
&=laughs oh what's happy ? 238696_240116
I'm sure the happiest day was &+o the day Joseph was born . 240382_243742
&=click &-um we were in East_Orange_General hospital . 245674_249064
I had a wonderful doctor . 249155_250615
&-um my husband Joe &=clicks who had a_little too much background in &+s language &-uh problems that can occur with babies and children &=laughs made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like (.) monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food . 251350_273560
whatever the heck his [//] he worried about my doctor removed from the diet . 273575_277795
so ‡ when it was time for Joseph &+t to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural . 278228_282078
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes . 282576_284706
so ‡ when the day come [//] came I [//] for Joseph's birth I was one lesson short <of the full> [//] &+le of the full (.) course I guess of childbirth preparation . 285295_296865
so ‡ I was going fine without any medication . 297623_299783
it was just taking awhile . 299800_300940
"and then I said to them +""/. 300960_301940"
"+"" this is all I know . 302059_302969"

and everything was fine . 338000_338710
it was the way Joe had hoped (.) without any interference . 338727_342057
he got a really nice Apgar &+s score . 342420_344580
yes he was a ten right off the bat . 345079_346719

once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball . 393891_398491
&-um and (.) not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where (.) dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair . 399551_413641
and shocked out_of his (.) ennui (.) &=clicks he looks out the window and (.) with ball in hand (.) has (..) judged (.) correctly that he's going to hafta go outside and (.) speak to little Ned . 414162_434542
well ‡ I think this is my daughter (.) in-law Tanya . 458055_462185
and this is Nick . 462200_463100
and &+t Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him &-um to school that day . 463925_470955
and as he's waving goodbye he is reassuring my (.) daughter in-law that he surely doesn't need an umbrella independent little soul that he is . 471200_479850
&-um within &-uh the first block on the way to school he [//] it begins to rain . 480780_487680
&-um as he's sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he (.) understands what his mom was trying to say after all . 488338_498218
"&=click a bit reluctantly he has returned home and &-uh (.) just hasta stand there sopping wet (.) while my daughter in-law tries very hard not to say +""/. 499623_512403"
"+"" I told you so . 512520_513230"
but he [/] &-um &=clicks he happily accepts an umbrella and returns (.) to school in the opposite direction it looks like &=laughs . 513977_523246
returns to school . [+ gram] 524126_524586

and happy . [+ gram] 526702_527382
enough . 529048_529468
&=laughs well (..) this is <little Mary> [/] little Mary_Boyle who has &-uh &=click noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree . 551935_569185
and [/] &-uh and has called the only person she knows who can rescue &-uh Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household . 569907_581877
and that is her dad . 581900_582980
&-um he has gone to help her &-uh climbs the tree . 583626_590016
but the ladder has gotten away from him . 590032_593142
is fallin(g) . [+ gram] 593160_593750
as if things aren't noisy enough &-uh the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark . 595412_601142
"and so now the neighbors <I guess> [//] have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue (.) in this order dad, Fluffernutter . 601986_615016"
and they're not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because he's the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with . 616000_621210
there you go . 621817_622317
you're welcome . [+ exc] 625224_625604
there was a [/] &-uh a widower with a daughter &+n whose name was Cinderella who had remarried (.) a [/] &+f a mean woman . 790000_804400
&-uh he didn't know that at the time but that's what marriage reveals over time &=laughs . 805470_809740
she had &+t two [/] &+s two daughters . 810460_813150
and so his stepdaughters &-um were part of the household that (.) &=clicks Cinderella and her father had enjoyed . 813200_821720
&=clicks but things changed once they all arrived together . 823481_828411
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude . 828726_834916
&-um the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her (.) in every way . 835276_841546
she performed servile (.) tasks . 842000_844630
&-um &=clicks at one point an invitation comes to a ball . 845272_850622
and &-uh they're considering &-uh happily going . 851589_856589
Cinderella's face is lighting up . 856850_858190
but she doesn't realize &-uh what's going on . 858209_860659
the ball was held because the [/] &-uh the King decided that <his son> [//] it was time for the son to marry . 861436_867556
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of (.) the town . 868563_874583
well ‡ Cinderella would love to go . 875600_878190
and &-uh it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because <the mom and> [//] &-uh the stepmother <and the> [/] &+s and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves . 878305_890255
so ‡ they prepared [//] &-uh had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy . 890963_895123
but &+sh <she was> [//] there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family . 895300_899090
well ‡ there's a book <in the picture> [//] and the &+b picture book I don't remember at all . [+ exc] 900544_904924
she discovers a book . 905087_905967
I don't know if that's where she &-um comes across an incantation . 906054_911054
but a fairy godmother appears . 911070_912520
and &-uh because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her . 913014_922794
fairy godmother helps her . 922865_924155
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too . 924788_929548
and as [/] &-um as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball &-um I'm going to just remember that she &-uh dances with the handsome prince . 930115_941465
and at [//] &+s as she <runs back> [//] &-um tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair . 941489_949109
I didn't see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though . [+ exc] 949980_953800
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight . [+ gram] 953880_959120
but she hadta get out_of there by midnight . 959140_960680
and &-uh she does . 961482_962602
but then <there's the> [//] there is <the return of the slipper> [//] &-uh the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what &-uh he remembered about his beautiful (.) date for the night . [+ gram] 962687_975417
&=clicks &-um but as I said the book seems a little bit different . [+ exc] 976479_979519
there's a key . 979928_980618
and I guess when she lets everyone in (.) finally +... 980641_984381
where is he ? [+ exc] 984400_984850
why is the key there ? [+ exc] 984900_985750
I don't remember that part . [+ exc] 985900_986820
but &-um as I just remember the story ends happily . 988429_992679
that he does find her and the slipper . 992694_994984
and they're &+u reunited . 995000_997790
and so happily ever after . [+ gram] 997839_999559
uhhuh . [+ exc] 1001568_1001718
&=click well &=click I would (.) &=click keep all my ingredients &-um at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly . 1011964_1022474
lay the bread down . 1023250_1024220
get a nice (.) butter knife . 1024452_1026892
and I begin with (.) spreading a [/] &+s a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the [/] &+e the well around all four sides so_that when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesn't actually go over the side . 1027171_1047781
it just stays within the [/] the borders . 1047826_1050086
&=click &-um &=click I useta like mine folded over &=laughs . 1051327_1054167
I think I [/] I like it just the one slice . 1055465_1057585
so ‡ it just looks really kind_of beautiful with <a little wall> [//] a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle . 1057640_1062860
okay . [+ exc] 1069604_1069844
