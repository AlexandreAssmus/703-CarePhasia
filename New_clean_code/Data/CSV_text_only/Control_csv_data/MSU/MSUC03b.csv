oh gee . 18509_19269
&-hm actually I fainted (.) once . 20112_24162
and that's a terrible feeling . 24908_26608
and <I guess> [/] you_know I guess we could compare that to a [/] a stroke in the sense that it's a sudden onset . 27102_33192
"and &-uh you do have a [/] a short window, if it's the same as a stroke . 34129_38049"
there [//] in my case there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong . 38072_42502
and you do have time to [/] to be cognizant of being in big trouble . 44036_50116
in_fact ‡ I remember one time I [/] I &-uh [/] I fainted . 51240_55510
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house . 56339_60039
and <that was> [//] I was really afraid of [/] of the fact that I was in a hard tile room . 61328_67398
and &-um my daughter was downstairs . 68566_70796
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight . 71735_75945
"and I [//] just in a panic I said +""/. 77030_79310"
"+"" Dolly, call nine-one-one . 80230_82400"
so ‡ I knew I was in trouble . 83558_85448
and I [/] I [//] then I [/] I was able to just slowly go down myself . 86202_91732
and then I went out_of the picture . 91852_92922
and &-uh the paramedics did take me to the hospital . 94472_96972
and I had food poisoning . 97709_99079
and &-uh when I got +//. 100343_101783
&+th now that was really frightening as you_know they [//] they're racing me through the &-uh the e_r . 101884_106814
they're asking me you_know all sorts of information . 107457_109767
and [/] and the pocketbook disappears . 109791_112571
and then you_know testing and monitors and all that . [+ gram] 112587_115677
"and they said +""/. 115700_116150"
"+"" you_know your potassium level is in the basement . 116290_118520"
so ‡ it was really a +... 119084_120284
and you_know you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either you_know in the hospital or even dying . 120726_127576
"and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to &-uh those sort_of sublevels, organs can start shutting down rather quickly . 128471_137081"
so ‡ it was truly an emergency situation . 137742_140312
so [//] and my daughter as young as she was you_know I credit Natalie with you_know the fact that it wasn't worse . 141351_147331
that she [/] she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed nine-one-one . 147856_152386
yeah ‡ so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice „ I think . 153364_161014
right ? 162894_163264
and that's probably as scary &+li just like that . 164694_167244
yeah [/] yeah . 169257_170997
I was in the hospital for the night . 177222_179032
and &-uh they gave me a liquid potassium . 179859_182949
and then &-uh in i_vs . [+ gram] 183841_185571
and then &-um I left the hospital with &-uh +... 186305_191085
"well ‡ before I left, they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions you_know to [/] to call . 191818_199178"
but it was liquid potassium and i_vs for &-uh many hours . 199200_203090
and they were monitoring me and you_know taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that . 204377_209537
so [//] but you_know I was out you_know by the next morning . 210615_213325
but still +... 213349_214079
I felt really weak and tired . 217494_218834
I_mean you needed to recover . 218855_220305
the [/] the [/] the rest of that day was really kind_of not on the map you_know ? 220356_223966
but I_mean I [/] I just felt really really tired . 224297_229337
and &+j wiped out maybe is better . 229903_231933
tired [/] tired doesn't capture it . 232560_234130
&=laughs you_know it was scary . 235119_241039
you_know ‡ when you see these stories right . 243890_245270
you [/] you hear them . 245290_246020
somebody died . 246273_246993
&-like how do they die ? 247017_248427
right [/] right . 251073_252653
it can be serious . 254718_255648
and I had been doing a good deed that day . 256748_258507
I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium . 259141_260680
"<at the time> [//] and of all things, at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation . 261233_266774"
and I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium working &-um an event . 267545_271355
it was family day . 271373_272793
and <they had> [//] &-uh I had some chicken . 273320_275540
and that's [/] that's what did me in &=laughs . 276688_278438
trying to do a good thing „ right &=laughs ? [+ gram] 280961_282771
they almost killed me &=laughs ! 283140_284510
yes . 300962_301432
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it . 309929_314299
&-um a very dear friend of mine was [/] was [//] had cancer and was dying . 315174_322044
"&-uh you_know ‡ she was at that, you_know, close point . 323183_326663"
and &-uh she [//] I guess it was &-uh the liver starting to shut down . 326940_332960
"you_know ‡ the [//] again, the organs the [/] the kidney and liver, especially the liver . [+ gram] 333368_337818"
and she was incoherent . 337835_339225
and she was &+s speaking to me . 340277_342077
this was a very strange experience . 342730_344350
she was speaking to me . 344369_345339
&-um but I couldn't understand a single word that she said . 346718_349888
and it was just gibberish . 350889_352479
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way . 352835_355295
and <she would> [//] it would be frustrating for her that I (.) wasn't understanding what she said . 356260_361260
and it sounded like words too . 362130_363820
but it wasn't . 364190_364790
and &-um I spoke with the [/] &-uh the &-uh nurse who was caring for her . 366571_372411
she was at home . 372678_373378
and &-uh I was told that &+th when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen . 374577_380847
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of you_know the medical sequence of events . [+ gram] 381576_386446
but [/] but that [/] that's very frustrating to be +... 387492_391502
and I could see the frustration on her face . 391824_394134
and then &-uh I feel badly . 395677_397657
and I feel frustrated too because I [/] I really wanna understand and [/] and can't . 397680_403590
well ‡ you could only have simple communications at that point sort_of like point to things . 407980_412160
"and then <I would> [/] &-um <I would> [/] I would tell her at &+di different &+ilver intervals +""/. 412931_418641"
"+"" I cannot understand what you're saying . 419727_421567"
and she would feel &+t even worse . 421586_423896
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was (.) saying words . 423917_427987
I [/] &+w I realized that pretty [/] pretty quickly . 429797_432037
she [/] she thought she was you_know saying things . 432179_435029
so ‡ (..) I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or &-um (.) just (.) pretend sometimes I even understood . 436178_449288
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever . [+ gram] 451533_454483
you_know ‡ then <she would> [//] it would be pretty clear I'm not coming with the water . 455062_459852
but that [/] that [//] that's very frightening . 460318_463728
and [/] and it's frustrating for everyone . 465841_468391
"you're imprisoned in your own body in a way, aren't you . 469291_471781"
yeah ‡ that hasta be a hell . 473038_475088
&-hm . 502467_502977
something important . 504205_505695
&-uh (...) I guess a_lot_of important things sort_of happened you_know ? 506773_516722
&-um be hard to &-uh +... 517072_519302
<I think> [/] I think &-um (..) in a sense I made my own important things . 521315_526765
&-um for instance &-um &-uh I grew up &-uh in a family . 527454_534424
&-uh I was one of five children . 534444_536284
and now I don't want this to sound you_know politically incorrect but &=laughs my father was &-uh Italian of Italian descent . 537194_549204
and he had this mind set that girls just don't go to college . 549660_555530
and unfortunately four of us were girls . 556543_558763
so ‡ he didn't [//] that wasn't a +... 558784_560114
he wasn't pleased with that either I don't think &=laughs . 560918_562788
and I was the third one . 562878_564248
can you imagine ? 564373_565183
in a row . [+ gram] 565234_565734
no boys yet . [+ gram] 566015_566835
&-mm so ‡ anyhow ‡ &=laughs it was made very clear that &-uh college was not on the map . 568460_574290
"&-uh and his [/] his [/] his idea was that &-um +""/. 575468_579248"
"+"" I've been supporting you all these years . 579471_582251"
"+"" and now (.) you owe me . 582857_584517"
"+"" you_know you hafta go to work (.) and contribute to the household . 585528_588728"
so ‡ this was a built-in thing . 589599_591029
at the time I wasn't realizing how grave it was . 591265_593555
in_fact ‡ there was something that felt almost exciting about it . 593918_597268
that I'll be going to work soon you_know &=laughs . 597399_600059
and the good news was that I was also an honor student . 601016_605096
and I got to high_school at twelve . 605117_607987
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete &=laughs . 608816_613446
and now I was going to work &=laughs . 615048_616558
so ‡ my guidance counselor at the school was [//] she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student . 617293_625093
she actually wanted to call him . 625366_626596
and I was very calm about the whole thing . 627194_628664
"I said +""/. 628683_628763"
"+"" there's really no point . 628902_629872"
"+"" you_know it's [//] &+y you're not going to get anywhere . 630163_632373"
this is the state of things . 632490_634070
it's the state of the art at the Lastname household . 634314_636824
and that's that . 636910_637840
so ‡ anyway &-um she then &-uh decided to take me under her wing and &-um knew someone down on Wall_Street and [//] &-uh who worked at a personnel department at what was then the Irving_Trust_Company which no longer exists . 638135_656355
and they took great pride in that [/] that company . 656500_660030
&+th they [/] they were at one Wall_Street . 660079_661709
and they considered themselves at the top of Wall_Street . 661759_664379
and this was verbalized . 664401_665641
so ‡ anyway &=laughing &-um she called her friend . 666156_669706
and &-uh I'll never forget her . 670035_671965
her name was Firstname_Lastname who I went to see . 671986_674486
so ‡ I [/] I put a suit on &-uh went shopping and bought myself you_know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview . 675239_684519
and I think I was a shoo-in because her friend the guidance counselor had called her . 684536_688366
and so she hired me . 688708_690838
and I ended up in a subbasement . 691704_695414
not just a basement . 696092_697202
it was a subbasement . 698140_700130
I think I was lower than the vaults . 700294_702094
"in a secretarial pool, where else &=laughs . [+ gram] 703245_706525"
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool . 707821_711691
I did . 712140_712750
and good [/] good on me . [+ gram] 713197_714827
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to +... 714849_719899
even_though I had an academic &-um &-uh course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study . 719957_726747
<and I> [/] and I [/] I took typing and stenography . 726765_729585
I thought this might help me . 730554_732464
and maybe my job won't be so random . 733355_735605
I have at_least a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up you_know &=laughs . 735623_741303
so ‡ I end up in a secretarial pool . 742534_744704
and &-um they [//] banks are notoriously very frugal . 745525_750835
and &-uh back then the things were even worse . 751495_753715
"and the Irving, as they call themselves, were a very conservative organization . 754264_758434"
and &-um I [/] I [/] I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved . 759390_768670
so ‡ if somebody you_know in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches you_know where I was . 769285_780055
so ‡ I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in . 780704_784434
it was sort_of like I could imagine <little orphan Annie at the or at> [//] being at any orphanage where a call comes in . 784820_790650
and they pick you &=laughs . 790665_791475
so ‡ they [//] a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust &-uh department on the twelfth floor +... 793750_801420
he was a [/] a [/] a senior vice president of the bank . 801991_804261
&-uh his secretary was unexpectedly out . 805191_807461
and &-uh they needed a fill-in . 808642_811012
so ‡ they selected me . 811570_812930
and up I went &=laughs . 813400_814720
and I walked in . 815936_817436
and you could hear a pin drop in this place . 817452_819462
I could tell it was going to be +... 819732_821152
I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of you_know lightheartedness . 821330_825720
you [//] you_know it [/] it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water . 825966_830386
and you should genuflect you_know <before you> [//] to sit down at your desk &=laughs . 830403_836453
so ‡ there I am . 837085_838485
and &-uh it turned out that his secretary +... 839137_843297
I'll fast forward a_little . 843910_844770
so ‡ here I was . 844988_845448
you_know ‡ my skills were good . 845466_846666
I'm answering the phone . 847445_848845
"I'm taking shorthand, letters . 848865_850515"
&-uh <things are getting> [//] things are humming along &=laughs . 850846_852576
everything is great . 853375_854615
and &-um it turns out that she [//] the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back . 855428_862538
&-uh she was pregnant and &-uh was having some &-uh difficulties some complications so the [/] the absence was going to be long term . 863703_873393
and they hired me . 874525_875595
<so now> [//] &-uh and I had a raise right away . 876757_880927
I thought this work life is a cinch . 881140_883780
I'm here for a week and I got a raise &=laughs . 883950_885760
I got out_of the subbasement you_know . 888238_890258
I'm in the light of day . 890796_891886
<things were> [//] you_know &-like things were moving along so quickly that I [/] I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall_Street &=laughs you_know . 891934_900104
it was the trajectory I was on . 900329_902359
so ‡ one day <I was there> [/] I was there for about three months I guess . 902687_906237
and I was out &-uh to lunch still trying to you_know explore the area . 906259_911359
"&-uh it's a very exciting place, you_know . 911757_913907"
Wall_Street . 914565_915095
and I found the New_York Stock_Exchange . 915997_917867
and I [/] you_know I was &+cum sort_of like a pseudo tourist . 917957_920877
so ‡ I was walking up Broadway one day . 921256_922796
"and I encounter the Marine_Midland_Bank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge, went up a few stories . 922859_933859"
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving . 934518_939158
"<it just> [//] you_know ‡ it was a great place, light and airy, modern . 939489_943429"
I went in . 943923_944653
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was . 945419_948369
so ‡ I was directed there . 948391_949671
I sat down filled out &-uh an application . 949967_953707
and &-um I was drunk with power by then you_know because I had gotten the raise . 954676_958766
things were moving so quickly . 958816_960966
so ‡ I filled out the application . 961559_963629
the interview with the personnel &-uh manager went very well . 963645_967365
she told me about three different types of positions I could have . 967678_970738
and &-uh visited all three of them . [+ gram] 971315_974275
and I could pick whichever one I wanted . 974346_976416
so ‡ I picked the one in the international department . 976937_979357
that sounded really interesting to me . 979588_981308
and was working for an executive there . [+ gram] 982009_984199
and &-um it was just a wonderful environment . 984806_988216
and I was in the Latin_American division . 988232_990812
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and (.) Chile . 991284_997164
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when &-uh there was the coup_d'etat in Chile when Salvador_Allende was +... 998864_1008084
and we had lots of money . 1008168_1010328
&-uh we [/] we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin_American area . 1010894_1018684
so ‡ <those were> [/] those were some pretty exciting times . 1018857_1022177
and I then I was there for a few years . 1022693_1024123
and &-uh my direct boss <who was the> [//] he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office . 1024144_1034044
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor . 1035180_1041369

and &-like it would have been +... 1052006_1053726
I look back . 1054140_1054580
I probably made the wrong choice (be)cause the romance didn't work out either . 1054680_1059230
but that's okay . 1059250_1060120
so ‡ I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a_little more fast moving and exciting . 1060890_1072650
I [/] I figured &+ts this is a good you_know juncture to get out_of banking . 1073876_1078026
it seemed very staid no matter where you were . 1078047_1079947
so ‡ I [/] I [/] I got a [//] an agent . 1080776_1083386
I had you_know kind_of felt my way around you_know how things work down on the street by then . 1083998_1088998
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms . 1089743_1093333
so ‡ to fast forward +... 1094110_1095030
hope that wasn't too long a story . [+ gram] 1095090_1096620
&=laughs then I [/] I [/] I [/] I had my daughter . 1097331_1101211

so ‡ I applied to Montclair_State . 1105898_1108488

&-uh I came in at the time was a second career program . [+ gram] 1111773_1115383
and &-uh the important thing was that I did it . 1116200_1120450
I got my degree . 1120615_1121765
and I graduated summa_cum_laude . 1122342_1124412
and I had marvelous experiences . 1125122_1127502
and plus I was a day student . 1127599_1129229
&-um and that was another thing for me . 1129746_1132776
I realized that I could still kind_of live the life I might have . 1132795_1139125
when I mention a day student it's because I was <a young> [//] &-uh always among young mainstream students . 1139395_1145925
"and I thought +""/. 1146554_1147224"

and they liked me . 1153352_1154682
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience . 1154700_1157740
so ‡ I got the degree anyway . 1158541_1159801
