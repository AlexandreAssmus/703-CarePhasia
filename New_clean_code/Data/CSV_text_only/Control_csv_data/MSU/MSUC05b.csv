oh that's right . 33407_34357
I [//] &-uh injury [//] I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant . 35033_43553
I was going to a store to get some [//] an ice cream . 44183_47183
I was really hungry . 47558_48148
I had just worked really hard that morning . 48166_49716
"and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying +""/. 49732_52322"
"+"" if they sell cheeseburgers I'm getting one . 52402_54582"
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist . 55163_59643
and immediately a big &-uh ball popped out_of my wrist . 59737_63507
and I couldn't move my fingers . 63671_65111
so ‡ I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast . 65396_71576
and <it was> [/] &-uh <it was> [/] it was interesting mainly <in my [/] &+c my> [//] &-um in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything . 71625_79315
but of_course I couldn't work either . 79332_81642
&-um but it presented a challenge . 82347_84307
I learned how to do things left-handed . 84434_85804
I hadta write left-handed . 85875_87215
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars . 87232_90252
and <that was in> [//] &-um I think it was in May . 91092_93892
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in Columbia_Presbyterian with him with the cast on . 93915_99055
we have these pictures . 99143_100053
and I remember he had &-like a little &-um kind_of like a scrape on the back of his head <or just> [//] not [/] not a [//] &-like a bloody thing but a [/] &+w a [//] kind_of like a worn-out spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast . 100589_111219
&-um I don't actually remember doing physical therapy . 122150_124240
once I had the cast off I think I was fine . 124684_126824
and I regained all the strength in my wrist . 126841_128631
I think six weeks . 131351_132161
yes it was my dominant hand . 137317_139007
yes I do . 150263_151083
you_know ‡ my cousin Ann &-um she's seventy one now . 152501_155431
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six . 155451_158381
and so she's left-handed . 159114_160434
and so she lost the use of her right side . 161570_163800
"her hand is all mangled and her foot, also . 163849_167439"
and her communication skills are very limited . 168070_170350
she [//] it's aphasia is what I think she has . 170550_173120
and &-uh she's gotten progressively better over the years . 173587_176257
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again . 176434_178854
"she useta always say +""/. 178957_179747"
"+"" zoom zoom zoom zoom . 179826_181156"
and &-uh I always thought because <she was in a car> [//] she was sitting in a [//] &+p her parked car when she had the stroke . 181636_186736
and &-um she doesn't say that anymore . 187448_189648
but a_lot of the people where she lives that's her nickname Zoom_zoom because she useta say that a_lot . 189671_194431
but she's very challenging to communicate with . 194652_197402
&-um and I'll go see her and spend and hour or so . 197491_199931
and we have lunch . 199955_201055
and &-um things and we try to communicate <as well> [//] as best as we can with asking her simple questions . 201630_207030
and she communicates in sort_of a roundabout way . 207052_212312
she has three children . 212424_213244
and when she wants to talk about them she &+aw can't always get their names but she'll say one two or three . 213261_217891
and that's how we know (be)cause sometimes she brings a_lot_of numbers in . 218237_220637
so ‡ when she tries to tell you she's in pain she'll &+t take her good hand . 220652_224552
"and she'll say +""/. 224568_225068"
"+"" one two three four five &+uf pain . 225343_229293"
"+"" I don't know . 229398_229538"
"+"" I don't know . 229957_230327"
like that . 230343_230883
"she [//] somehow, it's amazing how she communicates . 231292_233272"
I give her a_lot_of credit . 233292_234892
yeah . 236526_236746
okay ‡ &-um I would like to tell you the story &-um about my grandfather . 265719_271089
because he was the [//] one of the most important people in my life when I was a child . 271545_275535
and <I was> [//] &+g it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten . 275619_278739
it was in July . 278809_279319
and &-um it was just a normal day . 280287_282577
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street . 282599_285829
and it was back in the day when there was a_lot_of freedom . 285947_287697
you [/] you went out the door and came in for lunch . 287715_290315
and then you went out the door . 290339_291569
and there really weren't very many parameters . 291645_294365
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had . 294875_296955
and &-um came home to find out that he had had a +... 297102_299952
he [//] &+th they didn't use the word stroke but that's what he had . 300000_302610
&-um that he hadta go to the hospital from work . 303176_306266
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies . 306567_312657
and then the next morning I remember waking up . 313309_314909
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like . 314929_317429
"I have that feeling of what it felt like &-um to find out that you know he wasn't coming home and just as a child, an innocent child &-um kind_of coming to terms with life and death saying “wow” and really being blindsided by the whole thing . 317578_332428"
having that be my first experience with death . 333113_335433
and &-um you_know <I had> [//] my four sisters were there and my cousin who &-um is in the nursing home . 336034_341954
she was around because she [/] she kind_of lived with us for awhile . 342095_344685
and <it was just> [//] <she actually> [//] I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard . 345204_349414
<everyone went to the> [//] all the adults went to the funeral at night . 349819_352139
I just remembered that . 352263_353163
and I was hysterical crying . 353902_355342
I was so so sad . 355363_356083
and she didn't know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me +... 356208_358898
and it worked . 358918_359938
she wasn't being mean . 360362_361242
but I was beyond being consoled at that point . 361874_364934
and I [/] I felt very alone in my &-um grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather . 364955_372395
but anyway that [/] that [/] that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future . 372982_377872
and I remember a time when &-um I was in sixth grade . 378401_382921
and we were having a sleepover in my friend's back yard . 383498_386028
happened to be with a [//] &+w a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to &+leu leukemia a [//] &+g the other girl who lost her grandmother . [+ gram] 386623_394433
and I had lost my grandfather . 394457_395807
and we [//] it was like they [/] they could make a movie about the bond . 395823_398893
we were all in the tent . 399294_399904
and [/] and we were just talking . 399981_400781
I &+re can see us all sitting there . 400887_402747
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life . 403119_407219
and we put it out there . 407238_407968
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go . 408052_410982
and we all just [/] just let it out . 411611_413311
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this . 413335_418225
and it's &+t a good thing . 418244_419424
so ‡ that's why I think this story is [/] is &+m so important to me was because it's something that affected my life you_know as I grew up . 419474_427254
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that &-um I didn't know about angels then . 427645_431805
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe . 431923_435923
and he can &-uh sort_of watch over me if you will . 435940_439390
"yeah, &-uh one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball, kicking the ball . 465488_474728"
and inadvertently it went through the window &-uh of his [/] his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper . 474779_481389
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp . 481412_484402
and he stood up and looked out the window . 485083_486633
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window . 486656_490736
he &-um kind_of shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing . 492916_497116
and he was going to go speak to his son about that . 497256_499226
okay ‡ well ‡ &+i Johnny was on his way to school . 521756_523827
"and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said +""/. 524310_527030"
"+"" Johnny, take your umbrella . 527156_528196"
"and he said +""/. 528213_528693"
"+"" nope mom . 528963_529363"
"+"" I don't think it's going to rain today so I [/] I don't wanna take it . 529575_531705"
so ‡ off he went without his umbrella . 532369_533839
and sure enough it started to rain . 533860_535540
and it [/] it started to rain harder . 535563_537443
and he got wet . 538051_538811
"so ‡ he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said +""/. 538862_542642"
"+"" you were right mom . 543272_543752"
"+"" I needed my umbrella . 544298_545088"
then he took his umbrella and went off . 545582_547112
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of &-uh taking her advice next time . 547196_551836
it's always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though . [+ exc] 554789_556999
(..) okay &-um Sally and her dad were &-uh walking around the park one day . 574239_579449
Sally was riding her tricycle . 579566_581096
and &-um as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree . 581774_586314
and <her dad> [//] &-um she urged her dad to help the cat . 587740_590910
and &-um so &-uh he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree . 591669_595819
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over . 595875_598595
and &-um some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the &-uh fire department . 599257_604607
and sure enough the fire department came to &-uh help retrieve the dad from the tree (.) and the cat . 604630_610050
and at the end of the day every one was fine . 610261_612411
&=sighs once upon a time (.) in a land far away there was a &-uh little girl named Cinderella . 687558_697708
and she was brought to the home of a [/] a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her . 698661_704901
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters . 706037_708847
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was <the [/] the mom> [//] her stepmom . 708949_713889
and they actually put her to work . 714640_715740
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose . 716378_721688
&-um but Cinderella (.) was happy nonetheless . 722383_725913
"and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends, the mice and the (.) birds and such . 726169_731249"
"and she was a very kindred spirit, that Cinderella . 731364_733984"
and &-um she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride . 734573_741853
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom . 742297_744957
"and in her heart she thought +""/. 744973_746153"
"+"" oh ‡ I would just love to go to that ball . 746634_748234"
and &-uh she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of_course she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella . 749092_755322
and &-uh but the stepsisters were going to go . 755822_757722
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball . 757856_763176
and &-uh Cinderella was sad . 763850_765300
"she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said +""/. 765584_771414"
"+"" we'll help you, Cinderella . 771574_772754"
and they brought out some ribbon and some [/] some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her . 772769_778399
and &-um she had the dress . 779354_781354
but she had no way of getting to the ball . 781576_782896
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared . 782950_785800
and it was her fairy godmother . 785817_787187
and her [//] &+fair my [
"+"" don't cry my child . 789458_790378"
"+"" I know you wanna go to the ball . 790678_791548"
"+"" and [/] and I can help you . 791883_793123"
"+"" just fetch me a pumpkin . 793173_793893"
"+"" and I'll turn it into a coach . 794144_795344"
"+"" and your mice friends will be the coachmen . 795952_797542"
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the [/] the coachmen . 797565_804105
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world . 804533_807443
and when she got there she &+w approached the ball and looked down the stairs . 807491_811661
and there everyone was dancing . 811676_813136
and they saw her come in . 813152_814162
they turned and looked at her . 814181_815091
and &+sh the prince (.) looked . 815141_816951
and he thought she was the most &+am amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen . 817021_821461
he invited her to dance . 821646_822636
and they just had a nice connection . 822655_824965
and she &-um engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing . 825011_829701
and &-um suddenly the time had gone by . 830221_832701
and it was midnight . 832717_833277
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight . 833294_837114
so ‡ quick she ran from the castle . 837160_838540
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper . 839489_842969
and she found her way home . 842987_844217
and &-um &=clears
so ‡ he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to &-uh find them . 853956_857816
and everyone tried on the slipper . 857832_859012
and when he came to the house <of the> [//] where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper . 859064_866404
and &-uh it didn't quite work . 867442_868882
but the [//] Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs . 868930_871580
and the mice gave her the key . 871595_873725
and she got out . 874256_874906
she came down . 875149_875759
and she said she'd like to try on the slipper . 875781_877881
and with that she tried on the slipper . 877954_880194
and <her fairy god [
but as it was they [//] she tried on the slipper . 889606_892596
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted . 893074_894824
and they got married . 894848_896058
and they lived happily ever after . 896076_897716
I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters &=laughs and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness . 898382_905332
yes ‡ well ‡ if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of gluten-free bread from the freezer . 922913_931163
put them on a paper towel on the counter . 931559_933179
I'd get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon . 934120_937840
and I'd open up the peanut butter . 938068_939198
and I'd (.) scoop out (.) some peanut butter spread it on the bread . 939770_943720
close the jar . 944320_944920
I'd use the spoon to get the jelly out_of the jar . 945315_947555
I'd put it on the other slice of bread . 948156_949746
&=clear
put <the jar> [//] the lid back on the jar . 951951_954431
I'd put the peanut butter and jelly back . 956334_957834
I'd put <the lid [
and I probably would not cut it in half . 963412_965262
and I would take it to a table . 965377_966357
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich . 966376_968956
