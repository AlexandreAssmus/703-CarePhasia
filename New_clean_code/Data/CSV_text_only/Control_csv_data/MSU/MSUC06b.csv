and he wasn't being very careful . 298464_300244
and he went to kick the ball (.) to his friend . 300360_303340

his neighbor had been sitting there watching television and was very alarmed and upset that the ball came through the window . 308060_313780

she warned him a second time before he left . 348194_350334
"but he said +""/. 350603_350953"
"+"" no ‡ I don't need it . 351216_352036"
I guess hoping that it wouldn't rain . 352754_354504
but sure enough it did rain that day . 354884_356914
it rained on the way to school and on the way home from school . 357195_361855

Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away . 512770_515561
and her father married a wicked woman . 515801_518791
she had two daughters of her own . 518977_521116
and they (.) maltreated Cinderella . 521712_524933
she hadta clean the floor . 525368_527198
she hadta bring them breakfast . 527540_528900
she hadta make their dresses . 528950_530350
and one day &-um where they lived &+th an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land . 531260_540200
and all of the unmarried women <in the> [/] (.) in the area were invited to the ball . 540770_547310
and &-um the two stepsisters were going to go . 547885_551615
and Cinderella helped them get ready . 552384_554054
and she on her own made her own dress <with the help> [//] actually with the help of the animals . 554267_559737
she was very kind to animals . 559752_561222
&-um &=tongue
and then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her . 564886_567916
and they were evil . 568137_569397
and they ripped her dress and tore her dress . 569656_571966
and they told her she couldn't go . 572021_573341
and she cried and cried . 573958_575128
and they left . 575174_575974
and she cried . 576489_577389
and then all_of_a_sudden a fairy godmother appeared . 577407_579817
"and she told Cinderella +""/. 581376_582496"
"+"" I can help you get to the ball . 582874_584824"
and she used her magic wand and made a beautiful dress . 585062_588132
and she turned the pumpkins into a coach . 588597_590387
and she had coachmen come . 590902_593432
and Cinderella got to go to the ball . 593614_595434
and sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did &-um fall in love with her . 595933_601053
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that Cinderella hadta be home at midnight . 602396_610286
that if she was not home &+b when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form . [+ gram] 610546_616686
so ‡ Cinderella was at the ball having such a wonderful time . 617391_620801
and it was getting closer and closer . 620889_622479
and she didn't realize . 622501_623561
and all_of_a_sudden the clock struck . 623615_624865
and she ran out_of the ball . 625750_626930
and as she ran down the steps she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers . 627033_631393
and the prince found it . 632641_634061
and that was all that was left of Cinderella . 634246_636266
so ‡ the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him . 636289_642919
and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this &+gl fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella . 642935_651695
so ‡ the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away . 652365_657005
and they tried on the [/] the glass slipper . 657829_660409
but it didn't fit either of them . 660459_661829
and the mice snuck the key under the door to Cinderella . 662521_667021
and she was able to get out just in time &-um so_that she could try on the glass slipper . 667646_673476
and sure enough it fit . 673553_674553
and the prince's &-um servants brought her back to the castle . 675732_679792
and she and the prince lived happily ever after . 679845_682055
you're welcome . [+ exc] 684543_687883
