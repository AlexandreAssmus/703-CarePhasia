"yeah, well the big one is my cancer, &-uh Hodgkin's disease . 22394_26884"
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven . [+ gram] 27636_32286
"I had symptoms before then, but didn't connect the dots . 33511_38421"
I had night sweats . 39217_40227
I was tired and &+yuh just didn't think much of it . 40345_45285
but then I noticed that I was losing weight . 46244_48944
and that's what caused me to seek a doctor . 49665_53705
so ‡ I went to +//. 54115_55185
I hadn't been to a doctor in years . 55485_56895
&-uh so ‡ I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses . 57803_62093
she's now both [//] &-uh our physician for both of us . [+ gram] 62955_66465
"she did &+uk an office exam and &-uh was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something &-uh the lymph nodes, turned out . 68016_81486"
so ‡ I went for a sonogram . 82669_84039
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan . 85230_92100
that led to the need for a biopsy . 93951_96961
"so ‡ &+b <at that> [//] by then, it was becoming clear that there was something wrong . 97253_101203"
&-uh the decision was gonna be is it +//. 102385_105395
it [/] it was lymphoma . 106000_107380
but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non_Hodgkin's lymphoma . 108269_113039
"so ‡ I went to Mountainside hospital &+ih in Montclair for a needle biopsy, but <that wasn't enough> [//] &-uh &+th not enough tissue was obtained . 113144_121284"
so ‡ I hadta go <into the city> [//] into New_York to Sloan for &-uh a more complete biopsy . 121300_129009
and that clinched it . 129967_130808
"&-uh it was Hodgkin's lymphoma, which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two . 131256_138056"
"&-uh Hodgkins's is much more treatable, at a higher success rate . 138664_142024"
so ‡ I started chemo . 143899_145149
"and &-uh after the first session, I developed a rash . 146336_153306"
and we &+d weren't quite sure what was going on . 154990_158440
one of the nurses +//. 158494_159514
the [/] the oncologist wasn't sure . 159535_161195
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment &+wuh <for the> [/] for the Hodgkin's . 162134_166594
"but one of his nurses said +""/. 167291_168411"
"+"" this is an allergic reaction . 168530_170130"
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol . 171430_175510
I think I mentioned this last time . 175802_176912
&-um which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney . [+ gram] 177581_182601
it's actually a drug for gout . 183103_184723
but it has a protective effect &-uh for kidney (.) function . 185516_189596
that landed me in the hospital with [/] with what's called Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is treated like a burn . 191062_198792
it [//] &+ips people with Stevens_Johnson are often sent to burn units . 198838_202308
my mouth was inflamed . 203430_204830
I [/] I [//] it was just awful . 204898_206028
I couldn't drink water . 206075_206935
it [/] &+j it burned . 207019_208059
that of_course suspended chemo . 209599_211889
I [//] &+w we &+w worked through the &=laughs Stevens_Johnson . 213636_216236
I was looking forward to chemo . 216792_218102
<it was> [//] it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation . 218194_222744
&-uh so [//] &-um and I ended up having really a mild case &+ih &+ih from what I can gather . 223829_230759
"but still I [/] I couldn't take solid food for [/] for &+t &-uh two weeks or so, nor water . 230778_237498"
<it was> [/] <it was> [//] the only thing that really worked was [/] was &-um &-uh iced tea . 237846_243206
"&-um so ‡ I got through the Stevens_Johnson, went back to chemo and had chemo for several months . 245220_256579"
it ended (.) last May . 256634_259084
"&-um had my Pet scan at that time, which was clear . [+ gram] 260293_265093"
oncologist waited another six months . [+ gram] 266841_268921
had another Pet scan . [+ gram] 269331_270311
that was clear . 270599_271439
&-uh and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed . 272749_279539
I don't know if you know about ports . 279594_281064
"&-uh so ‡ <that sorta> [/] that sorta clinched the [/] &-uh the idea that I'm you_know, home free . 281918_287708"
you_know ‡ I hafta be monitored every six months . 288135_290585
&-um and chemo &+ih wasn't [//] it wasn't all that bad . 291269_295019
"I_mean ‡ Firstname got me through it, if [//] as I said last week . 295043_297383"
I &+ub broke down . 297405_299405
&-um she was just super &-uh in getting me through all of this . 299904_303934
and the chemo wasn't bad . 305016_306976
I [/] I really wasn't nauseous . 307000_308610
&-um my appetite started to come back . 308904_311844
in_fact ‡ we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo . 311868_314558
we'd send out for lunch . 315502_316602
&-um so ‡ the [//] <it was> [/] &+t it was tired [
I'd [//] I would get tired . 320857_321697
&-um but I had chemo every two weeks . 322698_324768
and &-uh my hair came back . 325431_327781
and (.) that's where I am now . 328838_331618
&-uh not all that much . 343297_345107
&-um &=clears
<I'm a> [/] I'm a very bad &-uh eater when it comes to nutrition . 353611_357201
&-uh fish . 357738_358728
&-um but it [/] it [/] it wasn't all that much &+t to do . 359497_364917
the [/] the chemo was the [/] the primary source of [/] of treatment of_course . 364941_371151
&-uh the oncologist &-um was very responsive . 371822_376702
and he [//] you_know he [/] he gave &-uh me anti-nausea medication . 376721_381231
but <I didn't> [//] I took it once during the whole treatment time . 381251_383891
"and [/] and even then, it wasn't because I was starting to [/] to vomit . 384411_388211"
I just felt a bit queasy . 388235_389455
&-um a_lot_of rest . [+ gram] 390447_393317
I slept a_lot &-um and had tender loving care from Firstname . 393363_398273
"so ‡ &-um &+ih &+ip it [//] I didn't do a_lot different, you_know . 398338_403728"
&-um (.) so ‡ I [/] I really can't go beyond that . 403750_409380
it was the chemotherapy and the rest . 409537_412767
&-uh you_know ‡ &-um that was pretty much it . 413922_416162
well ‡ I guess one of the most important things +//. 441281_445851
"<I think> [/] I think last week I mentioned my son's birth, so I [/] I won't go through that again . 446024_449094"
&-um another milestone was [/] was getting a job at Montclair_State . 449687_453597
&-uh I [/] <I had> [//] &-uh &+d I was a speech clinician &-um doing work <as a> [/] as a [/] &+s a speech language pathologist . 454807_465457
but I missed &-um interacting with students . 466279_471889
&-uh <I had> [//] and [/] and [/] and I [/] I had some experience in doing that because I [//] my undergraduate degree was in history . 472786_478966
and I actually did student teach &-uh at a high school &-uh &+ih &+ih in history and had planned to do that . 480198_488718
"&-uh but then things [/] things sort_of changed, obviously . 489229_491989"
&-um but I [/] &+d I [/] I missed that kind of interaction . 492654_495824
I worked mostly with children &-uh when I was a speech clinician . 495845_499475
and &-uh &+mur Firstname was teaching English at the high_school level . 500862_507612
and she would come &+b back home with stories about you_know working with students and discussions they had in class . 507627_514467
and I was sorta jealous &-um of that . 514520_519030
"and so when I was invited to [/] &-um to become an instructor here, I jumped at the chance . 520143_529633"
that [/] that changed everything . 529828_532028
&-um &=click and I was warned that [//] from [/] from &+ih friends [//] &+ug &-uh &-uh colleagues that I was taking a big &+d risk in [/] in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure . 532695_547855
that <they were> [//] &+guh I was gonna be taken advantage of . 548761_550721

"&-um &-uh but that <I would> [//] you_know I [/] &+w I would work for x@l number of years and when it came time for tenure, I wouldn't get tenure . 553563_561843"
&-um but I wanted to be in the classroom so much . 562002_564782
&-um and it was more that than doing research actually . 565563_568393
it was actually teaching that drew me to it . 568445_572045
"&-uh that I said +""/. 573757_575057"

"+"" &+et you_know ‡ I'm gonna do it . 576131_576881"
and so I [/] I did . 577063_578583
and it [/] it changed everything . 578711_580651
"and that was a very, very positive &-uh event you_know . 581174_586444"
and I spent forty five years after that &=laughs being here . 587708_592208

&-um and that's where it ends . 645828_647718
"so ‡ we don't know if he's gonna run after the kid, if the kid is his own child, or what . 647735_653805"

&-uh &+z &+s she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and &-uh hasta &+at &+at attend to their needs and the needs of the household . 858635_866645
