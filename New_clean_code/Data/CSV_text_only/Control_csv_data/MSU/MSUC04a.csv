yes <I had in> [//] &-um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor . 25359_36499
and he told me that if [//] as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen . 36970_40480
and two days later it ruptured . 40634_43394
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm . 43800_46260
and &-uh fortunately <it was> [//] &+y he needed do surgery . 46768_50928
but after that I was (.) fine . 51311_53031
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain I've ever experienced . 53472_57172
so ‡ that's the &+f first thing that came to mind . 57947_59917
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically . 67341_69671
and it could not be . 69690_70380
so ‡ it was full blown surgery . 70802_72942
and <I remember being> [//] &-um I was &+m obviously much younger . 73391_76491
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience . 76510_83720
and I hadta go very slowly . 83736_85106
and I was out_of work for a long time which is what I remember the most . 85541_88271
and then little by little I just got my strength back until &=ges
I had the [/] the privilege of working &-um with a hippotherapy &-um organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who &-uh worked with children with multiple sclerosis and [/] &-uh and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally . 106520_123790
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying . 124223_130293
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would [/] would elicit your sympathy . 130616_138127
and you just sort_of hadta tell them to you_know to &+b to buck up and do it . 138149_141649
&-um but <it was very> [//] it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that . 142093_145953
and now of_course here I'm doing that in [/] in [/] &-um in a much broader spectrum . 146015_150875
there are several . 178862_179842
&-um let me think what would be a good story . 180104_183484
well ‡ very recently &-um two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country . 185135_196205
and since we didn't have complete leisure time we &+div divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every <major league> [/] &+coun &-uh major league stadium in the country . 196940_211230
and in two thousand twelve we completed that . 211297_214037
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in [/] in thirty (.) cities . 214459_219859
yeah ‡ and it was absolutely wonderful . 220710_221990
and then of_course they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami . 222043_224623
so ‡ on Memorial_day weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there . 225137_230327
and &-um in August we'll be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there . 230870_236860
so ‡ when we hear if you build it they will come we think it's meant for us and that we're going to go see baseball games . 237309_243689
"&-um and even_though I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally, these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had . 244126_254596"
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that we'd never seen or never would have seen . 254647_260447
and it was just the [/] the [/] the best six years the best time <I can> [/] I can recall . 260812_265772
and we love to talk about it . 265985_267835
yep . 269342_269452
okay ‡ &-um there's a young boy kicking a soccer ball . 319806_322986
&-um he doesn't know his own strength so he kicks it &+har very far and very hard . 323583_328283
and it breaks the window . 328777_329707
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball . 330237_334377
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked +//. 334756_341236
oh that's the ball . 341378_341708
I'm sorry . [+ exc] 341987_342287
he's holding the ball . 342304_342944
and he's looking out the window to see who kicked the ball . 343365_345635
okay ‡ &-um a little boy is leaving for school . 364142_367452
"and his mother obviously thinks it's going to rain or knows it's going to rain, offers him the umbrella . 367855_372615"
"and he says +""/. 372634_373014"
"+"" no mom, I don't need it . 373519_374409"
"+"" see ya . 374607_374927"
"+"" I'm leaving without the umbrella . 375097_376277"
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder . 376823_380613
and he gets really really wet . 381268_382998
so ‡ he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry . 383378_388478
and he's [/] he's happier at the end . 388951_390691
okay ‡ the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree . 410590_413910
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree . 414674_417844
&-uh a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat . 418533_423043
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure . 423762_427842
and now the man is stuck in the tree as_well . 427858_429808
and the [/] &+defi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat out_of the tree . 430223_435723
okay ‡ &-um Cinderella is a story about a little girl &-uh who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled . 514773_524853
and she is not treated as an equal . 525448_527518
she is treated as a real stepchild . 527648_529258
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders out_of the fire . 529277_532617
and she grows up in that role where her [/] &+s her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not . 533190_538980
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry . 539703_545833
and the invitation comes . 546309_547249
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball . 547268_551118
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball . 551958_554578
and Cinderella thinks she won't go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures &-um makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball . 554708_565258
noone knows who she is . 565275_566465
and part of that is the glass slippers . 567061_569171
she has her glass slippers . 569507_570347
and she gets into the pumpkin that's turned into the carriage . 570516_572786
she rides to the ball . 573403_574203
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight . 574220_578610
so ‡ she goes to the ball . 579317_580417
and she has a wonderful time . 580434_581764
and the clock strikes twelve . 581990_583660
and she's running out_of the ballroom . 583683_585333
and she loses a glass slipper . 585881_587151
"and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry, he's going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his [/] his true love . 588034_598074"
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live . 598474_602344
and the two [/] &+stepsis two stepsisters try on the slipper . 602367_605607
and of_course it does not fit . 607567_608817
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him . 609367_613287
but the slipper does not break . 613338_614838
she tries on the slipper . 615492_616382
it fits . 616404_616964
and they live happily ever after . 617273_618633
and that's about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella . [+ exc] 619667_623157
I would take a knife . 650194_651284
&-um I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly . 652127_655347
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first . 655775_660645
and then I would spread the jelly . 661334_663304
and then I would fold the bread in half . 663550_665670
