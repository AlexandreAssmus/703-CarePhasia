okay . 18500_18700
&-um I remember &-uh hurting my back about five or six years ago . 36835_43845
and I really didn't do anything to hurt my back . 44302_47462
I just kind_of moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back . 47480_50500
and it was weeks of &-uh going to the doctor going [//] finally just having physical therapy to [/] to fix it . 50573_57973
but it all worked out . 58262_59262
yeah . 60413_60563
it was a_lot_of exercises . 65995_67135
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield . 67223_70003
and &-um they had me lift weights and do &-uh different exercises stretching [//] mostly stretching my back . 70131_78181
and they used some kind of electronic &-uh &-like (.) stimulation therapy . 78689_83989
and that really helped . 84385_85225
it was the big part . 86022_86712
yeah . 88087_88187
&-uh (.) not really . 100981_103601
I_mean a little bit here and there . 103618_104868
you_know ‡ I've know people who have had strokes and +... 104921_107121
&-uh I think a_lot_of it was sort_of just waiting them out . 115454_119094
sometimes they just couldn't get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign [//] &-uh sort_of a sign language where they kind_of point to what they're looking for or what they need . 119145_129205
&-uh that was mostly +/. 129800_130640
"+, kinda what did it . 131770_132200"
I guess I'll tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace . 163237_165707
&-um it was a long (.) haul . 166277_169337
it was a_lot [//] you_know a_lot_of discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it . 169506_174246
and we [//] probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents . 174296_179306
and &-uh &+w at one point I would be kind_of more wanting to do it . 179446_185756
and Eileen would be busy . 185883_187423
her parents were ill . 187446_188346
and we were trying to take care of them . 188365_189945
and then it would swap . 190320_191090
I was busy at work . 191187_192097
and she was more interested in talking about it . 192202_194342
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind_of we were on the same page at the same time . 194655_200405
and &-um we made this decision &+kin to [/] to [//] that we should look [//] possibly look at foster care . 200857_208107
and we looked into it closely . 208127_209527
and it just wasn't going to work right for us . 209545_212315
and then we decided to [/] to adopt . 212365_214085
and &-um we (.) identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family . 214623_220613
and we &-um looked into all of her medical records and things . 221067_225587
and &-um then we traveled to China . 225983_228473
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that . 228579_233699
and <then we> [/] &+mov then we went to China . 234276_236086
and actually the adoption occurred there in China . 236137_238977
&-uh and we have an older daughter who came with us also . 239475_242125
&-uh so ‡ we're <all part of> [//] all became one big family all at once . 242860_246390
thanks . 248392_248782
well ‡ there was a little boy who was playing [//] practicing his soccer kicks . 276494_279934
and &-uh looks like he kicked the ball a_little too hard &-uh right through the (.) living room window &-uh where his father was sitting there watching tv and keeping an eye on the baby . 280189_294739
"and &-uh his father hadta gather up the ball and look out the window at him and [/] and say you_know +""/. 295356_300856"
"+"" what are you doing kicking the ball &+re right near the window ? 301043_303793"
okay . [+ exc] 336146_336486
a little boy was on his way to school . 336852_339232
he's getting ready to go to school . 339495_340765
and his mother &-uh offered him the umbrella to take with him in case it rained on the way to school . 341172_347552
"and he said +""/. 347917_348417"
"+"" no ‡ thank_you ‡ I'm fine . 348600_350020"
and he walked out . 350367_351307
and on his way to school it started raining really hard . 351481_354221
and he hadta turn around and run home . 354669_356199
and &-uh get [//] you_know when he got home his mother wasn't happy that he did not take the umbrella from the beginning . 356523_363433
&-uh and he [/] &-uh he took the umbrella . 363874_366284
and off he went again to school . 366299_368019
(...) it looks like there [//] a little girl's cat &-uh climbed up the tree . 393440_397140
the girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard . 397743_399523
and the cat ran up the tree . 399543_401693
and she went in to get her father to help her . 402112_405432
and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air [
and &-uh the [//] while [//] once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too . 412769_418079
so ‡ they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree . 418399_423909
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out_of the tree . 424604_428994
okay ‡ &-um there was a little girl named Cinderella . 541914_545604
and her mother died . 545626_547126
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own . 547443_551913
and the new mother the stepmother didn't really care for Cinderella that much . 552757_557967
she was more concerned about her two daughters . 558029_559889
and then as they grew up the [/] the [//] she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her . 560580_569110
and &-uh one day there was a [//] an invitation to a [/] &-uh a big ball to meet the prince (be)cause the prince was looking for a wife . 569666_581556
and &-uh his father was having a big party [//] a big ball to [//] so he could meet all the eligible women <in the> [/] in the (.) kingdom . 582183_589413
so ‡ she wanted to go to the [/] the ball . 590021_592071
but she was too busy . 592125_593205
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for (.) everybody else &-uh because they all hadta have their clothes made [//] cleaned and ready to go . 593225_603045
so ‡ she [//] in [//] she started to get everybody's [//] everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball . 603373_609403
and in the meantime her friends the [/] the [/] &+mi the mice put [//] sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball . [+ gram] 609687_619347
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go . 619398_622958
&-uh but the sisters found out . 623413_624863
and they tore up her dress . 624882_626302
and <she was> [//] &-uh she thought she'd never get to the ball . 626472_629952
&-uh and then she met her [/] &+s her fairy godmother . 630688_632838
she went out in the yard and was crying . 633090_634620
and the fairy godmother came . 634636_635776
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the [/] the mice into horseses [
but told her that she needed to <be home by> [//] &+mid leave by twelve o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point . 647857_654817
so ‡ she went off to the ball . 655371_656481
and she met the prince . 656502_657522
and they fell in love . 657601_658551
and all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight . 658989_663329
so ‡ she &-uh hadta run out . 663683_666683
and she ran down the steps of the [/] the castle . 666793_669663
and left the prince . 669744_670714
and she lost her shoe on the way . 670907_672877
so ‡ the prince thought he would never see his [//] this girl again . 673394_677954
and so the next day the father <and the> [//] and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on . 678382_689112
and that was Cinderella . 689288_690368
so ‡ then she married the prince and lived happily ever after . 691065_693405
I would take the bread . 712989_714139
and I would <spread the peanut butter> [//] open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread . 714258_719758
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 719774_723274
and then put another piece of bread on top of it . 723865_725785
