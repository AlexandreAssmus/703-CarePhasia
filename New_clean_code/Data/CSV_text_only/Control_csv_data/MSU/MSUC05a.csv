okay ‡ &-um I had fallen at one point . 32785_36405
and I fractured my right wrist . 36420_39200
and I remember that . 39898_41658
well ‡ it was &-um how many years ago ? 47361_49771
it was probably in nineteen ninety &+th two or three . 49859_55859
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream . 56395_59195
and I was looking at the sign . 59715_60835
and then I tripped and fell . 60850_62040
and I was holding my keys in my right hand . 62717_64827
<and so I've> [//] but I got a little fracture . 64849_67410
and I hadta go to the emergency room . 67428_68748
&-hm well I was casted for quite a while . 76018_77878
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge <I think> [//] was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own (.) recovery . 78253_86133
&-um but it wasn't really a bad thing all in all . 86654_88964
I had the cast on for awhile . 89016_90016
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist . 90037_93967
yes ‡ I do . 103263_103833
I have a very dear friend [//] cousin who is [//] &-um has aphasia . 103850_107450
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and she's now seventy one . 107465_110355
and I visit her regularly . 111125_112455
and we communicate in a very interesting way . 112472_115402
well ‡ I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to . 119949_123599
and I don't give her many choices . 123651_125731
and we do a_lot_of hand motions . 125908_127968
and she has a way of communicating . 128108_130098
she's pretty amazing . 130226_131296
&-um she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats a_lot . 131916_137976
she [/] she likes to say she wants to go home (.) indicating her frustration with her situation . 138181_143351
but I can see when I speak with her that she's very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts . 143789_148509
she has the thoughts she [//] if she could only put the words together . 148616_151726
and it is very very frustrating for her . 152340_154000
but I think that she's kind_of come to terms with where she's at . 154021_157511
it's hard . 158329_158799
wow (.) well the first thing that came into my mind because I'll [/] I'll take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place . 192985_204805
and <the most> [//] so it's a trauma event where my grandfather passed away . 205087_209337
and he was not sick . 209889_210989
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was &-um at work . 211005_216255
so ‡ he went off on a normal day . 216689_217959
and I remember playing you_know with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital . 217981_227571
and a friend of mine and I made [//] put some cookies together and [//] for when he was going to come home <because we didn't entertain the thought of this person> [//] because it was my first experience with the death . 228296_238676
so ‡ it's kind_of a sad story . 238736_240086
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life &-um in the sense of the &+pro cycle of birth and death and whatnot . 240107_248007
so ‡ it turned out he passed away that night . 248888_250458
and I never did see him again . 250474_252084
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship . 252308_257887
and &-uh so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life . 258425_263675
and then looking back on it as an adult now &-um realizing that this man was really an angel of mine . 263746_270796
I didn't realize it then but I came to believe +//. 271195_273235
and I don't know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there . 273252_283562
came to learn about that . [+ gram] 284171_285271
and it just served as a [/] a real learning in my life in many different ways . 285891_289321
okay ‡ well ‡ this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went out_of the way and broke the window . 344552_351482
not his intention but it was an accident . 351531_353271
and lo_and_behold his dad was sitting in the living room . 353413_356173
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad . 356195_360435
and &-um the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didn't see the boy because the boy ran away in fear . 361172_368312
&-um this is the story about a [/] &-uh a little boy who was on his way to school . 392200_396070
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella . 396087_402467
but he didn't wanna take the umbrella because he didn't wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain . 402488_407248
so ‡ he went on his way . 407300_408340
he got caught in the rain . 408974_409714
it started to rain very hard . 409734_410994
he got very wet . 411018_411688
and he came home . 411704_412614
and he got the umbrella . 412679_414169
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom . 414477_418677
+< that's right . [+ exc] 422611_422911
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson . [+ exc] 423125_426405
(.) okay ‡ well ‡ (..) little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park (.) with her dad . 445019_454049
and as they were going along they noticed that &-uh a cat was running along the field . 454380_460590
and a dog was chasing it . 460640_461650
and don't you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree . 461674_465034
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so . 465049_468269
she encouraged her dad to &-uh get the ladder (be)cause they lived right across the street . 469164_472624
and &-uh the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree . 473117_475477
but then he got stuck in the tree . 475496_477156
and &-uh looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down . 478825_483775
so ‡ I'm sure someone had a cell phone in this picture even_though it's not shown . 483960_487830
so ‡ the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat . 488738_490828
and they all lived happily ever after . 490844_492604
&-hm okay once upon a time there was a young girl . 589515_596705
and she hadta go live with &-um her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldn't take care of her anymore . 598906_605086
so ‡ he brought her to this house where these &-uh stepsisters and stepmother lived . 605231_610881
and they took the [/] the girl in . 610932_612942
and &-um turned out they really &-um didn't treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted . 613738_622608
and she was sort_of like their maid . 622623_624483
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent a_lot_of time among the cinders by the fireplace . 624501_629501
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball . 630750_634970
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball . 635587_639567
so ‡ when they got the announcement &-uh Cinderella knew about it . 640705_645225
but of_course the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball . 645244_648814
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball . 648830_651330
so ‡ the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things . 652789_657229
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house . 657307_663697
and then they saw how sad she was . 663716_665526
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such . 665652_670422
but &-um Cinderella [//] I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball . 670528_675788
so ‡ as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go . 675836_679716
and they had beautiful dresses . 679733_680893
and she hadta help mend them . 680941_682521
and &-um let's see what happened &-um &=clears
&-um she [//] I think she went out in the garden . 691548_694638
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad . 694661_696891
and she was crying . 696914_697674
and she really wanted to go to the ball . 697691_699121
"and her fairy godmother had said you_know +""/. 699212_701422"
"+"" you may go to the ball just &-um (.) change . 702252_705632"
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress . 705653_708023
"and she said +""/. 708076_708836"
"+"" fetch me a pumpkin . 709065_709845"
and then turned it in to a coach . [+ gram] 709867_711057
and shen [
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin . 712924_715834
and so she was able to go off to this ball . 716547_719127
and when she got there the ball was in full swing . 719144_721994
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the [/] the prince . 722018_725618
"and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious, they really weren't gracious people . 726221_730601"
and one had a tic and a &+n creaky knee . 730623_733023
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just +... 733045_735225
things that they just didn't know how to &-uh interface <with the king in a proper way or> [//] the prince in a proper way . 735722_740432
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her . 741194_743674
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince . 743724_747124
and there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love . 747172_750432
and &-um they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting . 751084_754844
and suddenly <the struck [
and &-um she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight . 758636_765626
and &-uh with that she ran away . 766586_768296
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind . 768314_771334
she made her way home . 771969_772999
she was a_little sad because <I guess> [//] she thought she'd never see this prince again . 773077_776197
and then the prince &+s found the slipper . 777050_779800
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper . 779820_782920
so ‡ he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on . 783040_790140
and then they did come to the home <of the> [//] &-um where Cinderella lived . 790157_794027
then they [//] the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot . 794045_797415
wasn't going to fit . [+ gram] 798105_798905
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe . 799065_804235
and it fits . 805109_805919
and they get married and live happily ever after . 806201_808911
that was not the best version of the story that I've ever heard . [+ exc] 809630_813450
well ‡ if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would &-um open up the freezer and get some gluten-free bread out_of there . 837339_845509
and I would &-um put a paper towel on the counter . 846346_848566
and I'd put the slices of bread on the paper towel . 848589_850969
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly . 851735_855175
put them on the counter . 855396_856256
and I would retrieve from the drawer a (.) implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly . 857079_863579
and I would then open up the peanut butter . 864321_865821
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread . 865837_870467
and then I would close the jar . 870788_871948
and then I would open the jelly jar . 872527_873707
and I would take a nice heaping . [+ gram] 873722_875282
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around . 875300_878700
and then I would &-um put the top on the bread . 879533_882413
I'd close up the jelly and put the knife &-uh and the spoon in the sink . 882430_887560
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater . 888075_890435
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate . 891083_894063
and I probably wouldn't cut it . 894350_895360
and I would go sit down . 895649_896479
and I would enjoy (.) a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich . 896494_899284
