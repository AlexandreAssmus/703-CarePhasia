(..) <the [/] &=sighs the most> [/] the most memorable event was +... 25361_31381
it [//] but I think I did tell you about it . 32211_33771
the [/] the yeah . [+ gram] 34846_35507
it was about the [/] the possible scare . 35663_37783
it was just a lump in [/] in my breast . 37800_40070
and that [//] &+w I'm [/] I'm pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of [/] of our son to think about . 40731_49011
and I didn't think because of my age or the [/] the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything &-um more than precaution to do the [/] &-um the procedure . 49152_58522
&=click but as close as I came was &-uh you_know the [/] the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and [/] &+g and caring . 59900_66680
and I [/] I felt supported <the whole> [/] the whole time . 66695_69265
just that &-um I [/] I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasn't sure whether the breast was gone or not because <the bandage was so> [//] &-um the &-uh dressings and bandage were so tight . 69782_79922
but I just remember thinking &-um <the [/] &+s the they'll be> [//] I'll do whatever I hafta do on it . 80451_85751
and whatever's next I'll find out about and take care of . 85769_88649
so ‡ it's a moving progression . 88700_90350
I don't usually write the end of a story &-um if it's something like that . 90373_94453
"if you tell me I'll say +""/. 94500_95050"
"+"" oh ‡ we'll go through it step by step . 95250_96580"
"+"" and we'll get there . 96690_97850"
it was like that . 98184_98834
so ‡ I'm fortunate that it hasn't been anything worse than that . 99088_102868
just [//] &+f I can only remember being busy because with [/] &-uh with &-uh a toddler +... 109848_114528
he was a year old then . 114600_115550
and [/] &-uh and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another . [+ gram] 115595_121595
it was nothing short of &=click &-uh show up for a doctor's appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done . 121616_128726
so ‡ I didn't think about +... 128870_129759
&-uh <I knew I had> [//] it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright . 130442_133782
so ‡ it wasn't much to do except you_know just take care of [/] of the healing part &-uh and cooperate . 133833_140183
but &-uh I was sure everything was going to be alright . 140290_143810
something important +... 163720_164750
<well I think> [//] (...) I think oddly enough &-uh &+fi of [/] of meeting and [/] and continuing a [/] a life with Joe . 170352_186052
it was &-um I'm sure the most important &+th thing that ever happened . 186100_191130
&-um the most memorable day was the day our son was born . 191603_195433
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how [/] how interesting that all was . 195450_199470
we were students at Montclair_State . 199530_201880
and in those days (.) freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and [//] in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus . 202600_214630
we hadta sing the [/] the alma_mater . 214700_216980
but &+w the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at [/] &+s at Life_Hall . 217000_222000
and he noticed the sign and said something about +//. 223188_225698
I think <I had> [//] part of it was covered . 225746_226976
"and he said +""/. 226999_227449"
"+"" are you a [/] a speech major ? 227609_229349"
"I said +""/. 229400_229530"
"+"" no English . 229710_230760"
and I [/] I &+un unveiled the [/] the words English . [+ gram] 231940_234840
but he was a senior . 235158_236128
and I was a freshman . 236357_237127
and so I got to meet one of the [//] you_know the upperclassmen got his signature . 237148_240808
and then later &-um <we just had> [//] it was an easy conversation . 241306_244946
<we just> [//] we talked a_little . 245000_246280
he [/] &=laughs he continued &-um <when I> [//] whenever I saw him to say hi . 247021_250621
"and I [//] &-uh people would tell me +""/. 251000_252150"
"+"" he's a BMOC . 252269_253009"
you_know ‡ <he's a> [//] he was a [/] a vice president of student government . 253300_257050
"and I said +""/. 257072_258002"
"+"" oh_my_goodness . 258221_258982"
but the more we hadta talk about +//. 259000_259810
I was a student leader in my high school . 259833_261663
and I thought <when he> [//] when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee &=laughs . 262500_266560
but it turned out that <he we> [//] he was interested . 267108_269818
so ‡ our first date <I think> [//] was the +... 269873_271863
it was something like the Kingston_Trio or something like that . 272727_275547
some folk group . [+ gram] 275637_276427
it was really nice . 276500_277100
they were on campus &=laughs . 277150_277990
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come &=clears
that was one of his duties . 282779_284009
but when I just &+s think of how all that unfolded just &-uh +... 284470_287220
I knew I [/] I was gonna finish school . 287530_289260
and so we [/] we paced ourselves <I guess> [//] you_know to [/] to be logical about things . 289280_294150
get to know each other no surprises &-uh along the way . [+ gram] 294200_297870
because you have time with a person and you [/] you see them in all the seasons and all . 298148_302148
but I think when it finally came to [/] to getting married &-um I don't think there was a formal &-uh +... 302200_307780
<we [/] we> [//] people ask us but this was &+f not even a formal proposal . 307869_310979
I think everyone around us assumed we would &+m marry . 311062_313512
&=click so ‡ we did . 313899_314469
&=laughs and so I [/] I wasn't engaged . 315573_317163
you_know ‡ <I &+w we> [//] I was pinned . 317336_318666
"and someone said to me the next day +""/. 319626_321386"
"+"" you_know you're [/] you're engaged to be engaged . 321570_323760"

"+"" no ‡ I'm not . 324734_324954"
"and they said +""/. 325000_325360"
"+"" well ‡ that's what that means . 325730_326570"
"and I said +""/. 326676_327186"
"+"" oh ‡ I thought it meant sort_of going steady college style . 327951_330511"
"they said +""/. 330908_331178"

"+"" well ‡ we have some time to go before +//. 333070_335420"
"I said +""/."
"+"" it means what it means to the individual couple too . 335690_338300"
so ‡ I tried to assert myself . 338796_340066
but I guess they might have been right . 340128_342238
but <I don't> [/] I don't care . 342287_343517
it didn't mean anything . 343700_344120
but <that it> [//] when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross I_mean that's [/] that's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married . [+ gram] 344700_354370
and all that happened at once . 355126_356146
it all converged . 356193_357093
it's alright that we've done this before ? 388000_389640
okay &=laughs same story . [+ exc] 390086_392176
now &-um &-uh was it little Ned ? 392200_394550
no ‡ this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself . [+ gram] 394600_399500
and the trajectory is off . 399600_401340
it goes right through a window . 401399_403039
and we hear the crash . 404229_405249
and &-um the lamp has gone over . 406040_409120
and [/] and I'm assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody who's startled that this &-uh intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture . [+ gram] 409139_421649
"and he says +""/. 422454_422654"
"+"" I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard . 423304_425784"
okay &=laughs . 426580_427310
it's still raining . 447174_448244
okay ‡ in the first picture it's about to rain . 448972_451982
"mom is telling little sweetie +""/. 452000_454490"
"+"" take your umbrella with you because I think it's going to rain today . 455100_458110"

"+"" no no no no no I don't need it I'm a big kid . 462050_464220"

"he says +""/. 469400_469500"
"+"" so_long . 470182_470382"
see you later . 470400_471030
but as he steps out the door wouldn't you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall . 471475_476115
"and as he's (.) getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says +""/. 477128_480698"

"+"" I told you . 490096_490576"
and he's looking a bit sheepish little Sammy . 490600_493310
but he's out in [/] in the last frame &=clears
but he's still going in the opposite direction here . 502900_504930
okay . 505271_505531
we're in a time warp you_know ? [+ exc] 521139_522479
you guys have not moved forward from last [/] last week &=laughs . [+ exc] 522500_525720
okay . [+ exc] 527197_527817
groundhog day &=clears
no ‡ this is cat up in a tree day . [+ exc] 529500_531270
&=click oh_my_goodness my_goodness . [+ exc] 533347_535247
&-uh this is little sweet Sue . 535300_537520
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree . 537600_540460
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb . 541456_550186
the ladder that he must have taken to [/] to get to [/] &-um to the cat has fallen . 551000_555970
so ‡ he's stranded . 556090_557310
"and little Fido is barking and saying +""/. 557871_560161"
"+"" what the heck are you doing up there ? 560347_562227"

and so they're rushing along with the ladder . 570420_572510
they will rescue him shortly . 573060_574630
and &-uh I think they'll get dad down before they get the cat down . 574794_579204
I think that's the priority . 580597_581867
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world . 582289_587849
it's all going to work out just fine . 587867_589617
alright ‡ I think last time it was a combination as_well . [+ exc] 740000_742870
what [//] &-uh once upon a time <there was a [/] a family &-uh where the> [//] &+f there was a widow [
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to &-uh a woman he had met . 757982_764362
but the woman had two daughters of her own . 764502_767082
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after &-uh the woman and her daughter the [//] became the stepmother and the stepsisters and &+a joined the [/] &+f the &-um household of Cinderella and her dad . 767302_780532
I'm assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again . 781703_785983
and she must deal with <the family> [//] her new family . 785999_789609
and they're not very kind . 789724_791294
there's [//] &-uh they're &-um mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother . 791313_796253
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of (.) Cinderella at every option [
and so she did the &+serv &-uh chores and she was treated badly . 803775_807915
&-um simultaneously there is another father <and a &+s and a> [//] &+sib and a offspring a prince this time . 808982_818402
and the father is a king . 819000_820810
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son . 821000_823640
and I assume that it's time for him to be married . 823660_827480
and so <the prince> [//] &-uh a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful (.) maidens who are available . 827857_837387
an invitation goes out <to Cinderella's (.) stepmother> [//] to the household . 839019_845169
and everyone is smiling . 845710_847180
and Cinderella <I guess> [//] assumes that she might be able to go . 847230_850780
but this is not going to happen . 850800_852320
&-um this [//] the [/] the book +... 852873_857083
and I don't know what's going on with that little book yet . 857201_859371
but she I [//] maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house . 859942_865972
the little animals or [//] &-uh begin to help out . 865995_869585
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as [/] &+sh as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready . 869600_879480
and Cinderella &-uh now knows that with the help of her &+f godmother she will get to go . 879500_885680
there is a little admonition from [//] after she's dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably . 886479_896979
"+"" be sure you're home by midnight . 897325_899455"
and then it switches <to the> [/] &+ba to the ball . 900713_903253
<and I> [//] and the prince sees and falls in love with &-um at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty . 903300_912800
when he could see all that . [+ gram] 913377_914957
so ‡ they dance and dance . 915736_916756
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase . 917047_926407
"I guess the <the [/] the right hand man> [//] <the [/] the first secretary> [//] first VP of the king is running after her to say +""/. 927390_934230"
"+"" &+w wait a second . 934570_935030"
"+"" wait a second . 935130_935680"
but she runs back <to the> [//] to [/] to home . 935985_938945
and &-uh then comes the search for who matches the slipper . 939631_943461
and it's <he in your little booklet> [//] the &-uh first vice president then who comes to the door . 944172_948952
and there's a funny little picture of somebody tripping &=laughs and a cushion . 949530_953530
but I don't remember any of that from my stories or my film memory . [+ exc] 953900_957760
<but &-uh apparently there &-uh the key> [//] there was a key there that still doesn't mean anything much to me . 958411_964561
they must have let him in . 964581_965891
&-um the [/] the match &+m is made when she tries on the slipper . 966537_971657
and so I [/] I suppose the [/] the fella [
"+"" xxx we've got our girl . 977140_977930"
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot . 978290_981380
and I don't know why I thought it was &+th direct . [+ exc] 981441_983671
but he could afford to hire help to do that so [/] so the help took care of it . 983960_988940
anyway &-um &-uh it's a happy ending . 989425_992235
they [/] &-uh they get back together again . 992256_994326
and I'm sure it's &-um the prince and his sweet Cinderella and &+hap life is &+f happy from then on happily ever after . 994348_1002288
+< oh_my_goodness ! [+ exc] 1022248_1022478
did you try it with the little wall ? [+ exc] 1022497_1024517

we can do it either way . [+ exc] 1029050_1030290
we'll do a half one this time . [+ exc] 1030771_1032611
we'll use the [//] just the one piece of bread but we're going to make it the same way . [+ exc] 1033117_1035948
we're gonna lay all the ingredients out first because I'm anal-retentive . 1036000_1038640
we get everything out . 1039425_1040555
the knife [//] butter knife . [+ gram] 1041226_1043806
we open up the peanut butter first . 1043991_1046981
and we spread a [/] &+s a thinnish layer in the middle because we're gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges . 1047589_1055719
all four edges will have a slightly raised &=click &-um perimeter . 1055800_1059660
we're going to put &+ry red raspberry jelly . 1060146_1063976
&-uh &+s open that cap up . 1064506_1065846
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesn't cross over the walls so it doesn't hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your [/] your hand as you're enjoying . 1066070_1078450
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich . 1078730_1080800
if you like you can fold it over which was the way a_lot_of people in my neighborhood did it . 1082220_1086360
&=click but I think that's it . [+ exc] 1087801_1088641
that's how we'll do it . [+ exc] 1089067_1089947
