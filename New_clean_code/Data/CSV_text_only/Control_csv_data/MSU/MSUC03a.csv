&-hm (.) you mean in terms of how I felt or what happened ? 24937_28687
&-uh <I was> [/] I was thrown off of a horse once which was was quite traumatic . 30512_35312
and &-uh the horse reared up and seemingly simultaneously kicked back . 36097_41807
and I was thrown in the air and tumbled &-uh pretty much head over heels in front of the horse . 42469_48299
and I was out with a group of horses &-uh riding along a beach . 49156_53276
and the [/] the rest of them were behind me and just went galloping over me . 53943_59223
and &-um it [/] <it was> [//] that was really scary . 59968_63198
I [/] I love horses . 63283_64643
I love all animals . 64663_65633
but I never went &-uh horseback riding again . 65726_69756
it was serious and I ended up with a serious back injury . 70951_74491
it didn't manifest right away which I found out in my travels through the &-uh osteopathic world that they oftentimes don't . 80169_87509
sometimes years can go by before you realize that there's been a disc injury or anything like that which is why most people don't connect it with an accident . 87956_98826
sometimes you_know great [//] a great deal of time could go by (.) years . 99190_103520
"and suddenly they aren't saying +""/. 104147_105957"
"+"" oh ‡ I remember I fell off that horse five years ago . 106267_108367"
you_know ‡ they're thinking what happened to me yesterday or last week &=laughs so . 108956_112166
but that was traumatic . 112726_113586
+< noone trampled me but it [/] it +/. 117855_118930
"yeah ‡ and the [/] the terror of watching them you_know, running over me &=laughs . 121464_125174"
it was pretty bad . 125701_127221
yeah [/] yeah [//] no ‡ it was very scary . 128595_130595
my back ? 142525_142915
oh ‡ yeah . 143227_143627
"&-um when it first went out, so to speak, I &-uh &-um ended up seeing an orthopedic (.) surgeon . 144188_151988"
&-uh didn't want surgery . [+ gram] 152573_154453
totally against it . [+ gram] 154649_155549
was lucky enough to find an osteopath who &-um +... 155741_159011
he's not a chiropractor but they do manipulations . 159701_162101
and I've met people who have had surgery . 162800_164820
and I'm doing way better than them . 164836_166646
I've had &-um (a)bout three rounds of physical therapy . 167031_170901
and I also &-um began doing weight work to strengthen my upper body . 171500_176380
there was a time where I could you_know be taking a gallon of milk or a half gallon of milk out_of the dairy case . 176732_182332
and it would go right to my fifth lumbar . 182350_184610
so ‡ now my [/] my biceps and shoulders have been strengthened with regular weight work . 184952_190002
so ‡ there are things you can do you_know . 190767_192477
and I'm doing better than (.) many people . 192908_195398
the disc &+d was cracked . 195445_197075
so ‡ &-uh but surgery never seems to be a solution . 198874_202304
+< no . 204655_204752
+< no . 205694_206024
I understand how to lift and bend . 206306_208276
and I just strengthened myself . 208355_210385
mhm . 211946_212386
not really . 224656_225476
I_mean from time to time in our day to day you'll encounter people &-um but never you_know a [//] for a sustained period of time or did I ever work with any person like that . 225748_237938
oh yes . 244466_245116
no ‡ it usually goes pretty well . 247926_250256
+< a combination of &-um demonstrating and signs you_know showing them something and what little what few words I do know . [+ gram] 251485_260834
well ‡ &-um maybe more than a few words in some languages . [+ gram] 260851_263841
and they tend to know a little bit of English . 263857_266497
&-um I remember <I was> [/] I was in Frankfurt once by myself and I ended up going to &-uh a pub . 267298_275788
I don't think they called them that in Germany &=laughs . 276075_277695
but anyway &-uh I had a wonderful time talking to people . 278005_281925
I don't speak German . 281942_282952
and a_lot_of Germans do have some you_know language recognition in terms of English . 282976_288316
but I tend to get along (.) okay . 288383_291463
there are way [//] other ways than words to communicate . 291660_294740
and it's fun . 295711_296351
&-um when my daughter was born &=laughs . 324502_326572
"favorite day of my life, well the worst and the best . [+ gram] 328033_330943"
&-um <I had> [/] I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell . 331524_336714
and <it was just> [//] <it had no> [//] &-like you_know that old song what a difference a day makes &=laughs ? 337695_343395
I_mean &=laughs from the pregnancy which was just wonderful . [+ gram] 343444_347354
I ate everything I wanted . 347369_348689
I felt terrific . 348711_350051
I was working full time . 350174_351524
&-uh my freezer looked like an Oreida convention . 352153_355063
"I could eat my [//] you_know my crinkle cuts, my shoe strings, with pasta . 355081_359221"
I could do anything . 359242_360102
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say . 360522_363632
"&=laughs my [/] my [/] my obstetrician you_know during the [/] the buildup to this would say, you'll be sorry &=laughs ! 364216_371346"
and I said you_know I cannot imagine regretting this . 371967_376587
you_know ‡ <I'm eating> [//] I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the [/] the [/] the [/] the +... 376607_381297
it's two pieces of pound cake you_know with the Hagen_Dazs in [/] in the middle . 381525_385815
so ‡ then I get to the hospital . 386617_388187
and &-um it was really nasty &=laughs . 388208_390778
<it was really> [//] it was probably the worst experience I ever had . 391031_396181
&-um I was told that if I had &-um &-um automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward &=laughs . 396860_406740
that's what I was told &=laughs . 407881_410431
and &-um <I did> [//] &-um it did spark &-um revenge in me that I actually carried out . 410856_420186
you_know ‡ &-um my [/] my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook . 420791_426901
"he said +""/. 427607_427937"
"+"" well ‡ we're just going to break your water . 428119_429279"

"+"" relax . 442852_443752"
"+"" I don't understand while you're not relaxed . 444334_446244"
and this is psychological I'm sure . 446878_448738
"every time he said relax, I became even more infuriated . 449586_454076"
you_know ‡ this is the effect it had on me . 454988_456958
and he wasn't listening when I said stop saying that . 457181_460951
"when you tell some one to stop doing X, you expect them to stop doing that . 461248_465448"
so ‡ anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful . 466229_469559
"she was born smiling, right away recognized my voice . 469641_473221"
it was just the [/] &+n the most special experience of my whole life . 473696_477376
and &-um so now I went for my first postpartum checkup . 478296_482086
and I'm sitting on the table . 483441_485261
and he you_know does the finger pricks and [//] to get some blood out . 485967_489617
and he turns around . 489640_490500
and he puts the little tube in the machine . 490516_493196
and then he turns it on . 493220_494030
and the machine is whirring . 494048_495578
and I &+s quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock . 496293_501553
it happened really fast . 502514_504104
and I threw him on to the table . 504154_506174
"and then I jumped on top of him, put my knee in his groin . 506882_510692"
and I was &+r +//. 511057_511507
his glasses were askew . 511625_513205

it was such a calamity . 527624_528964
and [//] &=laughs although you_know it was all in good fun because later on you_know he +//. 529473_534183
and his wife useta work in his office . 534200_536430
and they had a nurse too . 536520_537780
"and they said +""/. 537802_538212"
"+"" selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives &=laughs . 538649_546289"
"+"" it's really selfish <on I> [//] on our part . 547615_549955"
&=laughs ‡ so that was it . 550352_555522
that's it Keli . 555731_556431
"that was a big big experience, you_know Pee_Wee's big adventure &=laughs . 556447_564777"
well ‡ it seems there's a boy out playing . 604213_606043
kicks the soccer ball . [+ gram] 606321_607601
"unfortunately it goes right into the window, breaks it . 607971_610551"
I'm gonna guess that's his father sitting there . 611254_613384
now he gets the ball . 613740_614790
and he's <looking at the> [//] surveying the damage and his son „ I guess . 614807_619057
and &-um it doesn't [/] doesn't look like it's going to end too [/] too well &=laughs . 619136_623306
might be a problem . [+ gram] 624544_627274
okay ‡ well ‡ here's this little child <I guess> [//] leaving for school . 644154_648054

"+"" no no I don't need an umbrella . 651220_652700"
very optimistic . 652720_653620
I do the same thing . [+ exc] 653920_654850
now it's raining . 654872_655822
and now it's pouring . 656552_657702
and then the child comes home you_know obviously soaking wet . 658156_662346
the mother is kind_of in her I_told_you_so@q$adj mode . 663069_666079
and <the little> [/] the little boy <I guess it is> [//] he learned a lesson . 666687_669887
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella . 669911_671731
"life is learning, from one's mistakes &=laughs . [+ exc] 674709_677079"
listen to your mother . [+ exc] 679685_680925
well ‡ the cat's up in the tree . 694220_697040
they get stuck in trees „ I guess . 697518_698938
I've [/] I've heard stories like that . 698990_700490
I guess it's the [/] &-um the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like she's ready to catch the cat . 701039_710469
the little dog of_course wants the cat down for different reasons . 710580_714440
and then the fire department shows up . 715362_716872
which [//] they're good like that . 717292_718302
they got the ladder . 718558_719178
and all is well . 719201_720481
so ‡ Cinderella is sent to live <with this> [//] &-uh with a family . 843577_847307
and she is basically a [/] &-uh a maid . 847331_850631
and &-um they [//] there are <the two> [//] &-um &+stepsis the two +... 851098_855058
I think it's the wicked stepsisters „ if I recall . 855123_857613
and <they were> [/] they were rather homely &=laughs . 858249_859659
and &-uh Cinderella of_course was very pretty . 860080_864120
and she's very you_know sweet and helpful . 864142_867772
and these two are kind_of spoiled and you_know not very pleasant . 867794_872334
and there's going to be &-uh &-uh a ball . 873186_875686
and I [/] I believe invitations go out . 876045_879145
and <the two sisters are going to> [//] &-um &-uh they're going to go to the ball . 879370_885060
and Cinderella is not invited . 885362_887452
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in . 887472_889782
and Cinderella ends up with &-uh +//. 890427_892147
"well ‡ it's all magical, you_know right . 892337_894257"
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach . 894274_897184
and by dint of you_know luck and good favor from the &-uh fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball . 897802_905722
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight . 906072_909322
so ‡ she's dancing with the prince having a wonderful time . 910022_913342
the other two sisters I [/] I forgot where +... 913622_915802
they just kind_of melted into the background . 915822_917762
they weren't very popular &=laughs . 917939_918939
I could have told you that from the beginning you_know . [+ exc] 921526_923316
but anyhow &-um Cinderella finds out what time it is . 923910_927920
and she needs to leave you_know &-uh to get into the [/] the [/] the carriage to go back before midnight . 927968_933638
and she [//] &-um her slipper fill [
and the prince finds it . 941011_942231
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that you_know he wants to find this [/] &-uh this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper . 942247_953017
&-uh I remember the details now from my own picture book . [+ exc] 953877_956837
put it on . 957165_957595
when [/] when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet . 958060_962150
and the slipper was &-like <even half> [//] not even half the size of her foot . 962628_966928
so ‡ anyway they locked Cinderella up . 967517_969217
I think nobody wanted them to find her . 969386_971536
and the mice helped . 971556_972476
they brought the key . 972559_973299
and <the mice> [//] she [//] you_know the animals loved her . 973322_976062
they were her friends . 976086_976976
and of_course it all ends happily ever after . 977539_979869
<she does> [//] <it does> [//] it is discovered that the slipper fits her . 979891_983991
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince . 984543_987933
just the way we all live . [+ gram] [+ exc] 989234_990614
it's exactly what my experience has been &=laughs . [+ exc] 991191_994381
it's the same thing . [+ exc] 994544_997314
<it's like they> [/] it's like they met me . [+ exc] 997469_999459
<and they> [//] &+reali you_know <they [/] they> [//] <it was the> [//] &+s you_know really it was like they knew me . [+ exc] 999951_1005771
it's so uncanny . [+ exc] 1005793_1006833
alright ‡ well ‡ first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture . 1026276_1029656
&-um now when I make a sandwich +//. 1030188_1032088
and it's not just with peanut butter and jelly . 1032109_1034300
I [/] I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up you_know ? 1034917_1039887
it's got to be just right . 1040143_1041183
so ‡ anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter +//. 1041819_1045540
"again two slices of bread is nice, but for this we'll put the peanut butter on first &-uh with a knife . 1045651_1051881"
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around . 1052195_1056455
and it [/] it just works better than with the knife . 1056809_1059119
and that's it . [+ exc] 1059735_1060155
"you_know ‡ in this case you could cut it in half, fold it in half, get another piece . 1060178_1063558"
you_know ‡ if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle you_know like that . 1064236_1069766
