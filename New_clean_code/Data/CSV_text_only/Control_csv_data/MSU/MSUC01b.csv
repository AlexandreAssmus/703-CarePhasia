I will tell you about a cheerleading accident . 133960_136170
&-um and I broke my arm . 136641_138141
and I was in I &+th believe <it was sophomore> [//] it was my sophomore year in high_school . 138391_144121
and I was in the gymnasium . 144626_146016
and we were practicing . 146035_147625
and I did a back flip . 148147_149697
and I came down on my arm . 149861_152301
and I remember hearing it crack . 152322_154092
it was CYO so <it was> [/] it was not &-uh &-uh &-like in a public school . 154582_160122
and &-um I remember the [//] some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest . 160694_165544
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital . 166131_170451
and I remember that &-um I was in the hospital for almost a week . 171024_175084
I'd never really been sick and have since really been sick . [+ gram] 175599_178469
but [//] &-um (.) so ‡ I [/] I remember being in a cast for quite a long time . 178600_183980
and [/] and [/] &-um and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long . 184000_195200
I had a Christmas sling <and a> [//] and whatnot . 195218_197028
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling . 197161_199361
but &-um (.) I can now tell the weather . 199882_203342
oh ‡ well ‡ <I was> [/] I was fourteen years old . 213375_216135
your body just gets better . 216153_217303
I [/] &+f I [//] there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that . 217579_221369
<it was &-um going back> [//] I never went back to the squad . 221516_224776
I tried to do twirling . 224796_225906
and I just couldn't do the hand motions . 225925_227755
and &-um so I never went back to that . 227914_230424
so +... 230701_230941
besides my husband ? 238201_239201
well ‡ after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him &-um (.) and realizing that (.) he needed time for processing and [/] and sort_of (.) understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them . [+ gram] 247844_268264
so ‡ that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability . [+ gram] 268530_272980
so ‡ he [/] he was able to do that . [+ gram] 273070_274850
so ‡ after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sort_of &+s a little bit of self teaching and [/] and &-um and giving him time to find his words and [/] and thinking of the process <as as> [/] as a child learns speech again . [+ gram] 275100_293930
so ‡ I tried to educate myself on [/] &-uh on how children learn language . 294247_300977
and then from that &-um he sort_of followed that same process but only speeding it up . 301668_309818
"so ‡ he had the foundation there, so &=shrugs . 310003_311803"
&-um but mostly just giving him time . [+ gram] 312464_315554
happy sad . [+ gram] 342885_343545

&-uh &-um in the summers we would go to the beach . 348893_355393
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins . 356192_360022
and we were always close . 360074_361434
and we went to a place in &-um Long_Branch . 362158_366508
and it was this sort_of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families <would [/] would get into a room> [//] would get a room . 367606_376266
and then you would get a parcel <of a> [/] of a kitchen . 376283_378883
and [/] and you_know when you think about it now . [+ gram] 379502_381382
but [//] &-um and so we would go . 381492_386252
and my folks never had much money . 386326_387826
and [/] and &-um so they would sort_of save up for this week . 387847_391707
and [/] <and we would go to the> [//] and we [/] we would all stay in this one room . 391766_394856
and I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother . 394879_397249
and [/] &-um and <we would just> [//] we would go to the beach . 397805_402395
and we would just have a great time . 402417_404367
<and I> [//] so I remember &-um going to the pool . 404389_408309
they would have salt water pool . 408329_410009
I remember it being really cold . 410031_412721
so ‡ you would jump in in the morning . 413032_414432
and you_know you would just spend your whole day there . 414452_417532
and you would be spent by the end of the day . 417548_419688
and [/] and I still remember the smells and the sights of it so . 419703_423533
you_know ‡ and I remember the [/] &-um the routines . 424019_427199
being Catholic <on a> [//] on a Saturday . [+ gram] 427219_429899
there was a place called Rutt's_Hut which I think is still around . 429920_433180
&-um but it was this little &-um over the boardwalk over the beach kind of place . 433709_438519
and it was &-um +... 438573_440213
and on Friday nights my [/] my mother and my aunt <and &+m and> [//] they'd wake us all up to go to &+r Rutt's_Hup [
and that would be &-like our [/] our treat . 455895_457485
we were probably &-like all in our pajamas . 457702_459792
and [/] and [//] but &+w we would all get out there . 459855_462345
and [/] and so it became a [/] a [//] sort_of a ritual that we all did together . 462360_465740
"but &-uh I remember just playing on the beach, and &+th you_know &+th +... 466361_469421"
so ‡ it was just a good time . 470363_471563
yeah it was . 472735_473215
it was a_lot_of fun . 473267_474047
"and with those cousins we're still close and still share a_lot_of things , so . 474376_478306"
a boy is outside . 510419_511239
and he's playing a game of soccer . 511258_512957
so ‡ he's out for the afternoon and playing with &-um +... 513465_517885
"I don't see any friends, so I think he's just playing sort_of a kick the ball . 517900_521460"
and he's <in his> [/] in his neighborhood . 521479_523589
and &-uh lo_and_behold the ball finds its way into a window of a [//] either his own family or [/] &-um or a neighbor next door . 523767_533937
and &-um there is a gentleman that's sitting &-um maybe watching tv . 534449_540469
"I don't see a newspaper, so he's watching some tv . 540538_542968"
and &-um <the window [
he gets up to see who it is . 549408_552028
and you kind_of wonder did the boy run away or is the boy still there ? 552074_555524
I guess the mother heard the weather report (be)cause she had an umbrella in hand <as the> [/] as the little boy is walking out the door . 577295_582955
"but he <I guess> [//] took a look outside and said +""/. 582979_586069"
"+"" no you_know <I don't see any> [/] &+w I don't see any rain so I don't wanna take a [//] an umbrella . 586252_590632"
so ‡ he says goodbye to his mom . 591123_592673
and &-um he's walking out the door . 592689_594779
and then maybe he gets a couple steps . 594797_597477
and here comes the rain . 597551_599191
"and he's like +""/. 599241_600331"
"+"" uhoh I better get back home and &-um see if I can get that umbrella . 600802_605682"
so ‡ he gets in the door . 605757_606737
"and his mother is looking at him and saying +""/. 606755_608595"
"+"" I told you it was going to rain . 610210_611620"
so ‡ let me give you the umbrella . 612346_613936
and then you can walk to school . 614528_616498
and you'll be dry . 616910_617690
(...) a girl is riding her bike . 646274_647964
so ‡ she's [/] she's out on her bike . 648660_650480
and she's going through the neighborhood and &-um all_of_a_sudden looks up and sees her cat in the tree . 650533_656993
and calls to her dad and asks her dad to <come on> [//] come over and help her get the cat . 657711_663961
and the father brings over his ladder and puts it against the tree and starts to go for the cat and the ladder falls . 664613_674433
and so now he's stuck in the tree . 675397_677987
and the dog is barking trying to (.) get everybody's attention I guess . 678808_684828
or he's barking at the dog [
or he's really barking at the cat probably . 687154_688964
and &-um (.) <the girl has> [//] the father takes out his cell phone . 689603_696643
we'll put it in that situation now . [+ exc] 697300_698920
calls the firemen . 699294_700454
and &-um he calls <the fire> [/] &-uh the fire people from his town . 700830_706480
and they come on over . 706499_707479
and they &-um will rescue the cat <and the> [/] and the man . 707495_713155
and the bird will &-uh still sing their [
and the dog will stop barking . 717169_718599
well ‡ the story opens with &-um Cinderella's dad &-um coming home with his new wife <and their two children> [//] and [/] and her two daughters . 820288_831658
and what we find out later on is that the father has died . 831762_836272
and this woman now becomes her stepmother . 836292_839102
and as they grow then &-um Cinderella becomes more of the servant <to the> [//] &+m to the stepmother and to the two girls . 839666_850396
and &-um <a letter comes to them or> [//] an announcement comes to the family . 851174_857314
and <there is a> [//] there's going to be a ball . 857871_860071
and the ball is going to be held at the castle . 860702_864632
she &-um wants to go &-um makes a [//] some sort of a dress . 866019_872309
and then later on &-um the stepmother and the [/] &+s the stepdaughters find out about it ridicule her kind_of take the dress apart disassemble it . 873053_883143
and she's left home <doing scrubbing something> [//] <scrubbing some> [/] scrubbing some pot or other . 883217_889417
and <she then will &-um> [//] she's then left home . 889524_895804
and all_of_a_sudden lo_and_behold comes the fairy godmother . 895823_898813
and [/] &-um and they whip her up a beautiful dress you_know . 899274_903564
well ‡ it's just a whole new thing of Chanel . 903581_905911
and &-um so they [/] they whip her up this brand new dress . 906098_909398
and she &-um is then able to [/] &-um to go to the ball . 909551_916271
and the ball is set for a reason . 916727_918927
and the reason is [/] is that the prince is to find a wife . 918943_921923
and she's given instructions that she needs to be home by twelve midnight . 923035_928665
and [/] &-um and the [/] the fairy godmother provides her with this beautiful dress and these wonderful glass slippers and [/] and <a whole coach of [/] of> [//] pumpkins that turn to [/] to a coach and [/] &-um and with horsemen etcetera . 928839_943499
and &-um so she goes there . 943956_946636
and she is the belle of the ball . 947187_948867
and everyone is oohing and aahing because they don't know who she is . 949092_952252
she then will &-um go to &-um the clock +//. 952775_957465
well ‡ she's dancing and whatnot . 957562_959322
and the clock sɑɪks@u [
she hasta leave . 961300_962230
&-um and she's running away . 962884_965114
and the prince is (.) you_know (..) after her . 965129_968639
and &-um (.) she loses a slipper so this is all that the prince hasta find this woman . 968815_976695
so ‡ he combs the land and finally comes to the house <of the> [//] &-um of Cinderella with this wicked stepmother . 976752_984652
and so they try on the [/] the slipper . 984675_986815
and it doesn't fit <the mother> [//] the stepmother or <the [/] the &+stepch> [//] the stepdaughters . 986839_990489
and &-um lo_and_behold they find Cinderella . 992040_995490
and [/] and &-um the glass slipper fits . 995507_999267
and (.) to coin that phrase they live happily ever after . 999734_1004214
(.) with two pieces of bread &-um I would get a plate to put the bread on . 1023335_1028994
get a knife to [/] &-um to spread the peanut butter . 1029458_1034748
and get a spoon to get the +//. 1034859_1036520
no ‡ I wouldn't get a spoon . 1036605_1037405
I'd use the same knife . 1037522_1038323
so ‡ &-um <I take the peanut butter out_of> [//] I unscrew the top take the peanut butter &-um with my knife and spread it on the bread . 1038865_1051245
spread it on only the one side . 1051685_1053725
get the jelly and put it on top of the peanut butter . 1053820_1057350
and &-um <put the top> [//] put the other slice of bread on it probably press it down a little bit and then slice it . 1057880_1065680
put the covers back on . 1066595_1067775
