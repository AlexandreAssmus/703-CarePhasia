haven't had that many . [+ gram] 28472_29382
but &-um when I was <I guess> [//] around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader . 29910_37030
and I was in practice . 37738_39318
and I was doing +//. 39558_41878
which I can't believe I did . 43067_44077
"+, but headstands and head [//] back flips . 44518_46358"
and doing a flip I fell . 46917_49447
I tripped . 49976_50776
and I came down . 50826_51526
and I broke my arm . 51547_52237
so ‡ I remember that instance . 52783_54603
I remember it quite clearly being driven +//. 54680_57450
&-uh it was a CYO thing . 57638_59078
so ‡ I remember being driven in [/] in the car by the priest and the [//] my [/] my other friends around me and going to the hospital and [/] &-um and having my arm taken care of and having surgery . 59522_72012
so ‡ +/. 72255_72525
I was in a cast . 81976_83126
you hafta remember it was a long time ago . 83171_84401
so ‡ I was in a cast . 84471_85321
and I was in a cast for a long time . 85456_87156
I do remember my father making me &+s &-um slings that were &-um (.) the holidays . 87583_94843
so [//] because it went through many holidays . 94992_97192
and [/] &-um and then <once it was> [//] &-uh you_know once it &-uh &+m +... 97777_103087
I went back to being a cheerleader again . 103585_105235
&-um it's a_little misshapen . 107999_109229
but it's fine . 109493_110303
so ‡ I no longer do back flips to say the least &=laughs . 110900_114440
well ‡ my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight . 123556_125886
well ‡ the problems were that he (.) could not communicate . 131477_135077
right after his stroke he really had no language at all . 135154_137474
so ‡ the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and [/] &-um and has continued at this clinic . 137673_145323
&-um and this is almost four years later since his stroke . 145709_148449
so ‡ I've seen the development of the speech patterns emerging . 148876_152826
and &-um what I have seen <is him> [/] is him recapture language . 152849_156499
I[/] I think very similar to what I see in a child . 156523_156843
"so ‡ , in moving in [/] in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see . 158073_158143"
okay .
well ‡ I guess the thing that always &-uh &+st stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and [/] and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident . 192677_192678
"and [/] and I remember asking the question +""/. 194938_195028"
"+"" is he alive ?"
and it was such a strange question .
but &-uh I needed an answer to it . 208117_208197
and they said <on the other> [//] on the [/] &+su the other side of the phone &-um they didn't know .
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and [/] and getting out there . 213578_213688
and I remember hearing the sirens <as I was> [/] as I was approaching . 221068_228754
and when I got there &-um you_know <he had already been in a> [//] &+st he had already been out . 229534_229644
&-um he didn't know who I was . 232062_232142
and he didn't know who anyone was .
<but luckily and> [//] &-um but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him .
so ‡ they knew that he wasn't drunk .
they knew that he wasn't impaired in any other way .
and he knew enough to know that <he was> [//] he had a stroke .
"and (.) I remember he was the one who said to me +""/. 240147_240237"
"+"" get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible ."
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to .
and I remember this police officer . 262980_263050
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him &-um when Anthony was on the force .
so ‡ he came in <as a> [/] as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant .
and so you_know I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you_know in that it was very much <like a> [/] &-um like a movie or you_know . 271945_271985
but and I remember getting down <into the> [/] &+in into the brain attack center . 297211_297212
and &-um everybody was doing what they needed to do .
and it was all this kind_of prescribed dance that went on .
and &-um you_know getting him there and [/] and getting him that shot and [/] and that starting .
and [/] and [//] you_know ‡ and then from there it was just the recovery .
it was the day in day out routine .
but &-um I do remember that . 298418_326385
that stays with me .
"yeah ‡ it does, absolutely ."
okay . [+ exc]
well ‡ a boy is outside .
and he's playing (.) looks like soccer .
so ‡ he's kicking the ball .
and lo_and_behold it goes (.) into the neighbor's or his own &-um window and crashes through that window .
and there's the [/] &+f the man who's sitting and either watching t_v or talking or having a conversation .
"and the soccer ball comes through the window, hits the lamp ."
and &-um the gentleman inside is really quite surprised .
he then &-um has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man .
"and the mother is saying to him +""/."
"+"" take this umbrella because I think it's going to rain . 423020_423021"
"and he's saying +""/."
"+"" no, no, no, I don't need that umbrella . 429090_429180"
"+"" I'm leaving ."
so ‡ she's got the umbrella in hand .
and he's out the door .
and then &+gasp lo_and_behold the rain starts .
and he is caught in the rain .
and he is really wet .
and he makes his way home .
"and his mother is looking at him saying &-um &+h &+h +""/."
"+"" I told you so . 431705_431825"
"+"" and let's get the umbrella ."
"+"" and then you can go back out ."
well ‡ it's a series of circumstances .
and (..) the little girl's cat is in the tree .
<she was> [//] looks like she was riding her bike .
and <she was> [//] &+s &-um she saw her cat up in the tree .
she could have called her dad .
"and her dad said +""/."
"+"" okay I'm going to help you and go get the cat ."
and took the ladder .
and it doesn't seem like the ladder is quite as [/] &+l as &-uh high as what he needed to .
so ‡ anyway the +...
no ‡ I'm sorry . [+ exc]
then it looks like he used the ladder .
and the ladder has fallen .
and he is stuck in the tree .
and (.) the dog is barking (.) because they (a)re all up in the tree .
and the firemen hafta come and rescue .
"when Cinderella was a little girl, she was brought to a house ."
and there was &-um a stepmother .
and the stepmother had two (.) daughters .
the father dies .
and <the daughters> [//] &-um the stepmother &-um has a sense of favoritism towards <her children> [//] her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid <and they> [//] so to speak .
so ‡ &-um Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and [/] and all of that .
and then the [/] &-um the [/] &+s the stepsisters &-um (.) grow meaner and meaner as the time goes .
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more (.) jealous of Cinderella .
&-um and then comes the [/] &-um the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity <for the> [//] &-um for there to be a dance .
and everybody <is all> [/] &-um is all you_know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the [/] the perfect outfit .
and [/] and Cinderella &-um is not going to go to the ball .
and she is at home .
and [/] <and> [/] &-um and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot .
<so they find> [//] I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the [//] <in a> [/] (.) in a hope chest or <I guess> [//] what I would call now a hope chest . 525010_719425
and &-um so that becomes +...
<I don't> [//] &+n wait a minute . [+ exc] 720175_720265
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing . 725843_725873
&-um so ‡ the sisters go to the ball .
and [/] and &+s poor Cinderella is home with her mice .
"and [/] and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance, I believe . 729789_743110"
so ‡ the fairy &+p godmother creates the [/] &-um the carriage to take her in . 743132_748392
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect . 748622_751692
and [/] and her fairy godmothers then help her &-um to go to the ball . 751710_756360
so ‡ when [/] when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there . 756522_759602
and &-uh everyone is just &=gasp . 759618_761028
<takes her breath away> [//] and she takes their breath away . 761474_763944
and she meets the prince . 764143_765613
&-um and they dance . 766384_767864
and they have a wonderful time . 767887_768917
&-um but what happens is the clock strikes twelve . 769306_772406
and she needs to be home . 772427_773667
and &-um she is running out the door . 774325_777285
and <her slipper is> [//] her shoe is left behind . 777305_781165
so ‡ she goes home . 781930_783240
the sisters and whatnot they all go home . 783651_785891
and [/] and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper . 785908_792208
and he combs through the village . 793241_795601
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers . 795709_800679
and it doesn't work . 800697_801697
and then lo_and_behold he finds Cinderella . 801760_804400
and the &+f shoe fits . 804558_805988
they get married . 807253_807883
and they live happily ever after . 807907_809397
"the end, the end . [+ exc] 810528_812008"
and way too many girls are looking for Prince_charming . [+ exc] 812734_815324
"but that's a whole other issue, yes ! [+ exc] 815339_817339"
I would get the bread . 819870_819871
first [//] well I would get the bread out_of the +//. 846201_846291
for me I keep my bread in the freezer . 850437_850487
so ‡ I would take it out_of the freezer and let it defrost . 853041_853111
&-um my peanut butter stays in a cabinet .
my jelly is in the refrigerator .
so ‡ the bread comes out first .
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out .
&-um once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first . 854693_871501
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter . 871725_875685
put the other slice of bread on . 876868_878828
and slice it in a triangle motion . 878924_881824
there you go . 883344_884184
