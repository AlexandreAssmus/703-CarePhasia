alright &-uh back when I was in high school I broke my collar bone &-uh in phys(ical) ed(ucation) class . 24473_30263
I was a senior in high school . 30598_31858
and I was playing third base in gym class . 31876_34906
we [/] &+pl we were playing softball . 35420_36140
and I was playing third base . 36159_37059
and it was a ground ball . 37525_38375
I kind_of moved over toward the short stop . 38390_40380
and the short stop charged in to get it and ran into me and kind_of hit my shoulder and snapped my collar bone . 40437_45717
and it was &-uh in the springtime . 46278_47918
so ‡ <it was> [//] I [//] &-uh you_know <they hadta> [//] I'd never broken a bone . 48508_52718
they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me . 52742_54942
and take [//] &-uh then I [//] we [//] the field was about half a mile from the school . 54961_58801
so ‡ I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm . 59171_61901
and [/] &-um and they said my arm was broken . 62427_64967
and they put this harness on me that kind_of pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight . 64986_69146
and &-uh so I got to wear that for my prom and for graduation . 69169_73159
and there was a &-uh miserable injury . 73207_76567
I'll say that . 76728_77418
no ‡ really <you just> [//] it's a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and &-uh you_know meet up when [//] while they heal . 81516_89786
and &-uh otherwise it's just limited activity for awhile . 90248_93608
right around the funnest time of the year . 94867_96447
+< yeah it did . 102819_103569
&-um yeah <I &-uh go> [//] &-uh I distribute communion in the &-uh nursing home once a month . 118713_127243
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making a_lot_of sense and some are not so communicative . 127661_138711
and you_know you end up you_know using (.) my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to you_know coax them into <talking to you> [//] communicating with you . 138812_149312
and &-uh you_know you do a_lot_of different things &-like make [//] you_know with trying to make facial expressions and trying to [//] you_know to just kind_of jar them back to the present so they can determine whether they're even ready to take communion . 149787_165277
&-uh but you_know <that's kind_of> [//] <it's a_lot_of> [//] it's <a_lot more> [//] a_lot less verbal and a_lot more you_know trying to make a personal connection with them . 165807_174867
&-uh when +/. 207715_208345
I'll talk about my other daughter . 208660_210340
when Erin was born &-uh and we [//] it was &-uh a little postdated the energy [* s
and she was a little bit late so they decided <she would> [//] they would induce her . 218758_221988
and she [//] we went to the hospital . 222009_224959
it was all planned . 224982_225692
it was only going to be a couple of hours . 225712_227162
and it ended up being of_course like thirteen hours . 227312_229492
&-um but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileen's parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby . 229955_240385
and it was <the first> [//] my parents' first grandchild so a really exciting time . 240408_244988
and I have three brothers . 245033_245943
so ‡ it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl . [+ gram] 246605_250505
so ‡ &-um you_know <it was> [//] &+ju the whole (.) thing was just that [//] being that (.) we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done . 251048_260218
and <a little> [//] but it made it so exciting because we knew our [//] &+gran that the grandparents could be there . 260240_265260
and <we could be> [//] you_know it could be exciting for everybody . 265281_268781
yes it was . 270728_271188
so ‡ the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air . 304730_309190
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard . 309653_312293
and it goes through the window &-uh of the house . 312344_315904
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over . 317138_320668
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily . 321449_327619
and &-uh I'm sure he's on the other end running from his father . 328452_332042
the little boy is getting ready to go to school . 360869_362309
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and [//] &-uh because it's sposta rain . 362885_369535
and he tells her he doesn't need it . 369856_371976
and he walks out the door . 371997_372857
and you_know he just barely gets away from the house . 373353_375843
and it starts really raining hard . 375866_377326
"so ‡ he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her +""/. 377983_383143"
"+"" you know what you were right . 383508_384408"
"+"" I needed the umbrella after all . 384650_386000"
&-uh the little girl's cat climbed up the tree . 406465_408715
&-uh it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog . 409158_412168
and she [//] so the cat got stuck in the tree . 412899_415959
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out . 415977_420417
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell . 420439_425119
so ‡ then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father (.) and get the barking dog away from the tree . 425941_434611
so ‡ once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone . 542252_545402
and the father met a [/] &+w a woman and decided to get married . 545862_550432
and this woman had two daughters . 550499_552119
&-uh and the [//] so the [//] they became a family . 552915_555995
and quickly the new mother who [//] &-uh became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters . 556300_564900
so ‡ she [//] they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the &-uh stepmother and <the two> [//] the stepmother's two daughters . 565491_575771
&-uh and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody . 576487_581967
&-uh and then one day there was going to be a ball . 582621_584961
the king was going to have a [/] a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife . 584980_590450
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party . 591160_597020
&-uh and Cinderella wanted to go . 597483_599463
but her [/] &+step her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody else's needs were taken care of first &+everyb her [//] the two sisters' dresses were ready and everything else . 599481_608231
so ‡ Cinderella got it all ready . 608479_609779
and in the meantime her [//] the mice sewed a [/] a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear . 609803_615673
&-um so ‡ after she got <all of> [//] everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself . 616451_621721
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs . 622166_626036
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her . 626367_629427
so ‡ she thought she wouldn't be able to go to the ball . 629928_632088
and then <she met her> [//] she &+w ran out into the back garden of the castle [
and she met her (.) fairy godmother . 637279_639689
and the fairy godmother told her that you're going to go to the ball . 640101_643051
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach . 643376_645076
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown . 645646_647596
and <she put the> [//] she turned the mice into the horses . 648011_652931
and she went off to the ball . 652981_655261
<and the> [//] but there was one stipulation is that <she hadta be home> [//] she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was . [+ gram] 655520_663150
so ‡ she went to the ball . 663867_664817
and she met the prince . 664838_665918
and they fell in love . 666054_667164
and then the [//] all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock strike twelve . 667636_671096
and she immediately tried [//] ran out_of the ball hadta get out_of there before she turned back into Cinderella . 671723_677953
and she lost her shoe on the step <of the> [/] &-uh of the palace . 678424_682954
&-um but there was nothing she could do . 683492_685612
she just kept running . 685636_686566
and the next day the king's (.) minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe . 687043_698883
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldn't fit into it . 699425_704525
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe . 705107_706737
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after . 707072_709622
I would put the bread down . 727660_728830
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread . 728849_731439
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter . 731990_734380
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it . 734852_736742
