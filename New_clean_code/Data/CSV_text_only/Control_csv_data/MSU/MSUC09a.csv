well ‡ I recently had Hodgkin's disease . 23785_26965
&-uh was diagnosed (.) <I guess> [//] about three months after I retired . [+ gram] 27702_33442
I spent &-uh &+s several months in chemotherapy . 34527_38627
"&-uh but &+pri <prior to that> [//] before the chemotherapy started, I had &-uh an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks . 39432_49792"
"that was [/] was a Stevens_Johnson syndrome, which is not unlike a burn although there was no [/] no burning to my skin . 49904_58444"
it was all a result of the allergic reaction . 58465_61165
and that stopped the chemo . 61734_62984
I had one round of chemo . 63160_64760
and then the allergic reaction took place to the [//] &+medica not the chemo medication but to &-uh a medication that's designed to protect &-uh kidney function . 64775_74255
so ‡ I was in the hospital for three weeks . 75623_77143
that resolved . 77161_78271
I started chemo again . 78960_80250
and &-uh I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since . 81199_88179
so ‡ my hair came back . 89897_91007

and I hafta watch it now because it's [/] it's &=laughs back more than it has been . 93023_96533

&-um so ‡ <it was> [//] you_know it [//] &+ih I had chemo every two weeks . 129577_134687
and the oncologist was just great . 134769_136359
and [/] &-uh and Firstname was quite a support . 136489_139599
&=cries sorry . 142599_143039
and I [/] &+d &+d I didn't do much else because it was you_know the chemo and [/] and &-uh eating as best as I could and &-uh &-uh resting as [/] as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasn't too hard . 145728_158458
&-um &=click so that was it you_know following doctor's orders as they say (.) and my wife's orders . 159190_166190

a story +... 188069_189249
well ‡ this being Saint_Joseph's day in the Roman_Catholic calendar and since my son's name is Joseph as_well_as my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday . 192331_202101
"that [//] &-uh I do know the day of the week &-uh in December, December ninth . 202147_207567"
&-uh and &-uh it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that [/] that we found out <that &-uh we were pregnant> [//] that my wife was pregnant . 208680_219940
&-uh he's our only child . 220654_222804
"&-um so ‡ his [/] his [//] the announcement of the fact <that he was> [//] that my wife was pregnant and then his being born <I guess> [//] are happy memories prompted by , as I said , today because of [/] of [/] the &-uh of Saint_Joseph's day . 222911_241441"
<about the> [//] &+da about Saint_Joseph's day ? 245784_247014
<it's a> [/] it's a feast day in [/] <in the> [/] &-uh in the Roman_Catholic calendar that comes just after Saint_Patrick's day which <I think> [//] overshadows [/] overshadows it . 247029_257189
"and it's [//] &-um as the Irish celebrate Saint_Patrick's, I think Saint_Joseph's day is mostly celebrated by the Italian_Americans and by Italians . 257298_266578"
and there's a special pastry that is consumed . 267067_269437
and it's called a Zeppole or the [/] the donut of Saint_Joseph . 270016_273026
"it's quite rich, creamy, fattening, cholesterol laden, but quite delicious . 273813_279773"
"&-uh <if you> [/] if you meant my son's birthdate, &-um we prepared for &-uh childbirth . 280816_288396"
&-uh I was to be a coach . 288790_290260
it was very early in the time when the so-called painless childbirth developed or Lamaze . 290591_296391
&-um but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didn't allow fathers in the waiting [
so ‡ even_though <we prepared> [/] we prepared for &-uh the day of birth going to <childbirth classes> [//] Lamaze classes . 303971_312501
<when it> [//] when +//. 313093_313903
pun intended . 315170_315840
"when push came to shove, I couldn't go into the waiting ["
&-uh so ‡ I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days . 320732_324782
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery . 324800_328700
and [/] and I [//] we did use some of the coaching . 328724_330564
<so it> [//] and [/] and she did &+m &-uh employ some of the &-um &-uh techniques that were taught to her . 331086_337566
&-um so ‡ yeah ‡ so ‡ <that was> [/] that was the day of his birth . 338333_342633
"a boy is kicking a soccer ball which goes through &+w a house window, smashes the glass . 375379_381819"
and it's falling into the lap of a man who's sitting in a chair in the house . 381925_386885

didn't listen to mom . [+ gram] 425292_426132

"he leaves the house, this time with the umbrella . 437105_439075"
well ‡ a cat is stuck up in the tree . 456603_458693
and this child's father probably he [/] he did climb the tree to try to get the cat . 458717_463957
&-uh but he now himself is stuck up there . 464691_466951
the dog is barking at him . 466970_469220

Cinderella is a young girl who [//] &-um whose mother died . 566400_572840
and she's brought by her father to live with &-uh I [/] <I think> [//] a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age . 572893_583643
&-uh father meant well . 584699_586649
but &-uh the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought &-uh and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully . 587066_596506
"&-uh she became &-uh their maid essentially and &-uh hadta clean the house, &-uh take care of the fireplace, hence the name Cinderella, &-uh do the cooking, do the washing while they &-uh enjoyed life and &-uh &-uh did what they wanted to do to [/] to please themselves . 596764_619414"
"one day, the prince +//. 619435_621205"
they [/] they lived <in a> [/] in a principality . 621258_623098
the prince &-uh whose father wanted him to marry &-uh <was &-uh asked to or> [//] was told that there would be a ball held at which &-uh <many of the or> [//] all of the single women in the principality would [/] would be invited . 623113_639483
and the idea would be that <he would> [//] the prince would eventually &-uh pick one of them to be his wife . 640482_646532
<the three> [//] Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball . 648032_651072
<the mother> [//] their mother's very excited . 651095_653035
and of_course Cinderella is excluded . 653488_655148
she cannot go to the ball . 655170_656970
&-uh and so she's left at home alone while the &-uh stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball . 658185_664225
&=click she's visited by her fairy godmother &-uh who &-uh grants her &-uh her wish of attending the ball . 665741_676091
"because Cinderella says +""/. 676245_677185"
"+"" how am I gonna get there ? 677380_678250"
"+"" what am I gonna wear ? 678581_679461"
"&-uh so ‡ the &+guh fairy godmother &-uh makes a very nice gown for her out_of magic, &-uh takes a pumpkin, causes it to become a coach . 679485_690115"
mice become the horses . 691020_692780
&-uh I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too . 693826_696436
I forget (.) which animal becomes the coachman . [+ exc] 696454_699824
they take her to the ball . 700281_701201
&-um she's not really recognized by her stepsisters and [/] and the stepmother . 702341_708781
&=click &-uh but they [/] the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight . 709775_713855
otherwise [//] or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was . 713875_718285
"the coach would become the pumpkin again, etcetera . 718305_720345"
so ‡ she promises to return at midnight . 721157_723177
but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight . 723296_728486
so ‡ she panics . 728503_729543
rightly so . 730152_730952
"runs, &-uh gets back in the coach, and is taken home . 731209_735969"
but one of her slippers [//] glass slippers that was part of what the &-uh fairy godmother made for her is left behind . 736630_745140
and the prince &-uh at [/] at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and &-uh wanted to [/] to know who she was . 745800_754760
because she was going to be the one . 755034_756684
&-uh and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind . 757484_761474
so ‡ he &-uh has all of the young ladies <in the> [/] &+munici &-uh in the principality &-uh try the slipper on . 762380_770990
&-uh it [//] their [//] it's brought to each of their houses . 771423_773723
and the [//] of_course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one &-uh he was looking for the one who was at the ball . 774321_780621
"and, sure enough, &-um it is Cinderella's foot that fits &-uh the glass slipper, to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and [//] but to her great delight . 781237_792217"
and &-um the prince marries her . 792240_795720
and they live happily ever after . 795741_796941
well ‡ I would take &-um two pieces of bread . 821106_824926
