my speech is alright 
it's just that I have trouble getting some of the words out 
I know what I wanna say 
I know everything about it 
but um like right now I'm talking clearly 
and that I always did 
even the doctors always said 
 you  you speak so clear 
you_know  they know every word that I'm saying 
but um the words ges
now try  work  work  I hafta work for it 
um what I was doing that day 
before 
I was outside working in the garden 
and it was hot 
it was in the beginning of June 
and it was three years ago when it was in the nineties 
but I love to work in the garden 
and I was working in the garden 
and all_of_a_sudden it was getting  you_know I was getting a little not dizzy but I just wasn't feeling right 
and I thought 
 I think I better stop because it's getting too hot 
so  I cleaned up 
I had a shower 
and um I went shopping 
I was looking for curtains 
and uh it was getting later because I always like to get home by three o'clock to watch my program laughs 
so  uh on my way home I was passing another store whi which had curtains 
so  I thought 
 well  let me check it out in there 
so  I went in there 
and as I'm walking around all of sudden I'm like  um the ges
nothing hurt 
nothing hurt 
but it was just getting weird 
and I thought 
 what is happening 
so  I thought 
 must be from the heat 
so  uh I thought I better go home 
I'm driving and I'm by myself 
so  I went home got clea uh cooled down and I had a uh something to n eat 
and then I sat and my story came on 
and uh I don't remember closing my eyes or sleeping or anything 
but all_of_a_sudden my son who lives with me he's calling me 
and he comes home about five o'clock 
and uh clears
and he says 
 what are you doing 
he says 
 you should be cooking 
he says it's 
I says 
 oh  you're home early 
and he says 
 no 
he says 
 it's five o'clock 
so  between that time when the story was about to start and five o'clock I was out 
but I could talk 
I could walk 
I could  nothing  nothing bothered me 
but I got in the kitchen and I stood there 
and I said to him 
 whadya 
 what am I cooking 
 supper 
 okay 
so  I took a  mo a few more steps and I says 
 what do I have for supper 
 what am I making for supper 
he says 
 what you were 
we were making lambchops on the grill 
and I had them marinated 
and uh I says 
 well  what was I making 
so  he  he told me 
and I says 
 where are 
I didn't even know where they were 
he says 
 in the refrigerator 
and I didn't even know what a refrigerator was 
and then I started to get not scared but I thought 
 something's wrong with me 
 because I'm talking 
 I'm talking very clear and everything 
but I didn't know anything that was going on 
uh in my mind I did but I couldn't get them out 
so  um he looked at me and uh he says 
 what's wrong with you 
I says 
 I don't know 
 something's wrong with me 
so  I have a daughter who lives in uh Vernon 
and uh I said to him I says 
 call 
and he looked 
I said 
 call s you know you know who 
so  uh I couldn't get her name out 
so  he called her 
he realized what I was trying to get 
so  I got her on 
and I told her 
I says 
 there is something wrong with me 
 whadya 
 he's  I don't know 
 I know who you are but I don't  I can't get your name out 
so  she says 
 there's nothing wrong with you  mom 
 it's hot and we told you 
 don't work in the garden 
I says 
 there is something else wrong with me 
so  then all_of_a_sudden her name came 
because it's going through my mind 
and I says 
 Donna there is something wrong 
and I started to cry 
so  she says 
 mom stay on the phone 
then she got her other phone and she called the doctor 
and the doctor said 
 get her up to the hospital 
so  they took me up to the hospital 
she called her husband who worked down this end 
and um he came and my son took me to the emergency room 
and I was there for oh I guess  about oh twelve hours thirteen hours 
and they didn't know what was wrong with me 
because every question they asked me I said right off correct 
um everything 
and uh count backwards imit
went right back 
and uh we were you_know talking and I was walking around 
and I hadta go to the bathroom 
and I knew where the bathroom was  laughs in the hospital 
and I went there 
and uh we came out and we were talking and talking 
and um the one doctor said 
 we're not sure what is wrong with you 
 everything seems to be fine 
 everything is connecting with you 
so  uh meantime I didn't realize that I didn't know the names of my  ho all my other family 
so  they  um they just kept me there 
and all_of_a_sudden one doctor says 
 well  you've got a choice 
 you can either 
it was on a weekend which is a bad time 
Februa  uh Fridays 
and sh he says um 
 you have a choice 
 you can either can go home for the weekend and come back Monday 
 or you can stay over the weekend 
now when somebody doesn't feel sick and thinks they're doing everything they're not gonna say 
 oh  I'll stay at the hospital  laughs 
especially on a weekend  laughs 
so  we went home 
so  my  my son inlaw took me home to her 
and I was there for the weekend 
and um they had gone away for uh the weekend 
not the  the whole weekend just over  overnight that one night 
because originally I was sposta babysit for them anyway 
so  uh just by luck my daughter said to her husband 
 bring your father up too 
 I don't think mom should be by herself 
so  because I had ges
so  um the father came up 
and it was a good thing he did because I started to fall apart 
I cried snaps
and I just wouldn't stop crying 
and then all_of_a_sudden I'd sleep 
I'd sleep for hours 
and I didn't realize it 
and then uh we went the weekend we went to the doctors and uh 
 well  she seems to be fine 
 she's talking she's doing this and she's doing that 
and I said 
 but there is something going on with my head 
I says 
 something's wrong there 
so  I  arra I went home 
I was head
and about a week later uh they  s my doctors uh sent a neurologist to me 
and when he got done talking with me and everything and he looked at me he says 
 you had a stroke 
he says 
 it wasn't a big one but he says 
 you had a stroke 
so  that's how I knew I had a stroke laughs 
it was really really weird 
but uh I  I forgot so many things 
like in the morning every morning after I got my breakfast ready I always brought the newspaper out and I read the newspaper 
and head
I looked at it and I couldn't get the words 
I  cou I knew what they were but I could not say any of those words 
and I  t what I did get to read I didn't understand 
so  I tried for a couple of days and like 
 the  the heck with this 
 I just won't read anymore 
after a couple more days I'm sitting there and I thought 
 you are gonna learn to read that paper 
I started reading it 
now I read a paper 
and it didn't take me long but I worked hard at it 
and every morning when I got up after I you_know into the bathroom and everything I'd go back in bed and I'd lay there 
and I'd think of my daughter's family 
there's four people in the family 
there's two boys her husband and herself 
I knew her name but I couldn't get his name out and the two boys 
and I would just close my eyes and visualize it 
and gradually all_of_a_sudden I'd see their names 
and gradually it would come 
then I went with my oldest son with his family 
it was tiring 
and I did that at night too when I went to bed before I went to sleep 
I worked with one family at a time and then my sisters and my brother were in all that 
and it was a long time but it  it worked 
it really really worked 
and I said to my daughter one day I says 
 you_know  I don't know what the heck else is wrong with me 
I says 
 I am so tired 
and I says 
 I don't do anything 
she says 
 Mom  you are doing a whole lot 
I says 
 such as what 
I says 
 all I'm do 
 well  that's it 
she says 
 you are thinking constantly and you're exhausting yourself and you don't realize it 
but um it all came 
it's just now I  I have trouble every once in awhile to get my words out 
and that and when I write 
it's getting better 
sometimes when I write ges
and all_of_a_sudden I look at it and I thought 
 no  that's not that word  laughs 
and the first time I saw that was when I made my first  uh when I was going to the store 
my little shopping thing 
I needed uh mayonnaise 
laughs so  laughs  I'm writing and writing 
I get to the store and I came to that word 
I couldn't figure out what it was 
the  head
and I couldn't remember what it was 
and by the time I got done shopping I would keep going back at it and back 
 now I hafta think 
 what was I gonna do with this 
then I knew what it was 
it would come 
I'd forget it again but then in it  but that's the way it goes 
I know everything but um I still hafta  I forget a_lot_of things 
but everybody says 
 oh  I forget too 
 I'm always forgetting 
you_know  and it's fine because I  I laugh about it 
because when I'm with my friends and out I see people having trouble 
they can't remember 
 I know what I wanna say but I can't say it 
and there's nothing wrong with them 
so  I think 
 well  maybe you're not that bad laughs 
but um I have had so much pleasure here and learning 
and um so many people 
 I don't know what you still go to there 
I says 
 I'll go there until I'm finished 
and I says 
 points
I said 
 when I'm finished 
and I said 
 I know I'm not going to be a hundred percent 
but I says 
 I am still learning 
and I says 
 I  watch everybody here 
and I says 
 I have seen so many improvements 
and I says 
 it's wonderful 
and I says 
 I'm just so fortunate that I'm not had the problem that most of them here have 
nods yes  it has really helped 
still helps laughs  yeah 
it is 
for each one 
alright  the story is about a boy um playing soccer 
and he breaks a window  in a house 
and then points
and the soccer ball coming through the window to hit him 
and then he gets up and um he's looking out the window holding the soccer ball 
and uh  that's about what he has for the whole story 
but um  it more or less is a lesson for him that you don't do that kind of ball playing so close to buildings to houses 
and um 
well  there's one thing that I have been always happy about what happened to me 
like um the fortunate stroke that I had that wasn't too bad was  um it was in nineteen seventy five  I had cancer 
and I had uh a mas um okay masectomy 
and um I came through it very well 
and there was a_lot that was in there 
but um I got it through finally 
so  that's what about thirty some odd years already 
and uh I'm very proud of that 
and I was the first one in the family to have cancer 
and then all_of_a_sudden other members of my family 
immediate you_know my living home family 
um they have come down with it 
and they're gone 
and uh I have always been very thankful that I came through the way I did 
and the doctors were amazed because it was so fast that I  I healed and everything 
I didn't go home the way a_lot_of people who have masectomies 
and at that time it was about five years later when they started to come out with the um 
how do you call it 
um they made um 
the word is right there I can even see it 
um where they just do a sighs 
laughs 
come_on brain move 
um  oh   I am really stuck 
and my happy happy things were my children when they were born 
and um I had two boys and a girl 
and um they're great kids 
and I have finally got two great grandchildren this year 
 two at one time 
I didn't think I was ever gonna have another one  have one laughs but I got two at  two great grandchildren 
 boys 
this is a story about um 
the weather apparently is gonna be rain

and he's covered up 
well   this is a picture of a cat that went up in to a tree and apparently 
well  cats usually jump down 
but it's up there and it wouldn't get down 
and points
points
and then all_of_a_sudden decided he was gonna up the tree to find  to get the cat down 
in the meantime the dog is barking up the tree 
and points
so  what they did they went and called points
and points
and they um points
and points
okay 
 well   this apparently is during a flood 
and during that flood points
and it was very very uh strong 
the current was very very strong 
and she apparently couldn't get  her out  herself out 
and somebody must have seen her or knew that she was having a problem 
and they called the ai uh emergency group 
and points
and he's hanging on for dear life 
and wants to help her 
and it doesn't show that he did successfully but apparently I think  he did 
mhm 
if I can remember all of it laughs 
 I said if I can remember all of it 
I_mean  this  I don't know what this is all about 
it  apparently this girl's father remarried 
this is how I'm reading it 
and um his new wife had two girls 
and um so it made three girls in the family now 
um they weren't very nice 
they didn't like Cinderella 
and um they always made her do uh a_lot_of work around the house cleaning up and doing stuff like that 
and um the other two they would go to parties and  and uh be with friends and everything 
and then uh all_of_a_sudden one day the mother got a letter and  uh from the  um  the prince's sh  it's not a house   the uh  palace 
and they were invited to go to the ball that he was having 
and uh they told her that she couldn't go to that ball 
so  they were getting all dressed up and everything 
and um first she thought she was gonna go 
and then they said no that the  sh she couldn't go 
so  um they got all dressed and uh ready to go 
and then clears
and these little mice were friends of hers 
I think they were mice laughs 
and um so she took the dress and she decided that she was gonna go to the ball 
and she got all dressed up and everything 
and um there was uh uh the fairy godmother 
that's the one who said about the uh dress 
and uh clears
and the horses will be the mice  I think it was 
so  um she did that 
she got all dressed 
she went to the ball 
and the prince saw her and liked her very much 
she was  she looked beautiful and everything 
and um the  she knows  she knew that if she didn't get back by noon  uh twelve o'clock um everyth ges
so  all_of_a_sudden the uh clock rang for uh twelve 
and she realized she's gotta run 
and as she was running down the steps she lost her one shoe 
and it was the good  the pretty shoe that she had on 
and um she got home 
and then all_of_a_sudden uh the prince was trying to find somebody who fits that shoe 
and um they came to her house 
and uh the two stepsisters they thought 
 well  there's no sense in her looking at  uh trying because it's not her 
so  they tried and they tried so hard to squeeze their feet into this little shoe 
and it didn't work 
and it turned out that uh Cinderella was the last one left to try it 
and um they teased her and everything you know that it's no use of doing it 
but she did and it fit perfect 
and um it end up that they fell in love 
and um they got married and lived happily ever after laughs
