okay 
uh it's fine 
it's much better than I was 
you_know  I can speak 
before I did not 
no head
no  not for two or three years 
I have a good speech therapist 
uh her name is Jeanie_Lastname 
my first stroke 
I've had two strokes didn't  one on each side 
w um the first stroke 
when did you have that one 
um on  in  ninety four  I think wait wait no  two thousand four 
and um I forgot family friends um husband  everybody 
I could  I couldn't remember anybody 
I didn't know how to drive 
I started hitting cars because I thought  I didn't know where I was going 
I didn't even know how to start a car 
and  maybe like  three years then I was able to start driving 
and then um  my speech got better 
I still have  I have some difficulties still um with  w um with numbers   you_know 
um but I can speak a_lot better than I useta be  than I was 
um  well  probably in the last year it's gotten much better  when I started at the aphasia 
before I was very you_know unsure  not confident 
um  but you_know when I speak to people everybody talks to me I talk to them 
and you get a nice rapport with them and you feel better 
oh  um I speak English 
I useta speak Spanish 
no  head
um when I had my  my first stroke  I forgot all the Spanish because I needed to concentrate on the English 
so  it just went ges
um  I do a little Spanish now but it's head
you_know  I do try but sometimes it just doesn't come out proper 
if I'm upset or something  I start  you_know the words don't come out 
I just get more flustered 
um  what else 
I think the saddest day was probably when my father passed away 
and that day I had gotten a raise from my job 
and I was so depressed 
six months later I had my stroke 
and  nobody really knows what happened 
because now I'm heavy touches
before I was very slim 
and  before I was  you_know I was very happy w 
I was  I would always be with my dad  and my mom but they're divorced 
but he was you_know the light of my life 
and so when he passed away I just couldn't take 
it it was just too much for me 
and then I had my first stroke 
and I  then I would start thinking you_know 
 I wish you were here because you woulda 
now I can't because he's not here 
and I couldn't continue  working 
you_know  because uh what I useta  I useta work  at a legal office 
and I useta hafta um read um  land leases or sell sites 
and ges
and I just couldn't read them especially when I had my first stroke 
I  like I said I couldn't even read 
I still have trouble reading 
so  it was just  it was probably the worst times of my life 
the happiest time is probably  when my husband bought me a dog a service dog 
and he is the light of my life laughs 
he is great 
I love him 
he takes care of me and I take care of him 
he's a big German_Shepherd 
and  he's just mine

okay 
um I think there was a stepmother  and two sisters 
and I can't recall if there was also a third sister 
but  the one that  that were  m
they didn't look good 
the two girls 
however   th I don't know if it was a maid or a sister or a stepsister because they don't look the same 
um she was much prettier 
and she went 
 and she hadta clean up everything for them 
 um take  you_know  handle the  um  the trash the garbage the  ch the  the  the animals 
and one day I think  she was kind_of down 
and she wanted to go to a ball 
lo_and_behold though the step  the stepmother  and the two sisters  were going to the ball 
and she was just  you_know she wanted to you_know do something 
she was bored 
and so she was able  to get a  b a dress 
and she also got 
um there was a woman ad an ol older woman 
she  d she points
and so_that she can  look like the belle of the ball 
and then she got it was not a pumpkin it's just  just  it looks like a pumpkin ges
and she went alone 
and when she went there she met a beautiful young man 
they danced and danced and danced  until twelve o'clock 
twelve o'clock  you've got to come home 
so as she was  she wanted to speak with the guy  but she was running late 
she hadta hurry up 
so  as she was running to  the coach  her shoe fell off 
and then h he  he wanted to find where that shoe was so_that she 
so  there was a guy there that was showing all of the shoes  to the sisters  and the maid 
and  they did not fit  until she tried it 
and then  raises
and then  they 
and that was happily ever after 
that's as much as I can remember laughs
