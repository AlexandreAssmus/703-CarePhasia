and I think probably eighty percent by a_lot  lots better 
uh and I think it's very  f uh it's very uh from the  from the day 
very good in the morning 
very wait 
and I think that's probably head
I think in this area in the  in the group of the students I speak very well 
um  very well 
but when I go home whenever I uh my husband head
I'm less good with my husband talking 
um nods I think it's less 
so  it just depends on  on h how you go 
like everybody 
y uh sort_of 
um not really well 
but I remember head
 I was coming from Baltimore 
uh my brother 
and the charming charming house 
and I had decorated all 
had uh I quipped 
I had from  from my work I had  uh I think  one week I had quipped 
uh I had termed 
sighs and I felt so free 
and on the way home I had a car I  wreck 
and I never head
s n th that's five years 
my brother 
hm
sighs I  I think that the only thing that I have done well 
uh hand
you_know  it really doesn't count very much 
but we'll start with my second year 
um at the time I thought I was very clear on everything 
and I guess I was not 
according to the  um the  uh ges the masons  s
I  I  I was  thought I was clear but I wasn't 
I was bla
well  that's mortifying to think about 
that I wasn't clear 
but I  I guess I wasn't head
I  n I don't know shrugs uh if I was or if I wasn't 
um  I think uh the  the  the only thing to describe me is a little bit  ges
and um it's been head
five years 
head
mhm 
I think that's a_lot_of time

uh I will talk about the third grade 
the third grade I was  was very interesting that you wouldn't think that this would work 
we uh moved to s Seaford 
um head
we did not move to Seaford yet 
we were in Richmond 
Richmond first and then s Seaford 
and in Richmond um the school that we were in was of the school  of the  of the uh private school 
points
and so the  because we had no uh uh  school we had our school in our  in our church 
and that  that was very interesting as a  com uh as a combination 
and it was learning the very best way 
um you  you met the teacher 
she met you 
you learned everything about xxx students 
you liked them all 
you liked everything about school  really really well 
and I think that in terms of school  in firms 
uh because it just  it didn't have any bad times 
it didn't have any bad ikleɪʒənzu 
it  uh it was just clear 
it was clear 
it was  fresh and niːu 
and  and  and that was so good for us 
and then the nɛtʃu 
it was built 
and  and it was all v very very fair 
and now if you go back you  c you can't believe it 
because now it looks rather 
I_mean  it's  uns it's s so much t to word 
it's how much it r 
it's shocking 
but then it was new 
it was very new 
and it was great 
then we moved when I was six and it's gone
