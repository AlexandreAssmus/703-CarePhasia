okay 
 well  my wife says sometimes when I get a_little upset I talk too loud 
but uh 
 then she says rest the time I mumble 
so  you_know uh laughs 
 yes  it was in uh  March of uh  two thousand and  seven I guess  three years ago 
 or eight I 
head
uh  I was uh at the breakfast table 
 and uh ges
and I said 
 ges
 and I called my wife 
and she said 
 yeah I'm gonna call nineoneone 
so  they immediately took me to the Restin_General Hospital enrolled me and  and 
head
ges
I'm thinking about the uh  uh t_i_a 
 I went in to have hip joint replacement surgery 
 and I was a healthy 
I just had points
so  I went to have that replaced 
and uh the following  the surgery went fine 
following morning they got me up for the first time to  to walk 
and when I got up I collapsed ges  suddenly 
 and they did the usual m_r_is and the cat 
and uh  they would ask me the battery of questions 
and I had difficulties knowing when I was born what year I was born uh  etcetera 
uh
I had head
 never did 
uh lips_smack by the time I
 I could listen to the news  and understand what I was hearing 
ges but when I got the paper out which is what I always wanted to do  head
so  I tried to cope with it  by asking my wife grabs
and I started trying to work one line at a time in  in one ges column 
 that was difficult 
but when I f felt I ges could repeat that and say it then I would try to get  head
 maybe one  sent  one sentence 
and it was difficult 
but  ges
and after several days I got to where I could maybe  read and comprehend a short paragraph 
now by this time my hip joint had recovered enough that I could go down  mobilize myself to go downstairs where my computer was 
and I said 
 oh  good 
 I can get to my computer now 
 so  I got downstairs sat down at my computer  and sighs  I hadta call my wife 
 how do I turn it on 
she showed me 
and it came up 
and I said 
 now what do I do 
 and I said 
 oh  sighs 
 and I got something in front of me 
I said 
 I wanna send an email to my  some of my friends 
head
and said 
 ges
but it took me awhile to get that 
and I had ges jumbled head
and I even saved it  because it ges was very jumbled 
ges
and that one after I had it read it off and looked at it after ges it was very jumbled 
head
and uh so that's when I heard about the Stroke_Comeback_Center from uh the traveling nurse that came by to attend me 
head
and she said 
 you'd be a very good candidate for your  our class 
and I said 
 ges well sign me up 
and so uh uh I  I came here and was uh starting on a once a week schedule 
 and I felt  it was a very good experience because I started making  progress 
and what I  fel I've always said about with FirstnameM and p the center as a general is they seem to have a very good k way of knowing how to give me a bit of a challenge  but not over  not overwhelming me to where I would refuse to do it 
so  if it was points
head
and it was a goal to try to get it without having any mistakes and ges
ges and this sorta 
so  it was a ges
and then she  s  she said  um FirstnameM said 
 you might be a very candidate to enroll in our  one of our online penpal classes that we have with aphasia students  points at Oklahoma_City_University or  one of the Oklahoma universities  
so  I  b I became a penpal with one of the aphasia students 
and after ges
I decided I would start to write a   maybe a little journal  of my experiences from the day  as I recalled it from the day  I had my first uh stroke and  and ges to the recovery period 
and I ended up sighs doing that in about nine or ten weeks because that corresponded with the end of her semester 
and I ended up labelling it as Firstname's aphasia journal 
and uh I would s ges write a   a little section each week 
ges and then she would kind_of react  respond back to me 
but I would  I would ges build on it and finally ended that up 
and she turned it in as her   as her theme  p her project for the   for the  seme for the semester 
and hadta give a presentation on   on this interaction 
so  ges all that  all that really was a helpful process of dealing with this 
head
but a I think I forgot to mention about six weeks after the stroke I was sitting at the kitchen table and got dizzy again 
and that's when xxx sent me in and dɑɪəgmostu 
but they went ahead and sent me to John_Hopkins points uh Stroke_Rehabilitation_Center 
and I became a patient there subject and uh worked with them 
and uh  they diagnosed that I had had ges a previously undisclosed  uh ges flap on my heart 
 that uh  is congenital 
but that is ges probably why I caught the clot 
and xxx 
head
but that's  uh  uh yeah I participated in that 
and uh sighs  part of my therapy building along was  after going through wr writing my  ges weekly Firstname's journal I met with a couple of retired army officers who contacted me that said they were  the y US Department_of_Agriculture was wanting to write a  uh  a history of nutrition research that had been performed by the military after the  Department_of_Agriculture became involved 
and they said 
 Firstname I understand you understand what happened 
I said 
 oh  yeah 
 I was  involved in that when they closed the program down and had it rebuilt 
 and I  have kept all of the old files 
 and he said 
 well  you oughta write that up 
 and so I started another project to  uh uh still working on it writing a history of nutrition research performed by the military from the seventeen thirties to the present day 
you_know and I  I  I  and I'm  s  you_know I'm still working at that 
and uh  I continue to uh come here to  the Center once or twice a  a week and  uh because I have a buddy 
name is FirstnameK 
and uh she was  uh p ges had had a stroke not too long before I did 
and we were here in the first class together 
and she's   she's about forty  I think 
but we kind_of  we're buddies 
 and uh I feel like  maybe I can contribute to her recovery 
 at the same time ges interacting and working with other folks 
so  it uh 
 yes  yep head
I would think it's 
okay 
head
surely 
I will use one that I actually used in my uh  penpal stories 
one of the things that came was I   I was a farm boy growing up in Missouri 
and uh  I had a grandmother which I thought very much of 
and uh she had  was a single lady by this time 
her f husband had passed away 
my grandfather passed away 
but I was out uh getting starting in college or no  head
and dad uh  decided that I should uh  maybe buy a or  I'd decided I wanted to buy a   a uh p Hereford heifer to start a  b a
I had my Four_h  uh FFA activities 
I told my grandma about it 
and she said 
 well  I'd like to  I need one 
 I'd like to have a heifer too to come on our little pasture 
to keep the weeds down out on her place 
so  I went together and dad and I 
and we purchased  two heifers  Susie and Stella 
well  I took  Susie 
and we stayed on  at my dad's place 
and Stella was at my  gr my  gr my grandma's place 
the  uh  uh  but on one occasion   we brought them back home in the winter time 
we bring them all back to the  points to the  to the barn to where the  you_know to get them off the pastures were already gone up and to uh give them hay 
inhales well sighs  I was going out one day down to bring  try to get the cattle to come up including Susie and Stella to get them up to the barn 
and they were running around head
and I got aggravated xxx I decided I'd throw a rock at one of them to get them to go back 
well  I ended up ges
and I picked up this ges boulder and gave it a heave ges
unfortunately it ran headlong points
knocked the thing flat on its ges
so  I was scared as the dickens 
I ran up to dad 
 help me come 
dad came down the barn immediately and got his old dull pocket knife out ges
thought maybe he'd be able to  uh figured it was probably dying but at_least wanted to preserve the meat to let it bleed it out 
well  the ges
 imit
laughs Stella b blared laughs and belted 
and so it wasn't dead it was just knocked out 
so  uh that taught me a lesson not to be throwing rocks and st 
Stella became fine xxx head
head
 laughs 
but that   I used that as part of a short story about a little uh  writing cla 
 head
well  this young boy is playing soccer 
and he's just kicked the ball up in the air and uhoh 
it just hit the window in the house and I guess  broke in the window 
it not only went th
and then dad is  uh picks up the soccer ball and looks out the window and figured out  trying to find out where did that come from 
sure 
 well  the  sighs 
let's see 
the young boy is uh with a mother 
mother's got an umbrella 
he's  seemingly reaching for the umbrella 
the next panel  looks like uh mother's trying to encourage the boy to take the umbrella and go outside 
but the boy apparently decided to go outside without the umbrella 
and now it's raining 
and now it's starting to pour down rain 
and he's running back to the house 
and now his   his head's all wet 
and his mother looks sort_of upset 
and  he goes back outside but now he's using the  he's wearing the umbrella 
 well  I think we had a problem where  oc  occurred where a cat decided to crawl up into the tree and go out on f small limb on the outside 
it looks like the uh yeah   young girl got upset and had called  her dad probably to  maybe try to get the cat down 
 uh she'd been points
dad had apparently gotten a ladder and had uh started up the tree and got up there but  for some reason it looks like the ladder has fallen down 
the dog is now upset and barking 
dad's stuck in the tree 
and the cat's still there 
well  there seems to be a bird chirping for one unknown reason but enough that somebody decided to call the fire department 
and the fire department with two men are carrying a ladder apparently there to try to rescue to get the ma man down and possibly get the cat out_of the tree 
think that found all of the  characters that were in the 
 scene 
 head
 Walt_Disney's movie 
okay 
look through it 
okay 
 s story is about Cinderella who was a younger sister of  with two older sisters I believe 
and she seemed to be the prettier of the three 
and her mother was um a little bit of a domineering lady 
uh
 and they were all excited becau
well  the  li the older sisters were getting themselves well dressed and 
well  at first it was sure whether younger sister Cinderella was gonna get to go to her nɑɾəu 
but there were some animals around 
and head
but anyhow  they all finally got dressed mother and the three daughters 
and they went to
and sighs there was a handsome prince probably with the  t the son of the  shrugs whoever was a main character th or the head
and there was a number
and apparently Cinderella may have got to dance with  one of the young men 
but somewhere in the process she lost a slipper 
after the ball when they'd all gotten home  I think she must have noticed that she was missing her slipper 
and much to her surprise Prince_Charming came riding up to the house in his carriage and was looking for who  does the slipper  belong to which one of the ladies 
and probably they must have tried it on 
and the two older sisters their   slipper was too small to fit on the feet  of them 
so  he  then Prince_Charming tried it on Cinderella 
and it  slips the uh  s shoe fit perfectly on the slipper  s
and so Cinderella then got to go back with Prince_Charming and go t back to shrugs another ball or something 
that seems to be what 
there's animals ges in this  watching the process but I don't know how they were  s exactly were involved in the story 
but that's what I remember I think  of that story 
okay 
 well  sighs if we were s making  thinking of the process of the last class I had with points FirstnameM in which we were trying to hafta ges work out steps to do things you needta stop and think about it 
well  the first thing you hafta go 
 and if we were having a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would hafta go in the  into the uh refrigerator and pull out the peanut  butter and the bar 
uh I would get out a plate 
put my bread on the plate 
and I would go to the  uh  uh get a knife out_of the uh drawer 
and I would use a knife to spread first the peanut butter on one side of the bread 
then I would uh  use the knife uh to uh spread the jelly on the bread 
and I would close  uh  put the other t piece of bread on the  uh  join it with the others 
now I've got myself a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
and I can take it to the table and eat it
