my speech um I think they're not too bad 
better than it was  uh it was before 
yeah doing very well 
not a hundred percent but you_know good enough  right 
um yes it's been um a little bit more than um three years 
yeah um right  be about a week before my birthday 
yes had my stroke 
um I had been having headaches 
um and I was  I was a teacher working at a school and um working 
and during that day my headache was getting more worse 
and I went to the nurse that day um at school and asked her if I could lay down about lunch time for awhile 
and as we were talking she looked at me funny 
and she said that um 
 are you doing okay 
and I thought I was talking fine 
and I guess my sounds were blurring things like that 
and um she knew that I was having a stroke from that 
and they called five six seven eight  nineoneone 
and um I don't remember 
right after that when they 
I remember being in the  um uh what do you call it  in the 
it's not a car you_know 
it's not a truck 
it's  is being in there laying down you_know 
and the guy was asking all kinds of questions 
but I could not think 
at that point it was getting worse as it goes 
and um they ended up taking me 
and one of the guys who does um brains he found a spot 
w they made it a picture 
they said that you're having  you have a s clot in your brain in the back 
and it's starting to blood 
and it starts to uh take um part of your uh what do you call it  uh like cells in a way that die 
and so he  he ended up giving me surgery at that point and um fixed it pretty much yeah 
so  um I'm still here today 
but the um clot is still here 
it hasn't left 
so  um that's why I'm taking the medicine I am 
but they did figure out why it happened just in case I  t it happened again 
they said I was taking um medicine that um əræktɪdu 
it  um most people don't have trouble with it 
and I had a stroke from that medicine they think 
they're hoping that they 
yeah it's one of those things 
yup 
um I think at the beginning um the first thing they were helping me to stand up um to be able to walk again 
they were more into that at the very beginning than other like um aphasia type stuff 
they wanted to make sure I was able to  to walk again and  because my one side of my um body was starting to have trouble they said 
so  they wanted you start using your hands and your arm and walk around and be able to do all that at the beginning 
they started doing some little task for me 
like um we played cards to see how many cards I can find  looked at some numbers some letters stuff like that 
but we were doing that just here and there feeling 
um I was also very sad very um emotional feeling 
didn't  I couldn't even remember who I was 
and so um getting to work on therapy when you don't know who you are I was more panicked than that kind of stuff 
um once I remembered who I was and found my mom and dad and people that were sitting there for how many year 
so  um said 
 let's go for our therapy now 
 let's start walking around and stuff 
so  once I figured that out and my brain was functioning a little bit um we started working on therapy 
and um they said 
 you have aphasia 
um and my talking I couldn't say pretty much any  I couldn't say anything 
they were saying like 
 do you want something to eat 
I didn't understand what that meant 
so  they'd give me like a cup 
 do you want something to drink 
they'd sh take the cup and show me 
and I'd go yesq or noq 
it took me a  lil even harder to understand that this goes this way if you want it ges
if you don't want it it goes this way ges
took that long to figure that out 
little things like that that I didn't remember 
um then once I was able to at_least think a little bit more we started with um uh pictures like that bird and the  and the boy and the banana 
and uh we start  that was our therapy starting was the fact of being able to say certain words 
and um my first name took about another year to be able to say my last name my kids and everything else 
so  still working on therapy myself 
I have uh a book at home that I still do my homework everyday 
so  still going 
it's  I  I'm  um the only thing I can't do right now yet is read and write 
and I said  but I told myself that I'm going to do it 
so  I'm not done yet when it comes to coming up s you_know 
I'm going to read someday 
and I will write 
and I will have numbers at some point 
so  yeah 
um let's see 
um um let's  let's see 
I  oh one of my um from a long time ago um when I was I don't know  ten fifteen right in there you_know teens in a way um we had  my grandma and grandpa had a lake cottage 
and we  on the weekends you went to the cottage 
and um we wouldn't go every weekend 
but most of the time we did especially with summertime with not schools you_know 
we would um take that time 
and um I think that was one my favorite places to go 
we could um fish 
we could swim 
we could 
and it wasn't very deep 
there was a_lot 
now it was deep in the middle 
but right now  y I_mean you could  didn't really hafta swim 
you could just walk around a little bit 
um there were frogs 
there was um um turtles at 
so  I_mean it was  we got up in the morning 
and I think we ate as fast as we could to be  to go outside 
and I think you're pretty much outside until it's time to go to bed 
and I remember all of those memories on the fact that uh um all the fun things that we were able to do 
like my dad let me 
um we useta have a rowboat that had paddles 
but we also had one that had the um motor in the back 
and it  now you're  you were not allowed to go fast 
it was like two what do you call it  like fi no  five fast 
so  it wasn't very fast 
you could almost swim as fast as you can the  you_know the boat 
but um they let me actually m mow  s
and for me being old enough not to drive I could use that  that paddle boat and stuff like that 
I loved to  r um to drive 
I just thought that was really cool 
I'm not sure why now it was like  it was such a big thing 
but it was you_know 
and I was by myself on the boat you_know 
and I thought I was something else you_know and all that 
we forgot the gas one time 
and we had to row back stuff like that when I was a kid 
but I think that was 
and at night um we had  uh we had like a  uh a place to lay down outside 
and we would um go to bed the whole night outside if it was really pretty 
and I  I think um when I have my  if I have a bad night now I actually dream in my head on that lake cottage 
I still remember that kind of stuff when I have bads 
I think about that place 
I don't know why laughs 
yeah 
um there's uha boy outside that was um hitting the ball around and having fun  I'm sure 
and  um but as he was going by um he hit the ball on the window 
and it broke 
and it actually went in the house with it 
so  the  um that um ball fell into someone else's house 
and I'm sure the guy 
I can't see that he has a picture 
I thought maybe he was watching tv or has something obviously 
but um it even hit the lamp and everything 
and so um he was looking to see you_know what happened 
so  he's looking for the  the kid 
so  we don't know if he took off or if uh he was uh going oops feeling or what 
we don't see him in the picture now 
so  at the end all we know is that the  there's a guy with the ball looking for  to  outside to see what's happening 
yeah 
they should be more of the picture at the end to see what happened 
we don't know what happens this time 
okay 
um in the morning the  l the little boy are 
and mom had looked at the weather and said 
 I think there's a chance for rain 
and said 
 bring your umbrella 
and the boy said 
 no I  I don't need it 
and so mom said 
 are you sure you're gonna do that 
and okay 
and so he said bye mom and went to school started walking 
and here comes the rain 
and it started probably even more rain as it looked 
and so he ran to come home the other way 
and let's see 
so  he went back in the house probably and said 
 uh mom  um you're right 
 there was rain 
and so she said 
 well  go get your b brɛləu 
and so he put it on the brɛləu 
done 
okay 
um there's a cat that um was going up this tree on that bird 
and um I think it was up there and stuck 
and so this little girl was watching and thought 
 oh_my_goodness how do I get it down 
and um there was probably a guy walking by 
and he thought 
 I can help that little girl to get the cat on the tree 
and uh but he got up there 
and now he's stuck too  it looks like 
and um someone saw the guy up there 
and the firetruck called and said 
 we have a guy and a cat stuck in the tree 
and so they um brought the ladder to help the guy and the cat down 
yeah 
okay 
alright 
um so  let's see 
um she  um she 
I think her mom must've died because dad is finding a new  um a very bad lady 
and um now she's here um s stepmom in a way now right and with two girls 
and they come to their really nice place 
and um she hasta um do all the dishes and the laundry and everything 
and the other girls actually they were even doing um um like either singing 
or they do their little um mɛstrəmɛntsu 
they're doing all of that during the day and um having their fun 
and um they found out that there's going to be a  um a ball you_know kind of thing 
and everyone can go and everything 
and um the  so she goes to get a dress 
and um it was new in my head on the fact that  um the  the birds I think and um maybe see others l a little fu friends um helped her to make even brɪɾɪu 
it's one of those things that they lock 
and they got out_of there 
it looks really pretty 
but she's like 
 well  it wasn't a hundred percent 
but it's gonna look pretty 
but then the birds said 
 ooh 
and they um maybe even some of the little mice or something whoever they are you_know were helping to put her  her dress look even better 
and they got it done 
and um she's gonna go too 
and  um but uh she also can't have a ride because they're going  you_know the  uh the mom and the two girls get to go together 
so  she had to find a way to  to go 
and  um and as  as they were leaving they said 
 oh yours  I want this 
I want this and this that you have 
and so that was  um they took all of her beads and everything that was pretty 
and so now she doesn't have ride to get  to be there 
and also her dress was co torn and everything 
and um she found the 
I can't remember what her name is 
um she's like a fairy 
I don't  I don't remember what they call those little guys 
but anyway you_know she's just sitting here and there 
she's there to  s to help you 
and um she said 
 I can help you and to make your um dress beautiful 
and so they get that done 
and all of the little um mice become you_know like guys 
oh and the  um so as one of the  do I think their dog goes and you_know as one of  as one of the guys that doing the um driving and all that 
and um so that  that's how she gets there 
and once gets here I'm sure that they're gonna be like 
 gasps she's there too 
and they won't be very excited about that the fact that she made it here 
and she looks really good 
and so then the  um here is the uh new 
he's not a king yet 
he's a princess 
n no  that's a  that's a guy  that's a girl um not a king 
see  I don't remember whose is whose 
but you_know it's one of the  the  ki the  it's the king's kid in a way  right 
and um he finds her and says 
 ooh you_know she's beautiful 
and so they're dancing and everything 
and then she  she looked at the clock which I  now I forget to tell you 
but you_know she's only allowed  she's only  she is only allowed to be there until midnight 
and so she's kept looking at the clock 
she's good at that 
she's watching 
and um so as they were dancing and everything she thought 
 oops I gotta go 
and so um of_course he probably said 
 can't we just stay longer 
and she said 
 no I gotta go 
so  she's running 
and um I'm sure even the  one of the guys who worked there even had uh a question 
and she  I think she said 
 I got to go 
and um so as she went one of her shoes fall 
and um she gets all the way home 
and of_course you see the pumpkin is back down to what it is for you_know back 
and there's the dog and everybody's sitting there 
and I'm sure she's thinking 
 that was the most beautiful day I've ever had you_know 
and um I don't know if she's even a know she ever see her  ag him again 
but at least she had a real beautiful day  night you_know 
and then  um but there's  um there's a guy coming back t at all the houses I think you_know to see where that  um that shoe came from 
and I think that the mom  that new mom said 
 uhoh I think it was her 
which they probably knew it was her at the beginning you_know because she looked way too good 
and so they locked her in the like  in her room or in the palace or who knows she is 
I don't know 
it's always bad over there you_know that 
she's  they stuck her in there 
and um but here comes the one little uh mice that got the key to let her in  t to get outta there 
and so when she got in there they said 
 um you_know of_course it wasn't the two girls because she had big feet 
and  um and she doesn't look good 
so  you_know um I think maybe the guy was even leaving at that point 
and then there she is 
she said 
 well  can I try 
and so she sits down 
and it fit 
and so  um so she  uh she made it 
and so they put her  you_know took her back over to the  the castle 
and they get a marry 
and um what is it called  um happy whatever you call it 
it's on my cup 
I wish I could read it because I  it's always the thing at the end you_know 
allq afterq you_know kinda thing  right 
yeah 
um oh um for um sandwich you said that has um 
if you want a butter sandwich um you need the bread  br bread  right 
two slices of bread 
and you need um let's see cu um what's the word  um peanut butter and a knife and um jelly of some fashion 
whatever you  wa whatever kind ya like laughs 
and let's see 
I think the first thing you wanna do is um put the um peanut butter on part of the bread and  and um um spread it around 
there ya go 
and then whatever kind of uh stuff you want with it you can put that together and smooth it around 
and then put the bread t um together ges
and if your 
what is they call that stuff 
you_know you always have that bread around it that the kids won't eat 
they don't like that part 
so  I hafta take that off too 
they don't like that cart 
what's it  what is  I can't remember what that's called 
not the heel 
if it's the last one it's a heel 
they won't eat any of that 
but the one that has that 
what is that part 
do you know 
I don't remember what kind that's  what part of it is 
it's the one the  the  s the  um that part of the bread 
oh thank_you 
I was gonna say it's that part all the way around 
and uh my kids always want also sh tʃɛu 
so  you want  you have one two three and four of them like this 
my other kids  so  I have one kid that'll go this side and this side to make the squares 
the other kid wants to go this way

you cannot do all of them at the same time 
that doesn't happen your house 
not when you have that many kids 
and one of them won't even eat them INV
one of the best lunches
