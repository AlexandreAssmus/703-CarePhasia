um I can be confused a couple of times 
uh sometimes I get the wrong words 
um it might just because they are similar to what I am trying to say 
uh su sometimes it's like I have to go through a Rolodex to get the right word that I'm trying to say 
um I do have problems on  sometimes on the relationship between words 
like I know that I'm wanna talk about a female relative 
and I might say the wrong one 
like I might call my sister xxx my wife or my daughter my mother 
stuff like that 
um but um I do have problems with um numbers too 
um I know if I'm talking to somebody on the telephone if somebody wants to give me their phone number it takes me two or three times to get the correct number uh even how many times she hasta uh repell 
so  and just like that I  I said repealq instead_of repeatq 
that  that's some of the things that I have problems with 
but other_than that I_mean if people understand that I do have a difficulty and they speak slow  slowly I usually can get through it 
uh I don't know about it actually 
um laughs I was sposta be having um a physical uh s therapy at home 
um and that morning my wife said that I had been talking kind_of crazy she said 
um I wasn't making sense 
and later that morning the physical therapist came 
and he had all  all the  um uh he had all the equipment 
and he took my  um he took my uh vitals 
and he said that I should go to the emergency room 
and that's  that's  th that I remember 
I didn't remember 
so  my uh brother and my wife took me to the emergency room 
and luckily at the hospital that um I went to has a good uh stroke um thing 
so  they took me right in there 
they took a  even in the emergency room they had uh a c_k 
so  so  that's about what I remember 
well  when I  when they took me back to the um uh hospital room there um I saw like five different doctors 
and they all did the same type of stuff 
so  I could probably you_know do the  the what a doctor would see to check about a  about a stroke 
but I remember um I had um some memory loss 
like uh by that evening my brother and his wife came over to visit 
and although I've know my brother's wife for you_know thirty five forty years I could not remember her name 
like one  I said 
 who is that 
you_know stuff like that 
but it  by the time I was um discharged three days later I was back to pretty normal with the  knowing that I did have some um apha 
I didn't know at the time that it was aphasia 
but I  I knew the symptoms that I uh pro pro pro protest 
but that  that's all I remember 
uh w well with the  I didn't have any physical problems with the streak 
uh so when I did get  uh well  at the hospital they brought a speech therapist 
uh they didn't know how long I would be at the hospital 
as it turned out the day after she came to evaluate me I was discharged 
so  uh I had hoped  I  I knew I had problem speeching  p
so  I had asked if I could um forgo my physical therapy because I was doing well 
I  I was walking and all that 
but they said that 
 no you have to finish your physical uh therapy before you can start the speech uh therapy 
so  I  I had uh home speech therapy 
um it was very good 
I  I  the  the therapist was very good 
and she was actually the one that 
uh after they let me have I think it's a Medicare type thing that you can use uh ten sessions 
after that she was the one that mentioned that I should go to the uh speech clinic at Buffalo State in uh New York 
and uh a_lot_of that was uh to get my memory back 
uh a_lot_of the things were I guess pretty typical things where I had to tell stories 
uh uh i it's hard to explain how it took 
uh I also had a couple of sessions where I went to a neurologist 
and after a couple of um sessions with the neurologist he said you_know there's pretty much nothing else that he can do about it 
but if I had any other problems um um you_know they could call me 
um one of the things they did  uh they did probably one of those uh cognitive uh test 
I  I did them 
and I did okay I guess 
uh probably sound uh like the stuff that they  they said that uh President Trump uh aced you_know 
I had some problems with it 
but uh laughs I had brain damage 
so  I guess I had uh a reason 
but uh that's about it 
um well  uh probably one of the  the  the nicest things that I have recently was uh my daughter uh on this  uh this Mother's Day she stopped over with the card for my wife 
and she had a card in there that said that she and her husband were pregnant 
so  on father 
and then on Father's Day we went over to her house with uh my oh son inlaw's parents 
and they did a uh review 
so  they had a uh car 
and we saw that we're going to have a grandson 
so that  that is probably one of the um um  you_know that period between there has been exciting for us 
okay 
the young boy is kicking his soccer ball which hits the uh clears_throat window 
the ball breaks the window and startles the uh man who grabs the  uh grabs the ball and looks out the window to see what's going on 
okay 
it looks like the mother was taking the son to school 
and he wanted to take or  uh she wanted him to take an umbrella 
but he did not do that 
he started to walk back to school 
and the rain started to come 
so  he ran back 
and the mother was a_little angry because he had not pulled it or  he had not put the uh umbrella with him 
so  he went back  put the umbrella on and walked back to school 
okay 
well  it looks like the cat was stuck in the uh tree 
and the man had tried to get to 
but he was not able to do that 
so  the firemen came to  um to help him 
I don't know if they're there to get the cat or the  fa or get the man 
and the cat 
okay uh the story starts when uh a woman 
so  cirren Cinderella goes to the  step the man or  the bad stepmother 
and the two children the  the  the stepmother's daughters were bad 
well  they aren't bad 
but they make Cinderella do all of the uh work around the house 
uh and Cinderella has a bunch of little critters that are friends with her 
and apparently they can talk with her 
uh and then at after awhile  after several years it looks like after the  Cinderella got uh a_little older there was a  um a invitation to go to the um ball for the two stepsisters but nothing for uh Cinderella 
but then uh Cinderella's uh godfather 
and a  she turns the animals into uh people that work for the uh stage not the stage  the coach 
um so  they go to the uh ball where Cinderella meets the prince 
but because_of the  um the godmother only could do the spell until midnight um everything turned back to normal where uh her gown was gone 
and the coach were  m
and the animals were back 
but then there was a man that worked for the princess 
um at the end uh they  they put the glass slip slipper on Cinderitta 
and um it fit per perfectly 
and they found that that was the uh woman that the prince was looking for 
and they went happy  they went happy to the  to the end 
and that's about it 
oh okay 
uh I would open up the bag of the bread 
uh put a piece of  of  slice of bread 
I would push 
get a little bit of the jelly and spread that around 
and then put the second uh top of the slice of bread 
and I guess that's it
