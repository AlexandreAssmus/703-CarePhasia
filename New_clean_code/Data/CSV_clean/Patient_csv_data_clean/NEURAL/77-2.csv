I think it is pretty good 
I think I do very well 
I had my stroke at night probably when I was sleeping 
I think I became aware of my stroke at the breakfast table 
my husband asked me some questions 
and I couldn't answer him right 
I went to a rehab center for one week 
and then I had a speech therapist 
and I am almost done with her 
I think my last meeting will be next week with her 
I am s trying to be a person who uses Arc which is a Aphasia Recovery Connection 
and they have conversation segments 
and I generally sign up for those 
that's kind_of one thing I do to help me 
uh uh um a story about me 
um mm I  I f having trouble making a story 
um the  I  I'm not sure how to make a story 
okay 
I  I can tell you about our trip to China 
it was a land and tour  sea tour trip 
we took an airplane from Singapore 
and we flew to other hotels 
the airplane flew to Tibet 
and we got to see many beautiful temples 
and the people were walking around the temple 
and it was very beautiful 
and I enjoyed going inside the temple 
they had a very big Buddha there who was made all of gold 
and it was an immense amount of gold 
the people burned oil in the temple 
and we had to inhale the smoke 
the  visiting the temple was very beautiful 
we saw the people doing exercises 
um or not exercises 
they were praying 
and they prayed by moving their bodies up and down 
so  I enjoyed watching them 
then we walked along the street 
and we went to various vendors 
and we purchased a silver Buddha and a singing bowl 
and that was rary 
then we went to eyenother 
and it was so tall 
the height of the place was very tall fourteen thousand feet 
and I had altitude sickness 
and I had to have oxygen 
and the mpee doctor gave me oxygen at night and the next day 
so  I was glad to leave Tibet after that time 
then I took a boat on the Yangtzi river 
and it was very beautiful 
the boat stopped at different cities along the way 
and we saw many bridges that went across the river 
and I thought that it was interesting 
it looks like a young boy is practicing his kicking 
and he is kicking the soccer ball 
and an the soccer ball hits a window 
and it is broken 
and he knocks over a lamp and startles the man who is sitting in the chair 
and the man in the chair gets up 
and he picks up the ball 
and he looks out the window at the boy uh maybe wondering where the soccer ball came from 
the mother is trying to get the young boy to accept the umbrella when he's going to go out 
but the young boy says no 
he doesn't need the umbrella 
and he will do without it 
but he gets out 
and he finds that it is raining on him 
and he gets very wet and decides that that is not a good thing 
so  he comes back 
and he sh talks to his mother 
and he is very unhappy because he is very wet 
so  the mother gives him an umbrella 
and he goes back out into the rain 
but now he has the umbrella to protect him 
and he can walk in the rain just fine 
a picture of a man who went up the tree to rescue the kitty 
and in the process he got stuck up on the tree 
and they had to call the fire department to get him down and to rescue him 
and the girl is crying about the kitty 
and the dog is barking 
it seems as_though the ladder fell out away from the man 
and that's how he got stuck in the tree 
the story of Cinderella begins when 
and he is introducing Cinderella to his 
they are uh introduced 
and the life goes on 
and the father passes away 
and the stepmother and the stepdaughters are very mean to Cinderella 
they treat her very badly and have her cleaning out the fireplaces which is how she got her name Cinderella 
and so she also has to clean out the stables 
but along this time comes a announcement from the castle 
and the ma manager speaks an announcement that there is going to be a great ball because they want the prince to find a consort or a wife 
so the princess  so  Cinderella makes her dr a dress 
she finds a book and makes a pretty dress with bows and sashes 
and it is very pretty pink and white 
but the sepsisters 
and they hurt the dress 
they tore off the sashes and the bows 
and the stepmother looked on and allowed this to happen 
so  then they went off 
and they were going to the ball 
but the m princesses no  the magic lady um came along 
and she was a good fairy 
and she made a beautiful dress for Cinderella 
and she made the pumpkin turn into a beautiful coach and the dog into a concert  uh some kind of person to help with the coat 
and then the mice were turned into magical horses 
so  then Cinderella went off to the ball 
and she had a wonderful time 
and the prince thought she was very beautiful and had nice dances with her 
and the stepmother and stepsisters were jealous 
and so they were whispering and talking 
and the princess no  Cinderella went uh outside into the garden 
and she noticed that the time was getting close to midnight 
and she knew that she had to hurry back because everything would turn back at midnight into its natural form 
so  she quick got into the carriage and went home 
and she just about made it 
and all_of_a_sudden the pumpkin returned its way 
and they  um uh the pumpkin returned to its natural form 
and the mice turned into horses 
and the  and so then they me man in the castle made an announcement because she left a glass slipper on the stairway when she ran away 
and they were going to try and find the person who fit the glass slipper 
so  the manager person came around 
and they locked Cinderella  the stepmother and stepsisters locked Cinderella in the room 
but she had the help of the mice 
and they helped slip the key out 
and she was able to come out 
and she fit the glass slipper exactly perfect 
and so then the um Cinderella and the prince got together 
and they got married and lived happily ever after 
I would have two pieces of bread 
and on one of them I would spread the jam 
and on the other piece I would spread the peanut butter 
then I would put the two pieces  the bread together 
and I would cut them in half  diagonally
