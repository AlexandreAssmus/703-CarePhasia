um most of the time if I take my time I can do fairly well 
but it s seems like when I get in a situation where I'm in a hurry is more uh when my speech or my  I lose some of the  the words that I want 
and I found that the  going to the hardware store for example with a particular part or I know I'm hafta talk to somebody to describe something I write it down in my  my phone and show it sometimes rather than say it out loud or try to say it out loud if I have difficulties with it 
so  that's what I do for you_know my help 
I do because I woke up one morning with a splitting headache 
uh I normally in the morning go out get the paper  have breakfast or read part of the paper during breakfast and then go to work 
and um I went out and got the paper 
I still had a splitting headache 
I took a couple of aspirin  came in and uh had a bowl of cereal for breakfast 
and uh while I was there I usually read the first section of the paper 
and I opened it up 
and I could not read what was on the newspaper 
I couldn't see a whole paragraph 
and blocks of characters were missing altogether 
so  that's the first thing 
so  I just  I set the uh paper aside and said 
 okay  I'll read it when I get home 
and um got dressed and went to work 
I w droving 
and um what I was seeing on the highway again on the uh dashboard of the car I couldn't see all of the inf ins instrumentation on the dash 
but I was able to drive fine and go to work 
uh no problem at all there 
when I got to work I tried to log into my computer at the office 
and I couldn't remember my login 
didn't know how to log in 
and uh I still had the headache 
I uh talked to my boss and  and told her what was going on 
she said 
 just take it easy for awhile and see if you can later 
remember  I took probably a half hour  forty five minutes and still couldn't 
so  I said 
 I  I just can't do it 
 I'm going to go home 
I came home  took a_couple more aspirin and went to bed and slept the rest of that day 
that was on a Thursday 
on Friday morning I got up 
and I exercise on Friday  Monday Wednesdays and Fridays I exercised with a group early in the morning 
so  I went to exercise class 
and um I exercised 
but when I was with the group I was talking 
and what I was saying wasn't making sense to me 
wasn't making sense to any of my friends 
you_know they  the words were correct 
but what words that I was speaking were wrong words 
they didn't fit whiff 
and so I said 
 there's something wrong there 
so  I came back home and uh had breakfast when I got back from uh exercise 
and then I normally would go to work 
but I couldn't go to work 
and I told FirstnameP that I needed to go to uh see my doctor 
and basically at that time the only doctor I was seeing was a  hear heart  col the oncolo uh heart doctor 
and she s talked me instead to go to the emergency room 
went to the emergency room 
and they discovered that I'd had a stroke 
and so they put me in the hospital 
and uh I was there three days 
they were trying  basically my heart was out_of rhythm and uh was beating too fast and lots_of different things 
so  they spent three days basically just dealing with the heart issue getting it stabilized 
and then three more days basically discovering that uh I'd had uh a stroke and aphasia 
and um then I was  went home after the  trying to think what day of the week it was 
Wednesday  Wednesday I went home 
and uh Thursday I drove back to the  drove then because I could drive 
I could s everything  do everything I needed to do except talk laughs 
so  I went to make a appointment with the uh uh speech therapy at that point 
and that's where it started 
well  it started out with something simple because basically I could look at  at anything and know what it was 
but I couldn't pull the words out 
and so we started with the simple things like in the room for example 
looking around the room 
looking at each object in the room 
naming it 
trying to find the  the word and say the word out loud 
you_know so  that's where it first started 
and it built from there 
you_know just  and some of the things we sa looked at just a few minutes ago you_know like with the pictures 
you_know look at the picture 
name the picture 
and over time that gradually got better and better 
but uh that's where I think the start with the therapy was 
and then part of my therapy was actually writing my story out 
and I found when writing I  taking a paper and pencil and writing I couldn't spell properly anymore 
and you_know that was something I had to work at 
so  I found that with my uh keyboard I could do better than I could with a pen and pencil 
and with a notebood 
it  it has a spellchecker and a  spell 
uh not  I'm not sure what you'd call it necessarily 
a checker 
but it starts out  you_know if you start the first few characters of a word it gives you several different words that work 
so  that sometimes helped a_lot as_well writing 
so  uh I've done a_lot_of that 
but it's mainly uh uh working with seeing what uf  seeing the words and then saying it out loud 
that's done more I think better than anything else 
and I worked hard at it for a long time 
and then I took  got kind_of  st afterwards I've kinda gotten a_little slow about it 
or not slow but just haven't done it as diligently as I used to 
but uh for the first months after the stroke I was  I worked hard at it 
trying to pull those pictures back 
and I found that you  it's  it's like learning in school again grade school 
you look at a word 
and you learn that word 
and  and oh that's that word 
and it comes back and stays back 
but with aphasia it doesn't stay there 
it's  it's more like having uh an electronic dictionary that is  occasionally gets scrambled 
you_know it's like 
 okay  I know that word 
 it's not in the dictionary where it should be 
 it's over there instead 
you_know that type of thing 
so 
happy 
I think when my grandson was born 
he was a joy to be around 
and uh I got to spend a_lot_of time with him when he was little and an infant 
and uh watching him grow 
and just  that was special 
he's ten now 
and he's doesn't spend as much crime 
and he's off doing other things 
so 
okay 
boy's out kicking a soccer ball 
kicked it 
got a_little too close 
kicked it through the window 
I'm not sure whether that's his neighbor or his dad 
but the window  s
and a  uh I'd say his dad saw it 
opened looked out the window and noticed who had kicked the ball 
okay 
in the beginning the mom sent little boy out to go to school 
she 
and he didn't want to take his umbrella 
so  he said 
 I'll be fine without it  mom 
and he went out  and he went out 
and the rain started raining 
and so he ran back to the house 
and his mom was upset with him and  hu for going out without the umbrella 
and so he got a r umbrella 
and went back out with an umbrella the next time 
alright 
well  it looks like the beginning the little girl was riding her bicycle  or tricycle 
and the dog or 
and the dog chased the cat up the tree 
and so she called back to her dad and said 
 the cat's stuck in the tree 
and he got out a ladder 
went out to climb up to get the cat down 
and the ladder fell 
and so they hadta call the fire to help him and the cat get down the tree 
so  that's pretty much the story 
alright 
Cinderella 
well  originally apparently her mother died 
and um sh her and her family were comfortably welloff 
and uh that in time she got a stepmother and two stepsisters as_well that moved in with her 
and they were not very friendly with her 
and over time  her father must be out_of the picture for some reason because she  the change of the  Cinderella and the family changed dramatically 
and she became more of a slave than a  s a sister and the girl and the mother 
and uh things got worse and worse as she got older 
and uh one point in time she got acquainted 
or how do I say it 
she uh learned to live with the animals in the home  in the family or  in the house and uh outside the home as_well 
and uh they became her friends instead of uh her s stepsisters 
and uh that developed over time 
and then the king that nearby or from that decided that his  the princess 
so  he  they planned on a uh ball to meet all of the eligible girls in the  the kingdom 
and stepmother and her children her daughters decided to go but leave  not take sepmother 
and uh Cinderella had a gown somewhere  I think 
from the looks of the one picture like it was in a closet or not a closet but  a trunk someplace 
and she got it out 
and they fixed it up and showed her stepmother and sisters 
and they ended up tearing it up 
and she didn't have anything 
and then uh the animals the mice and the cats and dogs helped her to uh redo her dress 
her stairy 
there we go 
I got a word laughs 
fairy godmother stepped in as_well 
and they helped move the pumpkin into a coach and the mice into uh horses 
and uh s anyway they were able to go to drive to the ball 
and uh stepmother  the  the prince fell in love with uh Cinderella 
and they danced and got along fine until the end of the evening 
and they  uh Cinderella hadta  hadta leave at midnight 
and as she was leaving she left her  one slipper got left behind 
and uh they couldn't find her 
they had to looked all over for Cinderella or  for the girl 
and they couldn't find her until they finally came to her home 
and uh her stepmothers couldn't  stepsisters couldn't fit the slipper 
but Cinderella could 
so  that's where they ended it 
oh that's easy 
get two pieces of bread 
get a jar of peanut butter and a jar jam and a knife 
um put the peanut butter on one side of the bread 
jelly on the other 
put them together 
you got a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
