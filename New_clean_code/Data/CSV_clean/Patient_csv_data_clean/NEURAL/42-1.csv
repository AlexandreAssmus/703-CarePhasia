it's been a_lot better than it was  yeah 
ten years  you_know ten  ten years  right 
I had um encephalitis um ten years before 
and I hadta remember everything 
so  it's in my head 
but it's how when you get it out_of there  so 
um I had  um I had like um encephalitis for it was  about a month 
I don't even remember anything about it 
but um I was in the  but when I remember they got me to start up another time 
um hadta remember  how to remember how I'll talking about abck one two three um noun verb preposition and all that kind of stuff 
just remember how do you rewrite everything 
um just taking your time 
but it's still in there 
and you can't just get it on there 
you might talk a_couple times about it 
then you're talking about the decks 
and then you forgot about that one 
so  it's always kind_of like that 
but you can still do it 
so  I'm still writing and um preposition and all that kind of stuff 
just sort of thing you can do 
just keep  make sure it's still doing than  better than it was 
yeah  oh  it's unbelievable  yeah 
um um mostly hadta remember how to um 
there first couple months it seems like I had to remember how to get 
it's funny how uh my mom would always remember what it was and stuff like that 
I could go in the kitchen first 
and I can make all my breakfast and stuff like that 
the name 
I don't remember anything about it with my head 
I could sit there and making um breakfast and stuff like that 
and she'd say 
 um don't know 
she'd put toast and I'd say 
but eggs 
 that's right  okay 
but it takes time to get everything out_of your head outta there  so 
um a_lot_of it's there 
but most of it's just you can't get it out_of my head on there 
um it's hard to come back around everything like that 
and also  it's also because when you talk to me doesn't get the same way coming back to me 
um and it's also kind_of weird because if you talk to one person and me it kind_of kills me 
but if you have another person here I can understand a_lot better with that 
but it's depends  depends on how it's coming on to me yeah 
um like I said I hadta remember doing abck one two three everything like that 
um they took me at um oh  to uh um books for the first year 
I had someone who worked with me every day on the noun the verb all that kind of stuff like that 
um just trying to get back where it was 
um I yu just write trying to re just getting everything on there 
so  it's  um it's like that 
it's just hard 
you start getting little things starting through there 
but then I went to um 
I don't know if you go to Chicago 
there's five weeks 
there we got back how to do different things around there 
how you're kind_of think you're on this place I think then maybe a different one 
it's like you had different places you get around there helped around 
but  um so  it does get out_of there more than you can 
I_mean the first time you're just going straight 
and it's hard to get anything out_of there 
but um I don't know 
is that  did I tell you anything 
when I was little first time 
well  it also can be that too for  like I said for ten years it's kind_of  I really hadta remember start everything 
so  I did get a remember 
I did start up another time 
so  it did help 
um I_mean uh my mom helped me 
and um different places they've  they help everything about it 
but it is nice to get back up um where you can go 
the bottom 
I_mean it wasn't a real big deal because I couldn't go down 
I hadta go up 
and you had another time to keep getting better than you were 
um so  it's been nice to keep going if you keep doing a little bit to read and write everything like that 
it helps um a_lot better 
okay 
the boy was out outside with a  with a soccer ball 
and he was kicking around 
and he kicked one really good 
um but it hit right in the middle of the window on the  on the house there 
um so  the next one over there her 
gotta  might have been s sleeping and jumped out 
and the lamp broke down there too 
um but you really can't tell on number four 
um it looks like he is not very happy 
because he got his um soccer ball 
um but he's still looking out there 
and I think the  the boy musta ran away 
he ran away 
so  uh because he's still looking to see what he's doing 
okay 
um looks like mom told 
and he said wellco he doesn't really want that 
so  um he's moving onto the next 
he says no big deal with the  he doesn't  the umbrella 
so  he got outside 
and it rained 
um that was on number three 
he's over there raining on him 
number four 
and it's really raining him 
he's gotten water all over the place 
um number five 
he finally came back 
and  and he didn't look that very good 
and she didn't  she told him it's not very good and probably smarter that he didn't take it 
um so  next time he's gonna take the umbrella when it rains 
um it looks like her dad 
um well  mostly the  the girl who's looking to find her cat up on top on the tree 
she wanted to get it there 
but her dad actually thought he was gonna take the ladder 
but it fell down 
so  he's stuck up there the whole time 
um the dog's kinda barking at him xxx 
really helping there 
but um the um firemen are coming over there 
they've got another ladder 
they're gonna help him back up 
um but I don't understand why he went straight up to the middle of the tree 
he probably coulda held up enough to get the cat 
um and the cat gets by itself anyway 
um it's just kind_of 
yeah I don't know 
it's probably about what it is  I think 
so  I'm ready huh 
okay 
um what it was um she has  um she's not actually with the  the people 
but there's two um 
it's not like they're um cousins or something like that 
there's two girls 
and were next by him and their mom 
they're really bad ones and stuff like that or not very  um very  not very haÉªsu 
of_course she's not very good  very good to her 
um then she always hadta work outside and do all the  the hard things 
um and they dune 
they've got enough money and doing whatever they could 
so  they gave a time that um they said they could go to one place where they got to see all the  the money  p the 
I'm trying to say something 
trying to say all the good people there 
they had to go see them 
and um there's  uh they got to play and music and stuff like that 
um so  she would never get to go there 
but um s I forget how 
somehow she got in here 
but um she got to go 
um say exactly um 
it came that she had a very unbelievable great um clothes and stuff like 
they took her so_that one  one night where they got to see everyone 
um and  and actually it was the  um the guy who came to see her 
he was probably the best one there 
he was very nice and very  the best thing he could 
um and he really liked to see her 
but when it was done that time he 
so  he 
and um so it was all done 
but the next day someone actually brought those to him 
because it was his 
because the only ones that are big enough for him 
the other ones are too big feet and stuff like that 
so  it didn't work for them 
so  it came to him 
they just told him 
so  it came on to him 
it goes to that 
I'm not done yet 
um laughs the guy  he's the  the one guy that I saw 
the two um sing with him and play and stuff like that 
that's where he was that night 
so  he came back to make sure it was her 
so  since it's her he's taken with her 
so  it's going to be with her for all this  all the time and stuff like that um as much as it could be for him 
that tell you anything 
okay 
um you should take a bread 
um get some um butter out_of the refrigerator with a knife 
um put some of those on the bread and also some of the um um 
they're not peanuts exactly 
pee close_by the peanuts 
we also make one of those and you can put on the bread 
so  everything feels pretty good 
except for your hand probably gets all over the place 
um but it's a real easy one 
you can do it for about two minutes 
and that's a good one to eat if you  if you you need to get something to eat 
um got enough 
pretty much 
something  probably something to xxx 
um I think you just  you_know you just take the  you took the butters 
the  the um peanuts 
that's not the same thing 
they sit in the  it's in the um kitchen 
put on a bread 
and put it on a  probably put it on a plate 
go over sit down on the on the table 
and um have something to eat 
I guess that's it
