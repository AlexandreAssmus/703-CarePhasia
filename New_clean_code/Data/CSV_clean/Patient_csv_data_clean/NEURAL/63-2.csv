um my speech is okay 
but l a_lot_of times I  I  I know what it is but I can't say it 
that's what it is 
I  I know what it is 
and until someone tells me what it is I just can't say it 
I don't know why 
but it's the way it is now 
yeah 
well  I got up in the  m uh in the morning 
and right away I  I  I  I rolled over 
sh she  she was by my side 
and uh I told her I felt a little queasy 
and she didn't s s say much about it 
so  then I went to the bathroom and  I  I  I  I  I  I  I went to the bathroom and did my thing 
and then right after I did my thing something happened in here points
and uh I said 
 oh_no 
and that's the last thing I remember for weeks 
well  the  the last thing I knew be before my stroke hit was uh 
well  after my stroke hit uh I  I woke up 
and I was  well  I  I remember that is  this was Amsterdam New_York 
so  the next thing I know I'm back in Wichita 
and I'm  I'm on a bed 
my wife's there 
and  uh and I  I slowly start talking to her 
but I don't think I  at  at the fir first thing I don don't think I made much sense to her 
but she was always there for me 
so  it  it  it  w you_know it was okay because I  I could tell her anything I wanted 
she'd listen 
did whatever she could 
and uh then after awhile uh two or three uh nurses would come in everyday 
and th they would do crazy things like lift my legs and lift my back 
and e every day it was something different 
and I would go down the hall 
and uh they would do uh leg lifts uh trying to get me sh whatever 
and uh I  I would do  t do stairs 
I remember that I did stairs 
did a_lot_of uh I don't know uh 
then I don't know 
th there was always somebody there 
there was always  always somebody doing something to me 
a_lot_of it I don't know anymore 
but it  it was very  for the first couple weeks I  it was very ex extensive 
well  th th the  th the best thing I can remember before my stroke was getting married of_course 
and uh I was in the service at the time 
c we  we  before my  before I was a privacy officer I was also in the  in the airforce for twenty two years 
so  um other from that I think th the thing that I  I do the most about in  in  uh in Helenikon Greece 
I  w I was very interested in basketball and baseball and  and especially so uh football 
had a_lot_of good memories about football 
yeah I  I  I was  I was  uh I  I  I  I  I'm no not a blowing my own horn but uh a after the season I was  I was the best player defensively on the team 
I had a_lot_of interceptions 
a_lot_of things happened 
but there's a  a  a_lot_of things 
oh  there  there's so much I  I 
in_fact you_know uh there's so many things good and bad that have happened to me 
I  I  I can't do anything 
s in_fact there's a_lot_of them I don't even remember anymore 
they're either f trivial or whatever 
but tha that's the way it is 
okay 
uh there  there was a bo boy who kicked the ball 
and the ball went into a glass window 
and when he  when  h when it went into the window and it hit the guy on the  on the stairs 
and so she 
and he  he told him he wasn't getting it back til the lamp was fixed 
okay 
uh first of all uh the boy did not want to take an umbrellbrella 
sh he  he  she 
so  she 
so  she 
and he was all wet now 
and so uh she 
and she 
and sh he went to school with it 
okay 
 okay 
uh first of all I see a little girl 
and she's trying to get a cat 
but her  her  her ladder broke 
so  she couldn't get it 
so  she  uh she went to her frather 
and he had  he had a real  uh he had a dog  uh uh a dog 
and the  and had a dog 
and he  and up  up the tree trying to get him 
and so be because she couldn't get him 
and she couldn't get the cat 
she couldn't get the dog 
she went with the firemen who got her out and got everything back to normal 
okay 
uh when the grandmother 
and uh Cin Cinderella did all the work 
and as kids got older there were more things for Cinderella to do that  that they wouldn't do 
and finally they  they got an invitation from the prince that there was gonna be a gala at the  at the prince's palace 
and uh they  they told her she couldn't go because she  wa she wasn't invited 
and only they went 
so  after they were gone uh the fairy godmother showed up and  and showed them how she could do it 
and so the first thing the fairy godmother did was turn all the mice and everything into  in in in into uh the carriage and the horse and all 
and then  uh then Cinderella was  was given a fine dress to wear 
and then when she got to the  when she got to the ball  uh the only wo thing  the only thing  when she got to the ball the prince could see nothing but Cinderella 
and uh they danced the night away 
and then at twelve o'clock she said she hadta go 
and while she was going one of her slippers was left on the ground 
so  when she got home Cinderella uh was back on her  in her  in her shabby clothes and with the dogs and cats and everything 
and uh then uh the  the  the shoe wa was supposed to be broken by  by  by the  by the ugly mother 
but they  they  it  it wasn't 
and so Cinderella put on the shoe 
and it was an exact match of the other  s other one 
so  she 
and so her and the prince got married 
and they lived happily ever after 
you put  you put on one once  you put two sl slices of bread together 
one with pea peanut butter and one with jelly 
and you get them together
