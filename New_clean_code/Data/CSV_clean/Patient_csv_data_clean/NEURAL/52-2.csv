it's pretty good 
but it's pretty good 
understandable 
yes I do 
well  no  I don't remember the stroke 
I remember the first one that I had 
and I remember the third one that I had 
I do not remember the second one 
okay uh I can tell you about the first one 
I'll tell you that one 
um the first one um I was home alone 
uh FirstnameS had gone to get her uh hair cut about twenty five miles away 
and I was working here at the house 
I was  uh I was  I was  I'd been working on  uh on doing some carpenter work in the house 
and uh I started to feel  um I started to feel kind_of numb in my right hand 
um I didn't feel too bad 
but I knew from what people had told me what I'd heard uh many times the  one of the signs of a stroke is uh numbness 
in_fact I remember I was  uh uh a fellow that w I used to work with had a stroke at work 
and I remember going through that and um kinda recognize from that how it looked 
um so  I  I  I  I knew what was going on 
I knew I was having a stroke 
um against my  well  I probably  sh I shouldn't have done it 
but I  I called FirstnameS 
and I said 
 uh you prolly 
 um I'm gonna head  I'm gonna go to the hospital 
 I don't feel right now 
 I'm not sure what's going on 
 but I'm  I  you better  y just come on home 
and uh I'd said 
 I'm  I'm gonna start  I'm gonna head to the hospital 
 just come on down there to the emergency room when  when you get here 
so  I  I did 
I went out 
and I got in my truck 
and I headed for the  went to the hospital which isn't very far away 
it's you_know six or eight blocks away from here 
and um I drove to the hospital and uh drove into the emergency room parking and uh walked into the  uh walked into the hospital 
and I said 
 um I'm  I think I'm having a stroke 
and they d you_know didn't waste any time 
said okay 
somebody you_know 
 we're  come on  come on back 
 we'll  we're gonna take you and have someone look at you right away which they did 
they  they took me put me in one of the examination rooms 
and uh they started to examine me 
uh FirstnameS uh she'd  b it was about a half hour away 
so  she got there after this had started that  uh the ex um z questions 
I think I  w I think I  they'd uh already taken me to  uh to get a c_t scan or whatever it was um while  before she got there 
so  they  they when  when  when she got there I was  already had gone in to  uh to get a scan 
and um so when they had  when I was done with that they took me um uh back into the waiting  back into the room where I was  the treatment room whatever you call it at  at their  in their j emergency room 
and um I  I remember pretty well that uh you_know FirstnameS was there 
and  and uh I remembered  I knew what was going on uh I  that I was  that I had a stroke 
but it felt like it was probably  it wasn't getting any worse 
it was just stroke 
uh so  I wasn't too worried about it 
but  and at that time it was only still in my  in my um right arm 
it wad'nt 
I  I could walk  I could walk fine 
there's no  no problem there 
it was uh in my  in my arm that  that was affected 
uh didn't affect my vision or anything like that  that I know of 
uh I was able to drive you_know to the  as I said to the hospital and walk into the hospital and  and  and  and tell them what  what I thought was going on 
so  uh yeah  so  they looked at me 
they  they then they  they  um I was there for awhile in the  in the emergency room 
and then they took me uh and  took  took me to a  um you_know to the um neuro i_c uh uh i_c_u 
yeah i_c_u 
took me to the neuro i_c_u 
and uh you_know then of_course people came in and examined me 
and the doctor came in 
and  um and of_course FirstnameS  FirstnameS was there 
and uh I remember the  remember the room real well 
um I think I was hungry by that time 
uh uh I don't know how far  how much more you want me to talk  to say 
I can  I can go on talk for awhile if you want 
but that's  that pretty much the story of the  of the time as  when I had the stroke 
okay 
uh yes I can 
um my recovery from that initial stoke 
um I went  uh you_know I was in the hospital for about three or four days 
and  uh and then uh I went home 
uh I went home 
and uh we called a  um a neurosurgeon to um take a look at me and so_forth 
but  uh so  um but I went home 
and um I  actually within a few days uh I was  you_know I said 
 FirstnameS  let's  I wanna try driving 
and  and  and so we did 
we  nice cat 
um so  uh we  we went out to the country 
we live in Wichita and went out to the country and  on some of the country road 
and I did a little driving around 
and I felt like I was pretty good you_know 
and then I did that again a_couple more times other days 
and uh it seemed like things were going pretty well 
and then I  and then we  uh we  as I said  w made an appointment to go see the n uh neurosurgeon 
and we went to see the neurosurgeon 
and um uh his name was Doctor LastnameM 
and um he was in a building right there by the hospital 
and um so went to see him and  you_know in his office 
and he  he explained to me what he thought I had 
well  you_know he had seen the  seen the xrays and  and the scans and all that 
so  he knew what was going on you_know 
and he told me what  told me what  what I had 
and it was a  uh it was a um 
see if I can remember the word 
um it's probably gonna get away from me 
it's a 
it's on the tip my tongue 
it's a um 
I don't know if you can  you can help me with this ɑu 
it's a um 
you can't 
I see you're shaking your house 
okay uh I have a hard time some sorta remembering what this was 
it's not a regular stroke 
it's not a regular stroke 
it's  uh it's a uh situation that I've had probably since birth 
and it  the situation is that there is a  um uh a spot in my brain where the blood comes in from the um artery 
and instead of going th through the little capillaries and everything it doesn't go through the capillaries 
it goes directly into a  a vein 
so  there's no  no filter there to  to slow it down or  you_know 
and so that  that con 
and it  I said it probably was there from birth 
but at some point it got the part where it was just too much pressure 
and it  it didn't blow 
it just  there was  and it was not a very big  um uh very big spot 
uh maybe size of a quarter that  where it had bled into my brain 
but it stopped bleeding 
it stopped 
and  er and everything was going okay 
it stopped 
and there wasn't really much damage 
so  um so  Doctor LastnameM then said 
 uh we can  we can fix that pretty easily 
 we'll take you and put you in the hospital 
 take four or five days 
 I hafta cut into your  cut into your skull and  uh and go in there 
 and we'll take that  you_know fix that well  uh actually seal it off 
 and  uh and then you'd be goo as good as new you_know 
 it  everything will be okay 
 and uh you'd be in the hospital four or five days 
 and then you'll go home 
 and everything will be fine 
uh so  I went home from that appointment feeling pretty good 
um FirstnameS I guess both felt pretty good 
I continue practicing my driving and so_forth 
and uh I went  uh went back and made an appointment to go into surgery uh on  uh on May the first 
that had it 
I'm sorry 
May the sixth 
that had all happened on April Fools Day on April first of uh two thousand fifteen 
and um so I went in for the surgery on  uh on uh May the sixth of that year two thousand fifteen 
and uh little did I know I wasn't gonna come home for quite awhile 
I wouldn't be home for s another six months 
and in the meantime 
excuse the  uh the French 
the  the shit hit the fan 
and it did big time 
I'm sorry did I  I'm  I don't mean to um offend you 
okay  so  um that was  that was  that was  that was my second stoke 
and um didn't  I  uh then  uh then uh that was  that was 
well  okay  so  what happened was when I went into the hospital then to have the  that surgery that  that  uh that um 
uh t and again it's on the tip my tongue 
that I wanna say what it is 
maybe I'll think of it yeah 
so  when I went in to have that taken care of while I  when I was in the hospital then um they did the surgery 
and the surgery was a suc success 
uh the problem was that when I went back  when  when I was in recovery from that surgery I was in recovery and um 
I'll  l ignore that if you can 
um sorry uh make  make sure it's not 
no  it's not 
okay  no 
um so  um when I 
the  b let it ring a time or two and go  it'll go away 
I'm sorry 
okay  so  I  I  um while I was in recovery um my bla brain for whatever reason 
and not in the area where the surgery was done but in another area far away from the  that spot 
it started bleeding 
and nobody knows why it started bleeding 
but it did 
and uh even_though FirstnameS kept trying to say 
 there's something wrong 
 there's something wrong 
 I know it's something wrong 
uh because I  I  I  I don't remember it of_course 
I d didn't see it 
my  ha my head was very sw fs sw swollen 
and  uh and she could tell that 
you_know they tried to say 
 uh well  he's have 
they  they  they tried to say 
 well  he's having a little stroke and that 
uh not a stroke 
a  um uh having a uh uh 
I cant remember the word now 
he's having a uh um whatever it is that they said 
well  it happens sometimes after surgery 
it's no big deal 
it'll  it  it is go away 
and uh she kept trying to tell them 
 there's something wrong 
 there's something wrong 
 you need to you_know call the doctor 
well they didn't  well  they didn't get hold of the doctor until number of hours later 
that was at one  about one o'clock  one o'clock one thirty when I came back out_of surgery the first time 
and at finally about ten o'clock that evening they took me back into surgery 
and uh you_know by that time they'd had done scans and so_forth 
and they could see that the brain was bleeding badly 
in_fact uh about the blood  uh the blood was about three quarters of my brain 
it was so bad that they didn't know if I would be ɛbɚu 
uh and if I did come out_of it didn't know for sure if I would ever talk walk 
if I'd even know anything 
if I'd just hafta be spending the rest my life in a care home 
they didn't know 
and uh so um I didn't know if you'd me to go on some more about this 
I_mean I can talk for a long time about this if you want me to 
so  you ready to go on 
I'm sorry I can't even hear you 
yeah 
yes  um yes 
um of_course I when I was  when I was in the hospital um um I don't remember 
you_know for about two months I don't remember anything 
and I wasn't doing anything 
I  as far as I know I don't know if they were doing anything to me to help me get better or not but probably not because there wasn't anything to work with 
um I  you_know I couldn't talk 
um I couldn't um do anything 
and interestingly in July 
so  that was  that was  that was May 
in July  middle of July somewhere I had another stroke 
and they 
I was at that point  I was in the  uh I was in uh a rehabilitation center  a rehab hospital 
and they  uh they took me uh by ambulance because I  I felt  I could feel that something was going on 
and I was afraid it was stroke 
but I couldn't say it was a stroke 
but I knew there was something going on 
and FirstnameS could communicate with me well enough to know that there's a problem 
they took me to the hospital and um did the scans and so_forth 
and sure enough I'd had another  s I'd had another stroke 
um while I was there in the hospital 
um up until that time I could not move my legs at all 
my hands I had  I was no  I couldn't do anything with it 
I you_know was just  that's why they didn't know if I'd ever be able to do anything again 
but while I was in the hospital um I started being able to move 
oh and the other thing that had happened to me was I'd lost um my ability to focus my eyes together 
so  I can only see out_of one eye at a time 
so  I was wearing an eye patch over one side 
then I'd wear it for a while over this side then w you_know 
but I could only have one eye open at a time because I couldn't see um with both eyes 
I can steer with both eyes 
but I'd see different  different things 
and so um when I had the second stroke or well  this third stroke in the hospital uh I  the vision started clearing up 
and I remember telling me  telling FirstnameS 
I said 
 my visions are getting better 
 I can see better 
 I can focus 
 I can focus with my eyes 
and  um and I  uh sure enough I could 
and then I also told her that  that I thought I could start move my leg a little bit 
and uh you_know because when you're  when you're paralyzed you're not sure whether it's moving or not 
you think you're moving it 
but y it really isn't 
and I said 
 you_know look at my leg and see if it's moving and  uh because I really felt like it was 
and indeed it was moving 
it was moving 
so  whenever happened in this second stroke was  was good for me because I was able to start moving my uh uh uh muscle 
first time I was able to move a muscle any muscle 
uh and I was able to um see with both eyes together 
so  uh I was there two or three days 
and uh they took me back to the  uh to the rehab hospital 
and um at that point I was able to  um up until that point I'd permy primarily been doing rehab in terms of uh mental stuff 
and uh at that point then I was t able to start doing sʌmpɪŋu 
um and you_know as I worked to that and as they worked with me I was able to you_know start uh make myself move my muscles 
my arm  I can move my arm 
my hand still wouldn't move 
we just numbed it 
I couldn't do  anyth couldn't move my hands or scrunch my fists or anything like that 
and uh so I  I do remember that when at that  at that point 
and you  you  I don't know 
are you saying  your question was 
 do you mame remember anything that helped you 
um was that the question 
yeah 
and so I started working really hard 
I started working really hard because at that point I knew that  I knew that 
well  actually you_know I knew it before that 
that I was some  at some point I was gonna get better 
I just couldn't do it 
but at that point when fi I was steɪbəlɪu 
and if I work at it hard enough I'll be able to get better 
so  I  I was in that rehab hospital for  two rehab hospitals for awhile 
and then I went to a  uh a long term uh uh care facility 
and I was there for a hundred days 
and they worked with me with a speech therapist a um physical therapist and a occupational therapist 
uh and the hundred days 
I could've used more but that was the r limit for  because_of Medicare 
but that was  that was total of six months that I was  um I was um not able to um come  come home 
men 
so  we put a  put a  put a lift on the back on the port 
and put one  uh put a lift going upstairs because our is  we have two story house 
and um so those kinds of things all helped me because I hadta go up the stairs 
I hadta  I  I'd had some more rehab along 
I had rehab at home for about another six weeks of  uh of rehab 
and uh he was very very good rehab  rehab specialist 
I did some uh other um you_know uh occupational and  uh and  and  and  uh occupational and physical and 
what's the third kind 
uh anyway I'll come  I'll coming up with in a minute  in a minute 
so  I did that 
and  but I  I never did  I  I never did give up 
I always continued to work as hard as I could 
um you_know I  I had  had a very good physical therapist to help me 
and uh so we worked hard on that 
and that took me until 
and it  a actually and then I got uh when I was  when I was uh still at 
then I went to  uh we had uh therapy on an outpatient basis for awhile at a rehab hospital here on outpatient basis for several months 
and um during that time I met uh uh a um 
I don't really know how to describe him 
he's a  he's kind_of a  um he's  he's kind_of a um 
he does not have a  um he's not  he's not a p_h_d 
but he is a  a doctor of education or something like that 
but he is very very good at um working with stroke people um in  in  in terms of  um in terms of cognitive ability 
and  and I worked with him for about almost four years 
and um in_fact I've just got work when  I quit working with him maybe in the last six months 
um we were  went to his office  went to uh 
well  he had an office 
it  it  it  it  he didn't have an office there 
he had a  um he came to a  he came to uh a university here 
and he would meet with people there at the university 
and I  I was still in a wheelchair at that time 
and um I worked with him while I was still in the wheelchair and then went on to work with him when I was  when I was actually in  in a walker for another  s another year 
and then when  when I went to uh uh walking with  uh with a cane I continued working at  with him 
but it  his  his  his 
I witch 
but he works with  with the cognitive abilities 
and he helped me a_lot you_know 
in_fact some of the things that we've done here is  reminded me of some of the stuff that he's done  that he did with me 
you_know t nell telling stories and  and  um and a_lot different tests that  um that I'm sure you're very familiar with 
um but he was  he was able to work with me and just pull stuff outta me and make it work 
and maybe the biggest thing that he was able to do was  was kind_of inspire me to keep going and working working working 
um so  I did that 
and I worked hard on that 
and I  I worked hard 
uh when I  when I actually  when I finally finished to the point where Medicare would not provide any more physical therapy for me um I went to the YMCA 
and I got a membership in the yl and  and hired at the yl a uh personal trainer who  who didn't really know anything about strokes 
but she learned 
she was very good at studying and learning 
the first day that she saw me uh and I  I was so stiff that  sh that I couldn't move 
I  I couldn't move any 
my arm was just 
I don't know if you can see it here 
it's  you_know your arm is just like this 
and it has clenched fist and everything 
and the first time she tried to move my arm it was like 
 holy_cow I  I can't move it you_know 
and it wouldn't move 
she worked with me 
uh I went twice a week to go with her 
uh and then in addition to that uh 
buh but after a while I went  started  I'd say 
 FirstnameS take me down to the yl and let me uh 
I was  I was still using my walker 
I'd say 
 let me  just take me down the yl and let me walk around the track with my walker 
and I'm sure people probably thought stupid dumb 
here's this  this old guy walking around with his  you_know very very slowly 
it'd take me  you_know it'd take me 
it  it's uh six  six times arounds 
and it would take me uh probably half hour to walk around that lap 
uh but I was  I was determined to do it 
and I did it 
I did it 
and um then eventually I got to the point where I could use my cane 
I still go very slowly 
um but I'm doing it 
so  I'm gonna have to say the biggest thing that made me get better was myself 
and I'm not trying to pat  pat myself on the back 
I know some other stroke victims who do not have the drive that I have 
and I'm sorry for them 
they don't 
but  and I think  I think some stroke victims are robbed of their drive 
I did not lose my drive 
always  I've always been kinda driven anyway 
you_know I've always been driven 
but I was driven to  hur to improve and get better 
and I'm still  go I'm still doing that 
and I'm getting there 
and it will never come to an end 
but it  I will keep working at it 
okay 
um well  when I 
okay  I tell you about my wife 
how's that 
at my wife 
I  uh I'd been married before 
my first wife had Huntington's disease 
I don't  n don't know if you're familiar with it 
but she had Huntington's disease for many many years 
and she passed away um oh about twenty years ago 
um I had a  uh uh I had a friend 
now uh uh how do I go into this 
um when she passed away  before she passed away 
um this gets complicated 
okay my  my wife's  my wife's brother  um my wife's brother um had moved to Texas 
um in the  in the nineties they  they moved to Texas 
and uh sh in Texas she met and became very close friends with uh someone in  in Texas there that  that she didn't know 
uh but they  she met 
they  bec you_know they worked together 
and they became very very close friends 
um are you in for a long story 
uh so  so  uh my sister  my sister inlaw  uh sister inlaw her name is FirstnameD  okay 
and uh so they moved to Texas 
and at some point they moved back to Wichita 
and he went to work for  for Boeing  okay 
so  um at some point this friend of  friend of hers was going through a divorce 
she  she'd been married for almost twenty years 
and  and  and it end  didn't end up very well 
so  she was going through a divorce 
and so um FirstnameD who is my sister inlaw invited her to come to Wichita uh just because she needed somebody to  you_know she  wa she  she needed to  needed to get away from the si situation that she was 
and so she  she moved to Wichi Wichita 
and uh because_of the friendship that my sister inlaw had with her um we got to know  know them 
my  my wife and I got to know them 
but not very well because my wife had Hunting's 
and you don't socialize very much when you have that exist 
so  I really did not know her  them  their friend very well 
but we did see them once in awhile when we'd go  like go to uh a family gathering or go to their house because FirstnameD would be there 
and her friend would be there and  and so_forth 
and so that was  that was like nineteen ninety one or something like that 
well  uh to make a long story long um uh FirstnameD's friend then moved to get  got married  got  got married  remarried and uh went to  went and moved to California 
uh she was out there for about a year 
and she came back to Wichita 
and her  hu and her husband he came back to Wichita 
and uh he had his  her husband had a uh heart transplant 
if  if he  you having a hard time following  following this that's okay 
I'll  it  I'll try to bring it all together 
she 
and uh it  uh it didn't take very well you_know 
heart transplants they're long drawn out 
and s she 
and finally he gave out 
in the meantime my  my wife uh with Huntington's disease um was moved to a uh 
w uh we had her at a uh nursing home 
she spent five years in a nursing home 
um now then  and her nursing home was the same town about four or five blocks away from FirstnameS's friend 
I had no idea they  that she lived there 
you_know I had no idea that she lived in that  in that town or anywhere 
um so  um so  at one point my wife finally you_know she went downhill and went downhill and  and  and passed away in uh two thousand two 
uh I called FirstnameD my sister inlaw to tell her that  that FirstnameJ had passed away 
and uh FirstnameS uh and  and no  and uh FirstnameD said 
 I can't believe it 
uh FirstnameC just died yesterday 
and FirstnameC is FirstnameS's husband 
I say 
 they  they both died within one day of each other 
 um strange coincidence 
um over  over time um I  it  and not right away but over time I uh 
FirstnameS was living up there in the  in  in  in Sedrick  the town of Sedrick where the nursing home was 
and at some point FirstnameS said or  um uh FirstnameD said 
 you_know what 
 denay FirstnameD 
 did you_know that 
I said 
 no  I had no idea 
so  uh you_know after  after  y after you lose a spouse um it's very difficult to  for people to understand where you're going through when you lose a spouse 
and uh I  uh uh I went  I was in this little town where FirstnameS lived 
didn't really have any  any  uh didn't have any uh limits on fireworks 
okay  that's only important because uh my kids wanted to have  fire wanted to have some fireworks 
and uh uh you_know oh  oh my kids wanted to have some fireworks 
so  I said 
 well  I'll tell you what 
well  not my kids my grandkids 
I said 
 I'll tell you what 
 we'll  g we'll call FirstnameS and ask her if we can go up there in Sedrick wh where they have no limits on what you can shoot off 
so  went up there  went up there 
and  and uh you_know I just said 
 FirstnameS  can we come up there and shoot off some fireworks 
and she said 
 sure  come ahead 
so  we did 
and then we started  started kind_of getting to know each other at that point 
because like I say you don't  you  you  if  unless you've lost a spouse you don't realize what it's like 
and so FirstnameS I kind_of had an immediate bond there because we had both lost  v recently lost our spouses 
and both of us had spouses that add 
it took years before he passed  passed away and  and my sh my wife 
and so you_know we started  we  s you_know it's  it was a  it was a  nat kinda a natural bond 
and so we ɑtu 
and um here we are 
and uh so FirstnameD is still  FirstnameD is still FirstnameS's best friend 
in_fact she was here just d yesterday or day before 
um they're still best friends 
and uh that's what happened to me was uh you_know my we me wet 
and uh that was fifteen years ago  fifteen years ago that we got married almost fifteen 
wait a minute 
see  lemme think 
lemme think 
no  it's over fifteen years 
it was fifteen last October 
okay 
okay 
well  I is a  there's a  there's a little  little boy 
not a real little boy 
he's not a little boy 
he's maybe I don't know  ten twelve  something in there 
he's out kicking the soccer ball around 
he's  ru he's wearing a ball cap 
and uh he's uh wearing jeans 
and he's kicking the soccer ball around 
and he kicks it  ri uh ha kicks it really hard 
raise his foot up so high that it goes way up in the air 
and then it goes to um it  uh then you see the  um the soccer ball travels through the air and hits a window 
uh there's shutters on the window 
um it's  um it's a nice size picture  not a picture window  good one  good size window 
and um there's a bushes outside the window 
um and it  the  the  the soccer ball comes through the window and hits a lamp 
knocks the lamp off the  off  out_of  knocks the lamp off the table 
but it knocks the lamp over 
and um no 
uh so  it knocks the lamp over and  and comes through the window 
um the guy is sitting there probably watching tv or something 
but uh he um gets up  picks up the s soccer ball  walks over to the window 
and um uh you_know the  the window 
I think we talked about this last time 
the window is there 
the  uh the lamp where the  w where the  where the um soccer ball came through the window is not there anymore 
it's  the lamp is gone 
the curtains are  are  are little bit different 
um there's  um I'm not sure what  what  I'm not sure what the uh 
yeah it's  there's  there  I'm not sure what some of the s something is there the 
anyway though there's a lady 
um and  but the  the lamp and the chair are no longer there 
um and I think the  uh I'm gonna say that the  uh the window ledge is  is lower than it was 
it just  it looks different 
um but the guy he looks out the window 
and I think  uh I think he doesn't know where it came from 
but I am sure he's probably going to find out 
and he's probably going to uh make somebody's pay for the window 
so  the moral of that story is if you're gonna kick a soccer ball around make sure it doesn't go through the window 
the end 
oh  I forgot the beginning and the end last time  didn't I 
okay  the beginning is that they  uh uh the  the  the  the  the little kid 
I think it's a boy 
is going off to school 
and the mom tries to hand him a  uh an umbrella 
and he says 
 mom  I don't need an umbrella 
 I'm a big kid 
 I don't need umbrella 
 it's not gonna rain 
 I'll walk 
 I'll be okay 
so  he waves goodbye to the mom 
he's got his backpack on 
head for school 
waves bye  tell  tells  uh tells mom goodbye 
and she's standing there holding the umbrella that the kid doesn't wanna take with him 
so  he starts walking off to school 
and um there's some  some raindrops coming down  not a_lot but just a few raindrops here and there 
and uh he looks up at the sky 
and he's like 
 oh_no what did I do 
 I didn't  br I didn't bring the umbrella 
so  he said 
 I think I'll  I think I'll go home and get the umbrella 
and he turns around 
and he  and it's raining harder 
and now the wind's kinda blowing because the rain's coming at an angle 
and uh it's  it's quite a bit of rain because as he  as he runs he's  he's uh splashing 
so  there's enough rain that's making  making little splashes 
and he's uh kinda holding his hand up over his head like  as_though he's gonna be able to stop the water off his head 
but he runs home 
and uh you can tell the  say the mom is a little  a_little um perturbed but he get  because he wouldn't take the umbrella 
so  there  there he is all wet head to toe wet dripping wet 
and the mom just kinda looks at him like 
 you  you  you_know y you  you shoulda listened to what I said 
he said 
 okay  I'm  I'll  okay 
 so  give me the umbrella 
so  she gives him ber uh umbrella 
and he head  heads back to school 
and uh it's still raining 
it's still raining pretty hard 
uh it's coming down at an angle even more of an angle than it was 
so  it must be belo blowing pretty hard at a forty five degree angle 
and uh he's walk  he's got his backpack 
and he's walking h off to school 
and uh I  the  uh the moral of the story is listen to your mom 
she knows best 
the end 
oh  yeah  I've seen this one before  okay 
okay 
so  the beginning is  the beginning is the cat crawled up the tree 
and the little girl is upset because the cat's up the tree 
and she can't get her down 
I think she's calling the cat to come down 
but the cat won't come down 
so  uh either cat won't or can't 
but it looks like the cat really doesn't care to come down 
he's like 
 I'm here on this branch 
 and I'm happy 
 so  yall can worry about it all you want 
 but I'm not coming down 
so  the little girl says you_know 
 daddy daddy daddy 
uh and she's  uh the little girl is probably 
I don't know 
she's pretty young because she's still riding a tricycle 
and she got pigtails and little black sandals 
um like I said she's riding  riding that little trik tricycle 
the cat won't  the cat won't come down 
so  apparently the  uh uh the  the dad musta gone up this tree to get the cat down 
and uh he  he leaned the ladder against the tree uh to crawl up there 
and um something happened 
I'm gonna guess maybe the dog that is barking up the tree uh ran into the ladder or something 
but something hit the ladder and knocked it down 
the dad's stuck in the tree 
and um I don't know who called the fire department unless he had a cellphone 
maybe it's  maybe uh uh 
I don't know 
that's  he musta had a cellphone 
he calls the fire department 
and the fire department came with their truck and two firefighters 
and they're carrying their ladder 
and they're running over to get the man down outta  outta the tree 
um meanwhile the dog is barking up the tree 
I don't know if he's  I don't think  I don't think he's mad 
I think he's just ba barking up the kriu 
so  the  um the firemen are on their way 
they've got their ladder 
um truck's sitting out and set on the  setting out on the street 
um there's a bird sitting in the tree just whistling away 
um and um yeah then that's  that's pretty much it 
it's a  it's a  it's a big tree  big tree 
um yeah both 
and it is  it's summertime because the trees have leaves on  on 
uh yeah  okay  well  that's  that's about good 
okay 
okay 
alright  well  at the beginning I  I don't know if this is true or not 
I don't know if this is really what  what happened in the story 
but looks like  um it looks like that for some reason um maybe somebody took  somebody took his daughter to live with somebody else 
and um I don't know the story behind that 
but that's what it looks like 
and then  um so  she says 
 great  you_know I've got my two dollar 
 and she can be  you_know they can all be friends 
well  when  when she's gone it turns out that um Cinderella actually became more of uh a servant than a friend 
um uh she musta  she musta been sleeping in the  um uh out in the stable with the animals  I guess 
um she  in one picture she was making tea for the two daughters 
um she was doing their laundry 
she was doing all the work 
and um like I said she had become more of a slave than  than anything else 
so  um they lived in the  in the shadow of  of the castle 
and  um I think she dreamt about the castle 
um looks like she was in the one picture  it looked like she was dreaming of what life must be like if she lived in the castle or something like that 
that's what it looks like anyway 
and um so it turns out that the  that the king  little short fat king 
I don't know why the little short  why the king is always short and fat but he is 
uh is looking for somebody to marry his  his daughter 
and uh he is going to throw a party for all the beautiful girls in the kingdom so_that the  uh the  the  the girls can have their  their pick of uh 
they can't have their pick 
but he can have his pick of all the girls who come to the ball 
and uh they'll have a chance to show off to  to the prince and see if they can catch his eye and marry him 
so  um he sent out this invitation 
and of_course the  um the  the  the wicked stepmother or the  whatever she is  the mother  she um of_course doesn't let  doesn't want Cinderella to go to the ball 
so  uh um the other girls go off to the ball 
and Cinderella stays home 
and  and she's go gotta tend to the animals or whatever 
um so  the uh fairy godmother came along 
and I'm not sure how she got into the story 
but she came along 
the fairy godmother um showed up and al a with a  uh with a carriage a pumpkin 
uh it was that  um the I guess fairy godmother turned the  turned the  turned a pumpkin into a carriage for a  for the  gir for Cinderella to ride in 
they went to the  uh went to the ball with the two horses and  and the footman and the  and the driver and all that 
they went to the  went to the ball  they went to the ball  but uh they went to the ball 
and the  uh nobody knew who was Cinderella was because she was so beautiful 
so  she uh the  uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hasta be home by midnight or the uh pumpkin 
and so about a minute before midnight she realizes what time it is 
they  uh up on the Big Ben on the clock you could see it's about a minute before midnight 
and Cinderella runs downstairs before the  uh before the  the um pumpkin turns back into a pumpkin while it's still a carriage 
runs ho or  runs and g dʒɛnu 
but uh in the way she lost her slipper 
she was running down the stairs 
the slipper fell off 
and uh she didn't have time to go back and pick it up  I guess 
so  she went on  got in the carriage with you_know the carriage and went home 
the  uh the prince was heartbroken because he and  and me  because he had fallen in love with this beautiful girl who had come to the  who had come to the ball 
and nobody knew who she was 
but he had fallen in love with her 
and so he sent  uh he sent  everyb he sent his um man or servants or whatever out to find this  uh the person whose foot would fit in the slipper 
and so they went to Cinderella's house 
and um of_course the  uh the two sisters there uh they tried it on 
and of_course it didn't fit 
and uh so the  uh Cinderella was there as a servant 
and uh I think the  uh I think the uh fairy godmother or something said  made  um worked it out somehow that  so_that the  uh the  the prince would try the slipper on Cinderella's foot 
and sure enough it fit perfectly 
it was perfectly obvious whose  whose foot it was 
and it was Cinderella's 
and so um everybody was happy 
all the animals were happy 
the  l the animals were  cel the  the little rats 
everyone was celebrating uh as the  uh as Cinderella gets in the  uh the  the carriage with the prince 
and they ride off into the distance and live happily ever after 
you get  uh you  you get some  you got some bread 
that's the first thing  I guess 
get  get  get the bread out_of the  uh out_of the  out_of the refrigerator because I  we keep our bread in the refrigerator 
so  you get the bread out 
then you go to the pantry 
and you uh get out the  uh the peanut butter 
open the peanut butter 
and is  is this a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
I  g I think it is 
so  then I  uh then uh I go back to the refrigerator and uh take out the  uh take out the jelly 
and uh open up the bread sack 
and open up the uh peanut butter jar 
and open up the  uh open up the uh jar of jelly 
uh I go to the uh knife drawer near the drawer where we keep the silverware 
and I take out a knife and uh take out two pieces of bread 
and I spread the peanut butter on  on one of the pieces of bread 
and then I uh take another piece of bread and spread peanut  um jelly on the  on that one 
I put them together 
and um I uh go put the  uh the  wo the knife in the dishwasher so it gets cleaned up 
and uh put the jar  jelly jar back in the uh refrigerator 
and put the uh uh bread back in the refrigerator 
and then I go over and put the uh uh peanut butter back in the pantry 
and then I uh sit down and eat my peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
and that's it
