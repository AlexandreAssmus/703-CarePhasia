but it's not where I would like it 
so  so_so 
yes I do 
okay 
okay  so  um on the day of my stroke I had  t um I had a pain in my stomach 
so  I  it was really bad 
so  I went to the hɑsəbəlu 
and they said that it was um 
oh_my_goodness 
um it was um 
what 
I was having kɪznɪu 
um and so they gave me some medicines because I would have to pass them 
um and I'm not really good with um pills 
but I went ahead and took them again 
and um so when I got home um I took them 
and my husband um made sure the kids were okay getting out_of school 
and then he did dinner and all that why 
um and I think about  it was eight o'clock 
I came to the lɪvrɪŋu 
and I was um ta talking to my husband 
only it felt like I was really drunk 
and he's like 
 are you okay 
and I go 
 oh  I just don't like the pills 
so  I went back to the room and went back to bed 
and around eleven um I hadta go to the bathroom 
and when I got ou up out_of the bed I fell down 
and I couldn't get up 
and then I couldn't like talk at all 
I could hear my h um husband saying 
 are you okay 
and I couldn't say 
 no I'm not 
um and he knew something wasn't right 
so  he put me on the bed 
and he called nineoneone 
and um he  we live in a um 
s s sorry today's not good 
um we live in a  um our house is a split level 
so  they  he went outside to get the um æməlɪntsu 
and I  I wanted to change my pideɪzu 
so  I went to the closet 
and I was trying to figure it  to put something on 
and I fell in the closet 
so  when my husband came in the room it w 
because he was like 
 where are you 
and I was in the closet 
it was kind_of funny even_though it wasn't 
so  they had to put me i on the  um 
so  they helped me get out and put it  me in the æmɪlɛntsu 
and my husband could not go with me right  no that time because the kids were at home 
so  he went and got a neighbor to set 
and then his friend took him to the hɑsəbəlu 
so  he was right behind me 
um and then when I got in the hɑsəbəlu 
and I couldn't talk to them and tell them hi or anything 
and then my husband was there and his friend 
and I think I was in the i_c_u for about a week 
and I was talking to my husband last night because we were watching a show about a person that had a stroke 
and he was kinda crazy 
and I was like 
 was I kind_of crazy 
he's like 
 yeah you kinda were 
I was like 
 whatever 
I think he's just mean to me 
um but I think for the  because I still had the kidney stones that they were p passing through me 
and I don't remember a whole bunch 
but my mom said this that I was tr um yelling a_lot 
and then after that they put me to anov another um room for a week 
and then after that I went to the therapy  um um uh the therapy floor for about four m weeks before I went home 
sorry  I think that's t it 
right  that's right 
well  when I was in um therapy I had a_lot_of um speech s therapy and then um um p_t and o_t so I could  um because I was in a wheelchair for a while 
e even when I got home I was in my wheelchair for two months 
so  I had to give  get up and out_of the wheelchair 
um so  I knew how to get in the bed and get out 
um I  di with my hand I did a_lot_of stuff like um combing my hair um brushing my teeth um trying to um cook stuff um sorry  and  um and walking 
when I got home I then went to an outpatient therapy about three times a week and was probably about three hours 
was the same thing only I was trying to walk better 
and then with um my hand doing more stuff around the house um you_know like cooking because I hafta cook for my husband and the kids 
so  um what I can do with boʊku 
um and we have a_lot_of stairs in my house 
so  a_lot_of going up and down 
and then um with the Cova 
and then last week I went to a gym 
and um I have a friend that is a personal trainer 
so  last week I did a_lot_of stuff with my um upper body 
and then today I'm gonna go see her and work on my lower body because I want to run this year 
that's my goal 
so  so  a_lots_of 
right 
okay  I  th I know I tote 
um see  what else can I say 
well  you_know the one thing that has been awesome this l last year was um I couldn't drive after my stroke 
and um so it was nine months that I would hafta ask someone to help me to go somewhere 
or I would have to get a jubɚu 
and sometimes I would hafta go to Boise 
and I would hafta get a jubɚu 
and that would be fifty dollars one way 
it was crazy 
and um my h sister would help me out sometimes 
and my um mother inlaw would help me out and when my husband would too 
but I really wanted to drive 
and there's only one lady from Twin Falls that is like two hours away from me to Oregon kin  s
she's the only lady that will help people that had strokes or brain ændʒɚiz 
so  I was on the list for three months 
so  uh when I was able to um go to the class I had to do a_lot_of mɛmbɚizu 
and y you_know a_lot_of people that have strokes they can only see out_of one eye 
so  I hadta make sure I could see just fine 
I had do a_lot_of s tests 
um there was like a big board 
and it would have um uh lights that would come up 
and I would hafta smack them 
and I had to be really fast 
and when I was able to pass that then I had to go to drivers' ed 
and it was kinda weird 
and then I hafta drive with my left hand 
so  I have a knob that I do on the stiriu 
and then I drive with my left foot 
so  they put a um oh it's like a um 
oh  how do I say it 
um they put a 
so  on your pedal they put a block in front of it 
so  I don't  I can't have it go down 
and then I'm able  they put another pedal over on my left foot 
so  I can drive with uh my left fʊktu 
so  it was kinda weird to figure that out when you've been on your l right hand all the time 
so  it took me about two months after I was  went to the class and everything 
and then I had the doctor make sure that I was okay and I was able to drive 
and I felt like I was like sixteen again because I was like 
 freedom 
and um the only thing they my hus or  my doctor doesn't want me to go on the freeways in  ca unless is 
but I can get to everything on the back rows 
it just takes me a little bit longer 
but I can drive 
so  that's really cool 
right 
um so  there is a little boy that was playing with his stocker 
and he wasn't paying attention 
and he  um ki he kicks it 
and it goes through a window 
and then the ball um knocks over a lamp 
and there's a um neighbor 
he gets the ball 
and he's looking outside the window to figure out who kicked it hi at his house 
right 
um okay  so  there's they 
and his mom says 
 it's going to rain today 
you might want to take a ənbrɛləu 
and the little boy is like 
 no  I'll be just fine 
and he started to go to school 
and it's starting to rain a little bit 
and then it really was raining 
so  he went back home and told his mom 
 yep you were right 
 can I have the umbrella 
and then he has his  the əmbɚɛləu 
and he's able to go out to  he can neo now go to school because he's not getting rain on him 
okay 
I'm gonna say there was a little girl that was riding on her bike 
and um she had her um dog with her 
and a cat was by them 
and a cat went up in the tree 
and the dog was barking 
and she couldn't get him 
so  there was a nice guy that came along 
and he was trying to help them get the cat outs out_of the tree 
and he put  had a ladder 
and um the  the dog pushed it down 
so  he was  su he was  su he was in the  cr 
oh_my_goodness 
he was in the kriu 
and he couldn't get down 
so  then a  the firefighters came to help them to get the ban 
sorry 
okay  okay 
um so  Cinderella had a um dad when she was little 
and I think her mom passed away 
and he wanted her to have a um mom 
so  he married a um w lady that had two um daughters 
and he got really sick 
and he died later 
and I think they were tinɚeɪdʒɚzu 
and the  s s spet the stepmom made her do all the chores 
and um she was beɪsəlɪu 
and her  the stɛkmɑmu 
so  Cinderella had a_lot_of æmɪnəlzu 
she had a horse and a dog and mice 
and h she would make little um clothes for the mice 
oh  and I think there was  m burrs 
and um she was always deɪdrinɪŋu 
and there would be something better for her 
and um the king had a prince 
and he wanna 
so  he wanted to have a ball 
and he invited everyone in the kingdom 
and when the s stɛkmɑmu 
 well  it says that everyone in the kɪŋdʌbu 
she's like 
 well  you'll have to figure what to wear because you can't look like what you're wearing right now 
and she had a um dress that was her mom's that she need 
but the stepmom and her sɛksɪstɚzu 
so  she was never gonna be able to get the dress done 
so  the mice saw that they  that sɪkɪndrɛlrɛləu 
so  they snuck downstairs and looked at stuff that the stɛpsistɚzu 
and they got a ribbon and some pearls 
and then they went  they were able to help with each other 
and the birds make her dress ready 
so  when they were able to get ready for the ball um the  stus the stepsisters and the stepmom said 
 well  we're going 
 you're  you don't have anything to wear 
and she went to her room 
and all_the_sudden 
so  she hurry 
 late 
and then th the mom was like 
 well  that kinda looks like your pearls and your ribbon 
she was talking to the stepsisters 
and they were like 
 oh_my_goodness that was ours 
so  they took it and um ripped it 
and then clears_throat they went to the ball 
and Cinderella went outside in the garden 
and she was crying 
and then her feɪrɚu 
and she told her what  hap ha what happened 
so  she made a coach out_of a pʌmpɪnu 
um I think they  she ts had three of the mice be horses  the dog be the um coachman and then the  another coachman was the horse 
and she was like 
 okay  go ahead 
and she's like 
 well  what_about my outfit 
so  she made her a beautiful um dress 
and  and she had glass s um s um shoes and told her that she can do all this but when it is midnight it all s goes away 
so  she went to the ball 
and she met the prince 
and they dʒæntsu 
and then all it  all_of_suhven 
and she was trying to get away so she didn't have everything go away 
and as she was running away one of her shoes came off of her 
and  um and then she was able to get home without the prince knowing that she was  um looked like she was before her  her fairy godmother helped her out 
so  the next day um Cinderella was having such a good day 
and then there was about another announcement that the girl that  that  that was dancing with the prince had a s shoe 
and whoever it fit  that is who he was going to  mel rel was going to marry 
um and the stɛkmɑmu 
and she kinda looked like the girl that was dancing with him 
so  she put her in her room and locked her in h her room 
and she had her key in her pocket 
when um the duke came and let everyone in trying up 
and um why 
when  s when the stepmom saw that she was outs coming down to try on the s s shoe she trip 
and he was like 
 oh_my_goodness I'm ɪŋɛtu 
and she's like 
 oh you'll be just fine because I have the other shoe 
and she put it on 
and she was able to marry the prince 
and they live happily ever after 
the end 
okay 
so  um so  again I would t take my bread and put it in the toʊtʃstɚu 
and then um when it was done with the toaster I would put um peanut butter on one side 
and then um I was 
and then I would take the jelly and put it on the other side and spread it out 
and then I would put them together 
and then I would take a knife and cut it in half 
and that's what you  you would do
