um I think is better than when I had my s stroke because all I could say for like two weeks was no 
so  I think it's gone s better 
yes I do 
okay 
um so  um on the day that I had my stroke in the um æftrununu 
and I thought I was dying really 
so  I went to the  um m the e_r 
and I had um s um s stones kidding 
um I'll tell you I would never want anyone to ever have that 
um so  they gave me some pills and told me just go home 
and it will  pl it will pass 
um and I'm not really good with um pills 
it makes me feel like I'm not in my head 
so  I dʊdu 
and I went to sleep 
um and then probably around like I think it was eight in the iviŋu 
and I was talking to my husband 
and I kind_of felt like I was drunk 
and I thought it was probably because_of the pills 
um and he told me 
 you need to go back to bed 
um so  I went back to bed 
and um probably around eleven um I got up to go to the bathroom 
and I fell 
I was like 
 that's kinda weird 
and I tried to get up 
and um I couldn't 
and um my husband heard me 
he was in the other room 
and um he helped me get up 
and he knew that sʌmpwɪnu 
um I couldn't say anything 
um so  he went ahead and called nineoneone 
and he went outside to um l um make sure that the æməlɪntsu 
and I was on the um bed 
and I was like 
 oh_my_gosh I'm in my p_js 
so  I was trying to goes 
and I fell inside of the closet 
so  when my husband came with everyone they found me in the collet 
and my hʌzəmu 
 really 
and um then I  r they had to take me to Boise 
um so  that's about almost um twenty five miles to get there 
um my husband could not come with be 
um so  um I just r rode with them to the hɑsəbəlu 
and then I got there 
and my sister and um her husband were already there 
and then my husband came later 
and I know that um after that um I was in i_c_u for like a week 
and that was kinda weird because I don't remember a_lot 
but I know that I hadta pass those stupid stones 
and my mom said that I was um streaming 
and then I was  um then after that for a week then I went to another floor 
I can't remember why 
and after that then I went to rehab 
so  and I was there for about six weeks 
so  that's  that was all my fun stuff 
right 
that's  so  that's why I don't do um a_lot_of  I don't do coffee and popn because I would go  on my way to work I would have like two cups of coffee 
and then I would get to work 
and then we'd go  go out and get a coffee 
and then at lunch I would have a popn 
and then after my midizu 
or I would get another coffee 
um it was really bad 
uh I  sighs and I think y that  I think that was why I had the kidney stones 
it was really bad 
I would never want anyone to ever have that 
right INV
right  um so  when uh w I was in the hɑsəbəlu 
and the guy that helped me with that he was just amazing 
you_know I had to figure out to sorry  how to get u up o out_of the chair and get to the wheelchair and then how to get out_of the wheelchair and get in the bed 
um and then he would make me walk with him um because I didn't want to be in the wheelschair 
um and then we did a_lot_of um the walker 
um and then uh after the hɑsəbəlu 
and then  um and then they ga gave me the brace 
um but um th that was after the hɑsəbəlu 
when I was in there I did a_lot with my foot and my h hands um like how to dress yourself with one arm 
just saying that is kinda weird 
um I had to get 
m my hair useta be really long 
and um I had to cut it off so I can do something with uh my hair 
um and to do your makeup with your left hand 
you_know I can't do my um eye liner still 
but that's been um ɪnstrəstɪŋu 
and then I went to speech a_lot too when I was in the hɑsəbəlu 
and then after the hɑsəbəlu 
and that was a_lot 
um I would get home 
and I would just um go to my bed and just sleep because th they had you do a_lot um so you can walk 
and then we did a_lot_of swimming 
that is really goods 
I don't know how sʊu 
like you don't feel like you're like ugh trying to walk 
when you get in the pool you can walk like you used to 
so  I really like to go to the pool 
um and then after that um just I  um the people that helped me with my foot and my leg they gave me a_lot_of exercises 
and I make sure that I do that at home 
and hoʊpəlɪu 
I don't wanna go there right now until I don't know  ənfɪlu 
so 
oh_goodness 
uh well  probably  y probably you_know I love my kɪzu 
they are the joy uh of my life 
um my um son 
um when I met my husband 
um this is a little bit too much 
but I'll tell you anyways 
um when I met him he just got out_of a relationship 
and me and him were deɪfɪŋu 
and this lady said that she was prɛdjɪntu 
and um my husband I 
this was new 
so  it's like 
 we'll see what happens you_know 
and um we just never left each other's side 
and the lady that he was in um um she got 
after she had my son 
because I say my son 
um she got really into drugs really bad 
and um so my husband and I took him when he was probably two months old 
and he's always known me as mom 
and  um and he lived with us 
and he n didn't really see the other mom for awhile 
and when he was seven um I wanted to um ədɑpu 
and it  groans and then the girl wanna come back and make sure she was a mom 
but she really wasn't 
so  we hadta go through all the  um to the course 
and it was a_lot_of cheers 
um and ill 
and then  um and then we were able to ədɑpu 
and we had to go t in front of the dʒʌdzu 
and it was  t even my uh son was so happy 
it was like the best day ever 
and um sometimes he's a little butthead 
but I would never ever do it  anything different ever because_of it's really good for us 
so 
okay  so  there's um a kid again 
um um he's playing soccer 
and it went through a neighbor's window 
um and it's 
oh it goes through the window 
and it breaks a lamp 
and the neighbor has the ball looking outside to see what's going on 
and that's all I have 
okay 
so  um th the mom told the son 
 you probably need to have a ʌmbɚɛləu 
and he was like 
 yeah I don't need it 
 I  I'll be okay 
and um so then the boy went outside 
it was  it was raining 
and then it was really raining 
and he had to turn around and go back to home and tell his mom 
 yeah you're right 
and she went ahead and gave him the ʌnbrɛlələu 
and then he was able to go for a walk just fine 
um okay so um 
okay  I'm gonna say there  this little girl was riding her bike 
and  um and her dog was with her 
and they came across a cat 
and the dog was trying to get the cat 
and it was up in the tree 
and shoe 
and a  um maybe it's a neighbor saw the cat in the tree 
and he tried to put a ladder up so he could get the cat 
and um the ladder fell down 
and he couldn't get the cat 
so  then the fire 
uh wha what are they called 
um firefighters can see it 
so  they came over to get everyone down from the tree um and the cat 
I guess that would be it 
okay sounds good 
um so  there  w y there was a guy um that had a doctor 
and her um mother was um not there any more 
and he wanted her to have a new stepmom 
so  he um married a lady that had two girls already 
and then he died 
and the  s ste the stepmom was not nice 
and she made Cinderella be the um maid 
she would have to make sure that she did the floors and made food and make sure that everything was clean 
um and the s her sɛpsɪstɚzu 
I can't remember their names 
they were not really nice to her either 
so  really all Cinderella had was the ænmɪnəlzu 
they  h she had a  hor a horse  a dog 
and um she had m um mice 
and she would make um clothes for the mice 
and then there was a cat that was her  sut her  s the cat was the stepmom  m
and he was not nice 
so  um one day when 
sorry 
so  that was kind_of about their house 
um there was also a keen 
and he wanted him to get married 
um so  he did a  um wanted to do a ball and to invite everyone in the kingdom 
so  um at sɛndɚɛləzu 
and when they got the invitation Cinderella was like 
 I can go too because I'm a part of the kingdom too 
and her xxx all your chores 
so  she looked at a um book how she wanted to get her dress 
but her sis otr  her stɛpsistɚzu 
so  she can never get her dress done 
so  the mice saw that she would never be able to go because they were making her s do so much 
so  they səsɑɪdɪdu 
why 
there was like some pearls and some ribbon that they took from them because they said they didn't want them 
and they helped sue 
so  when she was  everyone else was ready to go to the ball sɪnɚɛlu 
so  she went to her room 
and she saw the dress that the mice help 
so  she put it on and was running down the stairs 
and her  stes her stɛpsɪsɚu  p
 oh those are are my bees 
 and that's my ribbon 
and they started to tear her dress apart 
so  she couldn't go to the ball 
and she went to the j grɑrdɪnu 
and she was crying 
um then all_of_the_sudden 
and she told her what's going on 
so  she's like 
 oh you hafta go to the ball 
so  they  she took a pʌŋkɪnu 
and then um I think she took the mice and turn 
and then the horse she turn 
oh  what do you call it 
like a person to open the doors for the koʊʃu 
and um then she made Cinderella um a br a beautiful dress and glass slippers 
and she told her everything will be okay until it's midnight 
and then everything will go back to how it was 
so  she went to the ball 
and she met the prɪsu 
and they were dancing the whole time 
and her  se her stepsisters were kind_of jealous 
um and then all_the_suhven 
and it was rinɪŋu 
and she was trying to leave 
and she was going down the stairs 
and she left one of her glass slippers 
and the prince found it 
and um sorry  so sis Cinderella got home 
and um the  fr the prince said whoever fits in the glass slipper he will marry 
so  wʌdu 
what are they called 
can't remember 
the  some guy that works at the um palace hadta go to ɛvɚwʌnzu 
um so  they  ha he was going to all the houses 
and  um and when  and  so  so  he was looking fruu 
and Cinderella that next day w she was like in um 
oh  do you call it 
like she was being dʒeingrimɪu 
and the um stepmom knew that something about her was not right 
and when they came into her house she knew that Cinderella was the girl 
so  she locked her in the  her room 
and why 
so  when sɪnɚɛləu 
 hey I can try it on too 
the sɛpʌðɚu 
and he was like 
 oh_my_goodness now I'm be in so much trouble 
and then sɪnɪrɛləu 
and she's like 
 oh but this will help too 
she  the guy was like 
 oh 
so  then they  then she was  went to the palace 
and she got married 
that was the end oh_my_goodness

and when it came out I would put um jelly on one side 
and then um I would get a knife and do peanut butter on the other side 
and then I would put them together 
and then I would cut them in hæpsu
