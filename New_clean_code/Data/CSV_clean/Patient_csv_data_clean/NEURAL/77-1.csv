I can say what I want to 
it is just very halting 
and I can't find the words all the time 
I think it happened at night when I was asleep 
it was at breakfast time 
and I couldn't say what I wanted to 
the words wouldn't come 
I  I went to a rehab facility for one week 
and there was a speech therapist there 
and she did um little kinds of tests 
then I came home 
and I had a speech therapist for once a week 
and she is almost done 
and now I am doing Arc Zoom kind of events 
and I try to do two or three a week 
I don't know how to tell a story 
um I  I can't  I don't snory 
um I  I don't  can't think of a story 
um there was a man 
and we play pickleball together 
and he died on the court uh two days ago 
yes  it was a shock 
and I was upset about it 
um the boy is kicking a ball 
and the ball hits a window and breaks it 
and it comes in and surprises the man in the chair 
the ball came into the room and knocked over the lamp 
and the man stands up from the chair and looks out the window where the ball came from 
oh okay 
I think that the mother is trying to give the umbrella to the boy 
but the boy says no 
and he doesn't want the umbrella 
and then he goes along 
and all_of_a_sudden he gets rained on 
and then he goes back 
and he is wet 
and he tells his mother that he is unhappy and wet 
and she gives him the umbrella 
and he goes back out 
and has the umbrella to protect him from the rain 
I think that the man tried to climb up in the tree to get the cat 
but the ladder fell down 
and he was not able to get down 
and the dog is barking 
and the firemen are coming to get the man down and to take the kitty out_of the tree 
alright 
the book begins when the father comes home 
and he introduces his daughter to the s new stepmother and the two stepsisters 
then it goes on and shows that they do not take very good care of her 
the father died 
and the stepmother and her daughters were not nice to Cinderella 
she had to take care of the horses in the stable and was not being treated very well 
then there came uh an announcement that the kingdom was going to have a ball 
and that Cinderella wanted to go 
and the mice helped her make a pretty dress 
but the bad stepsisters tore the dress apart and the necklace that she was going to wear 
and they locked her in her room 
but the mice came and helped her and get out_of the room 
and she had a fairy godmother 
and the fairy godmother made a beautiful white dress and a pumpkin and turned into a beautiful coach 
and the mice were beautiful horses 
and the carriage took her to the ball 
and she had a dance with the prince 
and they were very happy 
she was very worried about the time 
and the clock ruck 
and she had to hurry away down the stairs 
and in the process she lost one of her glass slippers 
and the pumpkin no  carriage turned back into a pumpkin and the mice back  the horses back into mice 
and then they made an announcement in the kingdom that they were going to look for the lady who had the foot that would fit in it 
and then the stepmother and the stepdaughters tried 
and Cinderella came out 
and the glass slipper fit her foot perfectly 
and then she married the prince 
and they lived happily ever after 
I would have two pieces of bread 
and on one I would spread the jam 
and on the other I would spread the peanut butter 
then I would put them together into a sandwich
