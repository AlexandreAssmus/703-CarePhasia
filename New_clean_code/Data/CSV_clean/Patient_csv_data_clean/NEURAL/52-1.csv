uh sometimes my speech is good 
sometimes it  uh it is not so good 
uh vocabulary I miss some words 
sometimes I can't think the word 
uh sometimes I think I don't enunciate real clearly 
um other times it's better 
sometimes is good 
sʌmzətɑɪmu 
um oh let's see 
yeah sometimes I say things backwards 
does it  does it  is it okay if I cheat here and get coaching 
I said some things backwards 
so  if I'll say 
 um uh if it's  if it  if it's big I'd say small and so_forth 
um I think those are the main issues I have 
no I don't remember anything for about six weeks 
the first memories that I had after my stroke are  were very cloudy 
uh and they were not accurate  uh they were not accurate 
for example I  I remember being in a wheelchair 
and I thought I was sitting up in the wheelchair 
but as I found out later I was actually leaning back in the weɪrtʃeɪru 
and I was strapped in because I couldn't sit up on my own 
uh those  um for about two months I  I  I really didn't  I couldn't remember  I remembered  al remembered almost nothing 
um and some of the things I had were um very much um incorrect 
um I found out later things I thought 
and then uh when I first started remembering things um I was mooz was at that point I was moved to a uh rɪləbɪləteɪʃɪnu 
and those are really the first memories I have that were somewhat distinct uh somewhat accurate 
uh and that was probably um month and a half or two months in 
then I  uh I started remembering things but  but it was slow coming back very slow coming back 
um one thing that  that I didn't know was that uh as I was  as it was coming and waking up I guess I was getting  getting around to being able to talk 
I thought I was talking 
but I found out later that I wasn't  that I couldn't talk clearly 
I couldn't say anything 
I just kinda mutter it and mumbling 
and so I don't remember when I started talking because in my mind I was always talking just  just fine 
and I felt like  uh feel like  you feel like maybe I was uh a baby tried to talk 
and I thought everybody should understand me 
but apparently in_fact nobody did 
and um that happened for a long that 
well  in my mind I've always been able to talk right 
now um maybe in the last year or so I'm much more aware of the fact that I don't talk plainly 
um th that  that's  that's kind_of the um the story of my memories that I  that I have 
well  it was laugh 
still is 
well  I was  I spent six months in uh um first of all in some oh I guess critical care places 
and then uh went to  went to  after about two months I went  went into um the um long term 
well  I went to  went to a couple of rehab hospitals for awhile for two or three weeks each 
and uh then I started remembering 
and I started doing some  some therapy of that sort at that time 
um I couldn't do much of anything 
um I thought I could do more than I really could 
um but I really couldn't do much 
I  uh after six months I got  got home 
and I did some  uh I had somebody come uh on outpatient basis and work with me for about six weeks 
uh a physical therapist was  uh a speech therapist and  um and um occupational therapist 
uh at that point I really d wasn't doing much by myself because I really didn't know what to do 
uh probably after about  um oh maybe after about a year I started kind_of figuring out on my own stuff I needed to do 
I started  you_know um I did  I did have somebody that I worked with 
he was  uh he was kind_of a cognitive um specialist is about west 
he worked with me for about three years 
and I really felt like he did quite a bit of good to  in terms of my cognition 
and uh I worked  uh worked on um 
I don't know if you've heard of uh uh Brain_HQ 
have  are you familiar with that program 
okay 
so  I've worked  I worked with the Brain_HQ program um a_lot um for four years maybe five years now whatever 
um of_course I've  I've done  I've  I've worked  I've  when I finished  um when I finished the time that I had for uh physical therapy 
you_know there's a limit  limit on how much you can do in physical therapy according to Medicare 
um I  s I started going to the  um to the YMCA uh twice a week 
and I worked with a  uh worked with a uh trainer there who was really good at helping me uh do some things I needed to do 
uh and then I also started going sometimes to the YMCA on my own um just to get more  more time in of w working at stuff like that 
um I  wor are you familiar with  um with um FitMi 
and uh I can see you're not 
are you familiar with Flint Rehab 
okay y you should be 
um look up Flint Rehab on the line because I have  I have the  um I have the um MusicGlove 
and I have the um FitMi 
and it  an from  from  from um Flint Rehab 
and they also have uh exercises online that you can do 
so  I  y it's  it's helped me to have that resource a_lot 
um I would  uh you_know I'd encourage anybody who's had a stroke to maybe l look at that 
um they have a  uh they have a  the  uh Flint Rehab has  has this uh uh webpage on  on Facebook 
and it's  it's more of  it's kind_of a uh support webpage 
so  you can hear other stories and so_forth other people and what they're dealing with and what they're kʌmpɪnʃtɑu 
um do you work on a_lot with  with stroke 
you work a_lot with stroke victims 
yeah 
yeah I'm  I'm sure you haven't yeah 
but I would  I would  I would  I mentioned that because I think it's a good resource for anybody who had a stroke 
and I'd certainly encourage you as  as somebody who wants to work with stroke victims to  um to become familiar with the reher re resources that they offer 
um I think there's  there's also a  um a re 
become  become familiar with recently was there's a book called um uh stroke warrior 
I think it  it's a  it's a good resource 
um it's  it's a  written by an individual who's  who had a serious  serious stroke when her  in her  in her forties 
um am I getting off the  off the track here 
tell me what  tell me  get me back on track 
and I'll  where should I be 
and  well  you know I  I do a  I've done a_lot_of things 
and I've done you_know a_lot_of uh physical activity kinds of things like my stationary bike 
um I've done a_lot_of um mental stuff uh like the um uh 
or I useta do that when I first came home 
I did a_lot_of crosswords and sudoku and stuff like that 
um I've just tried to do a_lot_of  d I've tried to do a_lot_of stuff on my own to  to get better 
and um that's it 
just something that happened to me 
um you_know I've done a_lot_of traveling 
that count

yeah I've  I've done  yeah I've done several trips with 
my wife and I have done several trips 
um and uh we've gone to Europe several times 
and I have just really really enjoyed that 
um yeah I  I just couldn't  couldn't really describe each trip to you 
but that  that's something 
something else that  maybe I should tell you this 
this is  maybe it's  maybe I can go into a little more detail here 
um I  I really enjoy riding bicycles 
and um we've  we've done a_lot_of r riding bicycling uh my wife and I for number of years 
and um we've done you_know like um a bicycle ride all the way across Kansas 
it's called Biking Across Kansas 
we've done  uh we've done  we  we had a group that we went biking with once or twice a week um thirty to fifty miles at a  at a time 
we'd go  go somewhere and ride somewhere for breakfast and come back 
I just  it was a_lot  really a_lot_of fan 
really we enjoyed that 
um yeah it  it  yeah I  I've enjoyed work  you_know riding bike and working on the bicycles 
and it  it  it's been something that we can do together and really enjoy doing it 
so  let's see 
the kid is out kicking the soccer ball 
uh yeah he kicks it pretty hard 
goes up  uh up pretty high 
and it goes pretty far 
and it goes through somebody's window 
and uh then it goes through  it goes through the window 
and the  this guy is  the guy is sitting there in the  in the chair as the  as the  uh as the ball comes crashing through the window and hits the lamp  knocks the lamp off and uh scares him  I guess 
and then I'm not sure exactly what happens after that 
but yeah there's a hole in the window then 
there's a hole in the window 
and he  the guy is holding the soccer ball looking out the window 
uh so  not sure what he's gonna do about the  uh about the kid who kicked the soccer ball through the window 
that's about it 
now  yeah 
I'm not sure 
well  let's see here 
yeah it w hit the window with the shutters on that 
um th there's a  there's a problem here because when the  when the ball comes through the window there's a lamp there 
and in  in the final picture the  the lamp is gone 
uh yeah the chair is gone  the chair he was sitting in is gone 
um and the guy's standing there and next to the window  I guess 
but the chair and the lamp are gone 
so  not sure what happened there 
okay that's about it 
okay 
um well  the  the  the  the little kid is going off to school 
and I think the mom wants him to take an umbrella with him 
but he's kinda waving it off saying 
 no I don't need umbrella 
 um yeah I'm going off to school 
 I'll be okay 
so  he goes and goes out the door tells the mom goodbye 
and um he gets out there going on his way to school 
and it starts raining 
and you can see he's kinda a_little worried there and worry it rains more and more 
and s now it's  uh it's a downpour 
and it's raining pretty hard 
and he's kinda running to get outta the rain 
and um he ran back home 
and uh he  he did uh see his mom is kinda upset by the fact that he didn't want to take the uh umbrella 
so  then he uh gets the umbrella to go off to school 
and he's happy going off to school with his umbrella 
okay 
well  the story is that um this little girl's cat got up in the tree 
and the  uh the dad went up to get the  get the cat down 
and he's got stuck in the tree 
and uh the  the dog is standing there barking up the tree 
I don't know if he's barking because he's trying to get that guy down or what 
but apparently he went up the tree on a ladder to get the cat down 
and in the process somehow the ladder 
maybe the dog hit the ladder 
but it  uh the ladder got knocked down 
so  the guy couldn't get  couldn't climb down the ladder 
so  they hadta call a fire department 
and they came 
and the couple of firemen there come running with the ladder 
and uh they're going to uh get the  get the  get the guy down from the tree 
now the cat in the meantime is sitting up in the tree 
and um I don't know if he's taking a nap or just 
but he doesn't really care 
he's not bothering him 
uh the little girl probably was  musta been riding her tricycle because it's sitting there 
uh but she is now trying to coax the cat down 
uh there's a bird there in the tree 
and he's just kinda singing away and probably i is oblivious to everything else that's going on 
um that's pretty much it 
the girl's got pigtails and all of that 
so  maybe she's a tomboy or something 
I don't know 
that's about it 
that's it 
okay 
well  Cinderella was a  uh Cinderella was I guess 
I think there was a  I think that uh Cinderella was actually had to work for the uh who's the  the got evil sisters 
and they weren't very nice to her 
they made her do the laundry 
um obviously in the story here all the  uh all the animals loved Cinderella because they're all in  they're all around whenever she is 
and they  they found that they  they like her a_lot because all the little animals are around when she's doing her thing 
um so the  um the  um the  the king has a son 
he's looking for a  uh looking for a bride for his  his son 
I didn't say that right did I 
yeah he was looking for a bride for his son 
and uh uh they  they were  he had  they were gonna have a ball 
so  they could all come and  and uh see who  who she 
and uh she was looking out the window in this one picture 
she was looking out the window kinda dreaming about it 
but uh she obviously hadn't been invited to the ball 
so  um they all went to the ball 
and  well  the  uh uh I don't remember exactly how it was that she ended up 
I guess the  the fairy godmother came while she was at  while they were at the ball 
the fairy godmother took a  told her to come to the ball and had a carriage that she'd uh take her to the ball in 
and it was a  a pumpkin carriage and uh gonna take them to the ball 
and uh I remember this one picture there that seemed a_little weird 
the horses were sitting on their hind legs with their  kinda with their feet up something like you_know 
they were  they were standing there on four legs 
uh it was kinda weird 
and uh so uh the fairy godmother took her to the ball 
and uh she at the ball and uh went in 
and nobody knew this  knew who it was uh because she was so  uh so beautiful 
nobody knew who she was 
and they had the ball 
and the  and the prince  the prince liked her 
and  um and then the  um the  the um chimes went off in the clock  big clock  Big_Ben or whatever 
and  uh and  w and Cinderella panicked because she was supposed to be home before or  back home before midnight 
and it was after midnight 
and uh so she got up 
she ran out 
and uh her slipper fell off 
and she went on 
she got home um without the slipper 
and then uh the  uh the prince started looking for whoever it was that had the  sl the slipper 
and he was trying  t he was uh trying the slipper on  er on everybody in the kingdom 
and um finally the  um the  um the  um they wanted to  he wanted to try it onto Cinderella 
but I think they  they the  the  the bad th th evil sisters didn't want her  didn't want him to 
but he did anyway 
he 
and it fit 
and  uh and the end uh Cinderella married the prince and uh lived happily ever after I guess 
okay 
well  I guess uh first thing I do is go to the pantry 
and I get out the peanut butter 
and uh then I go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out 
and um I'd get some bread out_of the freezer  uh the refrigerator because that's where we keep the bread 
keeps it fresh  fresh 
and uh then I would  um I would um take out two pieces of bread 
and I'd spread  uh I'd spread peanut butter on one of them 
and then I would spread jelly on the other one 
and I would um uh put the two together 
and I'd have a uh peanut butter dʒænu 
and then I would uh put the bread away back in the refrigerator 
and I'd put the peanut butter away in the uh pantry 
and I'd put the  uh um the jelly away in the refrigerator 
and then I'd sit down and eat my peanut butter sandwich with a glass of milk
