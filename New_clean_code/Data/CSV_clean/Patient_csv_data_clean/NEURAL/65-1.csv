seems to be adequate 
the eighty four incident last I remember is five days before that 
let's see 
it happened on a Thursday March the eighth of eight four 
I remember we were at some friends' house having supper the previous Saturday night 
and I remember nothing  nothing after that until  until  until after outta i_c_u and started  re started remembering things slowly about uh three days after I was moved out  moved out_of i_c_u 
and the  the  the eight  nineteen ninety uh 
let's see the 
uh I was crossing tenth street Indianapolis 
and I remember crossing in the pedestrian crosswalk 
crossing with the light and seeing  getting up close in the quarter panel on the car going from west to east 
and then I have the sensation being spun around 
that's the last  last I remember thing from  last thing I remember for probably I don't know twenty  twenty minutes or so 
eighty four  INV
okay 
it was very  that was really troubling uh because  uh really troubling because um didn't know where I was 
and there were visitors in the hospital room  in  in my hospital room 
and these guys were saying  the  the  z the visit 
I  I knew who they were  knew  knew these  these people 
but there's a_lots  lots_of them there 
I didn't know where I was 
there were lots_of  pe there were several people visiting me 
and  and there uh several of them asked 
 well  when  when is his voice gonna come back 
 when is his voice gonna come back 
I thought was perfectly fine 
uh and  but what I didn't know uh was that the  I'd spent ten days with a breathing tube poked down my throat uh in a  in a coma 
and  and it looked like I wasn't gonna come out anytime soon 
they gave me a tracheotomy 
uh and  uh I  and so the  the  s what turned out to be scar tissue on the vocal cords uh changed my voice pretty radically where  where my wife had  had told me 
she said  she said that the  uh uh said that you  you  you had the 
so  I said 
 actually there it  there it was 
 the one thing she liked about me 
 and that was gone 
uh s uh so  but that was  that was extraordinarily troubling because I  d I  like I said didn't know where I was 
my  and people I rec recognize  it's  recognize saying 
 when does  when does voice gonna come back 
and it was rea really really troubling to me 
really troubling 
that was  that was one of the first of my  mem first of my memories 
well  it's  what  what it ended up being was that the  the uh 
in terms of my brain injury if you will uh certain things kinda stand out and were extraordinarily troubling 
um um and you_know just when  when  when I happen to get  get focus on something I didn't par particularly understand or  or  or approve of I get  get or  it  it didn't show up 
but it was xxx extraordinarily angry 
and did  never did lash  did  never did lash out 
uh but just but real  really angry 
and  and I kept it all internal 
it was very  very  very troubling really troubling for a  lon for  for quite a while 
and  and  and  and I don't want you to ever to relate to that 
I wouldn't  w I wouldn't wish that in  I wouldn't  wouldn't wish that on anybody 
the  almost  nine  uh nineteen ninety was almost a what 
again 
th that's always say 
it was like just  just a  just a  just a rerun but not near  not nearly as severe 
but the  the eighty four incident was  uh uh was  was most interesting because  because uh uh an engineer for my  the company that I was employed by uh uh 
I was on what they call the highpotnn or high potential list meaning I had a wonderful career ahead of me 
was gonna go far in the organization 
and  and  uh and my  one of my supervisors told me 
and he wasn't supposed to do this 
told me  told me I was  I was on the highpotnn list which meant again in my  I was going far 
my career was laid out in front of me 
uh there was  there was nothing stopping me 
and then uh after the eighty four incident a personality change which I find out twenty years later is endemic ptsdn 
which I find out twenty years later is endemic 
uh and the  uh and  and I sound different 
uh I was slower to comprehend things 
uh but finally did after bit  taking  taking more time would comprehend things 
and  and  uh uh and  and I couldn't do my engineering job to  to  to suit me 
and I didn't  didn't tell anybody that 
I didn't tell anybody that 
tried  I faked it 
I faked it and spent my lunch hours for months I was um by myself in a  in a conference room uh relearning aspects of my job and not telling a  not telling a soul because I just knew 
this was before  before eighty eight 
nineteen eight  nineteen eighty four again 
actually before the American of Disabilities Act 
eighty eight 
and  and I was on  on the accident in eighty four 
I was on company business 
and I knew  I  I just knew that  that uh mɑtu 
actually I just knew I was gonna get fired 
I knew I was 
had three kids a wife and spouse uh just a l lovely  lovely  lovely  lovely woman uh there at home with the three kids 
and I was the  f I was  I was the income 
and I couldn't  I couldn't stand the thought of being fired 
uh and  and so like I say  like I say I did everything I could to relearn my job 
and it took me  but it did take me probably a couple three years to figure out that  that uh I was no longer on  on the fast track 
no  no  no longer 
it took  I wasn't  it wasn't obvious at first 
but I  I was no longer on the fast track 
and  and  uh uh and the b b biggest most difficult part of that was the  was the short term memory  just short term memory difficulties 
uh and so uh I ended up with uh a Franklin planner and would write down everything in there just to help my  help my short term memory 
uh so  it was  it was uh uh uh uh largely the  the um aphasia and  and people seeing me differently at work 
and of_course I'm  of_course I look on back  look back  look back on it a few years after that 
and  and I did not deserve a  to be on the fast track 
I  it  wa it  it  it was perfectly obvious to everybody around me 
but it wasn't obvious to me 
uh and that the uh writing everything down was  was uh the biggest  uh as uh biggest assistant  as assis assistant  assistance to me that uh helped  helped me do my job 
the  basically it was being the  the  the 
I  I  I call it pre eighty four accident post eighty four accident 
uh that's  that's how my  my  my life has been defined 
uh and uh I  it's  I just  it  um that  that  that is  that is what I call my  my  my defining moment the  the  the  the defining event 
because I've struggled with the  the uh aphasia obviously and memory issues uh ever since then 
and  and  uh uh and  and  uh I_mean like for example uh the  the  um the winter of seventy six seventy seven I was out_of engineering school at Purdue 
had a job in Indianapolis 
and so uh the  ec as economic viability I  I  I paid rent to my folks  lived in the  lived in their house 
and that winter my dad and I put the  uh put an Oldmobile vl eight in a Chevrolet Vega a little small car 
a and uh it was quite an interesting  interesting project 
and  and in interestingly enough I can probably 
the  the  the engine had a Rochester four gl cl carburetor on it which had some difficulties 
and I could probably still today 
now this was nineteen seventy six seventy seven 
I could probably still today rebuild that carburetor blindfolded 
and  but  but  but I  prob but I could  ask me what I had for supper last night head
can't tell ya 
so  yup 
short  short term memory issues 
but  uh but then things from  from  from long ago  and uh do  uh do  uh do  do som something long ago I  c I can  I can reconstruct like it was yesterday 
uh no  actually I was  uh I ended up actually at Purdue mechanical engineering 
uh and  and I got out_of school the spring of seventy six 
had a job at a company named Shwitzer 
uh they're in Indianapolis 
and Shwitzer no  sh Shwitzer no longer exists 
but uh I was in engine cooling engineering at  at coughs with uh Shwitzer 
and so  so uh I  uh my  my customers were we'll  we'll call it  for engine cooling fans for Shwitzer were uh Ford light truck  Ford heavy truck 
uh uh the Ford  uh one of the small Ford Pats cars had uh a Cadillac excuse_me  Pontiac 
um and the uh uh Chevrolet abfatyk cars that was all my cooling fan customers 
so  I was already doing that kind of stuff as my  as  as a job 
but then uh my  my father found this  uh this article on engine conversion on the Chevrolet Vega 
uh and there just happened to be that it was a project where he and I to  to  to build together that winter uh while  while  uh while I was working the automotive industry's field 
and  and uh it  uh um it  xxx it's kinda how I  hap kinda how I gravitated 
well  it was  it was real  it was a real sleeper 
meaning that  uh the  the hot car at the time was the  the Datsun two forty zl 
uh it was a real  it was uh the first of the t Datsun uh uh zl cars 
uh and  and uh uh I useta uh from a stoplight dust those guys off 
and they couldn't  they  and those  the  the other guys the drivers of Datsun's zl cars couldn't figure out how in the hell this Vega beat the shit out_of them 
it was  it was  it was  it was  it was a_lot_of fun seeing looks in their faces as it  in my rearview mirror 
uh okay 
this story is there's a  a  a young lad 
looks like uh uh maybe  maybe teenager like a sixth grader or seventh grader kicking a soccer ball 
and then  and here it kick xxx puts the soccer ball through a  through a  a house's window 
and the soccer ball comes through the house's window and  and lands on a  on a  a  on a  an adult male  uh male's lap in the house 
and the adult male gets up holding the soccer ball and looks through the  through the hole in the window and says  trying to figure out what's going on 
and done 
uh looks like a  a  a  a young  a young boy is leaving 
and his  his  we're gonna say it was mother says 
 he here's  here's your umbrella 
uh and he says 
 no  I don't need that 
uh and then  then he  he  he  he leaves saying goodbye and everythings 
and the mom holding the umbrella 
and the  the  the young lad is out and about walking around 
and it starts to rain 
then it starts to rain heavier 
and he's running 
and he gets back to his  to his mom so soaking wet 
and he's not happy 
nor  neither is she happy 
and then he goes out finally with a  with an umbrella 
and  and  and uh it looks like all is well 
well  the beginning it looks like a cat  a pet cat had climbed up a tree 
uh and being probably chased by a dog climbed up a tree 
got stuck up in the tree 
uh a little girl who was probably her owner uh rode over there on her tricycle uh and  and c wants her cat down 
and looks like uh an adult male figure most likely her dad had climbed up the tree to get the cat and is  and is  and is  and is caught up there by this barking dog 
also  and now then there's also a  a  a bird uh on the other side of this tree singing away 
and there's also the local fire department is showing up with their ladder to try and get down both the  the cat and the  and the  and the  and the male  f the  uh the male figure 
there's  that's  that's a tree by the dog 
okay 
thank_you 
Cinderella uh was  uh uh her mother passed away 
uh father uh remarried 
and uh uh the  wick there's the  the wicked stepmother had  uh uh brought with her two  two rather mean spirited daughters 
uh and they  and  and in their  in their home life uh the  uh uh Cinderella was treated poorly by the stepmothers and abused which I always say by the  by the stepdaughters 
uh uh and  uh um and so just  uh just worked  worked very  worked a_lot 
uh and then uh in the kingdom the king had a  uh had a  a  a unmarried son 
and one of zɪdvɑɪzu 
uh and the  and so Cinderella uh with the help of  of the um mice and  uh uh there in the  in the  in the  in the house uh they sewed up a  a really lovely gown for Cinderella to go to  uh to wear to this  to wear  to this dance  uh wear  wear to this ball 
and  uh uh and the  s the stepmother uh uh was intent on getting one of her  her  her  her daughters married off uh and  and then so would not allow Cinderella to go to the ball 
uh uh her uh stepsisters went 
and the  uh uh and a  a carriage which looked like a  a pumpkin and then mice who ended up uh turned into horses 
and I think that the  uh the horse from the house ended up as the  as the  the driver of the  s of the  of the pumpkin carriage 
and uh uh she  she  uh she ended up going to the ball 
also um the  the  the prince uh danced the night away with uh Cinderella 
and  but the stipulation uh buh from the  uh Cinderella's fella fair fairy godmother was you hadta be back by midnight because everything was gonna go back to the way it was at midnight 
so  it was late 
so  she hurried out_of there and left a glass slipper behind 
uh uh and then  uh and then after the  and the  uh after the  the ball was over the  uh the  the  the prince said there was only  only one person interested in 
it was the  the gal that left the  left the glass slipper behind 
uh and  and so the  the advisor was sent throughout the kingdom to try and figure out who was that  that lady who left the glass slipper behind 
uh and  and it was the  it was the one  it was the  it was the  it was the  the lady whose  whose foot would fit this  uh this small  the small glass slipper 
and uh the stepsisters neither one of them would fit the glass slipper 
Cinderella's foot would fit in the slipper 
and so she was identified as the one that the  that the prince uh uh wanted to  wanted to  uh wanted to marry 
and  and so the  so  then the  the  the  Cinderella married the prince 
and they all lived happily  and they lived happily ever after 
oh  prefer  uh preferably uh uh on  on a wheat bread 
you would use a knife and  and uh get the  spread the  spread the peanut butter on uh one side of the bread 
aha but then the  on the other  s other side of the other  other  other bread the optimal jelly is grape jelly 
and then  so  you take a spoon 
not  not knife because uh you  you cut up  you cut up the  the  the  the jelly and the  and the jar 
but  uh but you take your spoon and  and spoon out the  the  the uh uh grape jelly on the other piece of bread 
use that  use the knife to spread out  spread it out 
then  then put the two halves together 
and you got the ultimate  the ultimate peanut butter and jelly sandwich
