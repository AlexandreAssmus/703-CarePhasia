uh it's pretty good 
I know I s struggle when I get overly tired 
I  I'm told that people wouldn't know I have trouble unless I
my hesitation to them I'm told is  sounds like I'm thoughtful 
they don't understand it 
my hesitation is because I'm struggling laughs 
yes 
sure 
um I went to bed on a Monday night after work 
and uh just like any other night I expected I was gonna sleep and
um about uh one or two in the morning uh I hadta go to the
and I was struggling to get the covers off 
I was laying on my left side 
so  I trying to get the covers off with the right 
and I couldn't believe how heavy the covers were 
and uh that was my first sign something was wrong 
I  at first I thought because I had the two cats 
and I thought they were laying on the covers or something 
but uh they  I  you_know the room was dark 
and so I just forced the covers off real hard with all my might 
and finally they came off 
and then I um tried to take some steps 
the bathroom was the next room over 
and I was um finding that I was exhausted 
and I decided I will just lay on the floor at the edge of the bed 
uh I don't know why I didn't think to just get back into bed 
but I just laid on the floor 
uh I laid there for about thirty minutes 
um my Garmin told me what was going on  the timeline 
and uh so when I got back up I still didn't feel like I could
so  I did and just crawled back into bed 
and uh then about  um I was awake asleep back and forth
and I was trying to figure out 
something's wrong with me 
but I don't know if this is major 
and I was trying to decide 
it's probably something wrong with my brain or my heart 
and um I didn't want to go to the emergency room 
and there'd be nothing wrong 
uh but I called uh a guy from work 
I used my phone 
and I thought I was dialing his work number 
but I got his cellphone number 
so  I want to leave him a voicemail message 
and I was surprised to hear him answer 
and that's when he told me 
 you called my cell number 
so  I worked for a very difficult company to work for 
and I didn't want to tell them yet what was going on 
so  I kinda jokingly told him something that would make him laugh
but at least they would be notified I wouldn't be in that day 
and I said uh 
 pass the word on 
 m my brain's not working right today 
 I won't be in 
and so he just chuckled and said 
 well  okay  I'll pass that on 
and then I called a friend and uh told him what was going on 
and uh then uh between two of us uh we decided 
um um well  my  my idea 
 I will call him in a half hour 
 if you don't hear from me call me 
 if you can't reach me call for help 
so  a half hour later I called him 
and uh I decided I'm going to call my neighbor 
take me to the hospital 
so  I did 
and my neighbor next door came and got me 
and um w we went to the hospital 
I don't know why or how we went to the hospital that we did 
it was a great one 
we've got uh four hospitals to choose from 
so  I don't re know why  or remember why we went to that
but um she had a brain injury from a car accident a few years ago
and uh she was struggling trying to figure out where the
and at that point I couldn't read 
but I saw the red lettering 
and I knew that must be emergency 
and so I pointed to that 
and then  um sh then she didn't know what to do with me once
again she was someone with a brain injury 
so  she was having trouble thinking her way through this 
and so here  me  I just had a stroke 
and I'm having to do the thinking laughs 
so  uh when we pulled up under the awning there was a
and he checks people for guns coming into the hospital 
and I caught his eye 
and he came out 
and I told him 
at this point I figured I must have had a stroke 
and I told him 
 I think I had a stroke 
 and I'm afraid to walk 
um at this point I was not having trouble walking 
but I was afraid I might 
um earlier in the day in wee hours I was um having a real
but now I was okay with it 
um so  he said 
 hold on 
 I'll go get someone 
and he got a nurse 
and uh she came out 
and I told her the same thing 
and then she went back and got a wheelchair 
and they got me in 
mhm um I had a_lot_of speech therapy 
um I went to two different um organizations for therapy because
so  I wanted more therapy than that 
and uh so I went to both 
so  for maybe about I don't know  six or eight months I got
um each uh session is about an hour 
um uh I also did some physical therapy 
but I didn't stick with it 
and so I can still feel like my right leg drag a little bit 
um and I also have trouble writing 
so  I have uh some occupational therapy I did as_well 
um and it  it helped a little bit but not a_lot 
um uh but the speech therapy uh 
I found uh some therapists I just connected with better than
and uh the one I spent the most time with I really liked her
she was very good and very positive 
and as she explained it something important to me 
she said  um in the beginning she said 
 I'm going to test you right now to see where you're at right now
then after we work together awhile I'll test you again to gauge
the therapists I had worked with before that never explained that
so  when they would ask me these questions and quiz me I was
I felt so stupid because I couldn't do them 
but if I'd have known earlier that that's what they were doing it
but you_know they didn't think to tell me that 
but um I did uh games on my phone 
um I went to a local college that had uh meetings on uh
and so the first hour everybody's in the same room 
and then the second hour we're split up into groups 
and the leader is the one who decides what group we go into 
so  you go into a group with about four or five other people who
um I bought books uh grade school books for math and reading
um and I did that on my own 
and I did uh puzzle books 
and then uh I went back to work 
I went back to work very quickly 
way before I really was able to do much 
but I just thought 
 I've just got to get in there and do it 
so  I went back to work about seven weeks after my stroke 
um there was something 
oh uh I always liked to cook 
but now I really kicked it up 
um I found uh about healthy eating 
and I've always liked junk food 
and I decide to eat really healthy 
I felt like that would help me recover 
and uh so I  uh I got this 
and uh learning to understand measurements again was difficult at
but I learned 
and I still struggle with it sometimes 
making conversions is not so easy for me 
but  um but I see the ingredient list 
and then you've got like a paragraph of everythings
so  I've learned to  if it's the first uh two things you do
and then maybe the next three things you've gotta do something else
then I color those other three with another color 
that kind of thing 
and so um then I learned to cook some really good healthy foods 
and that was motivating for me 
and then I also  uh I was working near a mall 
and uh so at lunch time I would go walk every day 
well  the job that I had that was so stressful 
uh about two years ago now uh they laid me off 
and uh I was happy about that 
I hated that place 
I loved the work 
but the people were just insane 
and uh bullying people to get things done 
and I got the blame for stuff that I had absolutely no control over
but I was afraid to look for another job um because if the next
so  I was really afraid to move 
and there's not many jobs around here for that kind of work 
so  I felt really trapped 
but I was looking 
but it was just  you_know there really wasn't a_lot to pick
and  well  anyway  the day  three months or so before
so  I started collecting my information that I was gonna need
and I put my notes in a notebook 
and I took them out to my car 
and then when I want to refer to them I went out to my car and
I didn't keep them at my desk 
I took everything out_of my office except for things that belonged
uh I saved off programs I had written  everything 
and so then when the boss and the h_r guy came to my office and
I tried not to look so happy about it 
but I was really happy 
and then uh I was out_of work for ten months 
and it was okay because I had unemployment 
I had money in savings 
and I was doing alright with that 
the great thing is also that I got a wonderful job 
and now I work from home fulltime for a company that's uh in
and uh so uh my boss that's 
uh he's always upbeat and always encouraging and just a very nice
and I still do the same kind of work I useta do 
but now it's for nice people 
okay 
um this boy is kicking a soccer ball 
and he kicked it right into somebody's living room window 
and it went in and knocked over the lamp 
and the man saw the damage as it happened 
he got up with the ball in his hand 
and he looked out the window to find the origin of that ball 
um the mom is uh trying to hand the son a umbrella 
uh but he doesn't want it 
and so she still holds onto it 
um so  now the boy is walking 
and it's raining on him 
and uh the rain is getting heavier 
and he uh shows up in front of his mom all wet 
and he's not happy about it 
and she's not happy about it either 
um but now he's got the umbrella 
and he's continuing on his walk now with the umbrella 
um the little girl wants her cat that climbed up in the tree 
and so the man got up the tree to retrieve the cat 
um and the ladder fell out behind him 
and the dog is barking at all the excitement 
and the firemen are coming to rescue uh I assume the cat and the
and uh there's a bird on another branch that's singing 
um the  Cinderella's dad met the woman with the two 
and um then um the daughters uh were mistreating Cinderella 
um they are planning to go to the b ball 
um and uh they took a necklace off of Cinderella 
um Cinderella was locked in a room 
and uh some m mice came and  with a key and got her out 
and uh then the fairy godmother provided a horse and a driver 
and Cinderella danced at the ball with the prince 
and um then it was almost midnight 
and Cinderella hadta leave 
and uh as she left she was going down the stairs 
and she dropped her slipper 
and uh then um think it was two men came to her house with the
and it fit Cinderella's foot 
then uh they knew it was Cinderella was the one who had danced
and uh then  uh then uh Cinderella and the prince got
um I would get uh two pieces of bread
