speech is adequate 
much improved 
the  uh the halting of  w halting of  of speech 
um the  what  what happens is that the  uh um if I
 well  I  sho I shoulda said this 
 I coulda said that 
 why  why didn't I say that 
uh for example in the troubleshooting automotive electronics uh
uh it helps immensely if I think about it for about a  about
unle unless I've seen it before uh the  uh the  the 
and uh it  it is  uh uh uh well  I'll 
 wh why didn't  why didn't I think of that before 
I  I  I  be before  before my eighty four accident I
but uh it's much more difficult and  and uh takes longer
and that's  it's like I say 
been that way for thirty six years 
um the first one was a  where I was tl boned at an
uh and uh ended up being a 
I  I caught the  uh the uh old International Harvester
and uh had a shattered pelvis  broken hip  five broken ribs 
did I  did I say punctured lung 
uh seventeen units of blood 
uh three and a half weeks in a coma 
and  uh and uh I  uh in a coma for three and a half
um hospital probably  probably about two and a half months 
and our third child was born uh three days after I was uh moved
and the second one uh was uh February of nineteen ninety where
there was a shared 
uh and  uh and what  uh I believe that I was
well  I  I guess I don't know how long 
but uh uh I recall walking across the street starting across
and then I had the  sen the sensation being spun around 
and then  and then uh uh later like I say I  I  d
I don't know 
twenty minutes later 
and  and I  I was  I was in a great mood 
I was in a wonderful mood because the eighty four accident the last
and  uh uh and this one is fe ma uh February nineteen
and I was  I was  I was  I was in a really great
and then I say a  b a brain injury because uh uh um I
uh and uh I had  that was  that was  that
um it did finally go away when the brain swelling went down 
finally went away 
but I don't  I recall maybe three  four  five days
something  something like that 
but it lasted a significant amount of time 
uh and  and the  the doctors could not tell me whether the
it was extraordinary painful 
and  and uh um I recall that the orthopedic guy that stuck a
uh oh uh after  after three or four months when  when
 oh uh you_know that's probably the most painful injury known
oh okay 
yeah wasn't just me being a big baby then  right 
and uh he  he  he chuckled 
that  that's kind_of uh it  it 
th those are the two accidents in  in a  in a  at
uh West Tenth going into  West  uh Tenth and 
okay 
um the  uh um after the first the eighty four incident
uh wh what had happened was that the eighty four uh laptops
and  uh um and uh uh uh my  my boss at that time
I'll call it uh 
I won't say leisure work play with 
but  but uh learn how to use there  there at home 
and of_course this is before the  this is before the web
but uh I had been doing a  a Nastran which is Nasa structural
and  uh but that was all that  was all on uh IBM uh
um and  uh uh and so here is just a  a simple little
oughta be able to know how to use that 
and  and so they brought this  uh uh my boss brought
and  and in those years there was a  a user manual that came
uh and so tried to use a  c a computer  an  op a
uh if you've ever read  uh if you've ever read a Microsoft
and uh one of  one of the  one  th one thing in
selectq 
well  had we never had any training in  in a  uh in uh
and  and after several days of trying to figure out what
th there's one æfeɪʒəu 
select meat 
an aphasia 
uh selectq meant  uh what  what they meant by
I just could not 
there was no way 
I'm extraordinary troubled really troubled by that 
and so  so finally I called a coworker and uh uh said 
 what  what  what did the  what does this mean to me
and it described the uh uh tapping the cursor and moving the
that's what they meant by selectq 
well  hell  that was never described in the manual at all 
and that  that  that really  that threw me for a loop
and so uh I became  became uh very questioning as to whether
uh and  and so  so finally the  the  like I say the
 oh okay 
the most  most s basic of terms which the  the uh um
or my  uh no  no  this is DOS not Microsoft 
this is before Microsoft existed 
this DOS manual it did not  did not uh uh uh comprehend
but they did not 
DOS manual did not describe that anywhere 
and so  so the  and uh so I went back to work and uh
and  and finally uh my  my  after a couple years uh
 you might  might have it  you take those  take
and so wow that was  that was a godsend 
I_mean just being able to  to write  write things down 
so  I  I carry a small 
don't have with me right now 
but I still  I carry a small  like a small notecard
because that  that was  that was  writing  when
holy_mackerel that was  uh that  that was uh um a
um tha that  that in particular 
and  and also I ended up uh uh as a later  as a um
uh I developed uh uh tricks where I when I meet somebody new
use their name in any kind_of verbal  verbal conversation with
use name  e use their name every time first or last name or
and  and then uh after the  after the  after the
uh and  and  and that  that has been a  uh
for example I met a  uh in our neighborhood met a 
I'm at  I'm at  I'm at home now 
not down the farm 
but uh met a fellow in  in the  in the uh neighborhood
and I got his name 
and so then said his name over and over again and the like and told
and uh this morning I was  I saw him out for a walk and 
and then fine finally the name came to xxx 
so  but  but the  the discipline on  on um recalling
yes  yes 
the  uh um I think I mentioned to you last week 
may may uh possibly I didn't 
but the time  I'd spent some time as a  at the rehab
uh and  uh uh because I  I started oh 
and it became rather troubling to me because having  they just
so  there was no therapy 
you just  you're able to survive 
just a  the thing you're able to just  could just check
uh and uh um because they just did not do therapy in those
and  and over the course the next twenty years uh wife and I
and the suicide rate amongst the brain injured is four to five
that's what they're telling people even uh fifteen years ago 
uh and so I wanted to  to  wanted to share that with 
but it is  takes a long time 
and in oh 
 yup  a year to year and a half recovery 
 year to year and a half recovery 
 year to year and a half recovery 
hey  you don't stop recovering 
the rate may be asymptotic if you will and slow down pretty rapidly
but you never never stop recovering 
uh I had a  in the eight  the eighty  eighty four
and it was just something that I accepted 
and it was  I could function without it 
no  no big deal 
but uh to stick a pin there and I don't  wouldn't 
uh no  no big deal 
and then it was probably five years ago or ma twenty  twenty
I think it was  yeah 
I think it was oh 
twenty five years after the eighty four incident I was in the 
and I had feeling in the spot that had no feeling for twenty five
so  what I'm  what I'm telling you actually is that the
but  s but still you never stop recovering 
you just don't stop recovering 
you don't 
yes  it's uh not  not rocket science 
it  it ti ti time  time is  time is the best 
because you  you  the feeling that  the feeling that
and  and you'll notice one day it'll  it'll 
 oh  oh crap I  I  I have feeling there that I didn't
it  actually it will happen 
you will experience it 
um uh actually  actually n no 
it was  it was  uh it just  I_mean I was used to
but  uh but I  I don't  I don't know if I got used to
but  but uh like I say twenty five years later I just put on
 hey wait a minute 
 I've got feeling there 
and had  had  had none before 
I  I don't know when it happened 
have  have no idea 
they will  it will  they will 
the nerves will work again 
they  they will actually 
they will 
uh when  when I  when I  when I  I  first
when  when she and  when I  she and I first met uh
uh we went to  we went to different high_schools together 
uh her from uh in near Washington Indiana  in Washington
and myself from uh Plainfield 
uh and it was before classes started at Purdue 
August of nineteen seventy two 
uh it was uh uh her first day on campus 
my first day on campus 
um there was to be a  a dance at uh  the  the dorm I
again  again each is our first  first day on campus 
and  uh uh and  uh and  and so I was a little bit
which I  I will arrive but place a little bit early given 
and uh uh so I ended up being just a little bit early for the
and  uh and uh my wife and  uh and her  her  her
guy  girl  girls  girls go with  with body guards 
I get that 
I think it's a 
her and her  her and her wife and uh uh her and uh
and  uh uh and uh FirstnameS's wife has never met a
the  she's the  a  a true extrovert 
matter of fact if you look up in Webster extrovert and it said 
uh but anyway  so  so  uh she and a girlfriend that
 oh hey is the  uh is the  the dance here 
and  and wellco I answered 
 well  it's supposta be 
 uh that's why I'm here 
and  and uh then we  I just  uh I hung around 
I  I  I hu hung around her that  that  that  that
and uh that's where we started dating 
and  and uh oh it's  we  we dated probably three
dated around about three years or so 
and after about uh four years I figured out that wellco maybe
and I oughta get more serious about this 
so  it was just like I  k I accused her of  of uh
that's w where  where we first met is she picked me up at a
a young  a young boy it's look like a  s a um grade
is kicking it 
and he  k he  it ends up going through a house window 
uh a gentleman on a couch uh there in the window uh sitting
and then he  he  he gets the ball  s stands by the broken
in the beginning this  this mother it appears uh is  had
uh and uh he  he says 
 ah 
he says no and says 
 no  no  mom  I don't need that 
and then  then leaves 
and then in the middle it starts raining on him 
and then rains heavier on him 
and then  and then uh uh he goes back home just uh
and then the last  the end of the story was he learned his
the way this started was that the  it looks like uh that
that the dog is barking at  a dog is barking at this guy 
and uh on the  on the  on a tree limb there's a cat
and it would appear that uh uh a cat climbed up the tree 
the  uh a little girl's cat climbed up the tree and got stuck
they  they  they  uh a male  a man uh uh uh
there's also a  a firetruck and a fire engine 
but a pair of firemen carrying a ladder 
and it looks like the  lad the  the ladder is being used by
uh and  uh and the  and a songbird is over on a  a
okay done 
Cinderella was a  a daughter of a  uh uh a subject of
she  her mother had passed  uh her mother passed away 
and her father remarried 
and the stepmother had uh uh two  two daughters uh who
uh and as they  after they were married uh the uh uh
and uh so  so s Cinderella spent her time working cleaning
and  and uh uh in that  in the kingdom there was uh
um an advisor to the king suggested a  a  a ball be held
uh so  the word was put out about the ball coming up 
uh Cinderella was real happy about the  ba about the ball
uh and so the  the  the  f um the farm animals
and  uh uh and then at the last minute uh the stepmother
and  and the  uh and then also the  the  the
uh and so  so the stepdaughters went to the ball 
and  but in the meantime while  b before  uh before
and so it  it um made for her a  just a  a lovely gown
and they  then turned a  a pumpkin into a coach uh pulled
um and uh uh so  and so she ended up going to the ball 
uh and uh um the prince uh was acquainted with the 
ended up spending the night dancing with uh Cinderella 
but the fairy godmother told Cinderella that  that uh you
and so the  the  the  the prince and Cinderella were
and  and  and Cinderella said 
 oh_no 
and  and runs  runs out_of the  runs out_of the place
and  and as she's being driven  uh driven back home the 
the  the horse turned back into the mice 
and the  the footman turned back into a horse uh and  uh
I don't remember what 
and then  so  but still that  then it was over 
and  uh uh and then after the ball the  the prince
but nobody could  nobody knew who Cinderella was and could
uh and so he  he put his advisor out to the task of  of
and uh uh came to Cinderella's house 
the  the slipper did not fit the  the stepsisters 
uh and then  but  but turned out it did  it did
uh and so  so they end up uh uh being that  that
very  you have uh two slices of bread 
you have the ingredients of peanut butter and jelly and uh have a
you lay out your two pieces of bread 
spread the peanut butter from the jar on one of the pieces of 
and then you  you spread the  spread the jelly on the other
uh and then you put the pieces of bread together 
and there you have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
