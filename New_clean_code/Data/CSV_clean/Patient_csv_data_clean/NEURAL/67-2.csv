well  I did it on Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday  um Sunday morning 
um I was bed  in the bed 
and I was thinking I can  I was  I was fuzzy 
and then I said 
 I have to go see the  ha the doctor 
and I got in my car 
and I drove to my hospital 
and I said 
 there is something wrong 
only I was not talking ɑlməu  s
and they said 
 oh 
and they're there 
and then the girls that working there they were really nice 
and I had the fall 
I was not falling 
but I was kind_of falling 
and then they took me to the  the  the doctor 
and there were two doctors there 
and they were talking to me 
but I could not  I can hear it 
but I could not listen 
I could not tell them what I was doing 
and I stayed there 
and then most  then I didn't remember this 
my  my  my son and his wife they came there 
but I don't remember that 
I don't remember seeing them about a w week  uh for a week 
um that's all til I was  when I was in the hospital 
I remember that 
some little  in  in a few days I was in there 
but other people were talking 
and they will tell me things 
but I can  s I wasn't saying words 
um and I think they were afraid 
I know they were all afraid of me 
not afraid of me 
but they thought I was really  I was dying 
and then the  then the  I was in the hospital 
and the  then my son and her 
we went from the doctor  a hospital over to another hospital 
and I stayed over there 
and I didn't like those people 
they were nɑsu 
they were ges
they were saying 
 stop ges
and they were kidding 
and I don't know how that was  I don't know how that was 
I don't know how long I was there 
but too much 
because those people were not nice 
and then they said I hadta go to another place when you are  every day you go in 
and I don't know what it's called 
and they were really nice 
and my son and his wife they live closer 
so  they came to see me every day 
and I got to see FirstnameM my granddaughter 
I got to see FirstnameM all the time 
and ba in there  in there somewhere my son 
because she was at s Saint Croix 
and so that they  he 
and I got to see her a long time 
like six weeks 
and just that

but then about several weeks the one came in my  s in my house every day 
and she was just  she was very nice 
and we learned all kinds of things 
she  we were s say  saying words 
and she would write  write down the words 
write them  them 
so  I can look outside to do that 
and there were  there were several ladies 
well  not one at the time 
but there were two of them 
they would stay at my house 
and that was okay 
but I would find things 
I_mean j I would say 
 where is my something my  that I need something 
and I would look at it 
and I would say 
 well  it's not there now 
and she would say 
 oh  w well  now we keep it here 
and I would so fray froʊdɪnu 
I was  because I wanted to be it there at my house 
and sighs I got really frustrated all the time because they'd say 
 well  this is a place or better to do it 
and I'm thinking

so  I was grumpy sometimes 
um and I practiced on saying the words that

but she wants me to eats where she does food like the way she makes it 
and  and I would say 
 okay  but I don't  I don't like that kind 
and she'll say
