sometimes I can do it good 
but sometimes I just can't think of the words 
pardon 
well  the first one  um no 
I could hear the doctors that morning 
I could hear them talking 
I could hear what they were saying 
but I could not do things 
or I could  I  I could listen to them 
and then later it was just hard to say things 
I couldn't take  s
or I would not  I didn't know words 
but when I gɪdu 
I was by my hat  in my inside  in my house by myself 
and I didn't even n what I was wrong 
I just  I knew that I was doing something that was wrong 
so  I called my son 
and then they thought I was 
they could talk 
they talked to me 
but I couldn't talk 
but they would tell me to do things 
and I would think 
 well  I don't have to do that 
 I don't need to do that 
I could tell it 
but I couldn't I_mean  I couldn't tell them that 
my s my grandda I_mean my  FirstnameM  FirstnameM my sʌndɚu

I'm not really good yet 
and then I also have gotten this  this  I've gotten on this thing 
I don't know what it is

but they'll give me all kinds of things all over the world 
and I'll think 
 it's just a  it's just a this
