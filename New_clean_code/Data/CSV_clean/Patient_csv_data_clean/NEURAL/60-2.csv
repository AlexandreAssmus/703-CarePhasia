pretty good 
yes 
no 
um I went to bed on a Monday night 
uh I worked all day 
and I went to sleep 
and I just fully expected it to be like any other night and go back
about uh one o'clock or one thirty in the morning I hadta go to
and uh that's typical for me 
and uh I had trouble getting the covers off 
uh I was laying on my left side 
uh I remember that because uh I had right side weakness 
and the blankets just felt really heavy 
and uh so I really hadta work at it to lift the blanket 
as  uh it was like they were full of bricks or something 
and so I got them off when I just really focused on it 
and then I took a couple of steps and realized the bathroom the
I was exhausted 
and uh so I laid on the floor at the foot of the bed 
and uh I laid there for about a half an hour 
and um I think I kinda dozed off a little bit while I was down
and then I got up and uh thought 
 I'll try again 
but as soon as I stood up I realized 
 no I'm still just too tired 
so  I crawled back in bed 
and uh about uh seven thirty or eight o'clock I'd decided to
I  my boss was a creep 
and so I avoided talking to him when all possible 
and so  but this guy was uh kind_of uh the boss's pet 
and uh so I thought 
 I'd  I'll just call him 
and uh when I used my cellphone 
I had that guy's cellphone number and desk number 
but I thought sure I selected the desk number because I was
but I thought 
 I'll just leave him a message 
well  he answered the phone 
and  uh so it hadta be before eight o'clock because I was
and I said to him 
 FirstnameB  uh you're at work already 
and he said 
 no you called me on my cellphone 
 well  what's up 
and I said 
 well  um my  my brain's not working right today 
 so  I'm not gonna come in 
and uh I chose those words carefully 
I didn't want them to know there was a health issue 
um but I needed to give them some kind of a reason why I'm not
and I certainly needed to make that call 
and uh so uh he took it as uh humorous 
and I was fine with that 
that was kind_of why I said it the way I did 
um and as a side note when I came back to work he recalled that
he said 
 I really didn't understand what you were trying to tell me 
and I said 
 no  FirstnameB 
 I wasn't trying to tell you anything 
 I was  I was not  this was not a call for help 
 uh I already had in my mind what I was gonna do 
 but I just needed to let you guys I  know I wasn't gonna be
and uh so he was real relieved to hear that 
and uh so I felt bad when he said that 
I was like 
 oh_gosh the guilt this guy's carrying around for nothing
and uh anyway  so  um I called either before him or
and uh I never call him 
we've been going together for about six years 
and I  for me to call him is  that's a big deal because
and  uh but I called him that morning 
and he picked up 
and um I told him  I said 
 something's wrong 
 um my brain's not operating right 
 I'm not sure what's wrong 
 but something's wrong 
and uh he  I think he suggested I go to the hospital or see a
or uh he might even try to help work it through and try to figure
um finally I said 
 tell you what 
 um let's just see how I'm doing 
 I'll call you back in a half an hour 
and if I don't then uh I think I said 
 call for an ambulance or help 
I don't remember what I did 
but there was some kind of a plan if I didn't  he didn't hear
and uh so um I think before I called him back I decided 
 let me call my nextdoor neighbor and ask her to take me 
and I didn't want to freak her out 
so  I didn't wanna say hospital or emergency 
so  I just said 
 uh something's not right with me 
 and so I need to see a doctor 
 and I should probably see somebody pretty soon 
and uh so she said 
 okay I'll be over in about ten minutes 
and I said 
 that's fine 
and so I called him and told him you_know I was gonna go uh to
so  um later he told me that he almost uh called an ambulance
but he  he's the kind of person he's afraid to make a mistake 
I'm sure there's some  some psychology there to  to delve in
but  uh but uh I told him  I said 
 if you make a mistake because you love me and you're trying to
uh maybe initially I might be not happy with you for making that
but later I would understand that you did it out_of love 
so  it's okay 
so um anyway  so then uh my neighbor came over 
and I wasn't dressed yet 
and uh so I was in my bedroom getting dressed 
and um I don't remember taking a long time to get dressed or
I wasn't experiencing the exhaustion anymore 
and  um but I noticed at one point she came around the corner
and  uh so then  but I finished getting dressed 
and just  uh I kind_of planned out some things to do to
if I made sure I'd let the dog out and let her back in 
and uh I grabbed my purse and my phone 
and uh kinda made a mental note 
yes  I've got my health insurance card 
I've got money 
uh got my driver's license 
I'm good to go 
and then we went out the door and um or  I went out the
she said 
 I'll tell you what 
 I'll go get my car and bring it to you 
because she's just next door 
but I think she afraid for me to walk 
so  she was in my driveway 
and I'm coming out the door 
and I've got a deadbolt and a knob lock 
and I  n uh the dog is in 
and I'm trying to lock the door and xxx the knob 
I could feel it 
and it's right 
but I'm sitting here looking with my keys 
and they weren't fitting 
so  I was having trouble 
I don't carry a_lot_of keys on my ring 
but I couldn't figure out which key went into the lock 
uh so  finally I thought 
 well  I got the  the knob locked 
 it's good enough 
and we  when we went down the road I don't remember who or
but I think I went to the best possible one 
um and when we got there  um it was like uh four of
we call this hospital row 
so  um my street is always the first in the city to get paved 
well  maybe the governor's and then mine 
so  um then she didn't understand where to go exactly 
she  I think she knew she wanted the emergency room but didn't
and I saw the red lettering 
and I couldn't read it 
uh that was so significant to me because I remember I could not
I knew what the word was 
but I couldn't s say it to  to save my life 
um but  well  I could say it 
I just couldn't read it 
and uh so I pointed 
and I said 
 emergency 
and so I wasn't reading it you_know 
it was like 
 it's red 
 and I just know what that word was because it's red 
and uh so we got to the entrance 
and there was like uh I wanna say  a canopy but not
um and I caught the eye of a policeman that was uh sitting or
his job is to check people for weapons before they get into the
and uh I waved at him and motioned for him to come 
and he did 
and I told him 
 uh I think I've had a stroke 
and I don't know when I determined that that was a possibility 
don't even remember 
but  but  uh and I said 
 but I'm afraid to walk 
and I was walking fine 
but I just never had a stroke before 
so  I didn't know if maybe I'm walking fine now 
and all_of_a_sudden I can't you_know 
I didn't know 
so  I was afraid to walk 
and uh so he said 
 hold on 
 I'm gonna get someone 
and a nurse came out real fast 
and uh she brought out uh 
she came out first 
and then uh I told the same thing to her 
and she ran in and grabbed a wheelchair 
I think it was just inside the door 
then  so  she got me in the wheelchair 
and we went in 
and uh I remember looking at the people in the waiting room 
it was pretty full 
and I felt kinda guilty because I was being rushed to the head of
and I almost wanted to say 
 sorry  but I think I had a stroke 
but uh you_know just not appropriate to really say anything 
I just felt bad 
and uh so then uh the intake person wanted my health insurance
so  I gave her that 
and uh th she asked me 
 am I on any medications 
and I remembered uh the uh Metformin 
but I called it Glucophage 
I think Glucophage is  I think that's the name brand for it 
but I couldn't think of Metformin 
and uh there were a_lot_of uh supplements I useta take and uh
but I couldn't remember the name of them for the life of me 
and I always remembered them because when I went to the pharmacy if
and  uh but I just  uh was just uh struggling 
I couldn't remember um the name of them 
and I  it surprised me that I couldn't remember them 
and uh then uh I got put in a room right away and just waited
and that same nurse came back 
and she asked me 
 has anyone been in here yet 
and I said 
 no 
but I didn't think a long time had passed 
um and so she was a_little irritated with that and went back and
and they were back there very quickly 
and then it was just lightning speed all the tests they had me do 
and um they had one test where they were gonna need to put me
uh they're trying to find uh the origin of the stroke 
I think at this point they know what happened 
they just can't figure out 
 well  how_come  why 
and they never figured it out 
um but  uh so  they put me to sleep for that 
and what they were explaining to me what they were getting ready to
I don't like to be put under 
I like to know what's going on 
and uh then they're gonna put this thing down my throat 
and I know that there is the possibility 
it's so slim 
but possibility that um something could go wrong there 
or would  some permanent damage could happen 
so  I  I was pretty freaked out about it 
but I thought I  I  I gotta submit to this 
so  they did that 
and  um and when they did either a c_t scan or the m_r_i 
I don't remember which when they 
I've had those done before uh not on the brain though 
um and they told me it was really important that I  s that
and I laid there perfectly still like my whole life depended on it
 I want them to get the best possible image of my brain right now
so  I'm not gonna flinch 
and so anyway then  then began nine days of in hospital stay 
okay 
um a speech uh therapist told me either that day or the next
and uh for a moment I thought 
 you're making that up 
 it's  never heard of fu such a word 
and uh then she explained what it was 
I was like 
 huh  well  okay  I guess it explains why I'm struggling here
um and uh so while I was in the hospital she provided a_lot_of
and I tried to get that stuff done before I saw her next 
and uh it was like really important to me 
I was just super motivated 
and  um and then when I was released it was gonna be a month
and so I contacted her again 
and I said 
 uh can you email me some stuff because I just 
 okay  so  I can't see anybody for a month 
 but I don't wanna let up here 
and uh so she um sent me a_lot 
and um she  just like in the hospital she was willing to send
and I was so thankful for that 
and uh so I just worked on it 
and then  and so I'm not in the hospital 
so  I didn't give it to her to check it now 
I just figured 
 it's not right 
 but  but it's stuff to keep doing 
and um I got adult coloring books uh because_of a high fine
and uh I went to a teacher supply store and uh got some kids'
that's where I estimated my level was at at the time 
and so  um because when I looked at higher grades like
 I can't begin to even do this stuff 
but third or fourth it was like 
 okay this is a little bit of a reach for me 
 let me start here 
and uh so I did that 
and um I got puzzle books for kids um to do 
and so I did those 
and um I always did like to cook before 
but now I had a um special interest in cooking healthy food 
and I want it to be food that tasted good 
and uh so um I got some healthy uh recipes 
and uh worked on those 
and I s s was surprised to see that I struggled with um uh
like a jar of garlic 
half a teaspoon is one clove 
and when the recipe called for two cloves I struggled with that 
I was like 
and so I didn't know initially that I could use one teaspoon 
so  I did two half teaspoons because I knew that would work 
um and uh so  and I learned to highlight in the cookbook
uh everything that was gonna be put in the first bowl I would
and then everything that was gonna be put in another bowl I would
and  um and uh so I did really well with the cooking 
and uh just as time went on uh it was no longer a struggle 
and I did have some trouble recently about some conversion like
I never did figure it out 
but I was like 
 you know what 
 don't worry about it 
 I'm tired 
 and hey I'll figure it out another time 
but um I went to therapy 
and I went to two different therapists 
my insurance company said they would pay for as much therapy as I
and so I thought 
 well  I'm gonna just go whole hog on this and get as much
so  both therapists would see me twice a week 
and uh so  um and there was uh two different locations
and uh so I  I went to them 
and it was uh exhausting 
um I went back to work at about seven  eight  seven weeks
and uh it took me eight weeks 
but I took seven off 
um and uh so you_know I was leaving work to go to therapy 
or I would go um 
no  I didn't do it xxx 
I would  did it first thing in the morning or last thing of the
and my employer bless his heart said 
 you're  you're gonna have to make up any time you miss for
and I thought 
 you're full of crap 
 uh you_know this is uh too many hours in a week you_know in
I can't  I was exhausted as it was 
and I was like 
 there's no way 
but I just agreed to it 
I know he didn't have time to check up on me 
so  I said 
 okay 
so  um uh so  then I just uh did all this therapy 
and my  um there was one uh therapist 
well  first of all this one therapist the first one I saw she was
and I think I'd been seeing her for maybe you_know two weeks to a
and um when she was there one evening she recognized me 
and she called me by name 
and I just politely acknowledged her 
but I had no clue who she was 
um and now I've learned that uh since my stroke there's some
um now if the person has something very different about them I'll
um you_know somebody's got a huge nose or a big old wart at the
just uh something that would uh make me remember them uh then
but just uh yeah it's very easy for me to forget uh who I just
and so I remember uh her s pointing that out at the next
she says 
 you didn't know who I was  did you 
and I said 
 honestly no  I had no clue who was talking to me until you told
and uh so  but anyway uh she worked with me for maybe two
and then she moved 
and then  so another person took her place 
and um wasn't real crazy about that person 
um but  um and in hindsight she probably didn't do anything
it was just  I was just struggling with my confidence
um and it  but then I went to another therapist 
um and that lady was young 
and she was very um upbeat and very positive and uh encouraging
and so um that was helpful to me 
and so we did a_lot_of uh focusing on uh short term memory and
I did that with her 
um she taught me some card tricks to do that I've since
um like uh five and two 
I don't remember what it was 
but anyway  so  I was uh practicing with my cards on my
and um uh she didn't give me homework 
uh neither one of them did because I worked 
and uh they felt like 
 you  you got enough going with coming to therapy and work 
 I don't feel like you needta have homework too 
and I was actually kind_of relieved because I was just  I
the fatigue was k just crazy 
but I just felt like I needed to push through it because uh I
and uh so um think I just about covered it 
hm uh something important that happened to me 
um my grandbabies 
uh my daughter and I we struggled a_lot in her teen years 
and uh she met this uh guy when she was uh thirteen or
and uh you_know when I first met him I'm just seeing this skinny
and I'm thinking 
 he's like  I  this is the last thing I want around my
 I got enough trouble with her 
and  uh well  anyway uh they eventually got married 
and then  uh but she was determined she didn't want any
she was so sure she would screw them up 
and uh it's just too hard 
and so me and my husband we'll just  you_know we'll just see
and they did 
they did a_lot_of traveling and everything 
and  um and I had a  dis and I have a son too 
but he didn't seem to have any uh interest in getting married or
and so I just thought 
 I sure would love them 
 but if not then okay 
so  I just worked in the church nursery and  and kinda helped
and uh then uh my son inlaw and daughter moved to Florida 
and um by this time you_know I realized uh through some
and I was always super protective of my kids 
uh uh and I realized he was just as protective of her if not
and so I thought 
 he's gonna cart her off to Florida 
 and I don't want her to be so far 
 but at least I won't worry about her because he would die for
and uh so um then uh I don't remember how long they'd been
maybe a year or so 
and uh she  uh she came back to town 
and a relative on his side had a baby 
and she wanted to hold that baby 
and I was thrilled she wanted to hold that baby 
and she just  whenever I took a picture of her with that baby
and I thought 
 she just looks so natural with that baby 
 like she's held him all her life 
and uh she told me 
 I really want one now 
and so it took maybe another year or two because she was losing
she lost uh two or three 
and um then when she had this one um 
and uh maybe about six months in uh I'm in Indiana 
and she's in Florida 
and I'm nesting 
and then my house is reasonably clean anyway 
but  uh but I cleaned my whole living room once 
and I just said  you_know it  it had been a recently
uh and uh so there wasn't a_lot_of junk in there 
but I started uh pulling uh items out and going through them 
and I uh cleaned the ceiling fan and the windows 
and just you_know every crevice I cleaned in that living room 
and I asked her  I said 
 are you going through nesting 
and she said 
 no 
and I said 
 well  okay  well  I'm doing it for both of us because
but once I sɛltu 
I don't remember exactly which room it was 
it might've been my bedroom 
I don't remember 
but anyway then when uh the baby was here um he had uh some
uh I don't remember what it was 
but it  uh it was  they wanted him to be in the uh not
intensive care 
they wanted him there  NICU  I guess 
and so he was there for uh a few days 
but my daughter called me 
and she said  um told me what was going on 
and uh I was  she said 
 you_know we're  h we're  we're okay you_know 
but I could tell her voice 
she was scared 
and I wasn't really worried so much for the baby because what she
 you_know I don't want anything to happen to him 
 but I think he's okay 
but I was really frightened for her 
just her uh mental her emotional being  wellbeing 
and um after that phone call I hop on the airplane 
I hadta be with her 
I was compelled to be with her 
and uh I show up in that hospital 
and she was just shocked to see me 
like I was the last person in the world she expected to see 
and I remember thinking 
 how could you not know I'd be here 
and uh so anyway I  I saw the baby 
and uh uh couldn't touch him 
uh and that was okay 
um but I took a couple of pictures of him 
and um then I came back home shortly after that 
and later I learned that she thought I was coming to see the baby 
and she was kinda mad because she wanted to um decide when she
and uh she thought that's why I got on a plane like I did to try
and I just explained to her that I said 
 honey  I couldn't help myself 
and I said 
 it wasn't to see the baby 
 yes  I was glad to see him 
 he's a beautiful baby 
 and I just uh look forward to many many years with him 
but I said 
 it was you 
and uh s I think she uh was taken back by that 
and I said 
 someday you'll understand 
and I said 
 your heart just tugs you sometimes 
 and you just gotta act on it 
 you can't just sit back and just wait 
and uh so um anyway  but that little guy he's uh so
and uh he  um as I listen to him and his language
 gosh that's  that's uh like my progression 
it was really interesting 
and uh s he's uh almost four now 
but when he was about two he  s he loved dinosaurs 
I think he still kinda likes them 
but I kinda feel like he's maybe sorta outgrown them 
and he's onto other things 
but I was making him videos and  uh because I didn't feel
but this little guy he doesn't know what normal sounds like 
and so I made him these goofy little videos with these little
and they would get into trouble you_know 
and I had a box of toys here for him 
and  and so I had a dinosaur 
I'd  we'd call them saursq because that's why he called them
and I put a  dino a saur 
and I put a saur 
and it was just  and so I would uh make sill 
and I would tell him 
 you're gonna hafta come and see granny 
 help me with these saurs 
 they're out_of control 
 they're  they're into my computer 
 and they're gonna mess up my work 
 and they're into my re freezer 
 and I'm not gonna be able to cook because they're messing with
and he thought those little  stupid little videos 
maybe two minutes long each 
he thought those were hilarious 
and he would watch them over and over and over and over again
you_know they just  a hundred times you_know 
and then  and then uh his uh baby brother came along 
uh and I think there's a two years difference 
yeah two years 
and so the baby um he's uh just uh cute as he can be 
and so he's right about almost two 
and um so much difference between the two and their personalities
and  uh uh but the  the first one he's uh super smart
he's also very manipulative you_know 
and  and uh so he  he works that cuteness angle you_know 
and uh then uh the second one he was a_lot more agreeable 
and he was plenty smart 
but I could tell not to the level his brother is you_know 
it's like he didn't get stuff quite as quickly as like 
you  you hadta work with him awhile 
and  but  but then he'd get it 
he was fine 
um I think he just likes to analyze maybe more you_know and just
so  the second one um just uh super long eyelashes 
so  any girl would love to have and just as  just as cute as
and um I went to go see them um last Thanksgiving I think it
it was last Christmas 
I went to go see them Christmas 
and um I facetime with them a_lot 
and so the older one he's thrilled to see me 
and he just runs to me and you_know says granny you_know and wants
but the baby even_though he'd seen my face a_lot on the screen 
and he  of_course I'd seen him in person too but not real often
it took him a minute 
and he had to watch his older brother 
like I guess it's okay to go sit near her 
it was like  it seemed like uh at some point uh a light
and he was like 
 she's fine 
so  then had both on my lap 
and they just  for about an hour or two I was enjoying
it was just  it was uh just so cool 
so  I  yeah I always heard how f much fun grandbabies are 
but um oh_my_gosh instant celebrity is so much fun laughs 
so  that's the  probably about the best thing that's ever
okay 
uh there's a boy outside 
he's kicking a soccer ball up in the air 
and um the ball winds up inside of a  shattering somebody's
and the ball lands inside this man's house 
and this man is just sitting on a couch and um was surprised to
and not only did the ball crash through the window it knocked over
and uh so the man picks up the ball and uh looks out the window
okay 
um there's a little boy 
and uh mom is uh strongly advising him to take this umbrella
and uh he is uh not open to that advice 
and uh so he leaves without it 
and uh he waves goodbye to his mom 
and she's still got that umbrella in hand and uh asking him to
but no he's good while he  uh he gets outside 
and it's raining he's noticing 
and  uh and not only is it raining it's becoming t this
and he's walking through puddles 
and he's trying to keep his head dry um with just his hands 
and he gets to the house 
and he sees his mother with this uh I told you so attitude 
and uh she's looking at him where he is drenched 
and  um but the next scene is he's going on his way in the
but this time he's got the umbrella 
and it's open and is keeping him dry 
okay 
um this little girl has a cat 
and the cat is on a tree and the branch 
and the little girl can't reach it 
and the cat is just hanging out on that branch 
uh so  um somebody apparently called the pol fire department
and uh so these two firemen are um coming towards the scene
and um the little girl  it looks like she had gotten there 
and um i sh there's a dog uh at the tree trunk 
uh and it's barking up 
uh there's a man up on the branch of the tree 
um and the dog is probably barking at him 
and there's another tree 
there's a bird 
looks like it's singing 
and uh there's a ladder on the ground 
um possibly the ladder was used by the man 
and he looks uh kind_of uh not uh kind_of  discour he
and so it's probably his ladder that fell 
and so he's just kinda sitting there taking all that in 
and uh so with the firemen on the way uh looks like it's gonna
mkay 
um the evil stepmother and uh two stepsisters uh met the
and um then later as the stepsisters are older 
now they're not little kids anymore 
they're like uh teenage girls 
uh they're really not nice to Cinderella and expects 
and uh they're preoccupied with themselves 
uh one especially s shown uh powdering her nose or something
and um uh Cinderella notices  looks out the window 
and she sees the palace 
and uh she's looking at that kind_of uh fondly 
and uh she fantasizes about wearing a dress uh to this uh
um and so she puts it on 
and um sh her stepmother witnesses one of the stepdaught uh
um then Cinderella was talking to her fairy godmother 
and um this uh fairy godmother um made a driver and a
um the mice became horses 
and think the dog might've been the driver 
um then she gets the palace 
and she dances with the prince 
and uh the fairy godmother had given her a uh beautiful dress
and her hair was done nice 
um and uh she has a great time Cinderella does at the dance 
and then she notices it's almost midnight 
and uh so she explains to the prince that she hasta go 
and the prince is  doesn't really want her to go 
and so  but she leaves 
and in her rush down the steps she drops uh a glass slipper 
but I should back up 
there was two workers that worked in the palace 
and they were planning this uh event earlier on 
we saw s slide of them talking about something probably this
and he was  so  she rushes down the steps and loses her
and one of those same workers that had planned this event uh was
and uh so she rushes on home not even know where she dropped it 
and uh then  then uh one of those  the same worker
and uh then  so  he takes it to Cinderella's house 
and uh the evil stepmother um 
oh back at  back at the dance uh the stepmother and the
