my speech 
I think it's a_lot better than what it  what it was 
and I'm hoping that it gets better 
actually I'm hoping that it  that it gets back to where it was 
yes um but to be honest with you I  if  if  if what you're asking is I think that I didn't exactly understand what had all happened you_know 
um and I realize now that my wife and kids and even friends and a_lot of it 
they can talk to me now and tell me that some things I was saying were  were  were kind_of funny or weren't making sense 
so  I  I guess yeah at that point I guess I did understand 
but I think I did think that it was just a matter of a very short time before I would r remember everything 
and then I realized later it takes longer than what I thought 
there  I did have some times that I honestly probably cried and got really upset  not upset  sad  sad 
and then  but then 
anyway sorry 
well  most of the time I've been pretty happy sorry  because um I'm very fortunate that I'm still here and have a s second time to be alive and be with people that I  I care about 
but it's just amazing how something just that fast just changes everything 
I was  I was home when it happened 
and um I  it just really hurt 
for me it was on my left side 
and I just told her I wanted just to lay down 
but right away I could tell something wasn't right 
and um then I  my wife realized more stuff that was going on 
and she was able to ask me ques quite a few questions 
and after a few questions she could realize I wasn't making sense 
so  I guess that's the answer 
um sure um a_lot 
um um I'm trying to think where to start 
from the time that I was at the um 
I can't even think what it's called 
where was I at 
after the stroke happened at first CAR
yeah i_c_u and then the 
did it 
where I was for awhile 
um yeah they had some people trying to help me and talk with me CAR
yeah rehab that's the one 
it's hard for me to answer when I can't think how to say it 
rehab 
and they were helping me 
and they  they were very kind 
and my wife was wonderful 
and they were just telling me things that gave  g i i me  it gave me a_lot_of hope that they realized I was pretty much  I was a_little weak 
but I was physically able to walk around and do a_lot 
and that  remember I told yesterday I could remember a_lot_of like well  uh um how to play a guitar and um kind_of singing 
although I guess you would know how this stuff means 
but with singing I was able to sing along what the sound was 
but me trying to pronounce how to say a certain thing I get stuck on something 
but that gave me a_lot_of hope 
and then um I got back home 
and I've worked with a whole lot of things 
I'll show you one of them 
xxx 
here it is 
one of these things ges
so  not every day but for a_lot_of days I just go back 
and I look at this 
and I started going backwards i just uh to try to read it 
you_know dog and cat 
so  th there's a whole bunch of these things that they had 
and then uh some of those in the other room that I can't always get a hold of but I  I managed to get a hold of these 
I usually  I can usually get them 
and even the ones if I get stuck on something I would write something behind it to remind me of something 
and when I started playing 
is it okay i if I keep blabbing for a minute 
this is actually  I guess my wife can tell me I  I kinda blab 
so  uh I don't mean to be that way 
but um um you_know sh I guess she realized soon 
and I think I realized that I really wanted to perform and play guitar and saxophone and sing 
and um after what I was already going through I realized that I hoped that I always felt hopefully kindness I hope with um older people 
and then it made me think more about that after so something I was going through 
and uh I really wanted to  to just sing 
I  I  I realized that I missed that 
so  we were talking about me doing that 
and then we realized that somehow with my wife and my sister had been through so many other shows I was supposed to play just to tell them what had happened 
um somehow one of them got  got missed 
and so it was about a month I guess  later 
um yeah  yeah July 
one  uh well  I'm forgot to say it 
uh w bottom line is one of them called not long before 
oh_my_gosh you_know w we didn't tell him   s
and so I still said 
 yeah I want to try it 
so  I worked really hard at my house all day for a long time going through all these songs 
and I  I did it 
and I was nervous 
but anyway the bottom line is I was able to just to  to start doing it again 
and I did a whole lot of shows again 
and I think that really helped me because it  it started r remembering and a_lot_of that 
so  I guess that's the answer to a_lot_of it 
yeah and I was feeling so good 
I  m I musta done a hundred shows at least 
she could tell you 
there was a ton of them I did 
and uh pretty much not having any problems 
um but then one day I was telling you yesterday I was gonna start playing and I just started trying to sing 
and I was singing all not making sense 
and that just destroyed me 
I_mean I just  that was almost worse than what had happened originally because I  I was back 
and then that happened and the next thing I knew we're going to the hospital 
and I just couldn't believe it 
I just  I just said 
 oh_my_god no 
and that was  that was probably the worst 
um but then came back around again 
so  I was doing better again 
and then all_of_a_sudden Covid came in 
so  since it's been so many weird things in my life because_of just trying to go through life again remembering what is going on and what happened and how to talk and everything 
and then that's come along 
and it's just every  we're all going through that 
kind_of figure out what's  h what's all gonna happen 
and how are people and etcetera and 
so  yeah it's been really really crazy 
oh_my_gosh so many 
I don't know where to start with that 
I  I can only tell just  just the one  huh 
well  I would talk about my wife and I getting  getting  getting married 
um I guess that's pretty obvious that I would say that 
um gosh I_mean I'm trying to think if I should say anything more than that or talk about that more 
um I got  I forgot a little what you asked me 
but this might be part of it too 
um we got to go to where we useta go every year 
up  to up north from us which is up b by Wisconsin 
um FirstnameT my wife 
you_know I wasn't able to actually  I used to always be the one that kind_of was the like main like uh driver 
and so of_course she  you_know I knew that I couldn't  we weren't going to do that especially with our kids with me driving 
so  she  she did 
but going there again was a really wonderful time 
it really uh reminded me of a_lot of places 
because we  we usually would go in the same places 
and uh so that sort_of is a long thinking about 
I just felt kind_of 
we  we married there 
so  I guess I don't know 
I don't think I'm really answering what you asked me 
just like happy times of just one happy time 
yes I would  uh I would uh love to 
um well  first of all we're just friends 
we got to know each other from other friends we would all hang out with at church 
and I was really interested in her 
but I took a long time 
um and finally I mentioned about if we could g go out 
and she said yes which is wonderful 
we went out 
one of the happiest 
the  that first date was just amazing 
I felt like I was this younger g person maybe like sixteen seventeen eighteen type of 
and we just went out to see a movie 
and then we just talked for a long time 
and I told her good night and drove home 
and that was incredible 
and so we started going out 
and when we got married it was such a happy time 
um I remember I went  t t t it didn't right away go 
be before we got married that last night for 
but I did 
and I woke up 
and I was really happy 
and uh I uh was looking fairly forward to it 
felt a_lot_of peace 
and so um we had a pretty special wedding that we had done 
and um the way we did it was that you_know I didn't get to see her how she was looking when h she walked out 
and I was standing way back 
and I saw her coming 
sorry 
it's no nothing sad I was just thinking of something happy kinda 
but I cried because she was coming w w w wsorry  with her dad 
and uh that was amazing 
and uh we had uh uh a fantastic uh w wedding there 
and uh anyway the whole time it was happy 
I don't know why I cried  sorry 
I think I might have thought of c because_of FirstnameT's  FirstnameT's like  FirstnameT's like uh mom who  who had passed away a year and a half ago 
so  I think that kinda got me 
but everything else w was  was really happy 
oh_boy 
well  in this case it's a  it's a  it's a guy a young bo boy 
and he's got a uh 
oh what do you call those things 
things that you 
see now I get stuck on 
I  I  n I owe 
totally I can't think what that's called 
uh bouncing go 
oh_no 
uh uh I  I'll get that 
do I have much time because  because I can think of that 
is there a timing on it 
okay  I hope that's okay and that's doesn't drive you crazy 
you're like 
 okay come_on  FirstnameJ 
uh I've got this 
it's  um oh what do you call that 
mom  the moms go with 
oh  I'm stuck on something really obvious 
but anyway he's gonna  he's taking it and um using his foot 
and as he does hits it a_little too hard into the r I guess  the right 
and it's going right toward a person's house 
and oops looks like in number three you can see that it  it actually broke there 
and there's this person's probably somebody's dad just sitting there 
it looks like he mighta been reading or something 
I'm  I'm not sure about that 
like oh_my_gosh got a_little startled 
now he's looking down at the fourth one 
and he can look back there and see what happened 
and then probably can see behind wh who that probably was I would assume back there 
so  that's my answer to that question 
okay 
on the first one xxx  on the first one uh there is uh a person 
this is a xxx  I guess 
and uh yes which is like  um sorry  which is like um um mother 
and it looks like to me like she is telling him that he should take a um 
uh it's going to be the hard when we hadta think what that's called 
uh to k not get wet 
um like when you go singing in the rain just singing in the rain 
stuck on what that's called 
but I know what it is 
um and so she  it looks like he's going like 
 no 
and the  though the  the second one it looks like he's  oh like she's 
oh I see what happened 
she's looking a little bit upset like 
 what 
 you're not gonna leave 
and then the third one he's now outside 
and boyco guess what happened 
now it's  it's  he's getting soaked 
and the fourth one he turns around to run back to the house 
yes and she does look a little bit upset 
and he's looking kind_of like 
 yeah  mom  y y you were right 
and he's soaked 
and now she has the other thing I can't think of what it's called  around him to keep not getting wet 
that's pretty much what I have 
okay  so  first  first I'm going to look at what I see 
um and then there's a_lot going on there in there 
okay 
there is a um 
okay 
ks I see it's a tree 
there is a man uh standing outside or  up high with the tree 
there's a dog 
can't help it 
I always notice like dogs and cats 
there's a dog at the bottom u u under there looking up 
kind_of looks like it's barking 
probably saying something like 
 what are you doing up there 
and there's a cat just sort_of hanging out 
oh I see 
and then are both under the cator   at the bottom of the cat or whatever uh uh is a young girl who's probably trying to help with  th with the  with the cat 
um interesting enough there  there is a uh 
uh what is that called 
oh_no 
I can point to it 
but I can't say it 
um there is a thing that  which the young girl could take with the  with the man 
and he could  uh he could walk down there 
can't think of what it's called 
um okay 
on the right uh uh uh see is a  uh is a um 
crud  I forgot what that's called 
I'll skip that one 
at the bottom there we do see there is a  uh a_couple guys  a person  people who are um gonna probably help him 
um uh the  which forgot what that's called too 
uh uh f like a  f like a f 
I can't say it 
with a f 
I  I got it 
with a fire person who's gonna come and probably help him up there 
that's what I've got 
okay 
should be interesting with me trying to remember how to say the story of Cinderella 
but um Cinderella starts with uh she was  had a wonderful mom a and also dad  father and mother 
and they were loving and  and kind 
and she was too 
and um something happened which a_lot  lot of 
and that was her  um her  sorry  her like mother 
so  h her dad  her father um met this other woman and decided to  uh he'd like to m m have h him and her get married 
and uh as I always watched it probably most of us seeing that would go 
 oh_no don't be marrying this particular person 
but he did 
and that person had a couple  uh a couple like  sorry  a_couple like daughters that she owned 
and it's showing that they're all very very mean not only to  to Cinderella but even to themself 
they just  they're just very  all they think about is uh themself 
and the  m the mother is just interested in trying to make a_lot_of money when she gets married 
so  they realize that Cinderella is just  is a very beautiful person 
I_mean she's  she's very  she's very pretty and beautiful 
but she's  inside she's just a really sweet person who  who cares about people 
so the  uh s oh  I think it's called stepmother 
I think that's what it's called 
um realizes they need to  she needs to keep Cinderella just only doing working with her daughters 
and so Cinderella's life changed from going through a very happy wonderful life to being what could be a terrible life because all that she's  m
but yet during that time Cinderella still stays somehow basically happy um at least for the most part and just doing a_lot_of lovely things in taking care of them 
and so around that time the  uh p the prince 
uh let me see 
his dad 
I can't think of what that's called 
um wanted to say that they needed to find for the princess who would be the fairest woman of them all 
who would be uh just a lovely like a girl 
and so they have  have this like  this like ball 
and so at first we saw in the pictures there a moment ago that um Cinderella was a happy wow could I ever do something like that you_know 
but they showed that the other two stepmothers 
and that their mom 
and they're excited that they can maybe be the one that's chosen 
woo this is hard 
but the um mom realizes 
 uhoh better not have with Cinderella because it would be pretty obvious that Cinderella would probably be the one that would be chosen 
so  Cinderella had started to get her outfit ready 
and again I always liked that part of the movie as I recall because I liked how the little uh animals horse even helping her because everything loved her because she was so wonderful 
so  they made is  made her beautiful thing 
but then the stepmother got where she  she  she couldn't go 
and so then Cinderella was really crying 
as I remember that's the first part of the movie that really shows Cinderella understandably being heartbroken 
and you_know how could they not even let me do anything 
and then there's s fairy godmother person pops out_of nowhere and makes it where Cinderella can have a beautiful what she's going to wear and where she can be uh driven 
she gets there 
and she can dance 
and he sees her and wants to dance with her 
and uh he's captivated by her 
and um all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes oh_no it's by this  i midnight where she hasta leave before everything was gonna change back 
so  Cinderella gets home 
and she's still kinda happy 
um which is  I thought that was always amazing 
she was still  she just happy a and so honest about 
 wow I got to actually do something like that 
and she thinks that's the end that would ever be 
but she was still happy 
and so then with the prince he is like 
 I hafta find out who  who  who that  who that was 
which I  I wouldn't really blame him 
of_course he's gonna wanna meet her 
and goes he wants to  he probably fell in love with her and wanted to meet her more and hopefully marry her 
so  um he hasta go  has a decree I guess that popped in  decree to every single unmarried person 
hasta be  uh figure out who that was because 
oh  yeah  I forgot when  when Cinderella was leaving she left one of her things 
I can't think what it's called 
behind your foot thing 
uh so  they know that if they can go to each person they'll find out who that was  h who that fits 
so  th they go 
and at the end Cinderella  it's obvious that she's the  the correct one 
so  they get married 
and then she's happily ever after 
that's it 
my  my brain is like 
 whew that's a_lot_of thought 
okay 
um take  take my peanut butter 
hafta open it 
take it out 
probably get  wanna get like not just like one but get  uh get two 
lay them down 
grab uh something to go under thing uh 
I can't think how to call it 
under the jelly 
and go in there 
and take one and put it around the peanut butter 
and grab as many as you need maybe two or three three or four 
and that's how I would say 
I don't know what to call that  sorry
