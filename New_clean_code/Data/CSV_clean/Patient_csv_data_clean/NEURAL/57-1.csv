my s speech today is doing pretty good 
some days not laughs 
um yes  I had a stroke at the school 
and I was a teacher 
and I had had um headaches for about a week or so and still working laughs during the day 
and um they said um all_of_a_sudden I said 
 can I lay down for a half an hour 
and all_of_a_sudden I  st I was talking to the  the nurse that's at the school 
and she said 
 FirstnameK  are you okay 
and I kept  I was trying  I was talking 
I thought what I was saying was right 
and I kept saying 
 I'm fine 
 I'm fine 
and she kept saying 
 FirstnameK 
and um obviously my talking was not even all there 
and I don't remember anything from that point to um I was  um I had this tube in there 
I got my brain done 
I got  I wa had a tube going 
I was out 
it breathes you and everything 
um I don't rimɛmbvɚu 
um I didn't even know my name 
I didn't know who I was 
they gave me a mirror to know who I was 
and I didn't know it was me 
I thought it was a picture of someone else 
so  yeah  for that long laughs 
so  I had about two weeks of not here laughs 
yes 
um let's see 
at the beginning um I had  I could not walk yet 
so  they were helping me to um stand up s at the beginning um not walking anywhere but able to stand up 
I hadta work on that because my leg was not working very well on the side 
um so  I had one therapist that  bet 
this one arm was not always going 
so  weights trying to get that going 
um then I had another um therapist um was trying to get me to start uh talking 
um I couldn't really talk of anything 
so  they were showing me like um yesq or noq a_lot 
um I  we had to start with that 
sometimes I didn't really even understand if they said 
 do you wanna drink something 
usually they would show me that 
and I thought 
 what are they doing 
I'd  so  that was hard 
um even at the beginning I didn't even understand cups 
and um they had to show me how to use a cup again because I would just spill it everywhere 
and um they showed me how to  they hadta show me how to eat again 
um to  um at the beginning I was very  um very scared by myself in a room 
um I also thought we had  I  I thought someone had took me like  um like a bad person taking me 
so  I was trying to run to help myself 
I had those thoughts too of scared um uh to the point where I was trying to um hit people in a way because I thought they were trying to help no  I thought they were bad people 
so  I  I was trying to hit them a little bit because I need to run 
that was even that part for me 
I went from being scared to very crying feeling the other way 
um didn't  my mom and dad were there 
didn't know who they were 
um my kids were here 
didn't know them 
um like I said they showed me a mirror 
and they said 
 do you know who you are 
and I  di I thought 
 who is this person 
and it was me 
so  that's when it got started 
um then therapy started with even very small like um saying my name  saying yesq or noq 
um went from that point to we played some games t for numbers like um dice 
um we played some games that were cards like uh p play cards in a way  put  sort all the cards together  what colors matching 
suh little things 
it gives me um focus 
and also I would əlæksu 
if we're playing a game I was okay 
so  we did that 
um then they started giving me cards 
what  the first one I ever saw was a baby 
there's a baby card 
and there was a bird 
and they said 
 what is this 
is it a bird or um a baby 
and it took 
I didn't know 
but I knew it a little bit in my brain 
but not really on what they were you_know 
it was happy thoughts 
but I don't know  I wasn't sure what that was 
that's when it started 
um then I was able to start not walking very well 
but I could stand up  pivot  sit down to go to the bathroom in there by myself 
that's when all that started during 
um once I left to go home I could actually walk pretty well  not fast but hafta watch for dizzy at the beginning 
I still do have to watch my um uh dizzy s feelings 
but um therapy  that kind of therapy they were showing me to start walking better  stuff like that 
and other therapy was still doing the talking  started at the beginning 
um so  it's  that was about uh a year of just talking  working on all those words and all that you_know 
um then after two years didn't have to worry about the other therapy because now I'm starting to walk uh very well now 
so  only just therapy for  um um for speech 
um then I would say after about a year and a half almost three years um we started working on these numbers which I still not good at laughs 
um I went from um one to now I know one and two to one two three 
I'm not  higher than that not very good so you_know 
and one plus one  not sure there yet 
but  um so  was working on numbers um and trying to start reading of any kind 
um reading  it took me a couple years to figure out writing or reading 
I'm still not all there 
now it's been three years 
um I can  I really can't read  I say 
um sentences  maybe 
it depends on what we're talking about 
I'm starting to read um books from like little kids books 
um now I can do some of that 
writing is not as good 
so  I use my phone 
but um therapy people was showing me like apps  stuff like that 
because someday if you can't write again there's other apps to help yourself on doing stuff like that 
so  well  I can't remember the first thing we're talking about 
sorry about that 
see  this is me laughs 
okay  kʊzu 
um let's see 
um I  th does it have to  so  what 
are you talking about just um a story are you saying 
or are you saying like something about something like that 
okay  um I think um is  is new stuff 
I  I think um since  since I'm i a teacher 
and I was before 
um but now I hafta um be a teacher in another fashion versus kids at school  right 
so  one of my favorite things to do is finding new friends that had their stroke 
they have aphasia 
and we  um when there's a new patient here um I  I like to help them 
they're gonna have the  sa the same struggles most of the time that I had 
and so um now we  we are now friends 
I can help them to have her 
um and um tips I can give them 
um and so now when I do that kind of stuff I'm now a teacher again 
so  I  I like that 
and they're also now my friends 
I  when I had my stroke my real friends never called me back 
so  I haven't seen some of them now for years 
they don't call me back 
they don't understand me now 
um so  my new friends are kinda like me 
we're very  uh we talk a_lot which is good 
but um I think that we have bad days 
um therapy is hard some days 
um um some days our brain  mine  my  I would say my brain doesn't always work some days 
um my eyes don't always work 
um my foot  now that we're talking my foot's not working right now 
um things like that 
but um my life being a teacher and a friend is  uh is an awesome thing to me 
yeah  yeah 
okay 
I can't see us on the last one because we're in the middle ourselves 
so  I'm not sure what's under the last one 
um looks like there's a boy that's been um hitting the ball round 
probably a 
I remember the name of those little guys 
but um they're playing that ball 
and it looks  he hit the window 
and uh um it hit the window and went in 
so  it crashed the window 
yeah 
and I don't know if it's his house or not 
it could be someone else's house 
but  um and he also hit the lamp also 
and the guy 
I'm gonna move this again just a minute and I'll 
um so the guy is  well  he has the ball 
but I don't know if he 
yeah  he's just looking 
so  I don't know if that kid decided to leave 
or if he's gone growls 
so  that  that must be  there should be more story line on that one 
I don't know if he  r he ran or if the  da if the guy's just going 
 where'd he go 
okay  laughs okay 
um one of the kids have 
and mom said 
 there's probably gonna be a rain today 
 and so bring your that's my word  bɚɛləu 
and the kid said 
 nah I don't need it 
and I'm sure mom said 
 okay 
and so  but he went outside 
and here comes the rain um going faster even maybe more raindrops 
and so then d um he said 
 okay 
he went the other way home and said 
 you're right mom 
 I should've had it 
and so mom gave it to him 
and then he went back outside for school with the bɚɛləu 
yes  that's a funny one laughs 
okay 
um it  it looks like there's uh a cat s stuck in the tree 
and so dad said 
 I think I can help and had a ladder and got up there 
and the um ladder fell down 
and so someone must've called the uh fire people 
and they're going to get him out_of the  uh the tree and h maybe even the cat 
um let's see 
there 
yeah I don't know if it's really dad  I guess 
maybe it's just someone who is helping for the cat 
or if it's you_know the little girl's dad that did that 
I'm not sure 
I don't see any houses around 
so  it's hard to tell 
um she had her bike  I guess 
but  uh and there's a dog obviously that's barking because there's a guy up there in the  in the tree 
so  yep 
okay 
I don't remember her name  sorry 
it's hard 
um okay 
she um 
let's see 
I don't remember where she comes from 
but um she's in the  um the house with um the 
it's not her mom 
it's um 
I don't remember what calls that 
but it's not her mom_momnn you_know 
and  but s there's two other sisters 
and they get to do whatever they want during the day 
but the other girl hasta clean and  um and do all the stuff that who wants to do  right 
and um I'm sure she's  uh but she's  yeah she watches the  um the castle the big one 
and I'm sure that she watches and thinks 
 oh I wish I was over there 
and um then th they  um we get a letter that says they're gonna do a 
let's see what 
it's not a party 
there's a word but I don't have it 
the ball 
that's what they call it  yeah 
so  like uh a party in a way 
but you ba dance and look beautiful 
and um everyone could go 
and I think they're going to do that because they want the um prince 
I think he's a prince 
and he finds  he needs to find a lady 
and so there's a way to do it  I think 
so  um they said 
 let's do this ball and find some cute ones for him 
and um so when they got their paper um I think she even gets to go 
she didn't say she couldn't go 
but she had a beautiful dress in her um 
I say it's not  it's not a  a box 
it's something pretty 
but I don't know what they call those things 
and um but she was looking at the dress 
and oh I'm gonna look so good 
and the other girls um they don't look as cute 
but they  um they  s she  l they looked her stuff 
and they wanted this and that and dress  and h um tore her dress and everything 
and so they were gonna go 
and she looked  she didn't have thing 
and so she was sad 
and the fairy um 
I think that's what she is 
I don't remember 
right now she's different than the one you watch her another way 
laughs useta be a small one 
now she's a  l a real lady 
but um she was there 
and she said 
 I can help you 
and so she takes the  um the rats and  and the dog and everything become people 
and the pumpkin they make it pretty for her to go in there 
and they gave her a dress that looks beautiful 
and she said 
 but you can only stay until midnight 
and so she may forget that part at the beginning 
she's just  she's so excited 
she doesn't think about the time very well really  laughs 
and so  um so  then 
let's see 
um she gets in there 
and I'm sure that everyone says 
 ooh she's here 
and  um but the uh 
he's not a king yet 
the prince sees her and said 
 whoo she's cute 
and so they dance and  and everything 
and um all_of_a_sudden she does figure out the time 
and she looks at that and says 
 uhoh I gotta go 
and so um she runs down the stairs 
but one of her um they're not shoes  heels 
I don't know 
there's  there's rɑɾəu 
I don't know 
I say shoes 
um um so  she  um one of them falls 
and um she gets home 
and you could tell she was  she had a good night 
but she's probably also kind_of sad on the fact she never gets to come back in her head you_know 
but it was a beautiful night 
and then um she's back at home cleaning and everything else 
and here comes one of the people who works for the  um you_know the king and guy I'm sure 
so  they bring this guy 
and he has one of the shoes and says he  they want to find the pretty one 
and um those girls of_course they're hoping  they know they're not her sh shoes 
but they said 
 but maybe I could put them on anyway because you never know 
and of_course their usually have big feet or who knows 
but um I don't xxx that part of that story 
but I remember it before 
and then  um so  all_of_a_sudden she gets to decide now 
I don't know if they really  the  I don't think the other mom would've let her even try it 
but I'm sure someone  I don't  I don't  one of the  one of the ra rats figure this out or something 
they  they help her to  to sit down and put them on 
so  um there must be kind_of thing going on to help her to do that 
and then  um and they fit 
and um so uh she gets to come back to the um castle 
and um they get married 
and oh  and the end is always the 
oh  what's the word 
I wish I had it in my head 
but it's not there 
you_know they always say at the end 
 afterq 
like alwaysq 
well  what is those words 
I wish I remember the name 
it was like  it always says the end of all the stories 
afterq 
bah I don't have it 
but I'm excited about it 
so  um and they are always together 
you_know they always do 
yeah 
oh  okay  now I'm going to show you there's another way to do this 
so  I'm gonna give you the real stɔɪu 
so  if you want um peanut butter um jelly right together 
so  the first thing you need is two bread slices 
and then what's weird about it you deed 
and you take some of the um peanut butter 
and you put it in the cup 
and then you get some of the jelly 
and it has to be a certain kind because my dad only says you can have this kind 
I don't know it's one of those things 
and you put that in there 
and you get a spoon 
and you stir it like this ges
I don't know I've done this since I was a kid 
and then you take it out_of the cup 
and you put it on the bread together 
and then you put them together like this ges
and the  you eat it that way 
although when you're a kid you're also go imit
dad only let's you do that part because this is his sæmwɪtʃu 
you get part of the  uh the from the spoon 
yeah
