well for the most part or  or  I guess I'd hafta say m most of the time I think it's doing a_lot better than it  it  it had done 
and  and we're talking of_course a after my stroke  right 
hopefully I wouldn't have 
yeah  so  I think I  I'm doing better 
have a way I hafta like go 
but I think I'm doing better 
I've been trying really hard to think 
and  and I don't mean to keep blabbing 
I'm sorry but 
I'm just talking 
earlier um I think it was  yeah this morning I was telling somebody here my wife or my kids or something about how sometimes I feel like a person that's just not born but whatever 
what I mean is there's things I've just forgotten all about 
we  we got to eat a couple of things and I just forgot 
oh I forgot what that even is 
and so in a way that's kind_of exciting 
but then you feel like 
 oh_my_god what's happened to me that I couldn't remember xxx 
so but  yeah but overall better  better hopefully 
I'm hoping 
yes 
absolutely 
um no  I  I probably feel like I blabbed too much about that last time 
so  it 
I had come home 
and uh it wasn't very late in the day 
I think it was maybe twelve or one o'clock  I think 
and uh I had uh decided to look outside to see if we got any  um yeah any like  I'm sorry  any like  um uh any  I'm sorry  any mail 
and um I walked back in the house and said hi and gave them the mail  I think 
and anyway I um just started feeling really weird 
and I can't even remember exactly how that was or how to even explain it 
but I uh decided I wanted to just to sit down with our  with my like bedroom 
and I did 
and right away it just started getting worse 
and it really hurt 
and for me it was you_know my left side  I guess 
but it was probably other ones 
but I think I felt more here 
and um something  I just remember getting to tell my wife because something just felt really  very very different and strange 
and something was  was kind_of scary 
and um she started talking with me 
and realized  she asked me a few questions 
and um she could tell after several things she'd asked me that I wasn't making enough sense 
and then I started feeling almost sick 
and she got me a thing in case I did 
and I did getting sick 
and she right away knew to get me to uh a  a hospital 
and uh I think that  well  my wife and my kids knew  they probably figured some things out because with  um my wife's mom had passed away uh about s six months or something I guess it was before that 
I think that's about right 
and I think  last thing I'm saying is I think that I might have thought something was going on because I remembered what had happened with her a little bit 
and um so I was thinking about that and praying about that 
and that's the last thing I can tell you 
we were going to the hospital 
and I was trying  she was asking me a_lot_of questions as she was driving 
and I was doing the best I could 
but I  I couldn't really explain very well 
so  it was a pretty uh whew wow pretty intense thing that happened 
that is a fantastic question 
um and if you asked my that before I'm not even thinking of that 
so  I'm just saying that's a really excellent question 
um well  my wife and my kids came from church 
friends had been all so wonderful 
and especially as a wife and kids they um asked me a_lot_of questions 
and part of the whole thing I don't know how to say it  um is they've had to figure out what I'm trying to say 
and uh they've been very patient about this when I get stuck on something 
and every now and then I get a little bit upset 
but not upset like crazy scary something 
y I just  I just get frustrated because I know what I'm trying to say but I can't think how to say it 
but anyway so they've  um also  also with them I should have said um my sister 
my sister is always  always one of my best friends 
she's a couple years younger than me 
and  a and her husband too 
um they've all gotten back 
and they showed me a_lot_of photos and remembrances you_know 
things that I remember 
and sɛnu 
I don't have it here 
but like they'd gaven 
like if it says like uh um dogq a picture of a dog 
they give me tons of those 
but my wife's is the main one 
she's helped me out so much 
and like I say they've had to guess what I'm trying to say 
or like I'll say 
 oh it's like this 
and then they're all trying to ge imit
and then finally someone will figure 
I'll say 
 yeah that's it 
that  that's it 
you_know but it's getting to the point where um hopefully as I'm getting better I hope um they'll sometimes say 
 you_know FirstnameJ now y y y you know what that  what that  that  that means 
 so  you just keep trying 
you_know  so  that's been a_lot_of  a_lot_of it 
and then I think also with me  with me playing music um my wife's realized that so much of that seems to have come back which is amazing because for a long time I didn't do music for a long time in my life 
I started again awhile back 
but stuff's back there from when I was a kid 
it's just back you_know 
oh  and one more thing 
we really love certain tv shows and um sometimes movies 
and a_lot_of those have  have helped me too 
there's certain ones that we just really like 
that I don't know it just helps me you_know with anyway 
so  that helps at all 
so  uh it was gonna get something else but I can't think what to say 
um um sorry  I'm stuck on what the name of the show is 
I guess that  that's probably not very im important  sorry 
we  I liked  I watch a_lot_of older shows 
and some of those are just great 
they're just great 
anyway  so  that's what I've got 
cool  yeah  there are just certain ones 
and some of the especially  I'm not trying to uh say anything whatever bad about newer shows because there's certainly some good new ones I'm sure 
but some of those older ones are just  just so great 
sometimes they're so th well thought out or just so funny 
y the  a and so even when I was a kid there were certain shows that everybody remembered 
you_know it's just I'll say something that's kind_of probably silly 
but they're showing with tv now um uh the guy with the Fonzi going heyq 
you_know it's just one little  that's not a very deep thing 
but something like that back then that was everybody knew w who that was 
anyway it's the best I've got 
sorry  sorry  that I'm  I'm  I'm taking a second 
I'm trying to decide which one I had mentioned 
my wife um and that's a very  very vital one 
I thought I'd try to think of uh something else too 
and every one I'm thinking of i isn't much to say in there 
so  and there's a_lot I just  just  just think of it 
um I thought of one that would be very hard for me explain that 
I just  I wouldn't be able to get all in my head 
um well  okay 
with my wife again when we got married  w when we were married 
I mentioned that 
but I don't think I mentioned this 
um after we'd been married for a couple days we went up north up to Wisconsin and no  yeah 
and no yeah  and then we went 
uh sorry  Wisconsin 
als s what I meant to say was actually  actually next to that which is like  which sorry  which  which is Michigan 
and we went up to Michigan to stay 
oh_brother  it uh 
how could I not think of that 
I could draw a picture of it 
I could drive where to get there 
I can't think what it's called 
oh Mackinaw 
and we stayed at uh Mackinaw 
and that was fantastic 
we had a few days 
and um we stayed at a beautiful place 
and um it was just so peaceful and just beautiful 
and at  at that place I had mentioned which took me while to get out as kɔku 
well  up in Mackinaw uh they can't have any vehicles and cars 
so  you just hear this little clip clip clip clip clip of  of  of  sorry  of a horse  horses going imit
and uh we just were out there 
we had a s suite I guess you'd call it  o our third floor 
and we could open it up and look down there and just see these  these horses 
and it was just so peaceful and so beautiful 
and um that was uh a wonderful time 
um just being married and having a life together with each other 
and looking back at that and seeing there's a_lot_of other all around that whole place 
but I remember that particular part of it 
um and there's another one that's close to it 
uh I guess it was 
I forgot if it's before or after 
right around there we went to a place called the Sleeping Bear Dune that this guy that I knew years ago had just told me 
 oh you should go there 
and so we went there not even knowing how to  how to get there because back then we didn't have like uh our  um our interuhnet 
we had to just figure out how to get there 
but we found this place 
well  you  you  you  you go up real high 
and then when you finish you can just run down 
that was one of the neatest things 
when I went up all the way high and we could look down there it was just beyond beautiful just unbelievable 
and so when I think about that too I just  I just  I just get  just get happy 
so  that's my little stories 
um on number  on one um there's a guy  a boy whatever 
and he's got a soccer 
and he's hitting the soccer 
and on the second one looks like he is 
oh I see it now 
he's hit it 
and you can see actually where it's actually  where they have it showing w where exactly went 
and he hit by mistake I'm sure but hit one of the um 
oh  let's see here 
let me think what it's called 
one of the um houses 
and it got crashed 
and on number three 
oh_boy  there's the  the man that probably owns the house there who was sitting down probably just trying to just relax and all_of_a_sudden probably got oh_my_gosh what was that scared but realized what happened 
then um that just crashed and  and  and broke 
and so again I missed you on that but I think 
because I can't see him 
but it looks like he's probably angry 
a but he's  he's like holding it 
and he can see what made it get broken 
and I think that's end of the story  I think 
how much time 
d d do you hafta s make me start right away or 
okay 
I've got it  okay 
I got stuck on that one thing 
okay 
there is a thing called a  god crud  called an  called  wait a minute  called an  an umbrella 
and there is uh a  uh looks like a boy um who's younger and his mom who looks like she is telling him 
 you need to wear or I_mean  you need to have th that 
I'm sorry 
yeah I said it again 
 that  um th need to have that  that umbrella in_case it starts to rain 
so  he just kind_of is 
 oh  no  mom 
I  I  do I don't  I don't need that or I don't want it or something 
and she looks like she's a_little concerned 
and  and that was on  on number two 
on number three um looks like he's now outside 
and it's starting to rain 
and he now realizes he needs to 
a and can  now I'm on four 
um he turned around to the left to run back 
and he's realizing he really made  made a  uh a goofy mistake and should've listen to  to h his mom 
yes and number five he's like back to see her 
he must be in the house because now I don't see all the rain coming 
but he's like soaked 
and she looks understandably kind_of upset 
don't want to say angry but kind_of upset 
and so now he's going 
this is number sev six 
he's going back outside 
and he now has what he should have had for the dang it  for the dang it  for the  the umbrella 
and oh as he's going now he's not getting soaked because he is wearing  having an umbrella 
that's it 
uh this is hard because I hafta 
okay uh I understand what's going on 
I gotta think of all the different  what they're all called 
well  okay  I'm just gonna put it the way I would say it 
I don't know 
uh there is a dad 
and  ris oh I see what happened 
it looks like he might have tried to 
uh could be two  two possibilities 
okay um he has a very tall like tree 
and he's  he's  he's up there 
and he's like stuck 
it looks like the 
what is that called 
web 
what is that thing called 
um I guess that's what makes it what I have  what's happened to me 
I can't think how to call a certain thing 
a thing that he normally could have s stuck in front of 
oh I just touched something  sorry 
touch something thank_you  sorry 
and that looks like that had like fallen down 
looks like he was going up there to get a  um to try to help to get  to get yeah to  to get a  uh a cat 
and looks like his I guess  daughter is looking up at the cat 
probably she's um 
 oh  k kitty  get on down  cat 
like she's concerned about the kitty 
um there's a little um 
uh it's hard to explain  isn't it 
there's a little thing that she could have been maybe 
uh what do you call those things 
as a kid you can  you can get there 
and you can drive 
um it could have even have fallen down the  fallen down what he needs to not be stuck 
I'm not sure 
anyway on the other side behind him uh that's a dog 
dog's up there woofing woof woof woof probably wants I don't know  saying 
 get on down 
I don't know 
and then on the last part here uh there are two s responders  pers people coming trying to help 
and there is a um 
something else I forgot what it's called 
oh what is that called 
we see that um where they would use to have gotten around there 
I can't think what it's called 
and the last thing on the very top of that is a  um a bird 
that's the best I can do right now 
um the story of Cinderella 
um I guess it starts off 
leas at least the way I remember 
it starts off showing how her husband and wife were very  um v very good people 
and they treated her as they should very  very  very kind and with  with a_lot_of love 
and um that would  would of_course have been great except um her  her like mother died 
and I guess a_lot of those like Disney shows do that sometimes 
and um so the dad was a good man 
but um like a_lot_of people I guess would eventually think that maybe he might wanna try to meet someone else 
and so that ends up happening 
and really messed up by marrying this other woman 
who ends up  she's just so cruel and so selfish 
and um oh okay what I should say before t also is that they even show earlier how happy that Cinderella is with her life 
and so what I mean now is that the 
uh what is it called 
the other woman um she now has uh the power I guess where she's really being awful with  um with  s with Cinderella 
a and I guess maybe even the  her d dad might've died 
I don't remember about that 
anyway  so  they're showing  they would show in the story then now how Cinderella her life is just totally changed 
she went through um a really nice life which was deserving to her because she was a very  very  very wonderful person very sweet and lovely to people and cared about people and wouldn't hurt anyone 
so  now that the other mother is now there um the other mother uh makes Cinderella do everything 
all the washing and uh everything you can think of cooking I guess cleaning whatever you do 
and these  those two sisters  the  sek fes the other s sighs 
what are those called 
those two other girls um are just so mean to her and so just very s like very snotty horrible 
don't even care about Cinderella at all 
only that they can get whatever they want 
they make her do everything 
but even so she still  seems to still have an amazing way to be uh lovely and sweet and caring 
and so um I think I remember also it shows Cinderella just looking out one time and seeing what it could look like to see what it would look with the other place 
I can't think what it's called 
um beautiful place 
so  sorry  somebody's walking back here and I'm  I'm getting this for um 
s okay so  um okay  I think then the next part of the story is it shows that the  um that the king is decreeing that his son needs to get married with the right woman 
I guess 
so  oh  this is hard 
so  the  um the like 
s how's that  I'm in track where they are 
so the  so  it's made by decree that they should have  uh they should have this like  th yeah okay this like  this like ball 
where in the ball every girl that is not married needsta  hasta come there 
and then they'll be able to  dec to figure out who's the best one that he should  he should marry 
so  then they showed in the picture if I remember right uh his 
 oh  good  we all get to go to the ball 
and sh s she's excited because she thinks between those two daughters that one of them will  will be  uh that they will want one of th them 
so  they're all excited including Cinderella was excited 
but lo_and_behold um I think it showed that the other mother says 
 oh  no  you're not going there 
seems to me like I remember like the mother even got rid of something nice she could wear  I think 
anyway  so  Cinderella part of her  part of how she's just so lovely and kind um even the little  um a little like um sorry like ænəbəlu 
um so  they even do what  help to try to make her what she can wear 
and I think I'm  what happened with that 
anyway  yeah  then it gets messed up 
and then later at that point I remember in the story I think that's where it shows Cinderella really  for the first time really crying 
really just destroyed because it's like 
 come_on I can't even you_know do anything 
 I can't even d d go to this ball 
I'm being  it's like they think she's just nothing 
and um she doesn't deserve any of that 
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother pops out_of nowhere 
and she makes a beautiful outfit 
and uh then she uh 
oh_boy the  the photos you showed me before I think the next one showing where um 
uh yeah with  with  with  it's like a pumpkin 
where the pumpkin is made to where Cinderella can sit in 
and the animals are made to look like they're uh people 
uh um and just  the fairy godmother has told her 
 you can go back 
 you can have a  have a  have a great time 
 but by the stroke of midnight it's all gonna go back the other way again 
so  I think it showed Cinderella arrives 
and they can see that um the other  uh the other  the other two daughters and the mother are both shocked like 
 oh_no Cinderella's here 
and uh then the um 
why this is really hard to explain this 
then the um guy 
I can't think what he's even called now 
uh oh how embarrassing 
um I can't think of the name of the guy 
the young man who's gonna try to hopefully meet a wonderful wife sees her 
and he is  is very interested in her of_course 
and uh he seemed like a nice man like a good man 
and  and she of_course is a absolutely very wonderful and very very good um um girl 
and they get to dance 
and it's just almost magical 
they're just obvious those two are meant to be like in love 
so  then Cinderella leaves or  sees 
 oh_no it's almost midnight 
so  she has to suddenly run 
he's thinking 
 wait wait 
 come back 
 come back 
and as she's running down her slipper  a grass 
and she hasta keep running 
so  then I think the pictures show that she's back home 
and she's  she's just happy that she got to do something 
um and then they find out that 
uh boyco my brain 
that there was a s grass 
or they're  they're gonna find who was that woman who we actually  would of_course have been cin cin cin Cinderella 
and so they go to every unmarried young woman 
and none of them  it doesn't fit right w with any of them with the slipper grass 
I can't talk right 
with the slipper 
and um it does for  s for Cinderella 
and so she becomes married 
and I think I missed one thing in there 
seems like the  the mom ends up breaking that or something first 
I don't remember that 
but anyway they find the other one  like I say 
and  and that fits 
that's the only one that  that fits right 
and it's obviously she's  she's the one 
and then it shows that they get married 
and they're happily ever after 
I think that's it 
uh yeah you'd open up each of the  each of the like sorry  each of the like jellies 
excuse_me let me let me start over again 
peanut butters 
oh  wait a minute 
I'm saying that backwards 
peanut butters 
oh yeah okay 
first I have to get out 
I can't think what to call it 
what I would made hot 
I'd take probably two of those 
and then get peanut butter 
and go inside it 
and take one 
and put it around 
right  both maybe  maybe 
and then get the jelly 
put it around there 
that's the best I've got
