how it was 
um mostly when I started 
I had a month I don't even remember anything about it 
but um it was like ten days 
they finally got me in there to  um I finally started  I_mean I could actually talk or anything like that 
um but I had to remember how to remember everything 
and we're  everything is gone back 
I mean everything about um abck all that kind of stuff like that 
everybody's name 
everybody  the computer on there 
the  the Coke sitting there 
everything 
the wrong about it 
you have nothing about it 
you hadta remember everything about it 
so  um we um went to 
I had like thirty  thirty days first that they brought in there trying to get to see what I was doing mostly to see what it was first 
um and then um we went to 
um after that that's when we started to talk and to um get in the sort of thing 
make sure I'm forget something 
it's ten years before 
um laughs but we did start like um abck one two three or something like that with my mom 
started to  um it's in um um books 
I went there 
there is someone  we got a talk over there 
and she talked to me all the time about remember how you start about everything getting all abck one two three and stuff like that 
um and it took a long time 
it was about a year the start over that 
and I've gone down 
it was Monday to Friday 
now it's down Monday Wednesday Friday 
then after that there's a bigger place in Chicago for six weeks 
just try to talk a_little better and that 
because I_mean at this time I could talk a_little better 
but it just hard to get back everything out_of there 
so  that helped different things about it for those six weeks 
and you're trying with computer 
or trying to  try to write on there 
trying to do something about it get a_little better there 
and that's how they tried to 
after that they started IU 
and that's when they um started with noun verb preposition all those kind of things like that 
um there's so much you couldn't remember anything about it 
um but it's  you just take your time trying to 
me  m me and my mom  my mom helps me all the time still trying to rewrite everything stuff like that 
but if you hadta rewrite things about it after you do that you do very good about this things 
so  it doesn't keep everything in there the whole time 
so  you just gotta keep everything  keep where you're getting things you're doing there and still be able to talk 
mostly taking my time 
so  if I talk too much people have no idea what I'm doing 
and they talk to me real quick 
this is kind_of weird because if one person talk 
if there's three people I can understand other people 
I can understand more of this 
but  so  it takes time um getting around everything 
so  um so  it's just  it keeps going every year and stuff like that and just getting a_little better 
um I don't know how long I can go 
but it's just  it seems like I'm still doing something with it 
so  um and it keeps going over time 
so  so  I try to write everyday all kind of stuff like that 
and the  um and it's  my mom's very helping 
that and my sisters who helped a little bit there too 
they need to do something like that 
but um I have my brothers too 
one of them  I_mean one I don't see him all the time but when I do we do very good with each other 
so  it just  it's not it  as it used to be 
I knew a_lot_of people and all that kind 
now I'm kind_of move down like a_couple people I knew and just take my time 
so  it's a_lot easy as how it was 
um I dunno 
is that come around or 
xxx about it was um like I said I had to re remember everything 
I_mean I wasn't really  didn't get me out that bad because I said 
 what was I gonna do 
so  you hadta restart everything to get back on there 
so  you took your time and tried to get through it 
and I_mean if you're going to yell at it it's not gonna do anything for it 
so  you're  the best thing you do is try on it stuff like that 
and if like right now if this was killing me for an hour or something like that 
I'd be outside and doing stuff like that or you_know 
but it really doesn't bother me that much 
I_mean I just take my time during the day 
like I'm  I'm gonna dry  s
and I might go outside and working on the  a branch or something like that 
just keep going back and forth 
um like I'd  I'd go get my aunt 
she's ninety seven 
I get her on almost every times for a week 
and maybe like one day of the week and we'll see her 
but I get her on the phone every day 
but that just keeps me in another reason to get out there and just something to keep moving 
and  and it's another way to get through to me and everybody else 
I_mean a_lot_of them can't understand what I'm doing 
but a_lot I know they know everything about it 
so  it's easy about it  so 
just anything you're telling me or 
um I thought it was kind_of totally different when I  I  re I restarted here 
um I hadta remember how to do everything 
which was  it was kind_of  it's a_little weird for every  everybody too 
because I_mean I knew right away my mom could ask me you_know what this was in the kitchen or something like that 
yeah I knew how to make it 
I can make my breakfast and all that stuff 
she goes 
 know what that is 
no  can't remember 
like that 
I knew everything 
it's all on my head like that 
I_mean made my breakfast and you_know like the um eggs bacon um microwave and the whatever like things like that 
and always be there in the morning 
always my breakfast first 
people think I'm weird 
but  but  um but it's just something that um 
it is another way I tried to keep doing what I'm doing 
but it also is doing whatever I need to do 
I_mean I hadta do everything like that anyway 
so  it took some time on that 
and um it's  it was a long time to do 
but you had  just took your time and do whatever you're doing  I think 
it's  um I don't know how to 
you're not gonna too quick 
and you hafta do sometimes 
so  you just kinda do whatever you're doing but then a little bit farther 
number one the  the boy was sitting outside with a um soccer ball 
and he kicked a good one there 
but it went over by um the house over there went into the umbrella um not the umbrella how_about  the window 
went into the  through inside there it look 
there's a guy sitting in number third 
the soccer ball came in 
knocked out the lamp 
knocked him out too 
he was probably sleeping I think and scared him out pretty bad 
and then um number four I gotta see what I can move around here 
uh he's over looking through the window to see who it was 
their probably  probably ran away 
but um he's not very happy somebody threw the soccer ball into the window there 
about it 
um mom told the boy that she 
and she 
 oh  no  I don't need to take that 
on number two 
number three he went out there and it rained 
so  he's walking 
and it's raining more 
and he's getting his feet in there 
but he got all the way back 
and she's not very happy with him 
mom's very happy with him 
and he knows 
he had water all over the place 
but next time he changed and took the umbrella with him 
enough 
okay 
um looks for some reason the cat was up in the tree 
which they could do anytime  I think 
um well  I don't know 
they can't get everything but they're  they do to know  to enough 
um but the  the girl she'd like to get her cat back 
but  um so  she's waiting there 
and her  her dad decided he could go up there to help with that 
when he took the um 
I know what it is 
lak  lædɪdu 
something close like that 
but he took it up the top 
and  um and it fell down 
so  he's gonna have trouble anyway 
the cat's too far away 
but he's stuck 
he can't get down 
the dog's kinda barking at him for no reason driving him nuts 
but  um but the um firemen came in here 
they're gonna help for him 
so  they're walking over this way 
um so  they're walking 
and they'll get up here in a little bit 
they'll get him out I think unless they want to get the cat for him 
but um the  the bird's happy 
they're on the other place over there away from everyone else 
so  they're singing something like that 
but um it's pretty much about what it is unless they're waiting on he gets down and the cat doesn't wanna come down 
um did I get enough 
okay 
looks like  um for some reason they gave it seems like another cousin with them 
they gave her with her aunt 
so  um I'm not sure why he's  they send that way 
but anyway um whoever gave it said that'd be nice 
we'll give it to you and stuff like that 
and they'll keep and  st and they'll make it good for you too 
but then the aunt 
she made her pretty bad 
she had to go work outside and  and everything else 
and again she's certain  s
but her cousins 
they got to do whatever they wanted 
and they're kind_of a pain in the butt 
um but  um so  that's how it was for all the time 
she tried to be nice 
but they were still not very nice 
but um the one time they were gonna have they were t 
I guess they do for the sometime the year they get to see everybody 
so  they went to um see if this would be  see 
their  their aunt 
um so  they're gonna go there to play or  play or sing that night and stuff like that 
but their cousin 
but a  um uh what would you say it'd be 
um s not a ghost or some I don't know what 
they had one they would bring on the way 
that's not normal how the um people and stuff like that 
this was totally different 
how they 
but they 
so  she could go on that way 
um so  she got to go in that place 
then um went to see there to that night 
got up 
she could go um sing and play or was out there 
got some people 
and that's where they saw the big um 
it's one of the 
I think he's um 
I don't know if he is the king 
or he might be just the new king coming there 
he was out there 
he was with her for a while 
but then she hadta leave 
and he is worried what happened her 
but um she left 
and he was worried about that 
but she did drop one of her um shoes 
so  he had that 
so  they went back 
she was going back her place where she was just gon not very happy and working and all that kind of stuff 
but um her cousins 
and they put them on there 
and her feet are huge 
so  it wasn't gonna work on that 
but then um while they're there they did  he did bring them over to her 
and it worked perfect on her feet and got in the shoes 
so  he knew what it was 
so  he took her back 
and that's one of the great or  the best thing you could ever do 
she went back 
she's  she's like a queen now 
so  best thing that came on that way 
so  enough 
okay 
you  um I would take two the bread 
um put it on  on top of plate 
um I got some butter 
and I really can't say what it was laughs 
um it's in the 
well  I took one of those out 
so  you take the knife and  and just lot  s
um so  you could flip both sides so c comes in  in the middle there 
I'll take the knife and go wipe it off  put it in the dishes something like that 
um usually get something to drink 
Coke mostly 
but go sit down on 
um and just in  in your hands 
and you got your  got the sandwich 
and should be pretty good
