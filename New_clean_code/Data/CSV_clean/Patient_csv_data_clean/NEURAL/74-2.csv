well  it's doing fairly well except when I get in a hurry laughs and try to describe something for someone 
that's where I have more problem with speech than anything  I think 
is des describing something for somebody else to he know what I'm trying to uh talk about 
especially FirstnameP my wife laughs 
seems like you_know I'm think 
 she oughta know this 
and then you_know get the details 
and then sometimes the details don't  don't work well 
so 
all I remember about the stroke is the fact I woke up one morning with a splitting headache 
and it was so bad that uh 
I think it's probably the worst headache I ever had 
um took a couple aspirin and went to  uh outside and picked up the mail  my  not the mail but  my newspaper 
went back to have breakfast 
and uh as I was reading the newspaper while I had breakfast I tried to read 
and I could not make  read the paper properly 
the blocks of words ch were just that 
they were blocks 
and some of it  they weren't s all together 
it was like I was seeing part of the words or part of the blocks of words not the whole words 
so  I left the newspaper that morning and didn't uh read it and finished getting ready and went to work 
and uh drove to work 
and on the way to work I uh noticed that on the dashboard of the car  again parts of that was  I could see parts of the dashboard 
and parts of it I couldn't see 
I couldn't see all the words all that 
but I was able to drive properly 
and uh drove to work 
got to work 
and when I tried to  got to work I tried to log into my computer 
and I didn't know how 
I think that's probably the best thing I can say about that 
I didn't know how to log in 
I didn't know my username 
I didn't know my password 
anything 
and I just had a total blank with that 
so  uh I worked at it for a while and couldn't  couldn't do anything 
so  I finally went to my boss and said 
hey I've got a problem 
 I've got a headache 
 and uh I just can't  can't log in 
and uh I was asked 
 just take time 
 and find a place to rest and relax 
 and come back in a_little while and try again 
so  I just sat in a dark room for about half an hour and went back in and tried again 
and I couldn't make it 
so  I finally said 
 I  I can't uh do it 
 I need to go home 
so  I went home and went to bed 
uh when I got home I took a couple more aspirin and went to bed and spent most of the day in bed 
and I  I slept 
and then when I got up in the afternoon I was able to uh read 
I was able to see a little bit more with the newspaper where I could read a little bit of that 
but it still was problems 
and um I do Sudokus the puzzle 
and uh I did that on the computer and was able to do it 
it took much much longer than normally to do it the puzzle 
but uh I was able to complete that 
and then uh had a normal evening and went to bed early 
got up the next day and went to uh exercise class with a group that we meet at  early in the mornings on Monday Wednesday and Friday 
and this was a Friday morning that 
I'd gone to work on Thursday 
couldn't work 
so  then Friday when I got up I went exercise with the group 
and with the group uh we normally start out slow and do a few small exercises and then walk a little bit and warm up 
and while we're walking we talk and visit with each_other 
and uh when I was talking and visiting with my friends in that group what I was saying and what they heard me and what I could hear me didn't make sense as far as the  the words that I was uh speaking 
uh the words were correct 
but they were not making sense as complete words 
so  I said  knew there was something wrong 
my friends knew there was something wrong 
so I  when I got through the exercise class 
we spent an hour exercising together 
I went home and uh had breakfast 
and uh I told FirstnameP 
I said 
 there's something wrong 
 I need to  to go to the doctor 
that I wanted her to take me to my heart doctor laughs 
and she decided that rather_than that we'd take me to the emergency room 
and there at the emergency room they checked and found out that I'd had a stroke 
and so I spent the next three days 
well  there was a problem with my heart 
uh my heart was beating too fast and out_of rhythm 
and so they spent most of the time from the next two or three days correcting that issue 
and then after they corrected that then they started checking in on the speech issues with aphasia 
and they'd discovered that I'd had a stroke and had aphasia 
so  that's pretty much where I am 
laughs well  I tried to 
no  I  I really didn't you_know 
I just thought I had a headache you_know 
and uh talking with FirstnameP later she said on  on the Wednesday the day before I woke up with a headache she said 
 you had a headache that  that day too 
like Wednesday night late I'd tol mentioned that I had a headache then 
so  I don't remember that at all  that part of it 
but it's 
so 
yes 
yes I do 
yeah  yeah 
well  I think the best thing that happened was uh I got a great therapist 
and uh she did really wonders as far as getting me pointed at the right direction 
it's finding what uh needed to be done 
and then working with me to uh uh get that 
but basically I went therapy three times a week for several months 
and then dropped down to a couple times a week and uh we  uh til finally I reached a point where the standard test that they did for us were  you_know I'd al already done all of them 
and um reached a point where they couldn't go any further with it 
so  uh yeah 
but uh starting  I've got a squirrel running across my uh patio laughs 
uh never_mind 
let go of that one 
uh but um part of it starting out was uh almost like we looked at the pictures with the  that we saw with all the drawings of different things 
I had the same thing sitting in a  go in the room 
sit in here 
look around 
and name each object I see in that room and uh say it out loud 
you_know I'd tell I can figure 
you_know sometimes  you_know you know all these words 
you know all these items 
but you don't aim  not able to pull those words out 
and the same thing driving down the street 
you look at uh say a mailbox 
say  say that word out loud 
mailbox 
post off uh you_know and um hedges 
whatever  you_know whatever you see make a name 
you_know bring a name for that item 
and it's something that I've kept along with all the  as long as I've had a  s aphasia now 
it's  you_know when I look at something I'll say the name of that item just to keep  keep it going 
and so that's uh one of the things I do all the time 
I  I don't even think about it a_lot_of the times 
it's just something automatic to do 
okay 
the boy was out playing in the yard kicking a soccer ball 
he kicked the soccer ball a_little too hard in the wrong way 
and it hit a window and broke 
the window 
and apparently it hit his dad or neighbor 
I'm not sure who this person is whether it's his father or neighbor 
and then the uh adult was watching out_of the window and looking to see who had thrown that ball and broken his window 
well  at this point we don't see his face 
and from   I would say he's upset about it 
but I'm not sure how much 
you can't see the expression on the face 
alright 
a mom and the boy 
looks like he's got a backpack on going  getting ready to go to school 
but it must be raining outside or look like it's raining 
and she said 
 you need to take your umbrella 
he said 
 no  I can go out without it 
so  he l left home without the umbrella 
and as he was walking to school it started raining 
and uh he realized that was getting wet 
so  uh ran back 
and uh his mom was upset about it 
but he got his umbrella and went back out to  and went back to school carrying his umbrella 
alright 
at the beginning it looks like the little girl was out in the yard on her tricycle 
the dog was out in the yard 
and the cat was out in the yard 
dog chased the cat up the tree 
and uh the little girl got upset then got her father to get the cat out_of the tree 
he brought the ladder out  climbed the ladder and in the process knocked the ladder down and got stuck in the tree 
and then they had to call the f fire department to uh rescue the father and the cat 
so  and hopefully that's where everybody got back down on the ground after the  from the ladder the firemen brought 
okay 
alright 
Cinderella 
story started out when she was a small young girl 
and her  uh apparently her mother died 
and her father brought home a stepmother 
and uh they met whe when she was young 
and um met with her stepsisters as_well 
uh and as they grew it looked like more and more she was  acted as a servant rather than uh a child  or a girl in the family  as part of the family 
she was more of uh a uh servant 
and uh so they grew up that way 
uh and then uh over time she uh got to know the animals in the home 
uh horse and the dog and the mice 
and uh had more of a friends with those than with uh the other two people 
uh and then uh as she grew the uh family  or the king in that neighbor neighborhood  city whatever uh had a son that was grown same time 
and he decided the son needed to uh meet a girl his age and possibly um 
don't know what the situation was there 
but anyway he decided to uh create a ball to bring all of the eligible girls in the n kingdom and  and uh meet them and decide who might uh be his uh girlfriend or whatever or wife or princess or whatever you wanna call it 
and so uh they sent that invitation out 
the uh stepmother saw it and planned on taking his 
Cinderella wanted to go as_well 
so  she with the help of the uh animals made a  build a  a dress for her a gown and uh showed it to her stepmother and the uh daught  or the sisters 
and uh they ended up in  damaged it  tore it 
so  she couldn't wear it 
and somehow she got  her godmother found out about it and uh helped her get another dress and uh changed  and set the uh animals up as a coach and horses and took her to the ball 
and while she was at the ball she met the princess 
prince liked her and spent most of the time with her 
the other people were  the girls were jealous 
uh but they they danced and got along well 
but she had to leave at midnight 
she  w she was running out 
she lost her  one of her slippers as they were leaving 
it was too late 
so  he sent people out looking for slipper to match the girl 
and uh eventually they found it at their home 
the uh stepmothers  stepsisters didn't  uh weren't able to fit it 
the mother tried to break the glass slipper 
and uh they recovered it 
and they got  got the princess or  to the Cinderella 
she was able to wear it 
and she showed them also the other one that she had 
so  she had those to prove that she was the person that uh actually had the slipper 
and uh then got together with the prince again and lived happily ever after 
laughs that's it
