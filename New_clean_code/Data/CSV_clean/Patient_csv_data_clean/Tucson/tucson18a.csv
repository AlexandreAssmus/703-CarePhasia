it depends on what I'm talking about 
um if it's pretty typical ges
telling a story 
I'll put it that way 
if I told you something about what happened ges it becomes   I  I  ges
and um people will say 
like even my mom will be like 
 I don't know what you're saying 
so  you know what I mean 
my words ges
yes  yes head
mm mhm 
and it  a a_lot_of times ges I can't come up with the words either 
but what I've learned quickly to do is how to define ges  what the word is which then becomes ges part of telling a story ges in order to laughs point out what the word is 
um you mean like once I'd been in the hospital 
I  c I can 
well  yeah  ges I  I can ges before they took me 
okay 
basically what happened like two or three months in advance ges I couldn't  um I couldn't organize 
I was running uh a business at a church bookstore ges 
and um ges it was close to Christmas so there's more stuff ges
and trying to figure out even how to ges
and at one point when I realized points
and um ges I couldn't figure out how to do it 
i and things looked a different size ges
so  I couldn't tell what fit ges
um and it turns out I also ges 
I remember specifically too 
ges I'd ordered fifteen hundred dollars worth of books 
Christmas time 
and then  so  I've got the receipt ges
and I couldn't get anything put together ges 
like I didn't know where to ges
I'm pretty focused ges
couldn't figure that out 
and then I saw another receipt ges because I got  ordered like ges seventeen hundred dollars more worth of books 
and I remember looking at it going 
 I don't  ges what does this mean 
and then I just was like 
 never_mind I can't think about it right now ges
and ges in addition to that I was going to school 
so  you_know all together ges
well  at school I was  I'd been in digital arts classes 
so  I was in a Flash class where  making movement ges
and um it was the same kind of thing ges where it was rather simple for someone like me to figure out how to do some things 
but our final project head
and the teacher made fun of me at one point because one simple thing ges that we'd done right before that it took  I put it in ges like seven or eight different programs 
so  now I look back ges
 oh  I wasn't stupid points
 it was this thing points
so  to s 
mhm 
and then the day that I went into the hospital um it was the first ges part of January 
and ges I was at work 
and  um and things had been ges being weird 
and a girl was there ges 
and  it's like I was  like I was ges
I'm like 
 woah  ges this is a weird feeling 
my mom picks me up points
well  actually drive points
and I took a rest during that time 
ges but I found out later that I wasn't even speaking well 
that  then ges I go to the emergency room 
it took them eight or nine hours to see me 
yeah 
and ges I didn't know that until later that points
they were just like 
 oh  head
because they were nice 
I remember points that part 
and then I did get ges unconscious 
um my mom tells me that they put me ges
and uh  so I  I still don't have  I don't even go like 
 oh 
nothing like that 
and  the way they discovered I had encephalitis  and this unusual one herpes encephalitis 
the neurologist was saying 
 no  it can't be 
and ges
 yeah  I think it is 
so  they gave me the medicine right away instead ges of waiting for the test results three or four days later 
and that's when I see it's kind_of ges
that's what even the neurologist has said 
so  that's my story 
so they say 
mhm 
I slept fifteen to twenty hours a day for almost a year 
um and um you_know it was tough to figure out how to walk ges
it's not that it was um ges  where I couldn't walk 
it's that I couldn't ges
um I couldn't both  like if there was points a radio or a tv on I couldn't pay attention to what you points
I couldn't figure out how to cook 
you_know things like that are still complicate 
no  they're complex but they're not as complicated 
I've just learned how to ges
 and 
y you mean like  um like learning words again 
well  I definitely head
I wrote ges a_lot 
I_mean  I wrote pages and pages and pages 
um just in general  I wrote a letter to  Pima_College um because of something ges that had happened the semester before 
and I took three or four months to write it 
I didn't want anyone to help me 
so  and that was cool that I'm  I'm 
you_know  I look back I'm like really glad I was the person that I was to not give up 
um and so I also went to exercise 
mom took me to her exercise class 
and they knew my mom well so I didn't feel ges uncomfortable  not being able to do much 
um little things like that 
I did lots of little things 
okay  now like what 
oh  okay laughs 
I'm like 
 ges what things 
yeah  I'll tell you a recent one because that might be a_little more difficult 
I can tell you the past because I've told a_lot_of stories from the past 
so  um so  I'm doing it deliberately for  the current ges
and it's sad 
um my grandson just passed away a week ago 
he's twenty 
and he passed away from cancer 
and he was sick for a year and a half 
seventeen months for them to discover that he had cancer 
so he was sick before ges
um now  let's see how I can 
I shouldn't try to think ges
okay 
um so   what happened is when he graduated from high_school he lived outside ges of Tucson close to Phoenix 
and  a and um  so he was going to join the Marines ges
but I said 
 don't join the Marines until you  find out ges what you wanna do really 
because it had been tough ges in his family life 
um so  I found uh a way to get ges him to move in with me 
we didn't have a_lot_of money to make it happen 
so  I found a way ges to get him here 
and after he'd been here a few months ges kept saying 
 I'm sick 
 I'm sick 
they finally found out what it was 
so  ges it was just a tough approach 
and um  exhales so they  f his parents finally moved him ges back in 
and it's just been a tough path ges
um I've learned how not to talk much 
so  ges I haven't been able to participate in us  ges in language at all just in ges touchyfeely stuff 
but um I've stayed up there um when he was in the hospital 
well  a week before he passed away ges my man and I went up there for uh a day and a night to just hang out with him at the hospital which was cool 
we got to spend time there 
and then the following ges
ges and we went up there  for a day 
we were right there when he passed along with other people ges and stuff 
so  it was  uh it was very sad 
and it was a good process too in the final moments 
that's my story 
oh  yeah head
 okay 
okay  these things are pretty easy for me 
so  th they're  ki uh  points
this guy here points
points
  points
 points
 points
 points
 points
 uh points
 points
is that okay to say it that way 
okay 
okay 
 the um fire department guys are showing up to  help someone points
 I don't  I don't know 
because um 
okay ges 
points
points
points
and then points
that's what I got 
mhm 
 oh_boy 
okay 
 oh_boy 
 there was  there was a girl  who had a family 
but two of the girls weren't her real sisters because her dad ges had married a woman with these two girls 
and they were pretty rotten 
and um  I can see some pictures with some animals 
and I don't know what that meant 
and 
okay just a minute  whispers finger
oh  and I think they wanted to go to a  like a party 
and the girls wanted to go 
oh  ges it had something to do with the prince  meeting the prince 
the girls wanted to go 
s for some reason Cinderella also wanted to go 
and sh she was able to because a fairy came along and helped her get dressed and get there 
so  then she  gets there  whispers 
and then something happens at midnight 
so  she can't get home because what she rode in ges becomes a pumpkin again 
and  um  and she loses a shoe 
and then once she's home like the next day the  the prince comes with the shoe ges
he's looking for the person it fits 
and it's not her stepsisters  or her fake sisters whatever they're called 
but her  f her foot fits in it ges because her foot's little and so is the shoe 
and so they  officially fall in love and get ready to get married 
head
I know these days points how to say it 
okay 
um first of all finger
gotta find where it is 
then  ges look for the peanut butter 
so  is it in this cupboard ges
then get them both out ges
ges then get a knife a
ges put the bread on the plate 
take the knife and ges
and then it's done ges
