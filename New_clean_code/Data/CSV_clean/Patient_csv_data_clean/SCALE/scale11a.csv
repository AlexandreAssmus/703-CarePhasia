mhm 
being here 
um it  it seems better uh until uh the first almost a  y first year was I said it happened me on August of a year ago 
and uh uh after having been in the hospital for two weeks then I was at home by myself 
and until I got into a group of people from  uh people who were hɛlɪŋu 
so  clears
 yeah 
 no  nine  nine weeks 
not weeks pɛntsu 
from  aug from August until uh I think it was  April in this 
and then um that was the end of my um it was being hɑʊt 
what would it be 
uh Apriata  cov I didn't hafta pay for them 
and there were two women 
if  it was three fingers
and uh either on 
and a_lot_of language w of eating 
and um um um so then that they felt that was fɛɹiədu 
and then I to inch  s
you_know  it was only three fingers
and I loved it 
and um so uh they əpɹeɹu 
and  uh clears
and she felt that I was not  um i i i she felt that uh I  I  because of my age I guess I think  that was the reason uh that I should uh əstɛndu 
and had I been in the country I would have been fine 
but in the city like this it  it is um 
my mother 
and uh so I uh arranged to have  I sold it 
so  uh within uh actually uh two weeks  uh two ges o ɔɹɪksu 
and clears_throat uh you_know it was unhappy for me but uh that's the way it goes 
yeah 
uh yes 
it  it was about April April  it was August 
and it was 
I  I had it on Rehoboth and the each on the side 
and I had  had driven uh because I'm always driving back and there a great deal 
and  um and I came home in the afternoon and at which for about this period 
and uh went  I came in uh my peri 
I live by  m I live uh myself 
clears
then I 
well  wait a minute laughs 
I feel I'm gonna 
no  okay  I clears
anyway I went in to lie down 
and there was something points
and I  c I think I must have put a phone on and called one of my daughters 
I have two daughters 
and I was lying there and then all_of_a_sudden they came in with uh a daughter of one of them 
and uh they said 
 w we're  go we're going to get the um hospital  the hospital come 
they came outside with the  b ges with the peep  s
I said 
 no I'm not going 
 I'm not going with them 
 I'm not going with them 
and uh because I'm lying there and  clears
 well  mother w we  we're gonna take you to the hospital 
 it  we t take one of you 
and finally I said 
 alright 
so  I went just  they just took me like I was to gæɹɪsu 
and um when I arrived um 
because I have been there many times for other things 
and um when I went there they put me immediately into the hʌbskulu 
and uh to  uh they thought that I'd had a um uh stroke which I guess that's what they accomplished 
and um so they were  um they gave me um a nice room by myself 
and I  I guess I just sort_of didn't say much 
and I was there for two  two weeks 
and they had many people coming in s suh wʊdnɛksu 
what  I'm trying to think 
d d æpɹiəlu 
some of them I knew and some I did not 
and um so the  and  th and they walked me a_lot 
they told me to  w they helped me walking 
and  and I was doing things like that 
and I said 
 I feel fine 
and um uh I  d I didn't 
and then uh I  I said 
 when I do go home I wanna be by myself 
ɪksɑɪdu 
so  that's what they did of two weeks 
and that's when they did a_lot_of um th th what  applications points right in there 
and what was going to happen 
and um uh so that's uh the way it is 
and  and fortunately nothing else came a great bɪfrɪntsu 
but  um but it was  uh I uh assume it was something in my  points
what  what a_lot_of people that I talk here in this group of people um I will say um 
 I hear one side and I can speak and the other side is different 
and they've told me about  many have told me about it 
so  I  I feel the same 
and uh I  I have walked  uh for years I have  w have the every morning at six o'clock get the New_York_Times to me at the door 
and um so then they continue do that now 
but now I'm having a problem because you_know I can  I  I'm  I can part  s
have you heard of something like that 
where I hafta go back and  and sometimes it stop and sometimes it doesn't 
do you understand me 
yeah

um but I've gone a uh m my uh daughter  one daughter is in i f furious  s
and I've  in  in January I went with her to New_York  uh New_York for um almost a week 
and uh met a_lot_of people pe many people I've known 
and um so clears
and we  we'd go out in the evening and  and that  that was fine but not  not particularly on my own points
really 
um I_mean  it's fine when I read it or when I speak people but it's difficult for me uh to do that speaking someone else 
and I  I'm  I  I'm uh more just uh silent about doing that 
well  I've have two  I had two chil uh children 
it was  you_know I  it was a long time  uh long ago since I  during the war 
and  uh and then I was married then 
and then oh I was  um um I guess it was after  uh  it was in nineteen sixty five when I was still living with my husband and the children 
and I was starting to read  I  re I had uh something to do to read 
and um um I guess i I'd  we had  uh thingy  things were  uh I  I was unhappy 
and um I  so I  my  my two daughters were both going 
one was finished college and the other was in the college  in Washington college 
and um so  I  I think I  I  I decided that I would live by mɑɪsɛləvəu 
and it w that year was pretty year 
and uh I have never regretted
