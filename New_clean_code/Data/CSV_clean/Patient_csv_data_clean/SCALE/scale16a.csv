it varies 
um clears
by that time I get um not  uh sloppy 
not sloppy but I'm tired 
and that determines how I do 
oh yes 
well  I um went uh back to school 
I was a teacher twenty five years 
two in Pennsylvania and twenty three in Baltimore 
I went back to school uh to become a counselor an elementary school counselor 
and um that day um um I went to 
Tuesdays we have the  um the team  the team 
and um I have  fi f I figured 
no 
I  um everything was in order 
and um everything was in their place ges
and I went to a meeting Monday a as 
and I came home and I thought 
 I'm wound up 
 and I wanna watch um some television 
well  I know what was on um Creatures_Great_and_Small 
so  I  um I had um um 
you press a button and it zooms back ges
um and I recorded it 
and um so I watched it 
and I says 
by that time I settled down 
and I says 
 I can go to bed 
and I  I slept 
and I got up this morning and I took a shower 
and I got partially dressed because I couldn't find my slacks laughs 
and uh so I came down and I w turned the um ges
ges
what is it called 
ges
I want some spritz in my hair ges
and um so I turned it on and I went downstairs to get a cup of coffee 
and uh when I g got the milk out and poured it in when I closed the door I says 
 oh  something is going to happen 
 I can tell 
and with that imit
I fell on the floor 
and this side points
and I thought 
 wow laughs nu what  what's going on 
and I kept  I kept thinking my hand grabs
I flopped it down hand
and so I was in the kitchen 
and by the time 
I thought 
 well  someone i 
I went out and I thought 
 I've got to tell somebody to scream or anything 
and by the time I got to the uh television I have a halfway to go yet ges
and um um FirstnameT was the principal and she came 
and um in the meantime my telephone rang three four times 
and I could not get it ges
and if I woulda 
because I didn't know it might affected my speech points
and I was you_know it  ges
anyhow she said 
 I'll be back 
 I will be back 
 I'm gonna go and I just wanna go you_know 
and I thought 
 she's probably ges
and she called the police and the ambulance 
and um they came back 
and um he broke the door down 
well  not the  broke it 
he s like um uh ges
i it sounds like they're gonna imit
um i slit  ges
but i on this one he hadta  um it needed repaired laughs 
so  and that's 
I was in Franklin_Square hospital 
and at that time December seventh ninety  nineteen ninety three they didn't have anything to do 
they  they put me in a room and they said 
um I was h hungry the next day and the next day 
and they kept saying 
 we're concerned about your tongue points
 you can swallow 
and he  she  anyhow they finally got me to eat 
but um my sister and brother came down 
and um I  I says 
 what  what  what are you 
I couldn't believe that they came for me 
because I didn't think I you_know 
points
well  I went to um Sinai because um they did not have um a program for people with strokes 
so  um I went to Sinai 
um you know where Sinai is 
and uh they have a really good program 
and  um and boy um they didn't mess around 
and um I liked it there 
and  um but um the speech pathologist was a man 
and he said that he is  after awhile he said he was going to leave 
he and his wife and I think they had two children 
he was going to Texas 
and uh he brought me ges
and he said 
 um you don't hafta do it all at once 
 some of them are hard 
 some of  you can figure it out 
 and do it as you would 
and I did that 
and then um I was there  um I didn't get out_of Sinai until I think  the fourth of um January 
well  I was there until um the twentieth  I think 
and then I went to Sinai 
so  um and then I had  um FirstnameJ was my caretaker because I live by myself 
and  um and she was okay  very good I_mean but she gets tired too you_know of doing the same thing 
and  um and then she  d while I was in Sinai I got  um a woman came 
and she was  dr you were making sure that anything  she was recruiting people with strokes or brain damage because of a car accident 
and um he 
 I think that you would be interested in the Return program 
and maybe  I'm not quite sure whether she told me or my sister FirstnameM 
but  um so the Return program I started in May the beginning of May 
and I had FirstnameS 
and she only  she worked all around the clock ges
she couldn't take like um a half day 
and um so I got FirstnameC 
and uh she could work half days 
and  um but I got  touches
and I kept thinking 
 I don't know what happened because I always get headaches here touches
and anyhow um um I'm w w w w wavering 
that is not the reason you asked the question 
 oh  oh okay 
well  um the  FirstnameJ said 
 why don't you just lay down and go to sleep 
and I slept for  around the clock ges
and I got up and the headache was gone 
but um FirstnameSu is a good friend of mine 
and she called the doctor 
and the doctor said 
 um go to um I don't know  Advanced re radiology and get a scan of her head 
and sh he did 
and when I saw it um it was the  the bleeder 
and I  sh he said  Doctor FirstnameLastnameD said 
 that might have been the first stroke 
and I said 
 no  head
and I had  I  I'm a  well a school teacher 
and ten questions were a second grader 
and I couldn't answer seven of them 
and now when I went back to that I answered three 
and I thought 
 that's it 
so  I kept on going to um the Return program 
and um May June July and i the beginning of August um eh eh FirstnameC was in the hospital 
uh she fell down a flight of steps 
and she was pregnant 
and she was so upset you_know 
and I said 
 that's okay 
 don't call 
because they hafta call somebody to you_know take care of me 
and I says 
 I'm fine 
and when I was sitting there I thought 
 well  it's time t for us to you_know eat or eh for me 
I couldn't get up 
I couldn't get up 
and I called FirstnameR points the next door neighbor 
she came over 
and she says 
 get out_of here 
she pulled me up ges
and she says 
 okay 
 call FirstnameSu 
you_know  she didn't 
like call FirstnameSu 
and I called her and I was back in the hospital 
and um because when I s had the stroke they gave me Ecotrin three times a day 
when I had that  sec my second stroke they said 
 Ecotrin 
and I thought 
 two times out 
 I'm not gonna take Ecotrin again head
and I say that to myself but they decided that it would be good to um a Coumadin 
and um I got very depressed when at 
I was not depressed the first stroke 
it hit me the third stroke 
I thought 
 this is gonna go on and on 
you_know  I never know what's gonna happen 
and um I just really d depressed 
so_that they got to take Zoloft 
and I took it and I thought 
 oh_boy it feels so good 
uh i i and so when I left the hospital laughs I  I ate my cereal every morning and I had um diarrhea every day 
and after I thought 
 I'll hafta call him Doctor LastnameD 
and he said 
 you're allergic to Zoloft 
so  I got to take Crestor 
no  uh um Crestor is that 
um Effexor 
and um I've been on that ever since because I've t tried to take i um it off 
and you hafta do it by um half a month and then 
and by the time I get finished everything bothers me I get really upset 
um and I started to cry 
and you_know I think it's better to be on the um Effexor 
well  um one of the things uh uh I've never been out_of p th uh the Pittsburgh 
uh uh I've been to Pittsburgh a at that time when I was about fourteen 
um I went to Pittsburgh once 
my mother and sister FirstnameK the older one 
and  um but it  w when I was about fourteen in the summer 
um FirstnameMi is my good friend in high school and  um and her aunt were going to New_York because of um their aunt 
there is a problem with her 
and I think that she's becoming senile or whatever but s somebody hasta see what you_know is going on 
and um so I uh kept asking my mother and asking her 
and she kept saying 
 no you can't 
and I says 
 mom  mom please 
and you_know she decided 
 okay 
so  uh we went to New_York 
and um I've forgotten the name of the town 
j j it starts with a gl 
um uh a little town 
and  and anyhow uh we went to see her 
and um one of the things that happened laughs 
oh the  she was upset with FirstnameMi and I 
we both had periods 
and our  the aunt told us you_know how  roll it up and all that 
and we rolled it up and we went off uh to Coney_Island 
and we got back everything would be fine 
and th uh the aunt was mad 
mad as heck 
what happened was he 
and the dog knew 
and he 
it was all over the house 
and she cleaned it up instead of waiting until we cleaned it up 
and um she was upset 
and I  r rightly so 
but we didn't know that the dog would do that 
but  uh and then at the  um the thing that um 
we went to um n not a Broadway play but um Radio_City_Hall 
and we saw um  Eric_Marie 
starts with an rl 
is it  could you spell that 
no 
um it's um long  longer ges
um v but um he wrote the book and they made it into a play  n uh movie 
and we got to see that 
and it was  and then I love to travel on trains 
and we went to  that way and then we come back 
and um that was the most exciting thing 
I'm sorry the last one is 
 yeah I know 
no  I  I just wanted it  you repeat the last one ges
and uh no uh 
the little boy or no uh middle um ten years old 
and kicking the ball 
and he thinks

points
well  the um points
and apparently uh points

 points
and  um laughs and then I guess somebody ca called the um 
maybe his wife or whatever called the um fire trucks so_that points
because I think the little dog points
well  um  out west uh w they um have a storms 
and um I think in Texas th a couple months ago 
and  um and the little girl was on the shore 
and um no more 
um it swept in and he

and  um and he  she

 but I know sim 
um well  Cinderella um is working for um them 
and them is I think  um the mother and the two little girls at the beginning 
and then they grow up and she's still working Cinderella 
and uh so there is um um um 
Cinderella uh is  um all the animals sort_of alike 
and um except um the one that um 
ges
sh she has it in her hand  hand at um um 
I don't know what kind of animal it is 
but that  but only the one that is growling you_know 
but otherwise  and then um they look  a she  he 
no  here I go again 
Cinderella looks out and sees the  um the castle 
and  um and she  in her mirror she sees a  pi um a picture  a picture 
and she  I don't know how she gets out but she wea wears it points
and they says  they say 
 she is going to the  the ball with us  yeah

 um it would be fine 
 this dress you can take out and wear points
 and  but you hafta be back by midnight 
and  um and so um when uh the prince  she looks at the clock and realizes it's just you_know a couple minutes before twelve 
and she hurries up to run 
and she drops  er her  sh her shoe fell off 
and they um came  the um 
I don't know what his name was but he has the shoes that he hasta fit laughs 
and it doesn't fit on the two women 
but on Cinderella it fits 
and they  um the uh prince and she get married and live happily ever after 
well  first of all you get the uh bread out
