oh  okay 
much better 
 yeah  um head
um for what ges 
anything 
uh well  um I learned a_lot 
and uh I did a_lot um coins  stock  um the restaurant uh talking about it 
uh and um like uh the restaurant typically I'll ges explain a_lot 
and everybody ges understands me 
um so  that's  refreshing  you_know 
um you mean years ago 
uh well  I remember um Lexus_Of_Towson 
and I had a stroke ges 
and I didn't know about it 
um something's hæpinu 
and I  I says 
 oh  well  it'll go away 
and then I blacked out 
and um on the ground ges now 
and the supervisor looks
um the ambulance 
and I can remember um the  um the hospital or the emergency room 
and I couldn't speak ges
and I was uh really  um I don't  I didn't know what's going on 
and then I blacked out 
um confused 
uh I remember um hearing mom asking a_lot_of questions 
and um I'm silent ges 
I'm  I'm in the hospital ges 
and  uh and also members ges
 what's going on 
 what's going on 
 what's going on 
and um a different room ges now 
um they  my bed ges you_know 
and I can remember 
 um what time is it 
 is it a_m or p_m ges
ges
and um then my um work 
h his  his boss ges he comes ges
and uh I remember um people came um like ges
and praying ges
um  so  yeah  I  I_mean  I  I've  a_lot_of things ges
and it I guess repairing ges 
so  tell me what kinds of things have you done since your stroke to try to get better 
laughs um taps
and uh lots to  things to do 
with  um and in retrospect ges
you_know  it's xxx like um I didn't know what's going on 
and um you_know what's um um yesq and noq 
 what's that 
and I said  you_know I  I didn't get it 
and then yesq head
and um so it's like okay 
um a  b um ges a boy playing 
ges
and then um middle school you_know kin kindergarten ges
and uh I've ges
the garden is two years ges 
and um I'm doing um exercise ges  um conversation 
uh I like that because I can talk ges 
and uh um one to one ges
now  ges
or I don't care ges
ges
a_lot_of times I do 
and um I respond ges 
um and all of it helps healing ges
 you_know 
understand 
 okay 
 okay 
okay 
hm sure  um  uh let's see 
that is complex 
and I  I will  um I  I'll tell you 
um FirstnameM  my girl  um she was I think  ten 
um FirstnameM 
and FirstnameE is eight 
and the difference is um very  um it's na like ges
and um I was 
um what's the term 
um I'm healing 
ges
so  FirstnameE realize points
 okay  I'm gonna step it up ges
and sh she  um my wife ges she is also doing that 
 ges but it's clear 
 she 
points
so  um there is a shift ges
okay 
the opposite ges um FirstnameE is clueless now 
and he 
 what to do ges
and she says not knowing anything 
 I'll do art  painting ges 
and  um so  in retrospect um it made sense because ges
I'm doing nothing ges
and uh FirstnameE is doing something 
now  I realize now ges like three years and I  I says 
 oh  she's got to do more ges
so  I did um um what's they call it  um talking ges
and ges
somebody else ges FirstnameE and pa FirstnameP that was working ges
so  at_least I did more ges
and then I also did the restaurant with uh Starbucks or um um elic Ellicott_City 
and uh I did more now ges 
so  I'm happy ges 
and I'm sad ges because I missed it ges 
laughs and I always told you you_know points
but you can 
yeah  okay
