 alright 
 alright 
yes head
in one sense I found it difficult be trying to remember the words 
I knew them 
I knew head
um but I couldn't  remem at first I could not remember 
I couldn't memorize them ges 
I  I couldn't pull ges
um as we went on they didn't 
I wanna say they came  came easy 
they didn't come easy 
but they  the more I did it the more the words came ges 
um I was thinking about th going over the words in my head 
and I found that I still retained a almost seven  eighty percent of what I had learned 
I hadta keep going back 
I  the words I knew ges I hadta keep going back sometimes 
but  um did I feel it was helpful shrugs 
yes  because I didn't realize how much I had learned I_mean  I d or  lost 
same thing ges 
um I think that uh 
and I don't  I know why ges uh you_know you have a time period to go over it and learn it 
um I was  ges because of moving and everything else I lost a_lot_of time and repetition ges in it 
um but I still kept a_lot_of  like I said I still kept a_lot of uh the words 
um I'm worried about losing more of the words because I don't have a booklet 
you_know  I can't ges go back over them and over them and over them because there's nothing there in front of me 
um so  that makes me nervous 
but is the pro program good 
yes 
especially for twits like me who  who didn't have the ges time or energy  energy the move anything 
you need ges to keep repeating it and repeating so_that you  and then go on 
points
I  I don't say I objected to it but I felt like if you give one through the for sixty words ges or eighty words 
ges you go through those 
ges I thought you should go through those say for three months 
and keep on those ges 
ges and add ten more words 
because I felt the repetition ges of two sets of words 
I don't know why but points
you go through the words 
like in the end in the last  uh even the last thirty days 
if you get through them and you feel like 
 oh  I know them ges so I should start on the next you_know like thirty more words 
and while it's not true laughs obviously because you missed words for some reason ges I felt like the more that you did that the more you'd catch on 
I don't know if it's true or not but 
sure 
okay 
oh  okay

I hate Cinderella 
I know 
Cinderella  Cinderella  sindia Cinderelli 
oh  I certainly would 
alright 
um Cinderella's mother died 
and she and her father um were living together 
and her father decided to remarry 
and so he married a woman who was a witch 
and um they had two  she had two children 
um soon after the father died 
and Cinderella became the um household 
there's a word for it but 
someone who just 
w she was a servant 
um she waited on everybody 
um and the girl  the two daughters treated her like a slob  like a slave 
and she just hadta pick up after them 
um then they got an invitation um to a  bah a ball that was being held in honor of the prince 
um so  sh Cinderella did all the work to clean it up to get it  everybody  everything ready 
and she made her own gown 
and when she went to join the two daughters and the mother to  at the  um for the dance or  for the ball um they um destroyed her dress 
and they told her that she couldn't go 
um she went and was with  in tears 
and um her f friends which were like the cat and the  ha the horse and there were three or four animals 
and they all tried to cheer her up 
and um she  she had been dreaming of going 
and she now couldn't go 
so  um then the fairy godmother appeared and told her that she could go 
and she turned the horses into fet footmen 
um she created the  the  the carriage 
um and she created uh fur footmen 
and the  she created a ball gown for her to go 
and so  they went to the um coughs 
excuse me 
they went to the ball 
and the  Cinderella got to dance with the prince 
and she was attracted to him 
and she wanted to marry him 
but then her  um she went  she ran because she was only allowed to go until midnight 
so  she  when she realized she um stayed late she went running home 
um she lost the glass slipper 
it  it fell 
um and as she went running home she  um all of her clothes changed back 
her  the animals changed back into animals 
um and she was left um the way she had started 
um the um king ordered um a search of the whole kingdom to find um the girl that the prince was in love with 
um and they came to h Cinderella's house 
and each of the wicked  s each of the um girl  each of the  sighs each of the two stepsisters tried on the um shoe 
and it didn't fit them 
then Cinderella went and tried on the shoe 
and it fit her 
so  they uh said that she was the prince 
and she and the prince married and lived happily ever after
