I  I felt weird 
and I  uh and I put my left foot down 
and um when I went to put my right foot everything went uh cries ges
well  everything didn't go blank but it just  it just seemed to  it seemed to stop 
and I  c I crashed down to the floor

and to get me out down the stairs and out the door uh and into the ambulance and off to  off to  mer off to  uh uh uh to mɔstɪnu 
uh and it  it only took maybe fifteen twenty minutes to get there 
uh and they took me and um I don't know head
uh I don't recall what all happened 
and when I woke up uh I was up uh in um some higher room 
or it was  uh I  I guess it was private 
and I was uh hooked up to a tube 
coming to my stomach there was a tube uh for feeding 
a waste tube was added 
um a tube points
and I  uh I just woke up 
I couldn't  uh I couldn't speak

and Brisky just stayed with me uh the rest of that day up until the evening 
and then I went on uh to sleep
