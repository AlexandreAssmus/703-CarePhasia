and that day uh as I was doing what I do every day at one time I didn't know how to do it 
just  I just all of a  ɔləsɔndɪnu 
so  I had  I started doing  I started doing it 
and then  then the almost done all_of_a_sudden I didn't know how to do what I sposta do 
like I didn't know what to do after that 
so  I went to the bathroom 
and nobody's seen me at first 
then I  I thought maybe I just needta go to the bathroom ræsu 
so  then uh by that time um I went back where I was 
but this time now I  now I really don't know what I sposta be doing 
so  um so  at that time one of the girls was there and she's  she was talking to me 
I heard her talking to me but I really s couldn't tell her what was going on 
so  she said 
 okay  now I gotta call somebody because something's wrong with Firstname 
and I could hear her saying that but I couldn't  still couldn't tell her 
so  by that time she got my um box  s
yeah 
yeah  it was pretty 
because I was like 
 now I knew I sposta be doing something but what happened 
I knew it 
I knew something was wrong but I didn't know  I couldn't tell them 
like  like what 
like when I went to rithæbu 
okay  when I went to rehab 
I dunno when I went to rehab laughs 
hm um that  that took a_lot_of time uh um thinking about what happened then 
I don't know 
I don't know 
uh just read through with everything back 
plus I have kids and trying to figure out what to do with them 
and it was a_lot_of pfrɛsɚu 
um I can't  I don't know 
I just went through everything 
you_know  I just went through with it

I still hadta plan what to do with my kids 
and um um I do a_lot of  of s shu stuff at tʃɝtsu 
so  t freɪnɪnu

but uh I did that a_lot_of time 
uh time  time to myself head
okay 
oh okay uh lemme see 
so much stuff hap 
I had a_lot_of stuff happen to me 
um hm now is where can I start laughs 
okay  uh lemme see 
okay  well  I think I'll talk about my baby 
I  I  muh uh I lost my baby 
um she was  she had  uh she had a stro I_mean  she had a streever 
and she went into a coma 
and so um when she did that she was  she went into a coma 
and by that time 
she was  re the reason why that  why  why she was 
at first  um I had her early 
so  I had her like um two  two um s s um 
she  I had her early 
so  that's another thing 
so  she hadta go into the hɑθɚzu 
she hadta stay there 
she never came out_of that 
and so in  in that time something happened where they didn't know she wasn't blee rivɪnu 
she wasn't brivɪnu 
so  that's what caused uh um uh um tra komɚu 
because she lost her breath for a long time 
and uh then  so then she had a tracheotomy ges
she got a tracheotomy ges
and that  so that's another thing that was going on at the same time 
and she  uh I was there of_course 
and then they told me something happened 
and by that time I found out what it was happening 
so  she never came out_of that 
she never came out_of a um coma 
but she stayed in the hospital for a long time 
and then they decide to bring her to another place that would deal with just kids being on the  having the coma 
so  at that time she never made it because on her way there she start  she stop brivɪnu 
so  she never made it there 
so that was  yeah that's a long time
