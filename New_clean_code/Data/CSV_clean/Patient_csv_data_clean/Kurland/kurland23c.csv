oh I  I definitely think uh because uh when I first met you at uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house you were doing the same kind of testing 
and I think most of them I couldn't  I couldn't say anything 
um I_mean  I'd  l I'd see the pictures 
and I  I couldn't say an action thing like somebody's like um bending or something like that 
I_mean  I'd just look at the pictures 
and uh and I'd see pictures of things 
uh if I saw a peacock or an artichoke or something like that you_know it was  I probably  there was probably most things 
maybe my  I could say my glasses maybe or banana 
I don't know if I said that at the time but 
 I could say something like that 
but most everything else I'd just  you_know I'd just look at the  I would just look at the pictures you_know 
and I'd  I would be trying to say something but you_know I couldn't do it 
so  I think I'm a_lot better now 
and  um and I think I  I did better in uh well 
I haven't seen uh Martha and Jacquie and  and  and you and myself were doing that for like a couple of weeks 
and I think that I'm better now than I was then 
yeah 
that's  that's what I'm saying 
that's  that's one of the uh 
and then of_course that  you_know when you're not doing it for like 
it's been  it's been uh awhile 
um I hadn't been thinking about for  uh g up until recently a couple of uh days ago 
and I started thinking about everything else together 
now you_know the saying stuff again 
and uh a_lot_of it was coming back perfectly fine 
and then some of the  some of them uh I've added 
I've added that I really couldn't  uh I wouldn't be able to do correctly 
but I think I've done a little bit better 
uh like something's planting you_know 
it has uh planting uh in the ground or something like that 
yeah 
I don't know if there's anything else you'd like me to say 
yeah 
yes 
okay 
yeah 
a young man is um kicking a ball 
and he's really not looking where he's going to do it 
and it comes over to a neighbor's window 
and the  uh and the ball goes right through the window 
and the  uh it's hard to tell whether that's  it's an old  it's an older  p it's a 
it could be a elder  uh a young  a old  an older man not an older man  uh that's sitting in the sofa 
and the  uh the ball just knocked over the uh lamp 
and it actually broke the window and then hit the lamp 
and  uh and probably  probably could hit the  uh the third  this third person here 
they're sitting here 
so  the  uh the man uh stands up 
and he's picking up the ball 
and he's looking out the window to see who  who probably threw it 
yeah 
well  this is an umbrella 
remember I couldn't even say umbrella 
 before again I could say umbrella 
so  uh the mother  mother is holding the uh umbrella 
and the little boy is  uh is looking 
and she probably saying  g um saying goodbye 
and uh she thinks 
 well  sure don't you think  you should take the umbrella with you 
he said 
 nah I'm ɡʌsu 
but then he's out 
uh and he's 
 oh  look at this 
 it's raining 
 I should've like um taken that umbrella 
you can see it's even  it's even getting worse over here 
and he  uh he's back 
comes  so  he runs back to his house 
and the mother's there 
and she's saying 
they're both looking 
he's soaking wet 
and the mother's looking at him 
and she's gonna probably give him the umbrella 
um and he's going back 
I don't know where he's going 
he's probably going to school 
and he has an umbrella 
and now he's going back to school 
yup 
and uh 
yup 
well  the little girl's looking at the  at the t 
there's a tree here 
and um now this thing probably was start  I think this was started that the dog was running after a cow 
and the cat ran up the tree into a  li a  le a la 
how do I say this ges 
oh a breach 
I'm doing two with and I'm not saying it right 
anyway it's the  um it's part of the  it's part of the tree 
so  this is where the cat eventually got up  was up here 
so  the little girl could've been  could've been actually seeing the  uh the dog uh cha chasing the cat 
and uh but anyway she  she sees the cat is up there and would like to have it come down 
she was probably riding a tric tricycle 
um so  the  probably her father put the ladder up on the limb  limb  the limb and uh went up there 
and the  l and the ladder fell 
uh so  the  it's pretty high up 
and the cat's up there 
and the  uh the man is way up high 
and he doesn't have a ladder 
and his  uh and by the looks of it his  actually his daughter's more interested in the cat than  than her father 
or that's  or it's a man perhaps 
and uh there's a bird on the  tr in the tree also but I don't think they're involved in uh 
yeah  and I don't think they're afraid the cat or anything like that 
uh so  the uh firemen are going to put the ladder up and probably going uh to first take the  the father down 
and uh then they're gonna get the cat 
and uh the little girl will be happy 
and the  uh the dog 
who knows what's gonna happen to the dog 
it's gonna probably chase after her  the cat again and find another tree 
I don't know laughs 
Cinderella 
oh yes 
yup 
okay 
um on 
and they're not very attractive 
and there's a  there's another girl who's a blonde and quite attractive 
uh s same age 
uh but she hasta do things to like do all the work 
and the  um I think that the  uh the mother 
and I'm not sure whether that  the mother  the uh attractive uh one is part  is  she's  uh uh she's part of the family or one of uh a younger  a younger woman 
well  with  with the  with this mother 
I'm not sure how that works out 
there's a handsome man too 
I'm not sure that that's her husband 
and  you_know and maybe you_know that's the reason why he has those two  uh the two  the other two woman that aren't very attractive 
uh so  uh he's  the  uh the young  the young lady um is looking  um looking over the  over the window out into the city and sees the  the uh cass castle which I'm sure that  who  um who's probably the king uh of the  uh of that area uh lives at the regular city 
and the  the  uh the people live in a regular  in the the house  regular house uh with the mother and the  and the other  the other uh three uh young women 
and two of them 
I don't even remember if  if they're twins 
I'm not sure the  the  uh they have like dark  dark hair and stuff like that 
so  she's  um the  uh the king wants to have a party uh for his  his young  s his young son 
and it'd be nice if uh he might  if everybody in the city that are  uh they get a letter 
I'm not sure everybody's gonna get one but they're gonna have this dance 
and um they'll  they could actually meet the  uh this young man uh coming up 
so  the  uh the young  the young girl  the blonde lady is like down in the  has her own room 
or maybe it could be uh in the ba basement or something 
and she's looking at  uh at a  at the different  uh glah the uh 
what do you call that 
the dress  the dress is not  apparently it's not perfectly uh beautiful uh in the uh 
and the other  uh the other uh 
so  they're going  when they're going to the party 
and uh actually three of the  three of the girls  the two twins um 
and she's  she's going 
and um they're not 
I think part of that I'm missing what's happened 
well  anyway what  what happens is that the  uh the  uh the young  the young girl um talks to the uh magical grand  grandmother 
I know I'm not using it correctly head
uh and she  uh she has a magical f uh 
I can't think what did I call it 
anyway it turns her into a beautiful white uh dress 
and she also has uh the  her shoes are made out_of glass 
and she's dancing with a young  with a h handsome man 
and they seem like they're getting along 
and uh of_course the  the women  the other  the other children uh they're probably adults now aren't really that happy about the fact that uh she has a beautiful gown and  and she's dancing and obviously the uh young gentleman prefers her 
and uh they also know that  uh that  that all of that  the beautiful dress and everything like that that was given by the  uh this magical grandmother 
I know I'm not using this right head
uh knows that at twelve o'clock everything will  will change 
and she'll hafta like  uh she's gonna hafta run away 
so  right  she realizes that it's almost twelve uh that  eve that evening 
and she's running away down the stairs 
and she lost w the glass um shoe 
and  uh and all of the  she had uh uh uh a castle 
not a castle 
well  she uh 
I'm having a difficult saying how this  this young woman was uh ri riding 
but anyway at  at  noo at uh twelve o'clock everything goes back to its original  uh what it was 
and uh so she's gone 
she's back at the house 
and uh the king found this beautiful glass shoe 
and he wants to go all the way around  around the city and try to find this  y this woman 
and they  uh they came to that particular house 
and they found  uh they had the  gra the uh grass 
and the young woman  the uh blonde lady uh she actually  she's the only one that will  that can actually fit that glass uh shoe 
and the  uh everybody's really pleased about it 
and they realized that the  the king 
I guess he's a prince 
the prince and uh this young woman are gonna get married 
and that's how it ends 
 no yeah 
I forgot the part 
you_know  how they  how she got to the uh party 
was uh I think they have like  uh uh everything  everything is made out_of like uh 
like the horses are really mice and stuff like that 
I don't know if it doesn't say that in there but 
what 
a peanut butter and jelly 
um how would I  how would  how I would make it 
and I  I would use my  uh my knife 
um laughs well  if I was gonna make uh a sandwich with  uh out_of uh peanuts and uh some kind of futu 
and I would buy it 
and it's really fresh 
and I would  uh and I'd use the knife 
and I would  uh it's  it  I hafta like uh 
uh I'm trying to think of what the right term 
slice  slice 
I'm gonna slice the bread and make two pieces but whatever size I want it to be 
and  uh and then I would open up the peanut  peanut butter 
and I would use the knife 
and I could put as much peanut butter I would want 
and I would open up the  uh the fruit  uh jelly  the jelly 
and I could put as much on that as I want 
and I would cut it in half or even four pieces 
and  um and I could eat it 
and it would be delicious 
at_least that's what I'm gonna say shrugs
