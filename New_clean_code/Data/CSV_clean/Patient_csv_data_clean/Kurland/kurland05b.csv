yup 
my speech is uh as I've s just said it's probably you_know 
i i if  if  uh if the goal  uh like in a range of one to ten with ten being you_know prior to my stroke it probably ranges from like a  a three or four to a seven 
and um uh depending on you_know how much sleep I had and you_know what I did the day before and you_know how I feel and you_know it can  i i it can  it can vary like I say you_know on the high side like  of like a seven or uh you_know down as low as a three or four 
oh yeah 
uh uh s my stroke occurred on a Sunday April third  I think it was 
a a a April third or April fourth um in the afternoon 
I was uh taking my son uh FirstnameK for a ride in the truck 
and sometime during the ride f a about you_know an hour ride uh I didn't  I just didn't feel very good 
and uh uh f when I say I  d I didn't feel good I didn't  f I didn't feel up to snuff 
and uh I  n I knew something was wrong but I was hoping it was just temporary 
so  not to alarm my wife I didn't say anything laughs to my wife uh the rest of Sunday 
and uh you_know that night I went to bed early 
and  next morning's Monday 
I went to work laughs you_know like normal 
and uh driving to work because my right side was affected 
I had a left side stroke so my right side was affected 
I kept drifting off the side of the road 
um I got on the Mass_Pike from Springfield to uh New_York state 
and I kept going over the rumble strip 
and then I g didn't  I  I knew I couldn't talk to anybody because they  it  like I  I  I knew it but just had something wrong with my speech and you_know my verbal thing 
so  I  uh I picked up some corn seed that I sold these two farmers 
and uh I got the corn seed on my truck 
forty bags 
and then I came back 
and then I uh got off in uh Westfield 
and I drove down to Simsbury Connecticut 
and the same thing happened down there 
I was going hand
 um down in Simsbury I went r right up on a sidewalk with  with my truck 
at that point I  f I figured something's really s you_know drastically wrong 
so  I  uh I went home 
and about two o'clock uh I was home 
and I was sitting in the sunroom 
and uh the phone rang 
and I  I was si sitting like here hand
 you_know the phone was right here hand
my wife was like hand
and I answered the phone 
and I  I  s I think I said helloq and maybe you_know one or two other words 
and uh who other person was on the line said uh 
 Firstname  what's wrong 
I said 
 I don't know 
and the person on the other  f f i it was a  it was a female a f friend of my wife's 
and she said 
 I think you had a stroke 
so  she said 
 put your wife on 
so  I said y you_know 
 ges
 and then my wife was flabbergasted that I had you_know the problem I did 
so  we went to the hospital 
and uh you_know they determined I had a stroke 
but it was you_know over three hours so  the cat was already out of the bag 
well  I went to s speech therapy and o occupational therapy and physical therapy 
and the  the p_t and the  the occupational therapy probably went to like three or four sessions each 
and uh they  you_know th they said 
 you're okay 
you_know  you_know  I was throwing a ball ges
I remember the  I was throwing a  b like a  like a rubber ball ges
I was catching a ball better with my right hand ges
so  she said you_know 
 you're recovered 
and then the speech therapy must have gone to that for probably three months 
 and xxx you_know like I say i i if I was like a three hand
but I like  I kind_of like plateaued ges
and that's  that  at that  at that time there uh you_know my  my speech therapist uh Lorie_Corrs uh said you_know 
 you plateaued 
you_know  so  I  I stopped going to therapy 
um sh she  she was right 
 you_know I never got my speech fully back 
yeah 
it  i it's  it's  uh it's better but I  you_know I  I don't feel it's uh you_know anywhere near you_know what it was before 
it  I was was a salesman 
and I was you_know able to tell jokes and stuff 
and uh 
you_know  I  I  I was a pretty good salesman not to brag 
but you_know I  I became project manager you_know with the  the company I worked for 
and uh  um 
uh I'll tell you uh after I had the stroke I continued to work it's  because my year ended in October first 
and um I went to uh a meeting out in New York state 
I don't know 
someplace out in western New_York 
I think in Bainbridge New_York 
and anyways uh  they had uh like a class on uh corn seed you_know talking about you_know corn and you_know 
and anyways uh the guy asked me a question 
and I  sighs I couldn't answer the question in front of all my peers you_know 
and here I  I was sposta be the expert 
and it just  I  I  I'll never forget that 
it was really embarrassing 
you_know  I  uh I  I don't grasp as much as I  as useta grasp you_know as far as uh you_know studying stuff 
just the other day you_know like uh two weeks ago I  I bartend 
 so  I hadta take a course you_know safe serve course you_know to serve up uh uh alcohol 
and uh you_know I  d I went with three people you_know that I work with laughs 
and you_know they're done laughs a long time before I was 
and the  and the funny thing is that's the third time I've taken the test laughs 
and you_know s s s some of those people that were there f for  for the first time only 
so  it's  again it's  s you_know it's not the  you_know the same as I was before 
but you_know you just live with that 
so 
alright 
uh laughs I'll just tell you the first story that popped in my mind 
when I was in second grade laughs you_know a little kid so I was probably what eight years old seven years old I entered a contest uh sponsored by  by channel twenty two 
anyways uh it was uh so so so some kind of a contest uh put on by some western tv show 
and anyways I won a trip for uh myself and my  my two parents to a frontier town you_know all expenses paid laughs 
and we went up there laughs 
and my  and my father you_know we had a good time 
but my father was like 
we got up there 
and uh the guy that uh was our  our guide for the day laughs he  he was a drunk 
laughs he  he could smell booze on his breath you_know 
I'll never forget that 
laughs but we had a good time 
you_know  take it off as it rides 
and you_know  y and getting into  uh g i he gave me a toy gun and stuff 
you_know  it's  it's kind_of neat 
like I said that's  that's a long time ago though 
yeah 
okay 
well little Johnny's playing soccer or kickball out in his front yard 
and he kicks the ball too hard 
and unfortunately it goes through the  the window of uh uh uh uh either his house or the neighbor's house 
it lands in the  in the  probably the living room 
it knocks over a lamp and smashes that 
and the guy who owns the house is sitting right next to the lamp 
so  Johnny's caught 
and uh he looks outside 
and he's holding the ball 
and he gets the 
Johnny's in trouble 
ah 
well  again little Johnny's uh probably going to school 
and his Ma said 
 take an a umbrella 
 it's suppose to rain today 
he says 
 nah no it's  it's gonna be fine 
so  he leaves the umbrella home 
and his mother's right on this occasion anyways because it starts raining 
and little Johnny gets soaking wet 
he comes home 
and he's all wet 
and his mother scolds him 
and next time he goes to school he takes his umbrella with him 
 oh_my_god I remember this one yep 
well a little girl's probably uh out riding her tricycle 
and her cat comes along 
and the dog uh chases the cat up a tree 
and then uh uh her father or some older gentleman tries to uh get the cat down from the tree 
and anyways the ladder falls down from the tree so he's stuck too 
so  then the fire department's coming w w with a second ladder to get the  f the guy down and the cat down 
oh no laughs 
yeah laughs 
no laughs 
okay

 alright 
okay 
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella 
she had two sisters laughs not very good looking and a  m
and uh there was a  b uh a ball or something you_know uh a promenade or a  b a ball or whatever 
and uh the mother and the two girls went to the ball 
and they told Cinderella to stay home and you_know wash the floors because they're  they're all dirty 
so  Cinderella stayed home 
and I don't know somehow she found uh a chest or whatever 
or something sorta  something magical happened 
and anyways sh she got to  g to go to the ball 
and uh in  you_know i in  in going to the ball she uh took a carriage that was made out_of a pumpkin you_know that was transformed somehow by uh uh some fairy or whatever laughs 
anyways how am I doing 
laughs anyways  the  the pumpkin or  or the  the carriage returned to a  p back to a pumpkin at midnight 
so  Cinderella hadta ma ma make her time you_know 
and anyways she uh took off from the ball bf before midnight so she wouldn't turn into a  p uh into a pumpkin again 
and sh I guess she lost a slipper 
and while she was there she was dancing with the handsome prince 
and I always  the prince you_know got a  ho a hold of the slipper 
and he liked Cinderella pretty well 
so  he  he had a  had a  uh uh a  f a shoe fitting laughs 
whoever  whoever fit in the shoe would be Cinderella 
and anyways Cinderella fit unto  into the  s the slipper 
so  they got married 
and they live happily ever after 
alright 
okay 
take two pieces of bread 
and you lay them on the table hands
and you put uh Skippy peanut butter the smooth version because the  the crunchy stuff does not spread so well 
so  you lay on it ges
and that's one half 
and then uh o on the other half uh I use like raspberry pre preserves because those make the best fuh peanut butter and jelly sandwiches 
 so  I lay that ges
and then I just uh slap them together 
and I uh cut it in half 
and there you go 
s beautiful
