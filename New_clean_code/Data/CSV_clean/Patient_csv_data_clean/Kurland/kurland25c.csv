mm head
well  I think that um we were  I was  I was hoping that I would really just be able to get all of them all the time 
uh and I think we were close to being able to do that 
and maybe the little  the little uh uh hiatus here has not  has not been good because I should be thinking about this 
but somehow I  I  I really found that I could really do it again 
you_know  I've seen a_lot of that  s of those uh names and stuff so I didn't  I didn't sit there thinking about it 
perhaps that would've been a good  a good thing to do 
um because it's really not that one doesn't know these things 
it's more like just the  ges it's just like these are quick  quick things that you hafta say quickly 
and  and  uh and it does just all_of_a_sudden something off  something oh kind_of physical xxx imit
and that's it 
you_know  you can't  uh you can't really figure it out 
so  uh so  what did I think about that 
I don't know 
I_mean  all of these games are kind_of fun 
uh and  uh and they  they uh enable us I think  to  to see these  uh these  uh to see the  the  these pictures are moving around 
and I think  from that point of view I think we can all uh imagine that as  uh as  as something that  that i is a kind_of uh a logical um s set of motions 
but you_know it's  uh um it seems like the  uh the difficulties with seeing those individual uh names um they  that seemed like it was a big deal 
whereas sitting around working with the  uh with  with  you_know with a couple of  uh of  uh of  of games like 
what's the name of that one again laughs 
see I can't even tell you the names of them 
but even so  I think there was  uh we were making those things head
 ges now do this 
 ges now that 
 ges now the other things ges 
you_know  it was  it was like looking at the  uh you_know from the  from the  from those uh uh ges laughs 
it's not my  it's not my day today 
that's all I can tell you 
no  I  I really feel like I'm really 
oh yeah 
it's just  it's just all this stupid pain 
yeah  though I  d I don't  I just started that 
so  m I'll be even worse now 
uh yes 
mhm 
a nasty little boy who is not watching what he was doing kicked a ball right into the McGilicuddy's driveway 
 what is that 
said Mister_McGilicuddy's  uh uh uh Mister_McGilicuddy saying 
 what has become 
 we have been kicked  we have been destroyed by  uh by uh f furnaces  s
so  Mister_McGilicuddy looked in and  and at  at the  uh at this terrible moment when he hadta see the  uh the  uh the  his entire uh roof 
how's that 
mommy told us that we were  it was gonna be a rainy day 
and then we said 
 nah it's really gonna be just fine 
 you'll see 
well  uh poor Collin was out there 
and suddenly the rain came back 
and it came immediately 
and poor Collin came racing down uh saying 
 I guess I really do need that umbrella  Mommy 
 I told you so 
said  and said the mother angry and vitriolic 
but now Collin has a  uh an umbrella 
and he's done extremely well 
and  uh and noone's yelling at him 
and uh he's gonna be alright 
oh yes here we go again 
poor young Candace was horrified because her cat had strʌŋku 
it strʌŋku 
uh Candace was  was really appalled that she was unable to retrieve the cat 
nor was her brother uh or her uh 
let's see 
this must be Daddy 
uh Daddy also uh could  could not  not deal with this either 
and dog made things even worse by  by barking uh ridiculously and loudly uh thereby taking the  uh the situation even more  uh chao becoming even more chaotic uh ever 
uh there was even  uh even a  uh there was  there was even a uh uh velocipede and a  uh laughs and a uh 
it's not a rope 
it's a uh uh 
we know what's one  that's one  one of those things 
anyway that stuff was around 
but luckily for them the bird became uh delighted with its  uh with  with its uh twittering because here comes the firemen who are going to uh grab the  uh the  the  the kitty from at last its  its being  its  uh its happy moment when it will be uh something or other 
oh yeah  oh yeah 
that's right again 
okay 
laughs you want the New_Jersey version or the Cinderella 
well  let's see 
um for some reason uh uh a young  uh uh uh a young man who was  uh was uh living in uh his parents' uh 
it's not his parents 
the  let's try it again ges imit
for some reason uh Cinderella was  was discovered uh living with the  uh the Galumpy  Galumpky family of  uh of  of  of Sweden when  s when all_of_a_sudden uh they discovered that this brand new kid in the  in the house 
somebody that they don't know before who's  uh who's living there 
the  the  uh the three uh uh horrible Galumpkys uh uh Gonoral and Ragen turned into the  uh the most awful peach uh creatures ever and began to make  make fun of them at these poor people while the thing was going on 
uh then uh as  as it happened the Galumpkys were  uh were waiting to  uh to get uh uh the invitation for uh uh a beautiful wedding 
not a  it's not a wedding sorry 
when uh the  there's going to be uh a big party of some kind or another 
so  they go out there and they've got all their fancy uh clothes 
but there is  there are once again the  uh these  these  the  uh uh Gonoral and Ragen are so awful and stern uh dro droning and  uh and  and you_know 
and eventually uh it looks like there's gonna be no fun for poor Cinderella at all 
uh so  she's  she goes away 
and she can't  she can't be uh invoi invited for the  uh the rest of the  the party 
so  she goes over there 
and  and suddenly she's been sitting around s most of the time calling or talking to uh you_know barnyard animals which is what I guess you hafta just live with once you're  uh if you're uh an orphan 
and  uh and all_of_a_sudden they said 
 oh  no  w we can get you into this 
 you'll see 
and here comes uh uh 
what is her name 
the  uh this magical creature is gonna fix everything for you 
and  uh s and she  ha she has  all the  all of her  uh her clothing is wonderful 
uh and a magical  a magical uh uh ges tongue
wait a second deep
 so  then the  uh the fairy godmother is going to look at this and see how wonderful that these two women are 
so  th they go 
no  his  his 
sorry 
his 
nope  it's not working 
let's try it again 
um  Cinderella wanted to go to the  n to the  the ball but she couldn't 
but now but  with the uh 
what's the name of that fantastic creature 
with  with this fantastic creature who will deliver  give her this beautiful new  uh new uh gown uh there's  uh there's no reason to  uh t to  uh to be worried about that because it's gonna look a absolutely beautiful for all time 
so  there uh the  uh the  s
I guess he's a king or  or some such 
no  he's a prince 
that's what it is 
of_course he's a prince 
and  uh and all_of_a_sudden the  uh the prince 
so  but you_know when  when the  when it's  uh it's time for the clock to  uh to  uh to get  uh get uh 
but when the clock  clock strikes then  then Cinderella hasta  uh hasta  to run away before that comes 
so  now uh they're waiting on  to see what happens 
who is this new Cinderella this strange and wondrous person that  that's with us 
uh because we've never seen him 
so  the  uh the  the uh prince says 
 t we must have somebody s to see every single  peep every single person that uh could've been there in  in the  uh in the  uh uh in the party 
and  and uh so they look first at the  uh at uh Gonoral and then Ragen and said 
 no  these are not the ones we  ha we would needta  to see because they're really nasty and  and vitriolic 
whereas suddenly when Cinderella i is  uh is shown they say 
 she's the one ges 
uh and uh now she can go 
and you_know with  I'm assuming uh that  assuming that uh they can get married immediately for all of this 
then the  the  the prince will be delighted with Cinderella 
and they will live happily ever after
