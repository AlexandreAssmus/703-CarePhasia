two thousand and one 
yeah 
I was at work 
I was at work 
and um people came down 
one of the women came down 
and she said she was talking  d that her husband called the telephone  called him 
 you should see what's happened 
and one of the planes too 
one plane hit 
it was probably 
what was it 
uh it was eight fifty nine in the morning  I think 
and at first they thought it was like uh a small um airplane 
and it hit the  um it  it hit the uh Twin_towers 
uh but then they realized it was really  uh it was north and s 
I think it was north and south 
is that the different towers 
and um they thought that it really was a much bigger airplane 
and um anyway her husband said that he had heard that maybe they're 
this is later on that there was  they were like 
all around the country the other um buildings were gonna get hit 
and  um but basically we saw that there was really  uh the  um the pɪnətɡɑnu 
and um the other plane 
and then this is  this was a number of  uh I think there were four  four planes 
um the other one um people that were  were riding got up and tried to like um talk  they got it to hit the ground 
and um lemme think what else happened 
I think there was four planes 
and um okay yeah 
so there were two  there were  there were  there were  there were two of the Twin_towers 
two  kah two different planes hit that 
and  um and then the Pentagon hit 
and then the other plane they actually got it down 
and  and uh the plane never hit anything 
it  it hit the ground 
okay head
yeah 
yeah 
but it was funny because they thought that it was gonna  that it was gonna 
the  her husband thought that it was gonna happen to a_lot more than that 
uh where they  where they got their information 
they  they  they claimed that they could hear 
I don't know what they did ges but they claimed that it might go everywhere around the country 
but nothing yet  we never  of_course we realized that never happened 
yeah okay 
sure 
no  this is a story 
like me to tell a story 
okay  the boy hit uh a ball 
and he hit the  um the window 
and uh in the back  actually it was his  it was his house 
and inside the house it could've been an  ol an older man uh got hit by the ball 
it hit the  uh the window on the outside 
and on the inside it went through the window 
and it hit the uh person that was sitting 
and  uh and look like the person got up 
and he hel hold the  held the  uh the ball 
and he was out looking at a big hole in the  in the window 
and he was trying to see who actually hit him 
I don't know that's 
this is funny 
I'm gonna call this a heavy carousel 
because uh if I took a little  I'll  if I  if I spend more time I'll say what it is 
anyway it'll come up to me 
I know what it is 
I've been practicing 
where you were doing on the 
I was  I was 
umbrella 
okay  umbrella 
that's why I called it a heavy carousel 
I thought that was kind_of funny 
I meant that  I meant that to be funny head
okay  um so  anyway  I've been talking about this and I haven't really been looking at this 
sorry 
I don't know what this means 
is it  um it's either the little boy was going to  going to use that 
or either that or his um 
I guess 
is he heading  uh is he  is he  in the beginning of it is the little boy talking to his mother that he wanted to  to use this 
or he either that  ges either that or he wanted it 
and she said 
 well  maybe you shouldn't take it 
I'm  I'm not sure exactly how this is 
uh so  the little  the little boy is still looking uh at his mother 
and she's holding the  uh the heavy parasol 
and um anyway he's out the house 
and it's raining already 
and now it's really heavy rain 
and uh so he came back 
he's back to his house 
and he's covered with water 
and the rain was heavy 
and his mother didn't look like she's very happy 
and uh it doesn't say exactly what happened to the uh jusɛləu 
but he has it now 
and he's back  he's outside again 
and he's not get his  he's not uh get  he's not get his  um he's not  he's not gonna  on his head he's not gonna get hit by it 
and uh he  so he'll be drier 
I wasn't sure how  how that worked with the mother whether she really wanted him to use it or she wanted to keep it 
I'm not sure 
okay 
okay 
oh okay 
okay  this is kind_of a fun story 
this is like the  um so  like there's a  there's like a little girl 
and she liked  liked the  the cat 
there's also a dog 
now the dog could belong  belong to  uh to the  f the  f their family perhaps 
or it could be uh somebody else's um neighbor 
and they had a dog 
and the dog actually skeɪdu 
and the dog 
and it was um on the  up there pretty high 
so  his 
 oh  I'll get the cat 
 and I'll get a ladder 
 and I'll put the ladder up here 
 and I'll try to get the cat 
 so  I got up there 
 and what happened though 
 the ladder fell down 
and the little girl probably was driving 
I don't know what you call that it starts with a kl 
it's like a 
anyways she  she still  she really liked the cat 
so  somebody 
it was either um 
there's also a  there's also uh a bird up here 
but I don't think that  that  that has anything involved with the cat 
I don't think the cat is afraid of the  of the  of the  the  uh the bird 
so  um you would think that the little girl if she was strong  if she was older she could help uh lift up the ladder and put the father back on 
but uh she can't 
and uh I don't know 
she doesn't look like she's involved that  that she has a small  a telephone 
and she could call up um nineoneone or something so_that the fire people could come and put the ladder up and get his 
and then  and uh she also  she's not gonna  they like daw uh birds so they'll  they'll  they won't try to hurt the  the bird either 
and they probably will get the uh 
of_course the thing that would be kind_of fun 
if they were more interested in getting the cat they'd leave the father up there 
I don't know shrugs 
that's my little story 
oh yeah I knew that was 
I  I saw 
I saw it points 
I saw it 
sure 
okay 
my version 
um well  the first page um these  there are little girls 
and there's a  muh there's a mother 
and they had like a little  c a cat 
and the cat uh 
so those  so and then on the second page I don't know if it's her husband 
uh and there's like  um and there's another girl 
it's possible that they  that the mother had  had three girls 
and um the two of them were kind_of her pals 
and maybe they were twins 
I'm not sure 
but they weren't very attractive 
uh and the  uh and the cat looked like it was a_lot_of trouble too 
it had a kind_of  um um it was almost like um their mother 
their mother didn't look like she was a_lot_of fun either 
and maybe  perhaps it was her husband 
and they had like a dog 
and the dog looked like a nice dog 
and little blonde girl was  she was  she was nice too 
and the husband  perhaps it was the husband 
he seems like a nice person also 
and the mother and her two little twin girls and that little  and the cat are just trouble 
so  um so  what's happening 
they're  um we can see that this happened in a much later period of time 
and the  um the  l the  the three little girls got older 
and two of them weren't very attractive 
and the mother um was um perhaps it's her mother uh she much preferred the  the two  um the two twin sisters that weren't very attractive 
and um so they  actually if I remember correctly the  they useta let  the little  the little  the pretty little girl hadta do crappy work 
and she wasn't treated  she much preferred the  uh the twins if they were twins 
so  um and I think the mother  the young  the young girl uh the  at one time she was a blonde 
I think her hair is ɡɑɾɪŋu 
she um was looking at a beautiful um dress 
and um she also looked out the window 
and she saw this beautiful um place where the um 
I hafta say how you call that right 
it starts with a cl sighs 
it's probably the head of the uh 
if if there was like  there was a town 
um he is either something like the  may the mayor or he was a im important um person 
he had like a young  he had this  this young man that perhaps was gonna be the king or something 
I'm not sure exactly how you say it 
and it's like 
I'm having a really hard time calling what the name of that place was 
starts with a cl 
um castle 
the castle 
they saw the castle 
okay 
so  so  we're  we're setting up here 
we see the  uh the young  the  the attractive young girl 
she's our nice  she had you_know she had  um she's older 
she saw priz this very attractive uh dress 
and uh she looked out the window 
and she saw the castle 
and uh this would be a nice 
that's the area 
so  then the mother got uh a letter claiming that there was gonna be a  um a big dance or a big area where people 
I don't think he's the king or whatever he is were all gonna take a look at this 
it's gonna be around um 
it must be  uh it's a important area because people were going to  they're gonna dance with this young man 
um they're gonna have music 
they're gonna have food perhaps 
it seems like a great time 
but the main reason was  is that all those  all those young girls all around the country uh they would decide which one uh the  uh the king's young son was gonna marry 
he's gonna marry one of those women 
and uh so um I also  I  if I remember correctly the  uh the  uh their  the pretty girl couldn't really go to  um couldn't go to this  this  this  this interesting plɛriəu 
lemme see what you call it right sighs 
so  there's a merr uh magic grandmother 
and she decides that  um that the little  um that the young woman  this young woman could  could wear nice clothes 
she could wear nice clothes too 
you_know  there's a beautiful white gown 
and she would go 
and she danced with the  uh she danced with the um young man who was gonna be the king in the future 
and uh they seem like  this is the one 
and she had this  um um  there was a g glassed 
and a_lot_of different people tried to put that on 
and only one had the right  uh the right feet that  that would be able to wear the uh glass shoes 
and um so the  so they  um the young man was of_course quite happy 
and  but the problem was  is that things are gonna change at  at twelve 
there's a midnight time 
and uh I think all of that um 
I don't know if this story says it corr was  correctly that  that um they were all in this beautiful place 
this  um this not a wagon 
I'm not saying the right term of what this thing is 
but at twelve this thing that everybody's riding on turns into  um 
you can't ride in it nicely 
it's uh 
I'm having a ha hard time when I was doing this 
I  it starts with a uh 
that orange thing 
it starts with a pl 
and we were doing this when we were together 
I couldn't say it right 
and it starts with a 
anyway that's  it turns  it's got wheels and all of this 
and  and at the  when it turns twelve the whole thing's gonna like turn into something else 
and everybody's gone 
and there  uh the girl  the girl was xxx the  the  the  actually the attractive young woman she's running away because it's gonna turn twelve 
and she still has one of the glass  um one of the um glass um shoe 
so they're looking  the  uh the king is wondering what happened to the other glass shoe 
and people are going around to all of the different places 
and um went over to the  the one house that the  uh that the  uh the mother had the two twins that they never really liked very much 
of_course she couldn't fit  she didn't have one like that 
so  then the little blonde girl  the little blonde uh woman had the other um 
oh I know what they did 
they found one 
they found one that uh 
and they had like  uh their 
and the only one that could do it was the one that was like doing all  she was a worker 
and she wasn't treated as nice as the mother and they  uh the twin sisters 
and she wound up she could fit that 
and they decided this is the one 
and the thing ends um that uh they're gonna get married 
I'm sorry head
 on and on and on 
peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
how would I do it 
um I guess I would like  I'd prefer um the type of bread 
a_lot_of people like white bread 
and they also preferred small  smooth  smooth uh peanuts 
and if they had a choice of the  um j the um 
it's peanut and jelly 
the jelly 
uh what it  what could be made out_of 
it could be  um  could it be made out_of apple 
it could be uh grace 
g I_mean  um gr purple 
what do you call purple 
purple grease 
um anyway all these different types of um 
they could ha be made out_of like um oranges 
mɑrbəliu 
and what was your question 
how  how I would prefer to have it 
oh  well  I'd have two  two  um two pieces of bread 
and I would put  on one side I'd put a uh 
and I prefer  if I was gonna be preferred I'd have uh peanut  peanuts  peanuts 
I'd have like chunks in it 
and I would  I use apple  uh apple uh jel dʒʌvəlu 
I can't say it right 
and one would be on one side and one on the another 
I put it together 
I take uh uh a knife 
and I would cut it in half 
and I would have that on a plate
