I really enjoyed doing head
I_mean  it was tiring but it was  I enjoy it 
I  al you_know  I always like what's going on head
and I  I don't find a_lot_of fault  fault on anything 
but  I  I thought it was good head
yes 
well  number one is that I  d a doing the ges right sentences or you_know smaller sentences and not getting in  frustrated and whatever 
that  uh that's been a help for me  I think 
and I  I hafta stop ges
so  I think that's  that was helpful for me head
well  lemme see 
I don't know what that 
oh that's a ball 
okay 
so  this is the whole beginning I_mean  a whole sequence 
so  it's not like I hadta mix it up 
this young boy was playing ball and kicked the ball  then kicked the ball into the window  picture window 
and it broke the window 
and the ball went right into the fellow's lap 
and he  this man has the ball probably to throw back or to yell at this boy 
so  this is xxx 
okay 
and you want the beginning and the middle and the end 
the beginning is for the  feh the mother is giving this little boy the umbrella 
and he didn't want it 
and all_of_a_sudden the  n the uh 
and he had told his mother that he didn't wanna do it 
and  and it started to rain 
and now he's getting really wet 
and he got very wet 
and the mother's annoyed 
and he did get the uh umbrella 
he hadta leave  go and get his umbrella to go back in the out  outdoors 
hm yeah 
this is a little  the uh cat  little girl 
um little girl's daw uh cat climbed into the tree 
and the fire truck or  fire department hadta rescue 
well  the dog  the dog barked 
uh yeah uh let's see here 
the  the uh ladder 
the man tried to climb into the uh ov 
so  this is one of the s reasons that ges 
um the dog was barking at the man who lost the  the uh ladder 
because the dog was barking at him 
I guess that's probably why 
and then the uh little boy 
that's not as nice as I should've said 
yeah 
yes 
yup 
the  uh um sighs  the lady  uh the  the  uh the prince  the uh king ordered having  uh um uh ordered not ord yeah  to have a big dance 
and um the ugly children  women were really not very nice to Cinderella 
and the animals helped Cinderella  um um uh  Cindere helped Cinderella with her dress 
and then the  the  uh oh the whatever she is ges 
it's not how you talk  I shouldn't be talking but 
um  Cinderella's f s fairy godmother uh ordered the pumpkins  the uh horses to go to the dance 
Cinderella and  uh and was swimming 
and then uh she had said that they hadta  uh she hadta um leave before midnight 
and the ugly stepmother they locked her into  locked her away 
and in the end the  the mice got her key 
and the women hadta 
well  she had lost  Cinderella had lost her shoe 
and the  the people from the kingdom hadta um try on the  uh the shoe 
and the uh prince  and the prince said 
well  anyway the shoe was uh  felt 
not felt head
uh the store 
it's not the word feltq 
what're you saying on your shoe 
fits 
the shoe didn't  it should fit Cinderella 
and the  the  uh the uh prince and the  and Cinderella lived happily after that laughs 
you've gotta ge have two slices of bread 
on one side you can  s and  you uh well probably have butter 
and then you might have uh peanut butter on one side 
and on the other side of  of the uh 
there's two slices 
and the s fir second slice has jam 
and you're gonna put those  p those pieces together 
and you're going to  to uh cut them 
for one side  one piece for me and then the second piece for you
