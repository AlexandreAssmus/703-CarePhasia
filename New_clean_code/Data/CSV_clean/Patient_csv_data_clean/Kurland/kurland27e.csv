mhm 
I remember going into the  hos being admitted to the hospital 
I felt wide awake 
I was talking to the um guys in the ambulance 
um then my sister met me 
and after that I me remember very little 
um I do reme remember but I think it's because they told me that um they instead of  they admitted me but did not do anything at all to um work on my leg which is what they should've done immediately 
um they told  they told me or  they told my sister that um they were gonna let me you_know rest for twenty  f you_know for twenty four hours and evaluate it which was laughs the most asinine decision they ever made because by waiting um and I don't know remember the medical terms but basically I was out 
um and um my  sis they had sent my sister home 
and she came back up the hospital the next morning 
and um she had a fit because she knew there was something wrong 
um and I guess that by then I didn't know but she had  she called the doctors and had had a f s f screaming fit 
and they ended me in to do  to operate on me which was like twenty hours late 
and by that time I'd lost all use of my right leg 
um and I remember  I sort_of remember going in and out 
um I kept thinking 
 I hafta get up 
 I hafta do something 
um and like s uh to me in my head I was yelling at the nurse saying 
 you_know  why are you doing this to me 
um I didn't come out of it 
you'd hafta ask my sister but at_least three or four days 
um and I gather from my  my sisters and my daughter that it was fairly serious 
um and I woke up and was in a blitz uh blank out ges 
um I came out_of the hospital like after six days I think  seven days 
and they immediately put in  put me in 
um and it took me another ten  twelve days 
no  thirty 
t it took me thirty  forty  forty two days between each  ho between the two hospitals 
and at the end of the two  forty do 
no 
I wanna say Mount  s oh Saint  Mount_St_Vincent 
and um they kept me there for let's see  four five six weeks 
and then they left me in there another twelve  twelve and a half months 
so  I spent um thirteen fourteen weeks in there I_mean  fourteen months in there 
um and then they let me out 
and um the time in the hospital I 
and I hope  I'm hoping  may I'm changing my mind now 
but um for the month  for the twelve  six months that I spent there I've had a_lot_of doubt as to whether I should have left it or not 
because there I can go 
I could si study 
I could take the van wherever I needed to go 
when I wanted to study I studied 
when I didn't wanna study I didn't 
um the last six months or so have just been massive disasters of being  people who you don't wanna be around you around you um if you wanna do things 
and that  that ups upsets me as much as knowing that for the first three four  mo fi four  four to five months I have no recognition of what happened 
but now I'm going through a period of anger 
um it just sighs 
that's quite a story  Firstname 
oh  it gets  it gets better laughs 
I now hafta see all these 
uh what do you call it 
therapists and doctors and uh lawyers 
and I didn't know until a month ago 
they've  my sister and all these people have been talking about what happened to me 
so  now there's a lawsuit going and everything else 
I'm like 
 where did this all come from 
well  they've all been talking about it 
they screwed up on the  um on the leg 
so  now I'm in the middle of a lawsuit that I don't know anything about 
they've all talked 
there were five people in there 
who  my relatives and fɪstɚu 
um and I smiled sweetly and listened to all this 
and I have no idea what's going on yet 
yeah 
it's been interesting 
it's  but it's getting over it  I hope 
I don't have a choice laughs 
that's for sure 
I hope so 
oh  but that one's easy 
well  it may not be easy but I like it 
so  okay 
okay 
 alright
