yep 
mhm 
 it  it  uh it's a good way 
um I think it could've been extended with the expansion of the words more than just twenty on the object and twenty uh subject it's  uh subject 
um after awhile that gets a lil 
yeah  at_least to me it did 
to others ges probably not 
uh knowing the depth of the group that you have 
uh but to me it got really  rep after awhile I got tireding 
uh uh bɑltʃɪŋu 
so  uh I like a small expansion with  with uh xxx words would've been nice 
um I don't know if you could do that uh with the group or with the coming group ges 
it  would it be əpɪkəbəlu 
well  it depends on probably where the person is 
where the  where the person sits in that  that group 
uh if they  if they reach a certain mark then uh I'd  I'd  then I said  say 
 okay expand that person 
uh if they don't they stay on the same words 
and they keep going through it you_know 
 I don't know 
 yeah you expanded mine 
and I doubt that  that some of the people would  would uh be able to take that kind of expansion 
it would've been putting an awful lot of pressure on them 
um so  that was good 
uh but it got a little boring towards the end 
 well the word retrieval was severe at the beginning 
uh uh I think it more severe at the beginning than it is now 
uh but yeah when you say 
 well   I  I wouldn't quite meet that retrieval  wouldn't be at that retrieval level that the rest of the group is at 
it was true 
I would agree that  that um I don't fit into uh that group along that  that ges line 
so 
oh yeah it definitely helped me 
uh I can speak now a_lot more fluent than I could at the beginning 
mhm 
beginning middle and the end oh_boy 
well  here was little Johnny is off kicking the ball 
and he likes to kick the ball 
his father is a soccer player and so he gets a kick out_of it 
and he gets his  he sees the ball out there 
and he says 
 I'm gonna kick it 
he runs up and he whacks the ball points
he whacked it good too points
but unfortunately there's a window points
and the ball ges
now the father of_course xxx picks up the ball goes to the window coughs and he looks out 
and he sees Johnny standing out there with a facial
and he wants to yell something but it ends there laughs 
 I won't  I won't say what he said because it doesn't skɪvu

Cinderella 
hm my version of Cinderella 
Cinderella she's a goodie 
well back in the days  oh th this is the days of your little houses or little she
and Cinderella was a girl of this time 
and she lived in one of these sheds 
and she had a grandparent or  pa pa parent and three sisters 
and she was kind_of a poor little girl 
and the three sisters were fairly  hm they  they  t they saw themselves as really above Cinderella 
and she'd walk around the house and do the chores 
and the three sisters would kind_of  kind_of give her things ges to do 
but Cinderella xxx 
 what can I say 
 I hafta do what I hafta do 
and so it's  uh uh there came a letter in the mail about a ball that was having at the castle 
now the castle was big and very  very shiny 
and it was run by the princess 
and the letter invited the k family 
and the mother looked at the letter says 
 oh  this is for our three daughters 
 the three sisters that are good girls not for Cinderella 
and Cinderella looked up and said 
 sky 
and looked at the side of the house and 
 I guess you're right mother 
 I guess that's for the three sisters and not for I 
and he 
it was very  very nice but no she couldn't wear that 
she's too little 
and she's too small to wear that 
and so she just went 
 okay sisters you may go and I'll stay here 
 and I'll be doing the house 
and she's looking out the window and sees the castle all lit up and knows that her three sisters have gone there to  to date the princess 
and she's talking to her friends who are xxx mice and the  and the horse 
and they're saying 
 I can't go I  because I'm  I'm just  I'm just not the type 
and she's  she's kind_of whining and crying when poofo along came the fairy godmother 
she said 
 wha well what's that 
and she said  the fairy godmother said 
 well  I'm your fairy and I'm gonna take you to the  se to the s princess' 
and she's 
 I can't go 
 I'm not ready 
 I'm not dressed 
and she says 
 you watch this 
and says 
 bingo ges 
and she's turned the horse into a carriage  a beautiful carriage to carry princess 
as bingo ges
she wore a  had a beautiful white dress popped on there 
and she had that on 
and bingo 
the waɪsu 
and all_of_a_sudden she says 
 I can go 
 I can make it to this hell  s
and she jumped in this carriage 
and she rode along 
and she got to the ball 
and there the princess 
a pair a beautiful white shoes 
there were  they were glass shoes 
so  the three fairies 
the first one was 
 oh imit
she fell out 
it was too big  too  too  too little for her 
and the second princess 
they was too little head
and the third princess 
 I can do it 
and she jumped on groans 
and she couldn't get in the thing either popped out and says 
 this is no good 
and the princess 
 well  I'll try it on if I can 
and the princess 
 okay here you try it on 
and she tried it on 
and they fit 
so  her and the prince were dancing and making love all the way up until midnight 
coughs and midnight was gonna hit 
and the princess looked down and said 
 uhoh the fairy godmother points
she said I hadta be gone by midnight 
so  she says 
goodbye ges
and she tore out the door faster than anyone could lwɑtʃu 
and the prince said 
 woah woah woah 
and she was gone 
and she took off ges 
and when she got home everything turned back the way it was 
the mouse and the horse ges and everything became the same that it was 
and it was all the same 
and she was 
 oh_my_gosh how will this ever happen 
and she got in the house 
and the next day there come a knock on the door 
 what the heck is that 
and it was the princess 
and the princess 
 well  I wanna see if anyone has my shoes 
xxx the princess  s
 I do 
and he says 
 oh_my_gosh 
and he looked at it 
and the shoe was on 
and because it was on he 
and they went off and they got married 
and they lived happy kɛvɚu 
mhm 
tell me how 
well  I haven't done that lately 
but it is uh really the best thing going 
the what you do is you get the peanut butter and  and  and  and jelly all together ges 
and you hafta kind_of look at it and say 
hm okay I've got myself a loaf of bread 
and I've got a  a firm and a  and a  a lighter loaf 
and I'll choose the firm though because the peanut butter is gonna be sticky and when you spread it 
especially with one hand  left hand 
that's gonna tear the bread 
and so the lighter loaf can't do or you'll end up with  with your bread all ripped up 
so  you take the thicker loaf and slice it down ges
and slice it into two slices each about inch ges
and uh took those ges and lay them down 
and take the peanut butter first points
and bread 
and the bread won't tear 
that bread stays the same 
then you take the  the  the tʃɛlɪu 
oh i it's good tasting jelly 
so  you dip ges
and you spread ges
and it is on top of the peanut butter because I guess  because if you put that on first the jelly and then the peanut butter it would splatter all over 
so  you spread the peanut butter ges
so  you got a loaf  s
and you take your bare piece of bread that's  that's  that's  that's  that's not used 
and you pick it up and put that on top of the whole thing ges
and it'll  press it down just enough that it'll start the jelly falling of the edges ges 
and then you pick it up ges
and you chomp it down
