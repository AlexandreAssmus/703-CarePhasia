um well  clears
um I stopped at this  um in Petersan 
and they were having  um they were having artwork there you_know 
and uh I talked  and when I went in  t when I went in there a_lot of the  pee one of the women I actually knew her 
and act she  she actually ran for a representative 
xxx  she lost last year 
and she also writes uh books 
and uh I've seen her talking about this 
she wrote a book about this  uh this man that was in World_war_two 
and he  he was caught in the baton  s
when somebody  when they die 
um ut a march 
did I  can I say that right 
 you understood me right head
and that man when I was young when I was eighteen he  he would  uh he  he  he  k he talked to me 
and he said uh who he  who his name was and everything like that 
and he told me that he was always in love with my art 
in World_war  this is in World_war_two 
and uh but  and he was  he was  his name was FirstnameP 
and he wasn't  he was about as tall as I was 
and my aunt s 
and he asked her to marry him 
and she said that no she wouldn't do it because she liked taller men 
laughs but he would tell me about this 
but this woman that I was talking Sunday that she tried to be a  she tried to  to run for as uh a representative 
and she  um and she lost 
she useta  she useta be a writer for uh um a representative in  um in Massachusetts 
when she was young she useta did 
this and anyway head
so  I know  I knew her 
so  I talk to a_lot of these people 
and uh I was doing very well except I got to a word 
and I told them 
 you_know I have a  s I have  I have the  I had a speech 
 and it's difficult for me to talk 
and she said nobody had any idea there was wrong with me talking until that  until that time 
and uh so they were getting  re you_know it was  it was uh eight  it was six o'clock 
they were all ready to  uh everybody was all  all done 
and I bought  I bought the book 
and I was outside talking to this other man 
and he was probably uh our age 
I was  I_mean  I was his age head
and he was  he was  muh he was slender 
and he said that he had migraine headaches every two or three days 
 and  uh and he had  uh he was worried that he'd have a stroke himself 
and he said that uh he had extremely bad um maɪgrɛnu 
and he  you_know and but he said 
 uh you_know we don't know how you_know 
I_mean  we shook hands and everything 
and he talked quite about what his problems that he has 
 because I talked about the stroke that I had 
and he told me how he has  he  sus he suffered from that 
and uh I had read recently that there were some new uh drugs that might help out people that have that 
and he said that uh he  he saw a doctor 
and the doctor told him that  uh it  they gave him some of his drugs 
and it didn't do him any good what's  what  not xxx head
so that was  so  that was that 
uh so I  so  I guess my little bit of story is  is I said this quite a bit before anybody knew there was anything wrong with me you_know 
I guess the  and I  my feeling is  is that I don't think I'm doing much better 
um people will say boy Firstname sounds  he's a_lot better 
and uh but uh I'm afraid that I'm not getting much better head
that's  that's one of my  head
I think I'm probably a little bit better than I was 
um but I still don't think I'm really  really well 
you_know  and I'm always surprised when people tell me 
 gee we had no idea there was anything wrong with you talking 
you_know  because to me it sounds horrible to me 
this is how I feel about it ges head
is that  uh uh because I  I think that I was very good at  at speaking 
uh and I knew  I knew so many different things 
and I was witty and things like that 
and uh so I'm not  duh I'm not depressed or anything like that 
and I'm hoping I'm going to do better 
it's just that I don't think I'm doing that head
you_know  okay  head
um actually I don't think I've had any problems 
uh I think that I remember everything wonderfully 
and as a matter of fact I wanted to tell you about  uh about 
I was with FirstnameG 
and I was driving 
I was driving a van 
and we were going at uh the Home_Depot 
you_know  and for year  for a long time I could not say Home_Depot 
so  I  I admit that I'm  a_lot of the words I'm doing a_lot better than I  than I was head
like it took me m maybe a month before I could say uh Baldwin_Hill_Road which is where I  you_know where I live head
and I  actually I was probably  uh since I was like one year old I lived in the same  in the same house 
so  I actually knew  uh knew how to say it 
so  uh when I was with  uh it was like uh our  it was our  it was uh eight sixteen two thousand thirteen August 
and I was driving 
it was about nine o'clock at night 
and we had just left Home_Depot to buy ges uh 
I was actually  she had an apartment in her  in her um 
the  this lady who had lived there for twenty four years had died recently 
and we were fixing up her apartment 
and one of the things was that her  um the  the bath uh had an old steel tub 
and we just bought a 
and I'm good at finding deals 
and I found a nice  uh a nice new tug 
and uh we were just bought it in my van 
a and  and so then we were gonna have a supper  we were gonna go suppering now 
so  I was on route  te r uh I was on uh Boston_Road 
and uh I was driving 
and uh this is about nine o'clock at night 
and she said 
 you sh should turn  you should turn right 
she said 
 turn right 
and apparently what happened is that I had paralyzed ges
I was  dri head
and uh on the  she said that one of my eyes  you_know I  my  ee I couldn't see on this side ges
it's like this whole whole side ges
and uh I was driving 
I managed to get the van on the side of the road 
and it was right where we were going to uh the restaurant 
and  uh and then I would just hold onto the steel 
and  uh and I was so  I was really lucky uh that FirstnameG was with me you_know 
 and actually I've  I've always felt that FirstnameG saved my  saved my life basically 
um and  and the other thing that was  that worked out well is that there were  there were  there were doctors 
and uh uh there were  there was two nurses and a doctor that just happened to be driving their cars 
and they saw it  what happened 
and everybody got out 
and they all got me  op we opened up the door 
and they got me down on the ground 
and  um and they called up  ges
what do you got that say it right 
it starts with uh the truck 
it's  it's  um it's not the right term for  for the truck but they took her to  um and they took it to Baystate 
and while it  when I was there 
and during this time I started losing the color 
I could  s I could still see my vision but it was like black and white 
 that you_know the  c the  the color head
we got to  we got to Baystate and their emergency 
is it emergency 
well  anyway um e kay it  it all came back to me 
the color all came back 
I_mean  I was on a ɡɝdiu 
what do you call it 
they carry people 
ɡɝdizu 
ɡɝdizu 
I was on that head
and uh they were taking me in on  uh upstairs 
uh I think I probably took  uh s I don't know if I xrays or something like that 
or maybe it was like  uh could've been an m_r_i or something perhaps 
and then  uh then I finally made  head
it was almost like one o'clock in the morning ges 
I was in  uh you_know there was like uh a nurse  a young nurse 
and FirstnameG was here 
and uh I wanted to  I knew everything was happening ges 
you_know  I was saying to myself 
 boy something's really happening me that's really not doing well you_know 
I said 
 uh you_know they're sending me to a hospital so obviously something's wrong with me 
and uh so I wanted to  s so then I wanted to  I kept on trying to talk to FirstnameG about what was happening 
and I couldn't say anything 
and I said 
 if I can't say anything to FirstnameG then she's gonna think I can't tell her what's wrong with me 
so  they think that there's probably something a_lot worse than me 
because I think I understood everything that was happening during  during this whole thing ges that was happening 
and uh so that's  that's pretty good head
okay  well  I was  I was at  um I was at um Baystate 
and I was there for like um I think it was  eight days 
and then it was very  not very far away 
we went to Mercy 
and I was there for ten days 
um and then I  I was talking  I was there  um they tried to seem 
they  I said to her head
 some uh physical therapy work 
and I could do everything 
I had no trouble 
you_know  they  they started off you_know trying to move my  you_know  you_know uh how I can move and stuff like that 
and  and they  actually after like two days they said 
 he doesn't need any physical problems 
so  I was actually talking  I talked to this  this  this woman that was uh the speech therapist 
and um I talked with her for  mo for like nine  nine days I think 
and then the last day  last day I was there  uh I think the ninth day I think I  they  they had this group of people 
they had  s they had uh 
that you would  you would  this one  this one woman had  uh I think you probably  you probably knew her uh because she was from Umass 
and she was going at that time 
she's still going at_least m almost a year 
she was going to uh be th you_know helping uh at Umass 
uh so  we had this group of people that suffered from  from  uh from speaking well 
and I listened to  you_know I listened to what she was saying 
uh z actually the whole group uh of  pee of people 
and apparently they do that every 
I don't know if they come every month or something 
and they  they talk to people about that 
so  uh and then  and then after ten days I was there 
we dec uh decided that we went to  uh in Amherst 
and it was like um um rust 
and you_know what happened is that the speech therapist would come 
and she was there for like fifteen minutes 
and she'd do the same kind of testing that you've been doing 
and uh is  is like the same thing head
and you_know it was like I had seen it 
and  and uh the next day another speech therapist 
I think there was only a couple  t a couple of people 
and she started the whole thing all over again 
right 
and she wasn't here that long 
and then uh the next day this other person came again 
and uh we were doing the same thing 
but none of them 
it was only very short period of time you_know maybe twenty minutes or something like that and she was leaving 
and uh so I think uh FirstnameG and I we actually  we actually points went for a walk you_know because where she was isn't really that far away 
so  in the center of town points we went to uh dinner 
and uh we were talking 
and she was saying 
oh the other thing is the speech therapist had been there for like thirteen years in the same place 
and she was  qu and she was  she's getting a new job 
she was gonna lo lose  she was gonna leave 
and I think in the beginning FirstnameG thought that maybe I should be there for maybe two or three weeks 
and um now it's getting  uh you_know it's the middle  it's the beginning 
so  I when would  it was  I just had  I had a birthday there that week head
and um we were thinking that maybe we would stay 
and I was gonna stay with uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's house 
I was gonna stay there 
uh because I think what happened is that uh we decided this was a waste of time to be at that nurse 
the nurse 
and the thing is that  that uh this 
and this is what um 
they wanted to  ha to you_know if I wanted to go to the  um to have my  uh my bath and stuff like that 
they wanted to take me 
all of the people that worked there 
they  you_know and when I was in  in  I was in um Mercy all of the  they let me do it all by myself 
and some of the nurses would let me do it at four o'clock in the morning 
I could  I could go all by myself 
I could  ov I could  wa they had like a room ges 
I could  I could take all my clothes off 
I would  I'd take a nice bath 
I'd put everything back 
and then I would even  I  I would like  uh with my razor I would  I would  um you_know I would  I would touches
what would you call that 
not my beard but I would cut my beard and things like that head
and I didn't have any problems um when I was at Mercy 
no problems whatsoever head
and the only thing I could do the whole day was trying to read the New_York_Times 
that's basically the only thing I hadta try to read 
and I would say if I read something like um um one section of the New_York_Times it would probably take me  um maybe it would take me an hour just to read one  one 
and then I'd only probably understand maybe forty percent of the things I was trying to read you_know 
of_course if it was  maybe if it was an uh newspaper that was easier to read I might do better 
but uh it was still the New_York_Times and uh the edi editorials and things like that 
I was having a hard time understanding it 
but I had an ideara 
so  um so  a so  FirstnameG and I were going  we were  s we were at  we were having supper ges 
and she  s and  and she said 
 well  what do you think 
what she should do 
I said 
 I'd just as soon go home head
 I should go home 
so  then she tried to find people um in  uh in that area that would  they would come to my house and try to help me do speech therapist 
and um this one woman came 
and uh I really  I really  I thought she was quite good head
but you_know what happened 
I think they found one in Athol 
and then I started to drive too 
and if I could drive then you see you  c you couldn't have a person that would come to my house 
right 
so  um so  what happened 
I really liked this woman the speech therapist head
but I hadta give her 
and she had all of the  um she had all of this  she had a book with similar to all the different things that we could  uh I could probably learn with this 
how do you say the right term 
um we  um I started doing that 
you_know  she would do things like writing a picture 
there'd be pictures or something like that 
and we'd be like 
 uh the  uh  the clock 
you_know  and the clock would be  um we'd be on like a twelve 
and it'd be on six 
and it'd be on three 
it would be on  uh um you_know it would be on uh eight or something 
and I would hafta write  write it down which one it was head
so  um that was how I started doing with the  th with the speech therapist head
but then I couldn't  you_know I  I couldn't drive 
you_know  I'd  we  we can't let her keep on coming 
and  and she knew I could drive 
 so  um so  then I  I  we found that we could go to  um to Athol 
and it's  and I'm gonna still  I'm gonna go  I'm going three times a week to see FirstnameE 
and um 
yeah  okay  so  that's basically it 
okay 
oh 
 oh I think  well  actually meeting you at  uh at  s at uh FirstnameP and FirstnameY's 
and you  remember you started  you  you_know you were starting to do some of the work with me 
and you had like pictures 
and I hadta like uh try to say what the words were and stuff like that 
yeah  I remember that 
I was remembering that 
and I was  and I remembered that I was having a hard time to say what the words were 
and uh you_know and you  in the beginning it was pretty easy 
and then of_course the words got more difficult 
and uh so  I_mean  that was a_lot of the work that you did 
and I think the reason why uh y you were involved  that you were involved with that is that uh we were worried that we couldn't even find a speech therapist 
and I think that's how FirstnameY found you you_know 
and then we finally  then we  then we did find someone to go down to Athol 
so  and then you were also telling  telling me that uh because I had recently had that problem uh having uh trouble with  with the  uh what had happened in that part  that my  b then I needed  uh I needed everybody to  like uh to become ges 
what do you  c um what did I hafta say what it 
my  my brain was  was  still um um needed to be  uh get better 
I hadta get better before I could  I could come over here to have  to have you help 
so  we waited 
we hadta wait 
so  do I wanna tell 
you said you wanted uh another story 
this is just uh a story about how I met you 
how I met you 
I thought that was pretty  I thought that was pretty  I thought that was very important that this was gonna help me 
 you_know yeah  yeah 
okay 
yup 
um well  this is a  this is a boy 
and he's  um he's kicking a s um 
and I know what kind of like uh 
it's uh a ball 
it's a sɑkəlu 
and she 
and of_course what happened here is he  he  uh he kicked the  uh the ball 
and he hit the  uh uh um a window 
maybe it's his neighbor 
and  um or maybe it was his father 
I can call it his father 
his father is uh in the living room 
and he's sitting there 
and he actually kicked the ball 
and it went  uh it went uh on the other side 
and it fruu 
and it actually hit  um I guess it hit the lamp  the lamp too next to his  uh perhaps to his father  or a  ner a neighbor 
or maybe it was like um uh a young man 
I don't know who it is that's here 
and you_know the problem over here is  is that um he  he looks like he's standing up 
and this  la this fourth one is hard to tell exactly what this is 
whether uh 
this looks like this could be  uh this could be um 
whether this is like a  um a ball or whether this is his brain that got knocked out_of it 
I don't know 
this looks like it's opened here 
I don't know what this is 
this doesn't  this isn't very uh 
it's hard to tell very much of this other_than there's somebody standing up 
I don't know what s that person is holding  is holding onto 
if it's sposta be um that it could be this 
I don't know what it is 
okay 
that's all I can say 
mhm 
okay 
I guess he wanted the uh 
this that's what the 
you_know  I  I n 
the umbrella 
okay  the umbrella head
finally I got to say umbrella 
the little boy wanted the umbrella 
and his mother had it 
the mother doesn't look very happy 
she doesn't  actually it's hard to tell anything about how she looks ges
she changes over here 
uh so or he  either that or he tried to grab it from her 
I'm not sure 
because it looked like something happened ges 
um the second uh he looks like well  he's going to leave 
and uh she's gonna  she still has the umbrella 
so  here's the  s the little boy 
he's actually getting wet 
he's walking 
and um he's getting wet 
and now he's really getting wet because it's probably really coming out a_lot 
you can see right here 
it's like  um this in pʌltu 
head
well  he's a pool  s
pool  s
he's on  this  this pools on his um shoes and stuff like that 
so  he's back in his house 
and he's all covered with water 
and his mother she doesn't look like sh this was a great decision on her part 
she doesn't look happy 
it's hard to tell really but it's kind_of like uh the cartoon is 
it's hard to tell what she really looks 
uh so  I guess that she decided she'll let him use the umbrella 
and it's still really raining 
but he  at_least he's dry with the umbrella 
yeah 
laughs well this is pretty funny 
well  this is a little girl who has a cat 
and the cat is up the tree 
and um I don't know if she was driving 
she had her  bici she was on a tricycle 
so  and here's a little  the dog is up to  is at the tree too 
and he's barking 
maybe that's what caused  the  uh the cat was afraid or something and went up there 
either that or they're afraid of the sun 
I've always said that as a joke 
so  so  here's the ladder 
now what it looks like the  the um maybe the ladder was up there 
and it fell over 
and so now the  uh this is funny because now the  this man maybe it's  maybe it's her  um her father 
because he's  he's up there too 
he's  he's lost 
he can't get down 
and uh so what happened over here 
uh a fireman's over here 
and he's gonna  perhaps he's gonna save both the  um his 
and then there's a  uh a bird up here uh who probably enjoys this whole thing 
it's not gonna run 
now I'm xxx 
 I was gonna say this looks like  uh this  the  uh this is almost like a  g looks like a dog one 
looks like it's some  looks like somebody draw a picture of a dog on here 
k yeah not years and years ago 
nah I don't remember it 
sure 
well  the first page is  it's on the lefthand side 
it looks like um maybe it's uh could be  it could be their mother and uh their two daughters 
and they had like a little  they had a little cat 
and the little cat 
they all look kind_of like nervous ges to me 
they  they didn't look like they were  the little girl was  the two little girls they look like they were dangerous people 
and the cat looked like it was somebody that 
the  the cat was like a funny looking cat too 
and on this side there was a like  a little girl 
and uh she was very nice looking 
and uh I'm not sure who this guy's sposta be 
he's  he's uh a man ges 
and he's got like um a beard 
not a beard but what would you call that 
mustache touches
and he seems like a nice person 
and he was inviting them to come into their house 
um I don't know exactly what I could say about this whole thing 
if I was a little girl I bet you I could remember all the details on this a_lot better than I could right laughs 
so  um so  then I think what you  you get to see this  um this castle ges from the distance 
and I think there's this young  young woman 
and she looks like she works there 
she probably works at the  at the  somebody's house 
and she probably hadta like  uh her job was to like um clean 
and she was  she was trying to help out 
she probably wasn't rich 
um but I think they were looking um 
the  ma the major part of the story I think I'm gonna  I'm gonna  I'm gonna continue with this  is that um they were looking for a  um for a young  for a young  a young man h handsome man who was gonna get married 
uh and they were  and he was  he was probably in the  in the uh 
what do you call that place again 
I said it right but now I've forgotten what to call it 
uh the castle 
uh they were gonna have uh like a dance there with music 
and  uh and they had this um glass um shoe that they found the right one that would fit 
that would be his  that would be his  uh his wife 
uh so  a_lot_of people came to the  to the uh castle 
and they had the  da they were dancing 
and  um and I think this  this young woman who was very good looking she was like  um she hadta work there 
uh maybe it was her  maybe it was um the mother or something ges 
but she had  her two daughters  older daughters weren't very attractive head
um and they were probably hoping that they were gonna be ones that would  uh somebody  this handsome man was gonna marry her 
so  um so she was  so  mainly I think they went 
head
I'm not calling it a dance 
I know  I'm sorry head
and I'm trying to think who the  uh who the  who this  this  gram this sweet lady who's like 
she's a magical person ges
and she's gonna like uh 
so  this  this poor  g g this pyu poor girl she needed uh to have a beautiful dress 
but um I don't think she had anything 
but this um 
what did they call it 
this  this  that woman that could make things happen 
I don't know what you call her 
but um she wound up going to the  um going to the dance in this beautiful uh dress 
and  um and what had happened is that she was gonna  at  at the head of  of twelve she hadta run back home again because she would  all of that  that magical uh dress and everything was gonna be  uh was all gonna be gone 
and she's gonna have her  her uh clothes that she just worked down in the  uh in the cellar or in the floor or wherever she worked 
to go back to work 
so  she was trying to run away from uh this beautiful man ges that wanted to marry her 
and uh she lost this  the glass  the glass um ch shoe 
so  she managed to make it 
you_know  she ran away 
she lost  she lost that  that  that  um the magical shoe that she was wearing 
and uh so they  what they did is they  they hadta find all the  points all the different women that perhaps um would wanna marry him 
if they had  they hadta fit the uh right glass shoe 
and um I think they kind_of  they had it  uh they had that  they had the  um that  they had the shoe 
and ev they hadta decide 
everyone was gonna come and try to put it on 
and the only one that could put it on was the young woman that didn't have any money  was poor 
and she put it on 
and then they decided that she was the one that was gonna  that he's gonna  gonna marry her 
I don't know 
that's kind_of like 
um how would I would do it 
uh well  the first thing I would have is uh a knife 
and I would have a  pla um a plate 
and I would have some bread 
and uh depends on what it is 
if  uh if the bread was never  fluh if it was  uh it was whole you'd hafta take a knife 
and you'd hafta make um two sights 
I don't know what you'd call it 
when you  when you have bread and you cut it into two pieces what do you call that 
anyway I have the  this um 
what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna have  I'm gonna open up the  uh the um 
see I'm forgetting what the names of things are 
and then the uh peanuts 
and the  f and the  f the other one starts with an 
it's kind_of white 
and it looks like 
it starts with an fl 
uh and what you do is you put them together laughs in the bread 
and then you could cut it in the half or something like that 
and that would be your sandwich 
but I can't think of what you call uh that funny name 
uh that white thing that taste is probably  uh tastes really good shrugs with the peanuts laughs 
I'm sorry laughs 
yeah  I was trying  I'm trying to think of what you 
slights 
is that  I'm close to it 
the slight 
yeah 
closer 
not exactly but slice  slice laughs
