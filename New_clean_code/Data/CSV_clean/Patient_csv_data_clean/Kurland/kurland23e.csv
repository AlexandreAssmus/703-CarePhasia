uh sure 
I think it's  um it's August 
and um it was a Friday 
it was about uh eight fifty eight eight fifty nine 
it was almost nine o'clock 
I was driving on the Boston_Road 
I was driving uh a nineteen ninety three Ford van 
we had just gone to a Home_Depot 
and  and uh she brought 
a bathroom  s
a bathroom  s
it was made out_of fiberglass 
and then I showed her a thirty foot long uh ladder uh that I bought one a couple of days before that for a hundred and fifty dollars less 
and uh then I started driving 
like I said on Boston_Road 
and I was going to um Yuno 
and um FirstnameG looked at me and she said 
 um turned right 
 and then try to put on your brakes 
and I wasn't going very fast anyway 
so  I managed to like not hit anything 
and I managed to turn right 
and uh I pulled off of the side of the road 
and uh I put on the brakes 
and I just kept on hanging on to the wheel like that ges
I was holding on to the wheel 
and then  uh and that was  that was 
I was really lucky because there were two or three nurses all driving by separate cars and a doctor 
and they all could see something was happening 
and they helped me open the door and put me on the ground 
and uh um then somebody  somebody uh with a smartphone called up uh an ambulance 
and uh they said 
 you're going to the hospital 
and uh after that I  d it took me a long time before I could say um Bay  uh Bay_State  or something like that 
and um you_know I was saying to myself um I said 
 obviously I feel pretty good 
 and they're taking me to  uh they're using an ambulance 
 and they're taking me to the hospital at Bay_State 
 and uh obviously there must be something wrong with me or else I wouldn't be going to uh a hospital in an ambulance 
and uh then I tried to say something to FirstnameG 
and then I couldn't say anything 
and then I couldn't say the right words 
I_mean  I knew what I could say but I couldn't say it 
and that's when I realized that  uh that I probably had a stroke 
I think that's ges 
have I said  said that before 
oh  okay head
 sure  okay 
uhhuh 
uhhuh 
um well  in the beginning there's uh a little girl 
and there's a cat 
and um I think that the little girl loves the cat 
it's a good friend 
I don't know if it's male or female 
and she'd like  she wanted to get  have the  uh the cat off of a tree 
it's up on the  on the uh tr træntʃu 
I can't say 
bræntsu 
bræntsɪzu 
bræntsu 
okay  uh so  she asked her father if he could use a ladder and to go up to the tree and get the cat 
and then a ladder fell down 
maybe in the beginning the little dog scared the cat up the tree and tried to get away to this  far away as possible 
um either that or um the  the dog wished the father hadn't fallen down the ladder laughs 
so  then there's a bird 
um I don't know how  what the  the  the bird is involved 
it's s s gonna  s it's  s it's making a song perhaps 
and uh there's uh another uh ladder that's involved with the firemen 
and they're trying to lift up the  uh they're gonna put the ladder back up on the tree and take his 
uh if the  if the cat was more important of_course the  the uh firemen would get the cat first and then the dir the  uh and then  then  uh then get the  uh the father down 
uh is there anything else 
yup 
yeah  you_know I  I uh 
that thing about the grand  that  about the  uh the grandmother 
I've forgotten what I should call  the right term to call the grandmother 
yeah  yeah 
oh  I can't look at it 
okay 
okay  the version 
okay 
um in the very beginning there's um a mother 
there are two  two daughters 
and uh I'm not sure 
there's another woman  young girl 
and she's a blonde 
and she has blue hi eyes 
and uh the  uh the two  the two daughters have dark hair 
and they're uh young then 
and then  uh then this continues in the future 
time is going on 
and the  uh the girls are much older 
and the two  uh two daughters are uh not very attractive 
and the blonde lady has  her hair's now kind_of light brown but her  you can still see her blue eyes 
and uh she's uh 
in the beginning I have no idea why that young  the blonde girl is there 
whether uh she's an  or she's like uh 
something happened to their family and they're just taking you  they're gonna uh live 
so  anyway I'm not sure about that 
so  um so  anyway she's like  um her friends are all other mice 
and uh the cat seems kind_of evil to me 
the cat's a_little evil 
there's a horse  there's a horse there 
there all these little  mi there are three or four mice 
and uh the  um they realize that uh there's  that they're going to  um there's a  k there's a king 
and he has a son 
and um they  they  wan they'd like to have a dance uh because they would like to marry the  uh the son who's probably a prince 
and uh so they invite everybody in the town 
I think 
or just people that have a_lot_of money and you_know the uh 
so  uh there's a litter 
and uh they could  they could go to uh a prawn 
not a prawn 
I'm not using the right xxx 
a dance ges 
it's gonna be a dance or something like that 
and uh the  uh the  bron the brown haired  the light brown haired blonde woman is like  she's very excited too 
she could probably go herself 
and she had uh her  br her  um she has a gown 
uh it's okay 
um and they're going to the dance that evening 
so  uh  that's gonna happen  I think 
so  then there's this  um there's this grandau grand  uh grand 
not a grand lady 
see the last time I said it I knew what her name was 
it's kind_of like um 
and the first time I said it was a magical grandmother 
but it isn't magical 
it's something else 
 but I've  I've forgotten what it was 
and  uh so  anyway  they said that uh with magic I could turn the  uh the horse and the pumpkin 
I don't know 
they didn't say anything about the pumpkin but I think I saw the movie a long time ago 
a pumpkin became a um 
ges I don't know what they call that 
it's not a truck 
anyway  the  uh the  uh the mice are gonna be part of the  uh on  this group of people that are going to the dance 
and the horse is beautiful 
and the  uh the thing she's gonna carry and  is v very interesting 
and then they  uh they go to the  d they go to the dance 
it's in the  f it's in  it's  it's getting  it's very  it's in the uh nine ten o'clock at night 
she's go  she's  uh she's dancing with the uh prince 
and she has  uh um her shoes are glass shoes 
and they're very small 
and um she realizes that uh at  n at twelve o'clock that uh all of the magical stuff is gonna be gone 
and uh she's gonna  so she  so um she um realizes that it's almost twelve o'clock 
and she  she get  she  t she uh runs away from the uh dance or whatever it is 
and uh she lost one of them one of the  uh the glasses  shoes 
and um so she's back at her  hou she's back at the house 
and where she's like us 
she just helps out 
and uh the um part of the um 
the king found the uh grass 
and uh they  everybody tries to put their feet in it 
and of_course the  uh the two daughters 
of_course it doesn't  it doesn't say that but I'm sure that's what happens 
everybody in the town they can't  they're too  they have  they're the  the  uh the glass shoe is  is all too  their  you_know their feet are too big 
and then the  uh the young useta be a blonde bl blue hair 
and they realized that she's really gonna be a princess 
and  uh and then 
and the other thing is  is that I'm confused about when she goes to the uh dance she has a kind_of uh a white pink dress 
but then she's at the  uh the dance and she's got a much nicer  it's a gown perhaps 
it's a really  it's white very beautiful 
and she's got the uh grass 
and  um and she runs away 
uh I don't know what happened to the  to that white gown 
she's got the uh pink and white one 
and she's back in her bathroom 
and then  you_know then she can fit the  uh the grass 
she  uh she's gonna be the one that  that uh the prince and the uh princess are gonna be married 
ges that's kind_of 
 you always say that 
oh  yeah head
oh  is that good 
 that's good 
good to do that
