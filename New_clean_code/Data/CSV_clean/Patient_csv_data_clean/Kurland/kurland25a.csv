well  I'm  I'm supposing that my speech is getting a_little better uh as  uh as time has gone by 
I think that um I can  especially when I'm at the beginning of the day I think I can speak fairly well at certain times 
I've been able in  uh in  in certain cases to uh discuss whole  um whole elaborate stories with  with other people 
uh and  s and sometimes they don't work quite as_well 
uh sometimes uh I can  I can get lost it's  talking to my brother or somebody like that and  uh and just hafta give up and  and  and stop 
at other times I can just yack away with my  my  uh my uh natural uh bullship 
so  sometimes I really feel like I can still talk myself perfectly well 
uh but then s things foul  foul  get fouled and fouled up uh or they just uh start to getting snafuednv from time to time 
but periodically I can surprise people by sounding pretty normal shrugs 
uh it was actually very  very charming 
um I  I was  I was uh just sitting around in my  in my house 
not  I wasn't feeling very well because I'd been about  had about ten  ten  ten days of not feeling particularly great 
and all_of_a_sudden every  something seemed to be terribly wrong 
I said 
 hm I  d I really don't know what that is 
but first I  I called the  uh the ambulance immediately 
then I went and got myself a little valise ges and gathered all my things together 
and uh then I  I  uh I put a couple of things in my  in my  uh uh in my dresser like for example my uh wedding ring and stuff like that just to get  to get them out_of the  out_of the way 
uh and then I  ch I  I  took  uh uh b I  I had uh uh an email I was  I worked on 
I got  ov I got about four people little  just little uh emails saying 
 I'm going to hafta go to the hospital 
and then uh I went o out f of that and  and stood outside waiting for the uh hospital 
and the  uh the  uh the  uh the  the uh uh e_m_t looked at it 
 okay who's  who's  who's here with the  uh who's here with the hospital for the  the ambulance here 
and I said 
 that would be me head
and uh so  and then I helped myself out to the uh place 
and that was the last thing I saw 
yeah  no  I was really ve very  very  uh I was very uh uh laughs 
yeah  I just got it all right 
and the minute the uh e_m_t came out that was the end 
I  I was lost 
I remember  I remember it uh at the beginning of uh 
I can't remember the name of that  that stupid place 
I  it was uh 
what's the name of that place 
ugh I had three different uh rehabs 
and  uh and I  and they  they got me going away  uh very quickly 
uh where most of the time head
uh a_lot_of it was like uh talking but some of it was also just uh uh walking around 
but then I can't remember anything about Cooley_Dick at all head
I t have no idea 
and that was about s seven weeks or something like that 
I have no idea of  of anything of  of Cooley_Dick at all uh except for my last  uh my last uh uh um trip to  to Cooley_Dick 
before that I  I have no idea 
so  uh my friends once in awhile they'll tell me all these ridiculous things that I did and  and silly  silly things that I was trying to say and failing to say 
but uh I had nothing 
absolutely nothing 
Cooley_Dick was just a  a  voi a void 
yeah 
it v was very strange 
and somehow I came to um at  um at this place in uh 
I  f I  it's terrible to forget the name of the place 
but uh it was about twelve weeks 
no 
twelve days 
twelve days head
it was good 
it was very good place 
something that was meaningful 
hm let's see if I had any meaningful days laughs 
let's think now 
meaningful day 
uh hm  that's a  that's a toughie 
I guess probably one  one meaningful uh day in my life must've been my daughter's birth and  uh my daughter's uh growth and development 
and  uh and s uh enjoying the  uh the  the  uh the  enjoying the  uh the  the s uh amazingness of it  of it as she was growing up head
so  that was something that  uh that was  ges uh was always changing and was always different

alright 
um Cinderella i is  uh uh is  is uh a stepsister of  of two beastly uh creatures who are the  uh the uh 
Cinderella is the  s s the step  stepchild of two beastly creatures who are uh living in this castle  s
and uh they treat her very badly 
and she hasta  to do all kinds of terrible chores uh while they who do nothing at all completely are  are sitting  uh sitting around and scowling at poor Cinderella who hasta do all the shit work 
um around that time 
no notice the  the  laughs how quickly this is gonna move 
uh out_of that partel uh point uh uh the  the hideous  uh the hideous uh stepsis s uh step stepparents who are  uh who are uh uh living in the house uh are  uh uh uh are  um are  are  uh  w were uh imbr imbro xxx  were in invited to  uh to uh give a special  a special uh feast for uh all of the the nasty  uh all of these  the  uh all of these uh fabulous creatures that were living in this  in the magical uh place 
now Cinderella really would've loved to go to  um to go to the  uh to the uh 
Cinderella would've gladly come to uh with  to be with all of the other uh creatures who got to be there in that wonderful place 
uh but uh uh she of_course was not allowed to come 
then her fairy godmother uh showed  showed her uh uh a whole pile of Versace that she looked really good at 
and  uh and  and for a little bit of awhile she was allowed to go with these creatures while um all kinds of  of extraordinary  uh uh uh kinds of extraordinary uh uh oh oh coachmen  coachmen were riding through all of this place 
the  pin the prince who was necessarily unhappy with the scabrous looking women that were  that were uh hanging around in his house decided that  uh that  that Cinderella was really much  much more charming and wondrous than she had knew  she had thought herself 
and so she 
 who is this Cinderella 
but at that point the  uh it became clear that the  uh that the  the  the belle of the ball  the  the  the  uh the  uh the 
at that  it cl 
try it again 
uh at that point it became clear that midnight was over and the magical uh creatures that were riding in her  uh in her  uh in her castle disappeared 
and uh then  uh the  the  the horrible creatures that were living in the place looked around and said 
 we don't know who that person was that  uh who was uh living in there 
they  they had no i idea who looked so wonderful in this Versace 
when  hin and then at that point one of the  uh the uh k k uh 
one of the  uh the curt courtiers came out with  uh with  uh with uh creatures looking for real  uh for some kind of  uh for some kind of a  of a  uh a s 
the  the courtiers wanted to find Cinderella but they could not find her 
so  uh eventually the  the two scabrous and hein heinous creatures who looked  uh looked around the  uh the palace uh discovered that there  that noone was available to them 
they said 
 why don't we try Cinderella and see if she might just happen to fit the magical  uh s uh uh the magical 
what  what's that thing called 
the magical um Versace that she's in 
and so they looked at her and said 
 that's her altogether 
you_know  that she is the one that we were all looking for 
and of_course the  the scabrous and nasty creatures were uh horrified that Cinderella would  would've been the other person that they were  that they were uh looking for 
at that point the courtier brou brought Cinderella over 
and  uh and she  uh she just  she was  um she got mah massive amounts of money for the  for the rest of her life because she got to stay with the prince 
is that good enough
