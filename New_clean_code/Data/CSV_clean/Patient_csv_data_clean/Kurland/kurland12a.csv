but I'm still able to communicate good enough that I can  get my point across to people 
if not then  w then we puck 
but I feel f p fairly good head
I remember 
um well  it was in the morning 
um I was getting up uh to go to work 
and I felt  um  I felt something uh I don't know what it was inside 
uh and it felt ges
like I  I  I couldn't quite get myself together  pull myself together and  and get out_of bed 
and  um  uh and  and I  uh my  my wife FirstnameL called the doctor 
uh and we lived in an apartment in uh uh western  ma in  wes in uh eastern Massachusetts outside Boston 
and I said 
 no 
 no needta do that 
and I got up and uh cries wipes
then I got up and fell 
uh and from that point I started 
well  then I guess  uh it was a uh stroke 
uh and then I  then I just basically remember uh I was awake 
uh I  I  c I couldn't move 
yeah  head
and uh she called the doctor cries 
oh and  and they came 
and  and doctors came 
uh the ambulance 
and  and  uh and xxx 
I went from the third floor down  downstairs i in a stretcher and uh then w went on to the hospital 
and she followed in a car uh a and went kinda crazy all that uh  time 
uh I remember bits and pieces uh but don't remem remember anything per_se from that point 
yeah 
yeah  I  I   I really don't remember a heck of a_lot 
uh they cook 
uh and I remember basically being there 
uh couldn't speak and  and anything 
it was cries 
well remember  the  being up there in the e_r in the room 
uh and trying to get me outa that room into another room 
uh I was there two or three days in that one room 
uh then they were favor  then they were uh able to direct me to another room 
uh to uh two  two rooms 
two  two  two people in the same room 
um  and I  I was in there 
uh you_know  and I say I getting more  a_little better each day 
and I transferred 
and I remember I stayed in that room 
and uh people come in and  and taking care of me 
uh and they were  looking to get me out and transferred to the  uh the rehabilitation center  down there in Boston 
uh and they did that 
I forget   I forget  the amount of time I was in that room but it wasn't that long 
a short period of time 
and then I got transferred out to that rehabilitation center 
and from there uh things goo were all better as they went on 
uh I was dealing with uh speech 
to  to get me speaking 
to get  to  to  uh to get me up and moving 
uh everything 
they wasn't  it didn't have  they wanted to come and talk to me about and  and work on it

uh eventually I had the  t uh the stomach uh feeder uh capped off and then was feeding myself 
yeah  head
yeah  it was still feeding when I went in 
and then it finally dropped off 
uh and then I fed myself

and unfortunately soft 
they don't kick them on the ground 
they  they kick up in the air 
and what happened he kicked it here 
and the first thing that it did was it fell through the window 
and soft 
now hard plastic doesn't give versus the window does give 
especially if it's uh a nonbreakable window 
then it'll break and that's what it happened to do 
and it did  b broke through that window 
and when it did it broke so_that the ball came in 
and the guy that was living in the hou
the ball came down in his lap 
right on top of him 
that caused him feel a little bit  upset about the situation 
he stood up 
and he stared out the window

I don't  I don't use umbrellas 
I walk head
and I stepped outside 
and I go to walk 
and  and I'm walking 
and  and I'm getting wet looks
and I'm starting to think to myself 
 you_know if I get the umbrella and I maybe to walk the back route I won't hafta worry about the world  about other guys seeing me carrying an umbrella 
so  I walk back to the house 
I ask mom
