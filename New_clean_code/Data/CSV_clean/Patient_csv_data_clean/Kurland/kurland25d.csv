oh 
mhm 
that's an interesting question  isn't it 
well um it seemed  it  it probably  presumably you could actually do this on  on a  on a uh uh less high tech 
but it is nice to have 
and uh it  it  it has several different functions 
one is the uh um 
what do you call that thing 
um know yourself 
uh that  the  uh the thing we always talk to together 
um the 
 go to meeting  yeah 
that's one  one thing 
then there's uh t s the stɑprɑwɑtʃu 
and there's the  uh the  uh the  the  the  the basic media of the  of the thing 
so  it has a_lot_of different uh uses I think 
so  it  I guess it's  it's probably exactly what you need for your 
well  I_mean  sure 
because you_know something got  bet got better here through the  through the whole operation uh  I think 
you_know  it certainly seems that's  that seems to be the case because I was really flailing there at the beginning 
and  um and then I flailed again when  when I was trying not to look at the  at the uh uh letters 
you_know  just  I would  I would just push it ges
so  uh that  and that seems to have been the second way to help  help myself here 
is  uh because then I  I could get to the point where I could sort_of write these things a little bit 
um and  and actually everyday this is getting a little better now 
I'm still using the  uh u using the  uh the whatchamacallit 
the  the uh 
y yes 
uh yeah  the  wi the Ipad's great actually 
it works perfectly well 
and I do really like ipa Ipads as a  as a genre 
god_damn  this is like literature or something 
ready 
alright 
girl has lost her kitten which is now  uh now um going to the  uh is now sitting in the  the tree 
uh dad would like to get the kitty back but can't get it  get it 
um and apparently also the ladder was no use uh in the  in dad trying to get these things from the  uh the child 
uh as if to make matters worth 
uh a bird's twittering 
before things really got out_of hand the fireman came and got the and  were about to get  uh get  uh get  get the  uh get the uh kitty back from the  the fire persons 
not great but 
it's not Goethe  you_know 
oh  that again 
probably 
mhm 
okay 
oh  really 
mhm 
hm
let's try to see 
a young orphan was uh brought to uh the house to live with two  uh there  where  where two uh odious women were  laughs where two odious women were uh holding forth 
when they began  uh at  at the very beginning the  uh uh Cinderella as uh her  her name would  s would be known later uh was now just a  uh a kind of a servant waiting  waiting on these two women and their foul mother 
Cinderella noticed the  the beautiful  uh the beautiful uh 
try again 
Cinderella saw that the prince's uh castle gleaming in the distance 
at last uh a party was  was  uh at last the party was uh 
the king had asked uh p a p party to be uh uh 
no  I can't  can't do this laughs 
the king  set a party 
it sent 
I'll try this again 
the king had  had  a  s had a party uh where the  uh all of the  the uh uh beautiful women could be  could be uh known to the  uh to the prince who would be  who  who would uh find himself uh uh a  uh um a  uh find himself a uh per person laughs 
um  where the  the young prince could meet all of the other women that were around in the valley 
Cinderella would gladly have taken  had  had uh gone to that party except she was not allowed 
the two uh uh hideous women were all deck  decked up looking their very best 
uh but Cinderella was not allowed to go 
at that point a fairy godmomother 
here uh the  uh the two uh women who lived in in  the house were  were not very attractive 
uh and the prince was not much interested in them 
but in turn  in time he discovered that Cinderella was uh really quite charming and delightful 
and he would gladly have asked her to be there a bit  a bit longer 
but uh then came uh the stroke of midnight 
and she  uh she got back her  her  her  uh she got back to her  uh her  um to her  to her room and had a wonderful time 
the prince there would  would s still had not found the  uh the  the  the  uh the perfect woman that he adored 
so  uh several people started looking around to see them uh and to decide which one was really  Cinder was like  cin which one was the one that Cinderella really wanted 
one after another several of these terrible creatures uh proved that she could not  f she could not f uh fill  fit the  the  uh the  uh she couldn't fit the  uh the portions  the  the  uh could not fit the um 
lemme try it  try it again 
all of the  the other women in the castle were not  uh were  were too uh big and could not be  uh could not be  could not  c could not get the  the  uh the  the  the size of the  uh of the  of the shoe that they were trying to find 
but the shoe uh fit Cinderella perfectly 
at that point the  uh the prince then was brought to the castle 
and they were married immediately and uh lived happily ever after 
why is that so hard 
sort_of 
yeah
