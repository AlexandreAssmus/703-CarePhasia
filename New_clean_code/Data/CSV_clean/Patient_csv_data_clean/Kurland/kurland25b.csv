certainly 
yes  I think I was sposta  I think I  h uh I had dropped my um 
no  that's a good question 
I think I dropped my daughter 
and I  I went home to uh South_Deerfield 
and FirstnameP was there 
and uh I  I  we had things we were gonna do later in the day 
but all_of_a_sudden as I was driving I heard uh some chaos and commotion going off in the  by the radio 
and I went down and  uh and sat there and said 
 what's going on here 
and  and then I went up to  uh to uh FirstnameP who was getting dressed 
I said 
 uh FirstnameP  I think some kind of disaster has fall  befallen the world 
 and uh you should come down and look at it 
so  I went out and we had a  to the tv and  and started looking at it 
once it  once it started it was like you just hadta stop and look at it 
there was nʌsɪŋu 
and uh my uh uh managing editor at the Review uh who at that  at that time was  was uh uh living nearby came over too 
so  the three of us just sat around and  and watched 
but I think a nothing else happened that day 
I think we just shut it all down and  and just s sat there and began to try to deal with it a little bit 
but it was an extraordinary day because that was when the  uh the two towers uh fell down one after another 
and it was  it was amazing to just sit there 
then one of them the  the smoke would go over it and imit
 I  I just couldn't believe my eyes actually just you_know because uh you_know I'm  f I'm from New_York 
and I've  I've spent  I know what all that stuff is like and uh shrugs 
head
that was pretty much it 
I think we just sat there and  and  the three of us 
 then I got my  then I got my daughter 
and we hadta just  we had  I hadta explain to her what  how  what happened 
that was tough 
mhm 
okay 
uh Otto was playing soccer and kicked the ball much harder than he expected 
the  uh the ball uh broke the  the  the glass of uh Mister_McGregor's house and kicked his  and bumped his own  his uh ball  s
at this point Mister_McGregor came out uh very angry and upset by the destruction of his property 
okay 
 Patricia told her daughter to 
uh her  her son 
I guess it's a son 
Patricia told her son to uh make sure to get uh an umbrella today because it might very well rain 
however  young Ants said 
 no I really don't wanna have an umbrella with me today 
 and I don't think it's going to be particularly rainy 
so  Ants was on his way to school when eventually he began seeing the uh dribble drops of the  uh of the  uh the rain as it proceeded 
in_fact  the rain got very heavy 
and  uh and uh he hadta return to his house where his  uh his  uh uh uh his 
who's she  she 
his  uh uh when his  uh dai when his daughter 
 I told you before Ants 
 you're sposta take care of your  your clothes and get  uh and be careful of the rain before the rain comes out 
then young Ants carried  uh carried his  carried himself uh with a nice umbrella to  uh to get to school in the morning 
you're right 
yeah  yeah  that's it 
it's true 
oh yeah this 
it was a terribly busy day here in  uh in Woodbrook 
uh the cat was  uh had  had treedv itself in today  in the  uh in  in the early afternoon 
and young uh Polly was uh trying very hard to  uh to  to get the cat uh treedv before uh it  it tried to get even farther into the  uh into the tree itself 
uh dad uh uh attempted to get the tree 
and he couldn't get out  get the  the  uh he couldn't get the  uh the  the  the tree 
he couldn't get the tree together for himself 
uh so  here  uh the  there  there was no point by  of trying to get the ladder because uh dad just couldn't get it up 
and there it was 
the dog was of_course as dogs always do began to  uh to bark and bark furiously which of_course made the cat even more perturbed 
uh by this time they hadta actually call a fireman uh to get the cat back 
and uh the  the  the thing had a  a happy ending with a twittering bird 
oh yeah 
hm
laughs okay 
once upon a time uh the children were astounded to see that there was a new child uh magically appearing from somewhere 
uh though where she was  she  she came from noone seemed to know 
uh mother was very  mom  her  her mother was very angry with that idea and thought well I suppose uh that Cinderella can simply be a servant uh this  for her  for herself and for her own two daughters 
uh and sure enough that's what Cinderella mostly did 
she  mos she mostly worked terribly 
and uh as she was  and  and uh the  uh the other three daughters were of_course uh hideous and  uh and  and vicious 
and they  uh they were of  they were  uh they  they  uh they  they  they really  they didn't stay  in the  in the  uh in  they didn't sit  stay in the  in the uh uh 
it's not the apartment 
anyway they  they  they had uh a quiet  they had another spot a sort_of servant's quarters uh that they hadta  hadta keep 
um it was a  it was a beautiful uh day 
there was a  there was a  you could see the  uh the  uh the king's castle look  uh looking  uh uh kind_of twinkling in  in everybody's eyes as  uh as they looked besides 
but luckily there was something that  that  uh that helped Cinderella during this time 
mostly uh some rodents that  uh that appeared uh con constantly in  in  in  in what would've been I guess a very needed  would've needed  a  uh um a uh laughs uh 
oops can't do it never mind 
let's forget that part 
uh and also there was a horse lying around and I think  maybe a dog as_well 
at that point um the two uh other daughters of  s of  uh of their mother uh heard that there was going to be uh a special ball today uh presumably for the prince's uh birthday or something like that 
and there um Cinderella thought 
 oh  this is going to be fun 
and she got  she got the  a little  uh a little dress herself 
and yet the two nasty daughters said 
 no  she's not going to come 
 she can't stay 
she's a servant you_know 
and they are  they were the hautesadj old bourgeoisiesn of the place 
so  they said 
 fine 
and there was just no  no  uh no point in  in her being here 
fortunately for Cinderella who would've been no doubt weeping uh in  for  uh for the  the misery of not being at the  uh at the castle uh uh s sin Cinderella had a fairy godmothmother 
and uh she said 
 wow fine 
 I have a  uh I have uh a special uh place that you can do 
y I will get your  uh I will get you a beautiful uh uh dress 
 so  you can  you can  uh uh come  you can  f you can uh join with  with it  with me 
 and uh then uh I have also uh c uh a uh magic uh uh 
here comes trouble 
um  coach 
uh a magic coach that  uh that  that you can ride 
and sure enough there were also two beautiful horses that were not like the mangy old horses that Cinderella knew 
uh they move then to the  uh the  the beginning of the  of the  uh of the ball 
and uh all_of_a_sudden uh the  uh the prince's 
and she danced with him 
and they danced the  the ball together uh happily for uh many time  many hours 
however  Cinderella also hadta uh stop because uh the  uh i in the  in the  at the  cr at the  at the croak 
laughs no xxx 
at the  at the croak 
and  uh and so she hadta walk back from  from the  uh the  the  uh the  the  the  she  she had t to walk  uh she hadta drive back 
but all_of_a_sudden  uh but at that point she also no longer had her beautiful uh gown 
at this point the  uh uh the king 
 who is this beautiful 
uh this  the  the  this  the prince said to the king 
 who is this beautiful woman 
 I must find her 
and they looked all around uh to try to  to discover her but uh she  th they  they couldn't or not readily 
eventually they came up to the  to the  uh the place where uh Cinderella uh 
no  no  sorry 
where the  the two nasty creatures that normally habat inhabited the place uh would  uh would have their  uh would have their  their missing uh slipper 
uh and uh they tried each one 
and the  these  n these nasty creatures were unable to  uh to  uh to  to  s to fit with the  uh laughs were unable to  to  to  to fit the slipper 
uh however Cinderella was 
and uh they were uh delighted to be able to discover her 
and they brought her back to the castle where she  uh she uh uh eventually uh  lived there and  uh and married with the king 
that was sloppy work 
I should've done better with that really 
yes 
first I would  I would get some bread 
um and then I would probably um get some butter and slop the bread out 
and then I would  I would get some uh I would say uh uh probably jelly 
I'd slop the  the jelly in 
I'd  I'd bring it all back hands
then I will  c would cut the other uh portions of it 
then I'd eat it up
