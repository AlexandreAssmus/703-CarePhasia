had a m_r_i and it showed that I definitely had a right temporal stroke 
so  that  and after that I  um I had another one in um

but that was an occipital stroke 
and then I had  to go to the hospital and have heart surgery  head
and in two thousand ten I had um 
it's like I actually had three strokes in two thousand nine and then three in  uh  in uh
