well  if I hadta you_know say uh I was a ten before the stroke I'd say probably maybe a five or six you_know post stroke 
oh yeah very well 
yeah  head
and uh I  I went for a ride in my truck with my  my littlest my  my boy 
he was uh about fifteen years old then 
he was  um he had Down_syndrome so he wasn't fifteen laughs probably like four or five you_know 
 mentally 
and we  we went for a ride 
and uh during the ride s something you_know came over me 
and you_know I  I couldn't  I couldn't uh think straight 
and I  I'll never forget 
I  um um I was weakened on my right side my  my right hand shows
and uh a as it turned out my speech was about  uh about  about two on a scale of one to ten maybe even a  even a one 
and then I was  I came home 
and I  w I went in the house 
and uh I sat down 
it was about three o'clock three thirty 
and um on my left I have a chair  taps
and  and on the left I kept my phone taps
and it was  my wife was sitting points
and the phone rang 
and I knew uh I had something wrong 
so  I  I grabbed the phone ges
I  I couldn't even get you_know anything more than h you_know hello out 
and the person on the phone I  I  I t to this day I  I  I don't know who it was but she said 
 Firstname  are you alright 
and I said 
 no  I  something  something's wrong 
and she said 
 I think you had a stroke 
and  but sh she was  you_know she put me over to  so she asked f for  for my wife 
I  I hadn't talked to laughs my wife you_know because I didn't want her to know f that I was s s you_know not feeling right 
so  I thought it would go away to you_know ka continue to go to work and everything like that 
but  so  we went to uh the hospital um xxx 
uh  we went to the hospital uh Monday 
I tried going to work on  on Monday 
 I  I don't know why but I 
and I  I drove my truck from ha Hadley Mass 
laughs it's about eighty miles away 
and on the  on the way out it uh kept drifting to the right ges
you_know  f th the rubber strips you_know on the interstate 
and they  I went off the road down in sɪzbɛriu 
and at that point there I decided I  f I got something wrong with me you_know s more than s s you_know a good night's sleep is gonna you_know kɜu 
so  I  uh I went home and that's  that's points
s s s Sunday I didn't say anything hand
on Monday I told my wife laughs 
you_know  and I went to the hospital 
and you_know since it was already you_know a whole day you_know I found out that if you go to  th th to the doctor's within three hours of you_know your stroke they have a chance to change the course or you_know reverse it whatever 
anyways  the horses are out_of  out_of the barn by the time I said anything 
and uh I took the m_r_is 
and you_know I went s s through speech therapy and you_know uh 
there's two other types of 
I'm trying to think 
but those lasted a very short time 
but s s speech therapy you_know lasted like three or four months 
and finally uh my uh therapist said you_know 
 I think you've reached the  your plateau ges
and  uh and uh you_know I was re released 
and  um  and pretty much you_know she was right 
it  I  I plateaued you_know after six months 
and now it's six and a half years later and I'm still ges
 well  um one thing that's uh was f k quite clear I was very tired 
so  I z useta get like six hours sleep at night you_know when I was working 
I probably went to uh nine hours you_know and  with a  a nap in the afternoon for like a half an hour 
uh I  uh  in my therapy you_know I  sh sh I told ges
and she uh tried to help me with  with that 
and the only way I could  uh I could really function I could  I could  I could y y y y use the cue cards hand
or I could uh have written on paper you_know like  uh like uh canned speech 
but I  I  I was not able to uh really talk you_know like one on one like you're  you and I are doing right now 
you_know 
uh just  uh uh  the best way I can describe things um if  if I was a thirty five uh r_p_m record you_know I was trying to talk to a seventy eight r_p_m record you_know 
I just couldn't get on the save 
and uh it  it's not quite so bad you_know individually but when I talk to a  b a bunch of people in a  n a noisy room and just you_know ges noise from all directions uh I just wanna be out_of the  uh out_of the scene 
uh very much like downstairs points
it's getting bigger laughs 
well  I have had many things happen but uh uh I'll tell you one th that  that involves my stroke xxx 
clears
and uh my fiscal year ended uh October first you_know f f f for my s selling and stuff 
and anyways I said 
well  May June July fingers
I had like five months to go 
and I was  uh I was  uh I  I had done all of my categories 
so  I  I  I won a trip to uh Caro_Springs 
and uh and I had a stroke 
and anyways my  uh my wife hand
but uh I took my oldest son 
 and  clears
um clears
and that's another thing uh 
I never useta cry 
but uh you_know it's just something that they say that  that added benefit or a loss whatever that came along with the stroke 
 and uh that's  you_know as you can see it's uh k k continued to stay with me 
yeah  it's crazy  yeah 
I can hear uh Amazing_Grace at a funeral and hands
don't ask me why 
 yeah  v it's very weird laughs 
because you_know I'd be able to be cracking a joke for me or something during you_know  you_know the playing of Amazing_Grace 
but you_know it  j you_know it's just very  uh very awkward 
well  laughs it  it happens too  too often 
and uh you_know watching a tv show you_know 
it might be something stupid like the Bachelorette hand
laughs if I come in and my wife's watching a show and uh you_know if they have a little sin sɛnɪməlu 
and I don't like the show anyways laughs but I just  you_know I can't get over it you_know 
it's  it's  it's really  s it's very dumb 
well  a  a bunch of my female friends said 
 well  it makes you um a cuter guy 
whatever laughs hand
 no 
yup 
so  n now you know laughs 
alright 
alright 
well  this comes uh r right home to roost because I played soccer for  for Umass 
and uh the first picture shows a  a young guy playing soccer 
he kicks the ball 
and uh he must be f too close to the house because uh he put the ball right through the window laughs 
and uh as luck would have it the homeowner was sitting right by the window that got smashed 
and he knocked the window 
so  he did ks considerable damage  I guess 
and uh the last p uh picture shows the homeowner you_know holding the soccer ball and looking out the  at the guy 
so  I can only imagine what happened on the fi fi f if the  fifth f picture if there was one 
 well  I guess it shows a woman and uh probably her son 
and he wants to go outside  I guess 
and she says 
 take your br umbrella you_know before you go 
and he's  he didn't wanna take it 
and she offered it to him twice  I guess 
and uh he still didn't take it 
he goes outside 
and the third picture shows him getting drenched 
and the  the fourth picture shows him getting drenched even worse you_know 
so  he comes back inside soaking wet 
and the mother says 
 I probably told you so 
and the last picture shows him with a umbrella like he shoulda had in the first place 
alright 
well  evidently the cat climbed the tree 
and as cats are prone to do it couldn't get down from the tree 
and uh a homeowner or somebody you_know uh a male tried to get up the tree and he couldn't get s the cat down either 
the girl's crying for her cat 
uh oh  the reason the guy can't g get down is because his ladder fell down laughs 
so  he's stuck in the tree 
and the dog uh you_know bark 
so  I guess we know why the cat is up in the tree 
and anyways uh way to the right it shows the fire department coming to get the cat down from the tree and the guy 
this  this is this wanted 
yeah head
well  my son laughs watched Cinderella quite often 
he  he watches 
 he  he watches all  all the Disney movies you_know over and over again 
and I  I mean over and over again no not once or twice I mean 
forty fifty times yeah 
laughs I know most of them yeah 
well  I  I watched s so many movies with him uh Cinderella might  uh might involve uh some other s story too but 
 yeah 
 okay 
it won't take long 
oh yeah laughs 
I'm gonna give you m my version and it's gonna be laughs very short 
 but uh it starts off with a young girl 
I think she has two sisters maybe 
and she's the least favorite of  of  of  of the  the three even_though she's the  you_know the knockout of the three laughs 
laughs her mother's uh even worse 
sh sh sh you_know I  I k s compare her with the evil g godmother 
anyways uh don't laugh laughs 
anyways she wanted to go to the ball 
and she couldn't go to the ball 
but sh s somehow f sh she got t it  to go to s the ball 
and anyways at  at the ball there was a prince there 
and uh I think he had uh a slipper 
and he tried the slipper on the  every  every girl there 
and uh as luck would have it Cinderella you_know fit into s the shoe 
and anyways uh I hope I'm telling it right laughs 
so  I think uh you_know they're happy ever after 
the end laughs 
that's pretty easy 
I would take uh the bread out_of the icebox 
and I use only Arnold's uh whole grain breads because that's healthier for my son 
I can  I can tell you this because I've b b b been making b uh lunches for like six months now 
and every Tuesday he has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
but anyways uh uh I get him a whole piece of  two pieces of whole grain bread 
lay them on the  the ges
and on one I put the grape jelly head
he loves grape 
and then I put uh Skippy smooth spread uh on the other side 
and I ges
and I cut him four pieces ges
and then I uh have uh little bags that I you_know put it in 
and then I  I close the  the sandwich in the bag 
and  I'm ready to go
