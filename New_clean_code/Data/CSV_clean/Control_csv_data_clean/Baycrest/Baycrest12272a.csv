right 
so  I guess one of the biggest impacts that was  affected me
and it changed our whole family dynamics and business relationship
and um you_know it changed the way we were operating our business
and it forced us to do certain things 
and it forced me to 
because I was the primary um caregiver for him um against my
I have three other sibs 
so  this ended up being where I had the ultimate medical
and it turned out that it was eighteen years that it lasted 
and like the  he's  he lived for another eighteen years 
and all the ups and downs of all of that was very interesting time

and the guy stood up and looked out and started yelling at the
so  the mother wanted the little kid to take the  el uh the
and the little kid didn't take the umbrella 
he waved his mother goodbye 
he got outside 
it started to rain 
it was rainy 
he was walking in the puddles 
he finally went home drenched to his mother 
and the next day he went out with an umbrella 
well  it looks like the man climbed up the tree to get the cat
