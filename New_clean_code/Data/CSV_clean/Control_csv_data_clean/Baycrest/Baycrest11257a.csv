okay  I was running to my class at the university  to my finance
next thing I knew I woke up  looked at my wristwatch 
it was still on 
shockproof by the way 
it said eight twenty 
and the clock on the wall said five to nine 
so  I assumed something had happened 
yes  something had happened 
I had two broken legs 
and I was in the hospital emergency 
uh I remained there for three and a half months and was able to
and walking down the hall I lost my balance on my crutches 
and I put my bad leg down on the floor and broke it again 
uh and then they took me back to bed with a wheelchair 
and I got into bed 
and the nurse came in 
and I said 
 am I going to the operating room 
and she said 
 yes 
and I went to the operating room was put in a body cast from under
and I had to remain in that for another eight weeks 
and I finally got out_of bed and learned to walk again of_course 
because you can't walk when you're in bed for that long 
I came out_of the hospital 
my accident was October twelfth 
came outta the hospital March twenty ninth 
and that night I went to university to write a test 
so  um and then I hafta really learn to walk because I was
and I learned to walk 
and now I walk all over the city of Toronto and in Miami_Beach all
and while in the hospital they would bring ambulatory patients to
disregarding that except_for going for xrays I was in this room at
but I took the approach that there's nothing  when you 
move on 
and make the best of the situation 
so  the highlight of my day was watching Jeopardy 
yeah 
well  you know there's nothing 
I'm not  not to say 
I  I walk around 
I have pain in my leg 
but that's not gonna  it's gonna be there 
so  I can't ruin my life with it INV
I get up in the morning before seven  go to the corner  get the
the articles are short 
but it tells you just as much as a major newspaper 
uh throat
and we have little talk 
and the superintendent comes 
and a couple of other residents come 
and we talk for a little while 
and then I go upstairs 
and I do 
after I re flip through the paper I do the Sudoku and the
and I usually get the whole puzzle 
and uh then I will go and check the stock market on the internet
and depending on the day I usually meet somebody either for lunch
but it depends on the day 
and I belong to an investment club 
so  I kind_of look if there's anything I think they should know
since I'm the accountant in the group that I should be explaining
and uh then if I went out for lunch I will have dinner at home 
or I will go over to former neighbor who lives in a retirement home
and somebody gave her the crossword  the jigsaw puzzle from
and she's not capable 
she's eighty seven 
she can't do it 
so  I go over there 
and my goal is to finish it before I leave for Florida in laughs
so  whenever I have a night that I'm not doing anything I'll go
mhm 
okay  this boy is playing with his ball 
and he kicks it 
and it goes through the window of somebody's house and lands in the
and the man finds the ball and then come  is now looking out

so  she doesn't take it 
and of_course it starts raining 
and then she runs back all wet 
I think it's a 
now in some it looked like a little girl but I think it's a little
and runs back to get the umbrella 
and then walks with the umbrella after getting all wet anyways 
okay 
there's a cat caught in the tree 
the dog is trying to get to the cats 
looks like the father of the little girl is trying to get to the
but he can't because the cat's all the way out on a branch 
but guess what 
to the rescue come the firecommen 
and they have a ladder 
and they're going to  obviously looks like they'll solve the
uh Cinderella lived in a house with her three stepsisters 
and they treated her very mean 
and she cleaned the house 
and they just gave her orders and told her what to do 
and they were all going to a ball 
and she wanted to go to 0det ball 
and her fairy godmother came and dressed her in a beautiful dress 
and she went to the ball 
and  um and then at the ball she was dancing with the prince 
and she hadta be back by midnight 
so  she hadta run out 
and when she ran out she lost her slipper 
and the prince was so enamored with her that the next day he went
and he came to her house 
and of_course her stepsisters said that she wasn't the one 
but he did try it on 
and it fit her 
and they lived happily ever after
