okay 
okay so  um there's so many to choose from 
I just hafta try and fix my memory on one 
so  I remember it was a day kind_of like this but not so rainy 
and it was my first trip to Hong_Kong 
and I was on a work trip 
and I was tired because I'd flown all night and everything 
and  but I decided I was gonna go out sightseeing 
and I did go out 
and I went to the top of the peak in Hong_Kong 
and I looked around at the vista and saw the beautiful landscapes 
and I remember saying 
 thank_you Manulife 
because that was the company I worked for at the time
that I wouldn't have been there had it not been for that work
so  I felt a great deal of gratefulness and happiness  although I
oh I'm not sure there is such a thing as a typical day 
but um get up in the morning and have a shower and get ready for
and then usually my husband and I have breakfast together 
and we figure out who's doing what during the day 
and  for example  this morning 
one of my hobbies is I grow orchids 
so  this morning at the breakfast table we were surrounded by all
and it was you_know a miserable dull day outside 
but inside it was bright and very pretty INV
so  after we discuss who's doing what  who's doing what
I might have a study to go to 
um call people who are not well and see how they're doing 
and prepare a meal for the evening 
uh maybe some housework that needs to be done 
and then um in the evening I have a lecture to go to 
so  that's kind_of a typical 
if there is such a thing 
I'm tired at the end of the day 
mhm

the dog chased the cat up the tree 
the bird was caught by the worm

bad weather was caused by long airplane delays
