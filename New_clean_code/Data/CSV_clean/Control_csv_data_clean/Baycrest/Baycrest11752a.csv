oh okay 
um I guess the  one of the earliest memories that I have is
it was a wonderful experience because uh I was living in a small
and there wasn't the opportunity to partake in any sort of
but at this camp it was wonderful because they had sports 
um they had rowing 
and they also had arts and handicrafts  music theater which I
um and so  that gave us the opportunity to have a really full
and also what I really laughs enjoyed was the fact that they
uh we could eat we if we wanted 
if we didn't feel like eating we didn't hafta eat 
there was never anybody saying that you_know you weren't allowed
so  that was  I was in uh my glory because I would have
and that was enough for me 
um also um we uh resided in these cabins uh in the woods 
and every morning the uh counselors would take us swimming before
and it was always really  really chilly in the morning 
and so  this whole cabin full of girls would run down these docks
and this lake was extremely cold cold cold water 
I don't know 
I can't remember if it was the time of the year that we useta go to
but it was always freezing cold 
and there were all these blood suckers in the lake laughs 
used to attach themselves to your leg 
of_course suck on your blood 
and that the only way that you could get them off is  was if
and then you could pull them off your  your leg 
um and then we'd all go back  get dressed and then go and have
and um in the evenings of_course you_know we useta sit around the
everybody used to sing songs and tell stories  ghost stories and
and then um you_know that would be the end of the day 
and it was just  it was glorious 
I just  I loved camp 
um and arts and crafts was really good 
we  they always had lots_of materials and uh somebody who had
and there's painting and things that we useta create with um wood
and then I_mean I think I was only there for a week 
but it seemed to me like it was an absolute eternity 
because the days were just so  so  so full 
and then at the end of the week you_know they'd bring in the school
uh I was living in Montreal at the time 
 go back to Montreal 
and I remember I cried all the way from the camp home because it
and I made such good  good friends and people that I really
and um once home I kept in contact with a_lot_of the people that
a_lot_of the  the girls that I met at the camp 
so  that was kind_of nice 
and then I went to you_know every year I'd go back to that same
I think it was for about five years in a row I went back 
and so you would meet the same people over  and  over and
so  it was  it was nice xxx 
every year it's you_know looking forward to seeing FirstnameE or
and um yeah those were  those were some really really really
it was just so nice to be away from the city and living in the
mhm 
laughs well  uh today  laughs today I'm here 
uh no  usually I've  uh I retired as_of last year 
um so  at the moment I'm involved in uh renovating our house 
we haven't done anything to the house in the last twenty five years
and when I first bought the house it had been owned originally by
and being elderly she wasn't able to do any of the housework or
so  uh it was pretty run down when I bought it 
and she musta been a real cat lover because uh there were stray
inside the house the  the carpets just reeked of cat urine 
the walls were crumbling 
the plaster was cracked 
there was water damage everywhere 
I guess she'd left the windows open 
and the rain had come in 
and the place was an absolute absolute wreck 
so  anyways  we did a little bit of renovations 
but we haven't done much since then 
and that was twenty five years ago 
so  anyways  we hired somebody to you_know put together some
and  um and hired a contractor 
and at the moment what's happening is that the contractor and the
um so  they're arguing about everything 
the  the  the  the guy who designed the space you_know
 that's the way it hasta be 
the contractor says  is arguing that it can't work that way
 if you're gonna tear this wall down you needta put some support
and all this kind_of stuff 
which means bulkheads and yeah etcetera etcetera 
so  I've been dealing a_lot with that on a daily basis at_least
um so many issues 
so many details 
um you_know and I can't really afford a designer 
but I know I should because I'm not very good at it laughs 
uh but anyways  so  just trying to figure out you_know
that's  that's the major thing in my mind at the moment 
okay 
um so  the young  young man is kicking around a soccer ball
the soccer ball breaks uh a neighbor's window  goes into the
the neighbor gets up out_of his chair to look out the window to see
um imit
so  it was a  there's a mother and her son 
and she's telling him 
 look  it's probably gonna rain today 
 you better take your umbrella 
and he's there 
 no no no  I don't need my umbrella 
 I'm fine 
 I'm fine 
sure enough as the mother had said it starts to rain 
and he doesn't have an umbrella 
he gets all wet 
and he comes home 
he's dripping wet 
and his mother frowns at him  says 
 look  why  you_know you shoulda brought your umbrella 
so  anyways  she dries him off and gives him an umbrella 
and out he goes into the rain 
laughs this one 
uh this man was being chased by a dog 
and the only way that he could get away from the dog was by
no  no  no  no  no  no  no 
there was a dog who was chasing a cat up a tree 
and um so this man decided that he would try and get the cat
but then he got stuck up the tree 
and they hadta call the fire department to get not only him but the
we start at page one 
start 
okay 
oh uh 
uh whichever way I  you prefer 
doesn't matter 
okay
