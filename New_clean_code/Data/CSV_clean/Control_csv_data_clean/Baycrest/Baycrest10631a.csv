the little girl's pet cat managed to get up a tree and now can't
but I've had plenty of cats come down from trees 
I don't know what that's all about 
um the cat mighta been after a bird singing in the tree 
so  a guy tried to help by climbing up the tree 
the dog's barking at the guy 
and someone had the presence of mind to call the fire department
so  somebody musta called the police

and then when the clock started ringing she ran away even_though
 oh xxx 
and she ran away and left behind the slipper because it fell off
a glass slipper xxx it was 
and leaped into her carriage 
and just as she got home it turned back into a pumpkin 
and so the prince tried desperately to find the girl that he  he

 find me the person whose foot fits this 
and so he had his lackeys go all over the kingdom fitting it on
and they finally found her 
and he ends up marrying her
