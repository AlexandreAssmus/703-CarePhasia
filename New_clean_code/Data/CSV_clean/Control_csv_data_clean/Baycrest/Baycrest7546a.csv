uh I was thinking about this today 
like uh remember coming home with the report card in grade two
and I thought generally speaking I did  I did pretty well 
but uh I got a sort_of mediocre to not so great mark in  uh
and my uh mother in particular was kind_of upset with that 
and I thought that was kind_of unfair 
uh right now basically I uh tutor privately a bunch of students
normally that  that takes place in the  the evenings and
so  I do tend to sleep in 
uh usually I have breakfast around ten or ten thirty 
um I might read for a while and go the library just to email
and uh then I have like what's essentially my evening meal
and then I have maybe uh one or two uh lessons with students 
and that takes me to nine 
and then come home  might have a snack  might watch television 
this boy was t kicking the soccer ball around 
he hit a  hit a neighbor's window and smashed it 
uh the neighbor was uh sitting in his living room as the soccer
uh the neighbor looked out with the ball in his hand accusingly
uh the mother was just lecturing her son about uh the need to
uh the son reassured her that he didn't need one 
then it started to rain 
it started to rain even harder 
so  he came home all wet 
and the next time he went out he brought an umbrella 
uh because_of two emergencies the  the fire department was
uh this  uh the girl's cat ended up climbing a tree and was
and in the same tree uh there was this man who uh climbed up it
and someone  probably the girl  brought a ladder 
but uh for whatever reason it didn't reach either cat or the man
so  the fire department hadta come with a larger one 
uh okay 
uh s Cinderella was an orphan girl who lived with her uh
uh at one point um the handsome prince arrived in the house 
and the uh stepsisters wanted to go to the ball with him and so
but uh Cinderella made a wish 
uh she wished for a carriage 
but uh whoever granted her the wish I don't really remember
uh so  Cinderella and the prince went to the ball 
of_course Cinderella was concerned about the time 
but uh at one point the prince uh had like a glass slipper 
and uh there was some sort of prophecy that uh it would fit
and it turns out that it fits Cinderella 
so  uh somehow they got home before the carriage turned into a
and they got married
