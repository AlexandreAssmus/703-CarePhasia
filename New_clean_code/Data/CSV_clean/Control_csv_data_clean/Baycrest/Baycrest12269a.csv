okay 
um I was very happy when my  for  when my uh daughter
and I remember being um at the hospital with my wife uh waiting
we waited overnight 
and finally  and we didn't know whether the baby was gonna be
so  uh we wanted  we were s surprised when the baby was
and we were  I was there right at the time 
and  and uh so then there I knew it was a girl and uh was
I  um I like to spend a little time on the computer 
uh and then um often I go out to the gym and  uh for some
uh do workout um swim and exercise machines 
uh then come back 
and uh I usually have things to take care of back at the 
and  um and I like to read  um get out 
um uh I like to do sports 
uh sometimes I go  I have boats 
sometimes I like to go out in the boat on the weekends 
and  um hm uh and just basically the things I  I needta
and 
xxx more than me 
okay 
well  um there's a man sitting in his living_room relaxing 
uh and outside a boy is kicking a soccer ball and accidentally or
and it goes  breaks through the window  breaks the window
and the man looks out and is wondering where the ball came from and
okay  um okay 
so  mother's saying to the boy uh probably that it's gonna rain
and you should take your umbrella with you to school 
so  uh he  the boy basically says 
 no  I don't need the umbrella 
he goes out 
and it rains 
then he runs back 
and uh laughs his mother basically is xxx 
 I told you so 
and gives him the ʌmbrɪnɛlɪu 
he leaves with the umbrella 
hm okay 
so  um there's a  a cat  for some reason a cat has
then a man tries to come to the rescue  uh climbs up a ladder 
and somehow the ladder falls down 
and he needs to be rescued 
so the  so  the fire department comes and I guess will try to
sort_of yeah 
mhm 
yeah 
mhm 
uh I'll hold this 
okay 
well  I guess this is the story of Cinderella 
and um uh yeah Cinderella basically l lived with her father
and then Cinderella first then hadta go live with the evil
I don't remember the names but 
oh yeah Griselda or something like that and something else 
um is that supposed to be taped 
oh okay 
um basically um okay  so  uh a bird came 
and um I  all I remember is sort_of that she basically was
and all the uh young ladies were invited to come to the ball 
and uh uh Cinderella basically was mostly mistreated 
she basically hadta do all the work that the other sisters didn't
so  she was um never uh 
so  sh she was always being giving job  giving job 
so  uh she kept just getting more and more jobs to do 
and  um uh and so  so  she was never able um 
the  um so  the  t the day of the  the day of the
and uh she never had any time to work  to  to
so  um the 
yeah meanwhile the other uh two uh stepsisters were  uh
and so  um they were all prepared to go to the ball 
and then um uh the  on the day of  I believe uh
and uh so  the  the birds and the mice and all the  all
and they were stealing  I remember they were stealing like
and she was discovered  that was discovered 
and the moth s uh stepmother basically gave her more jobs to
and somewhere in the story there's  uh a fairy godmother
yeah so  this is her still doing all of these jobs 
and um yeah so  she's all s s sad and unhappy that she is
um and then um her y fairy godmother appears and um waved
and basically um the  um some  something gets turned
and I think the mice turn into s horse  uh either uh
and so   then  then she creates uh uh a nice uh gown
and um uh off she goes to the ball 
but she hasta be back by midnight because the spell ends at
and so  the sisters of_course they see Cinderella there in their
and they're wondering how she  and the  step and the
anyway midnight approaches 
the bell  uh the stroke of midnight comes 
and she remembers that she's gotta uh leave by then 
and so 
oh yeah 
in the meantime 
uh I think that's the prince 
and that's his father 
um and anyway he  he  he  dan he only wants to dance
and um anyway when  as  as  as midnight approaches uh
and so  she in her running out she loses her s glass slipper and
um but she's of_course still missing her one slipper 
so  the next day the  pr the prince wants to find out 
and uh he knows that he  the  ru the lost slipper 
so  he announces to all of his subjects that um he's  uh
and so  he  he come  he goes throughout the village
he fen eventually comes to  to uh their  hou their 
and it's  of_course it's not gonna fit on the uh evil sisters
and um he finds that it does fit Cinderella 
but I think in their anger the sisters grabbed the slipper and they
but he sees that it fit her 
and they live happily ever after and yada yada
