hm well  it was when I was a kid 
and I went with a group of my friends 
I think I was maybe about eight or  between eight and ten 
something like that 
and we went down to this local creek 
we lived in a small village 
and it was about a mile down to the creek 
and it was springtime 
and we were cautioned not to go down because it was  you_know
not a river 
it was a creek 
well  anyhow we  boys will be boys 
and we defied laughs all odds 
and we went down 
and we always had like hammers and nails that we bore from our
so  uh we went down 
and we uh found some logs and some odd boards 
and we put together a raft 
and we went rafting 
and the water was a very free flowing 
and it was fantastic 
but of_course we hit one point 
and there was a ice floe 
and the raft went sideways 
and we all went into the water 
so  uh you_know and at that time we wore rubber boots 
but they were no help because the water was more like uh waist
and uh we got soaked from the waist down 
water went in the boots 
and  and then we finally made it to shore thank_goodness 
otherwise it coulda been more serious 
and uh when we got to shore we emptied our rubber boots 
but laughs we still had our socks on 
and we were wet 
and it was very uncomfortable because it was still quite cool in
and we hadta walk the whole mile home on a gravel road 
and it was like slosh_slosh_slish_slosho you_know 
and it was getting colder because when you're wet like that 
and we got home 
and uh you_know unfortunately our parents saw us first coming in
 where have you been 
 what happened 
so  we  we got a huge reprimand you_know 
so  uh but uh thankfully we made it home 
but because the temperature was dropping our sort_of uh jeans or
they were starting to freeze 
so  it was like walking  laughs walking along like a robot 
but uh we made it home 
and uh everything was fine 
but it was sad in_that we got reprimanded 
but we were happy when we were doing the  uh you_know the
so  we had a good time 
and you_know we laughed about it 
and you_know we were all chummy 
and we walked back 
we didn't  we didn't think too much of it 
but you_know when we got home it was kind_of sad laughs 
thank_you 
um typical day I would uh go for a walk throat
I would go shopping 
um I would try to get involved in some local activity 
we have community gardens 
we have a recreation center on site where I live 
so  there variety of activities 
if it's a very hot day I would choose to maybe go downtown to uh
sometimes it's kind_of neat to pretend you're a tourist laughs
and the tourists seem to be very polite you_know 
up in my neck of the woods where I live right now you say hi to
and they look at you kind_of strange like 
 what do you want 
whereas you_know tourists uh they seem to be friendlier 
so  I'll go to Harbor_Front 
if I've got the funds  available funds I'll go to the islands 
and that's time consuming 
but during the week it's the best time to go 
on weekends you hafta stand in line 
and it's a throat
you spend more time travel downtown and going across in the ferry
and INV
and uh you_know there's bicycle rentals  canoe rentals 
there's uh lots to do 
miles of walkways 
so  yeah I try to keep busy 
I try to immerse myself in a variety of activities 
otherwise I find you_know doing the same thing it's like being a
and you have to go and guard the same post and stand there all day
so  it's kind_of nice to try different activities 
I like uh the you_know variety 
yeah throat
there's no Cinderella in these 
okay 
looks like the boy is kicking what appears to be a soccer ball 
and unfortunately it goes and breaks the window  a shuttered
and in number three the ball comes in a room with a man sitting in
the man picks up the ball  looks out the window  uh glances it
can I just scan the whole story INV
okay 
see the progression 
looks like probably the mother is speaking to the little boy 
he says 
 no no no no 
 I don't want the umbrella 
 it's not going to rain 
and upon leaving for school with his backpack it appears that the
and then he's  looks like he's on his way home or way back with
and uh stepping through the puddles with the rain teeming down
and she doesn't look too happy 
and he probably got a reprimand and was told to go out again 
okay  there's a_lot_of action here 
uh looks like there's a girl who's reaching up into a deciduous
there's a tricycle 
perhaps the little girl was driving the tricycle 
there's a man up in a tree throat
perhaps uh he was climbing up the tree 
and now there's a dog barking up the tree at the man 
he looks very uh perturbed  upset because he can't get down
meanwhile firefighters arrive in their truck 
two firefighters are running with a ladder to  probably in an
and there's  oh  and there's a bird s sing chirping on
okay 
it's a fairy tale 
that's Cinderella 
and it's about si Cinderella and a prince 
Cinderella lived with her mean say  stepmother who had two
they were not too fond of Cinderella and always were happy when she
and she was made to do all the work 
Cinderella was a very kind and gentle person 
and she lived I believe in the attic 
and she would talk to the birds 
okay 
she was always working 
but she would think of you_know how she was made fun of by the
she was overworked 
she'd bring them breakfast up and down to the stepmother and to the
there was a prince who lived in a castle and rode a white horse 
Cinderella was always mopping  mopping cleaning you_know cooking
Cinderella h received a delivery 
it was sealed 
and the delivery went to the stepmother 
stepmother received the delivery and to the glee of everybody read
Cinderella was actually hopeful that she was invited 
but as it turned out she was not 
so  the stepmother denied her that 
and I would imagine the stepmother and daughters were off to the
they were invited to a ball 
the prince was having a ball 
Cinderella was left back home dreaming that she could go to the
in fact she tried on or  looked at a dress that she would
she mentioned the dress 
and then she looked at pictures of the dress 
she was friends with all the throat
they decided to throat
so  they sewed 
and they spun 
and they weaved and you_know appliqued the bows on the dress 
she didn't know this was happening 
she throat
the birds came and the mice to tell her that they had a special
she was so delighted with the dress 
meanwhile the stepmother and the t two sisters were uh prancing
and Cinderella was left back very forlorn and depressed with her
I believe that they may have been responsible throat
she cried 
everybody was sad  her friends the animals  small creatures
the fairy godmother heard her pleas and  and her sorrow
and she came and waved her magic wand and turned pumpkin into a
sobs it's a sad story 
into a magnificent coach for Cinderella 
then she was off in the coach with the blessing of the sighs
she arrived at the ball and was greeted at the door by two of the
there she met the prince 
but the fairy godmother had brɑɪstu 
in her haste when she heard the clock dong dong dong she ran off 
and behind she left her glass slipper 
meanwhile she raced home before the entire dream disappeared in the
and  and then she made it back 
the dress disappeared 
the angry godmother met her 
and she uh was very annoyed at her that she came home so late 
meanwhile the prince sent his attendants to find the girl to whom
they tried  throat
it wouldn't fit 
however they finally came upon Cinderella 
it fit 
they brought her back to the castle 
okay
