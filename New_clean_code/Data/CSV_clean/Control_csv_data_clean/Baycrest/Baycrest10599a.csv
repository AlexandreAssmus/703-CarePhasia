sounds like a ten minute interview 
I hafta think about the scenario for two minutes and then talk
um it was important to me to get into law school 
that was something that happened that was very important 
I have no idea why I was accepted because I don't think I met any
thirty two 
I was thirty two when I started 
so  I guess I was thirty one when I applied 
and in my year the median age was twenty two 
so  I was one of the oldest in the class  had nothing in common
I_mean they still remembered high_school 
who thought about high_school 
and they all knew each_other from high_school 
and they were there because they didn't get into medical school or
and I was just flummoxed 
I was just sitting in this room listening to these people who came
they were just there because 
well  I guess it was the best thing that they could do under the
and I was there because I just really cared 
and so  I really didn't fit in um really 
it was at the end of the first year when I made my first real
up until then I was friendly with people but I didn't understand
and it was very limited because we were told to get into study
and I never spoke in class because I could never understand what
like they asked questions for which the answers seemed obvious 
why would anybody say the obvious 
so  people said the obvious 
and they were rewarded 
so  those were the people sought after to be in the study groups 
not me 
so  I did almost everything alone for the entire year 
and when I asked to borrow one of my friend's notes she said she
so  I said 
 thanks but no thanks 
 don't bother 
and somewhere along the line I found a group that really didn't
and just anybody who wanted to could be part of it 
so  that was me laughs 
so  I was part of that group for some classes 
at the end of the year i in the subway station I met someone who
um but we had been divided into two groups of fifty or seventy
and she was in the other group 
so  I never saw her 
and in second year things improved a bit because then I think I
and that was good 
like once I had a couple of friends to talk to and especially one
as an example of the incredible snobbiness of the school and the
and he said 
 please  when you write your exams don't think that your mark is
and I thought 
 wow it is so amazing to hear something like that 
and I said that to someone in my class who completely disparaged
it was in law school that I learned that competentq was a
 oh he's a competent lawyer 
and that the positive term was brightq 
if you weren't bright you were nobody 
so  um because he wasn't bright the students didn't respect him
and I th made the mistake of saying to someone 
 you_know yeah h okay but he's decent 
 like he's a decent person 
 he has a heart 
and she said 
 a heart 
 I didn't come to Oz where this one doesn't have a brain and this
 I came to law school 
didn't talk to her again 
U_of_T 
U_of_T was and continues to try to be the Harvard of Canada 
I don't know why 
and I also didn't understand that law schools had their own kind of
but I didn't  I didn't know that 
I didn't even get it until after I left 
so  really it wasn't the right school for me 
I really should have gone to York 
but when I came to Toronto people were saying 
 oh U_of_T 
 it's the best school 
 and why would you wanna be way out at York 
 you're in Toronto 
 you wanna be downtown 
so  I thought 
 okay I wanna be downtown 
so  I was downtown 
boy kicks the ball 
flies into a glass window  breaks the window and falls into the
it knocks over the lamp 
the man stands up holding the ball looking out the window to see
it looks like he's got his gun in the pock pocket 
okay  the mother tells the child to take an umbrella 
and the child doesn't want one 
oh the  uh but in this  st in the second one the
well  oh  oh  oh  oh  oh I see 
so  the mother offers the child the umbrella 
the child refuses 
the child says 
 goodbye 
goes outside 
it's raining 
it's really raining 
and the kid runs home soaking wet goes to the mother who's not
well  w what's happening is that um firefighters are rushing
but it looks like what happened is that the little girl's cat was
the man climbed up the tree to save the cat 
and then he got stuck 
and then the firemen are coming to save the man 
maybe the cat was chasing the bird 
no  I think the dog was chasing the cat

the bane of feminists everywhere  Cinderella's story about a
and I don't think we find out how she got to that situation but
and the stepmother and stepsisters basically treated her like a
she always  she hadta do all the cleaning and all the cooking
and she didn't get to go shopping for new clothes 
and she wasn't given the best food to eat 
and anyway she was just treated horribly 
one day uh the stepmother and the two stepsisters get an
Cinderella  thinking she's a member of the family thinks she can
but she can't 
so  she h has to help the two stepsisters and stepmother get
and then they go 
after they leave she's very disappointed because she really wanted
and somehow or another her fairy godmother appears and tells her
so  she gives her a beautiful dress to wear  lovely new shoes and
and the only rule is be back by twelve 
so  Cinderella went to the ball 
she had a wonderful time 
nobody knew who she was 
everybody was saying 
 oh who's that woman 
 who's that woman 
the prince danced with her the whole evening 
she had a lovely time 
and then as the clock was striking twelve she realized she hadta
so  she ran out 
in running out she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper
um following that  the prince found the missing slipper 
and he wanted to find the woman who went with the slipper 
so  he traveled all over the kingdom trying the shoe on women's
it didn't fit anybody 
finally he made it to the home of the stepmother and two ugly
and he tried it on their feet 
it didn't fit any of them 
and he saw Cinderella and said 
 why don't you try it 
or possibly she said 
 why don't I try it 
and he tried it on 
and it fit 
and he was ecstatic because he had found the love of his life after
and she of  co of_course  being swept off her feet  agreed
that she'd just go back to slavery and doing dishes and laundry and
but the book doesn't take you that far 
it only takes you to the pa part where they meet and they fall in
