okay 
okay 
well  um one of the big  one of the very important things
that was like very positive experience 
and I was a teenager at the time 
and um it was a significant change 
it was quite a drastic change 
and  um but it was uh interesting in the sense that it was
it was just a big  a big change and a big transition 
and uh it was you_know with all these expectations and  and
learning  you_know getting used to a whole new culture 
not language because I spoke English uh where I came from 
and  um but just getting used to whole new culture and um
like s like you_know we spoke differently from how we s
and  um and so  just getting used to everyone and the culture
it wasn't  well  one of the  one of the things uh
we drive on the  we drove on the left in the other  in
it's former British_Guyana 
and um you_know just getting used to consumerism 
that was one of the big shock you_know 
we didn't  we didn't spend money there like we  we did here
like my parents certainly didn't spend money and buy clothing and
and there was just money that was  money that's so
right 
it is just a dispensable commodity 
and I guess it's just like everything else today 
especially in the last fifteen twenty years you_know 
it's like everything has become dispensable 
you_know it's like you buy a shirt 
you wear it a few times 
and then you can go get another one because it's so inexpensive now
and  um but there's a premium on education 
and that's where I invested my time 
and um I spent many years in education while  while working
I just did it because I felt I could do it 
and it was immensely challenging 
but I struggled through it 
and I was very successful 
a typical day  a workday 
I'll describe a typical workday 
I'm up at five a_m 
I'm just  I just got useta getting up really early 
and I would um have a cup of coffee 
and I would uh brush my teeth and shave and shower 
and then I would put on my sweatpants and tshirt 
and if it's the wintertime I'd get on my jacket and uh winter
and I would go around the block for a walk a couple  two
espe especially when it's colder you kind_of INV
and so  by the time I'm  I've done I would go out  go out
by then I'm sweating 
um so  that gives  gives my  my  it revs up my whole
and that's  that's great because it just jumpstarts my whole
and then um I'll just undress and cool down and um then get
and I don't typically have a morning breakfast 
it's just something I got used to 
and it works really well for me 
I  I don't consume dairy products because I'm lactose intolerant
and um so  I'll walk to work 
it's about a twelve minute walk  twelve to fifteen minute walk
and then when I get there and I  um I'll have another half
well  maybe almost a full cup but with brown sugar again 
and then I settle down because we have all kinds of administrative
and you check your email and other  voicemail and all these
so  administration consumes a_lot_of time 
and by then it's eight o'clock 
then I'm ready to get into my work like for another half an hour
I'm ready to get into my  you_know the chargeable work
but it's the auditing or accounting or tax work 
whatever is  whatever I have on my desk or whatever is 
and so  that will take up  consume most of my morning 
I tend not to eat or snack in the  during the day 
I  um I'm  I'm a little bit disciplined with that 
because I used to 
and I useta be very um 
and it didn't work well for me 
I was very overweight at one time 
and I  it didn't work well for me 
so  I  and  and then I sit down all day 
and so  that's  uh that became a problem because I was
so  I really hadta uh get rid of the weight 
and it changed  it made a huge change 
so  I'm actually a pure pure vegan now 
and for the last three years 
well  a total of five years now but mostly so the last three years
and um so  lunchtime will come around 
and I take my lunch 
so  I  I make my own lunch 
and  um and so  I'll have lunch between eleven thirty and
uh I actually go out for a walk 
I always get up and go for a walk  get some fresh air and come
not a long walk but a short walk 
and then I'll have lunch 
and by twelve thirty  between twelve thirty or one o'clock
but in the middle of the day again you might have some
you gotta check your emails or voicemails  deal with any other
and  um and then around one o'clock then I really get back
and you_know so  one to  one to three 
so  I give it a solid two hours one to three 
and then I take a break at three o'clock to three fifteen 
and I did get some water or  or go downstairs and go for a walk
and um any other issues that come up again  the same  the
administrative  administrative stuff goes on all the time
and then between three fifteen to five o'clock I xxx the chargeable
and then I try to get out_of there right after five o'clock 
so  I'd pack up at five o'clock and um you_know do the routine
it depends 
it could be personal stuff 
it could be client related matters 
and um then I try to get outta there right at five o'clock or
and I make sure I'm there at that time every day 
tell me the story 
okay so  he's kicking a soccer ball 
and uh the soccer ball broke the window 
and the soccer ball went through the glass pane  broke the glass
and he's gotten up  the fellow who was sitting at the 
it looks like it entered in someone's house through the broken
and he's now gotten up 
and he's picked up the ball 
and he's looking out to see who did that 
so  starting at one 
okay so  the mother is giving her child the umbrella because it
and so  he's 
okay so  he didn't  he just said goodbye 
and he did not take the umbrella 
but then when he went out it started to rain 
so  he  I guess he regretted not taking the umbrella 
so  he became wet 
he went  he walked through the rain 
and he became wet 
and he went back home 
and looks like he went back home 
and he got the umbrella after all 
and this story is 
alright  it looks like the pet  the child's pet is up in the tree
and the father is trying to get the pet 
and it looks like he's stuck in the tree now as_well 
and the dog is barking up the tree 
but they call the fire department 
and so  the fire  the ambulance  the fire guys are
and they're gonna go rescue the pet and maybe the father 
stepsisters 
right 
and the  and the wicked witch 
xxx INV
so  this is the knight 
I guess this is the picture of the  the  her knight in
I don't  I'm not sure who the girl and the  what the
and this is  this is the  the  the wicked  the
and this is Cinderella 
they  she was more like the housemaid or the house servant 
and  um and these were her friends 
the birds were her friends 
so  she'd confide  confide in the birds  I think 
she  she would seek comfort in the  in the  in  in
and um yeah so  they  they sort of just  they  she
and so the  the  the three stepsisters they  they just
so  they were horrible to her 
and yeah so she  so  she  there you go 
she  she serves them 
and she was their  their maid essentially 
and uh the knight who he the 
I guess that's the picture 
that's the  the grand house that they lived in with the picture
and so  there you go again 
she was uh always  she was their cleaner and housemaid 
and that's what  that's what that picture shows 
and uh the  oh  this is the delivery of the invitation 
there was the  they were going to a ball 
right 
so  there she  that's the invitation being delivered 
and sh okay  there's the  the stepmother uh who's reading
and  and I guess this is probably Cinderella inquiring whether
and this is the wicked wit witch  witch uh telling her that
or she wouldn't gonna show it to her or something like that 
and okay so  there's Cinderella getting her dress ready for the
and what is that 
that's uh there 
and who's looking 
is that the  the  I  is that the 
I'm not sure what that is 
but uh that's probably the  s somebody looking at pictures
that's the  whether it's the Cinderella or the stepsisters 
and this is  okay so  this is  the  the  the 
and this is Cinderella looking out the  her house or where she
and  um and the  the  the pets are or  are happy
uh w that she's going to the ball or something like that 
because this is the dress and the  and a  and a necklace
and here she is 
uh she's  she's got the dress 
she's trying the dress  I guess  in a superficial way 
she's not trying it on but uh just looking at herself in it
and this is the  okay these  okay so  these are the
oh they cut up her dress 
okay so  the wicked sisters  the three stepsisters and the
and they were heading off to the ball 
oh okay so  there she is 
she's dis in despair because I guess she wasn't invited to go to
and she was confiding in 
who  who is that 
I'm not sure who that is 
that's the fairy I guess  the fairy godmother 
and okay so  the fairy godmother is  uh c has come to her
I take it 
and um okay so  the fairy godmother is 
well  she's still  she's  that's the  the dress that
so  this is gonna be the  the carriage that's gonna take her to
okay  the fairy godmother and the 
okay  and that's Cinderella there 
and that's her carriage  it looks like 
okay  and that's Cinderella all dressed up to go to the  the
is that she's arriving at the castle 
that's the castle 
okay  and that's Cinderella arrived at the castle 
and this is the king and uh his uh confidant  I guess 
I take it 
and that's Cinderella there with the prince 
okay  and that's the  the glass slipper 
she lost her glass slipper 
it was midnight or something like that 
how  where is that 
like the carriage leaving the palace 
okay  and that's her returning home without her glass slipper
and that's the  the  the stepmother 
is that the stepmother  it looks like 
that's Cinderella at home with the stepmother 
and that's one 
oh they're  okay so  that's  they're  they're trying
so that's  and okay so  that's the king who brought or 
okay so  that's one of the king's men  I guess  who brought the
and it fitted  fitted Cinderella correctly or properly 
so  it belonged to her 
okay so  there she gets her prince in the end 
I've actually never read Cinderella 
I just know it from watching cartoons and just having a general
uh but I know there were Disney  Disney books and movies
I've actually never watched it 
I guess a girl would more watch Cinderella than  than I would 
it is a fun story 
it was the fairy tale of the time for young girls  I think
