well  happy 
um let me see 
okay  going back to high_school days 
I think it was uh second formally called now grade ten 
uh I started to take geometry 
and I couldn't understand it 
couldn't understand geometry 
and uh teacher kept assuring us that you'll  eventually
couldn't understand 
I got pretty good mark 
I studied hard for it the first term 
and partway through the second term just before the second set of
and I was able to grab it 
and uh just like he said 
 it'll  eventually it'll come to you 
and I remember one time after the exam  the Easter exam I
and I thanked him for giving encouragement that eventually it'll
and I was okay in geometry after that 
that gave me a_lot_of happiness 
oh gee 
because it would've pulled down my other marks on average  you see
that's fine 
end of story 
okay 
um well  I don't do the same thing every day 
other_than I go to uh morning services at the synagogue 
oh I get up or  eventually before that I gotta get up 
yeah I get up and uh dressed 
and uh I do some morning prayers at breakfast 
sometimes I do laundry 
sometimes I do cleaning 
and I do some learning in what's called the Gemorah the Talmud 
and then by that time it's time to go for services 
I go to services 
and uh usually I get a ride home 
even on nice days people fall on themselves to help me out 
then I come home and depends if I had appointment or not 
so  then I would do what  uh uh more Talmud learning 
or I would go out shopping locally either to Yorkdale or PlacenameL
and I come home from those places to have lunch and rest up  do
and uh in the afternoon I would do cleaning if necessary 
because I don't do cleaning every day 
I space it out during the week 
and uh that time it's time to go for uh evening services at
and I go there 
I do uh some extra reading of what's called Tehillim psalms 
and then for that  then after that is evening services I come
and uh a husband and wife in the building younger couple than me
everybody's younger than me anyway 
uh they make me supper each night  hot meal  vegetables usually
and uh they phone me when it's ready 
I come down  pick it up  have it in my place 
and uh then evening services I do at my place 
I don't go out again in the evening 
and then after that I get ready for bed 
that's it 
that's providing I don't go out 
sometimes I go out in the evenings 
uh I'm invited out for a meal or someplace like that or to go to
then I go in the evenings 
but if I'm home  so that's how it is 
you give me so many compliments I gotta get a bigger yarmulke 
and I didn't budget for it 
but I got a good line of credit at the bank 
how's that 
yeah 
there I go 
what a story 
I think I  I saw this 
oh gee it must be still playing 
yeah  yeah 
I didn't see by myself 
oh yes 
mhm 
I tell you a story 
oops 
well  he was  young man was playing soccer  broke a window
then the owner looked out the window through the broken glass to
do I have to give names 
oh okay 
alright 
same thing again 
the mother tells the child 
 take an umbrella because it's probably gonna rain 
the child leaves 
the mother gives the umbrella 
then starts to rain 
oh there are two children here 
okay 
the one didn't take the umbrella 
it rains 
runs home very wet 
and the other one who had the umbrella was walking happily 
I think 
oh_my_god 
so much action going on here 
where do you start 
the girl is 
oh the father  father went up a tree to help the daughter to
oh no  there's birds up here 
birds in a nest let's say 
and the dog is barking 
and here comes the fire people with a ladder to get the  um
because he'd probably used this ladder to get up 
excellent 
too much an 
five thousand years ago 
oh 
alright 
here we go 
there was this girl Cinderella 
and she had a wicked stepmother 
and there was two stepsisters 
and she hadta do the cleaning of the  their place 
and there was to be a party  ball  a party a certain
and she wanted to go 
and she couldn't go 
the stepmother wouldn't let her go 
she hadta stay back and do the cleaning  continue to do the
and she really wanted to go 
and she's doing the cleaning 
and she imagined that if she did go they would somehow catch her 
I don't remember that scene 
throat
no end to it 
and then she gets delivered an invitation to go 
but it doesn't apply to her 
the wicked  wicked stepmother 
not all stepmothers are wicked but anyway this one was 
so  she reads the invitation 
and the  she goes with the uh two daughters 
but Cinderella isn't allowed to go or look at the invitation 
but Cinderella makes herself a gown for the ball 
she sews it 
she's a good seamstress 
and um it fits 
it looks nice on her 
and sh the place is so far away 
the castle is so far away she wonders how to get there 
and these animals help her  give her suggestions 
I think there's three of them 
yeah okay 
and uh she follows the stepmother and the two  s two
and um she doesn't go 
mhm 
and they're sad for her 
then the  comes the fairy godmother and uh tells her 
 you can go but you hafta be home by midnight or you'll turn into
 so  go 
 have a good time 
 and uh you'll go in this chariot 
 and you'll have a good time there 
 you'll be doing dancing 
 but remember to come home by that certain time 
so  she goes to the ball  enters the place 
and king is there with the prince 
she dances with the prince 
they have a good time 
and then she looks at the clock that she's gonna be late 
so  she comes running down the stairs and on the way down drops
well  I think there's four horses  yeah 
it's even number 
so  she realizes as she gets back she's missing one of the
so  she comes home and uh meets the stepmother 
and then one of the advisors of the royal court comes to see who
it doesn't fit the others but it fits her  Cinderella 
and they get married 
she marries to the prince 
or he marries her  whichever way 
and they live happily ever after 
and the other animals 
there's four of them 
I thought it was three 
oh four of them 
they're very happy on her behalf 
and they live happily ever after
