and uh this young gal wanted me to go to have a nap in the
and I was protesting 
and I was so upset

and it was different in nineteen forty six 
and I knew the way 
I  uh being in the car the kids they pick it up fast

because we were entertaining some people that were coming over
um we had some  some of  c some of my children came
and uh with  a couple of my grandchildren were  two or
and then we had some guests that useta live in Winnipeg 
so  that was for part of the day til about uh two o'clock 
uh I then walked my grandson of two and a half years of age from
I fear it was a good  j uh quite a walk for him 
uh and he did it all 
and then I stayed a little at my sister's and my daughter's 
and then from there uh I visited my  s one of my sons 
and then uh we uh came home 
and uh I  basically I watched the uh 
I took my wife to  uh to zumba class at Baycrest village 
and then we watched the Gray  I watched the Graycomb

and it looks like it breaks a window  goes through the window
and then the man that's sitting there picks up the ball and is
one seems to have an umbrella 
and she's looking to give it to her daughter 
who  the daughter takes it 
unless she takes it

mother's not happy 
and then the kid takes the umbrella  the  the umbrella
well  there's a man stuck in a tree 
and the dog is barking 
and the girl's trying to get the cat off the tree 
and she's got a little tricycle there 
and there's a ladder 
but  nobod now on come the fireman I guess  to help him

 what if she can't go to this 
 you're just a nothing 
so  they ultimately get all dressed up and go to the ball one
and uh Cinderella's left behind 
and then along  out_of the blue comes this fairy godmother who
and she basically turns all her rags into wonderful clothes 
and he 
and her  uh both horses suddenly s emerge 
and she's whisked away to the ball 
and she's given a warning that she  that  before she sets
