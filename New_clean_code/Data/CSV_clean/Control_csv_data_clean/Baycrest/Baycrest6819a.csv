sighs and uh I don't know  by hook or by crook  I got this
so  it was a big bunch of stuff I got in the mail 
and  uh well  I was super happy of_course 
so  I went to my headmaster and told him that 
and he was super happy 
and he just immediately told all the teachers  which we were only
and everyone except one were happy for me 
and the other one just said

but we don't  we British 
I'm the foreigner from Canada  right 
so  but anyway  everybody was very happy 
so  this guy who was nasty like that  he didn't talk to me for
he just  uh he was really angry 
I don't know 
I didn't do anything  right 
so  I think it was through Canada_House 
because it  when you  when you go to England for

and um there are walkways all along the  the garden there 
so  we  we stood along the walkways 
and there comes you_know the queen  Philip  oh I don't know
