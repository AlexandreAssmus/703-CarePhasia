mhm 
well  I recently had Hodgkin's disease 
uh was diagnosed  I guess  about three months after I retired 
I spent uh s several months in chemotherapy 
uh but pri prior to that  before the chemotherapy started I had uh an allergic reaction to Allopurinol and ended up in the hospital for three weeks 
that was  was a Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is not unlike a burn although there was no  no burning to my skin 
it was all a result of the allergic reaction 
and that stopped the chemo 
I had one round of chemo 
and then the allergic reaction took place to the  medica not the chemo medication but to uh a medication that's designed to protect uh kidney function 
so  I was in the hospital for three weeks 
that resolved 
I started chemo again 
and uh I finished chemo this past May and have been in remission since 
so  my hair came back 
my weight came back 
and I hafta watch it now because it's  it's laughs back more than it has been 
um but it was  it's been uh quite a year and a half or so 
well  I had married my wife about forty eight years ago 
and it was cries 
sorry guys 
pretty much her  her doing clearsthroat plus my oncologist of_course 
um so  it was  you_know it  ih I had chemo every two weeks 
and the oncologist was just great 
and  uh and Firstname was quite a support 
cries sorry 
and I  d d I didn't do much else because it was you_know the chemo and  and uh eating as best as I could and uh uh resting as  as best I could although the chemo did make me tired so that wasn't too hard 
um click so that was it you_know following doctor's orders as they say  and my wife's orders 
so 
a story 
well  this being Saint_Joseph's day in the Roman_Catholic calendar and since my son's name is Joseph as_well_as my own name I guess it was his birth which was on a Tuesday 
that  uh I do know the day of the week uh in December December ninth 
uh and uh it was that day that he was born that was quite happy but also the day that  that we found out that uh we were pregnant  that my wife was pregnant 
uh he's our only child 
um so  his  his  the announcement of the fact that he was  that my wife was pregnant and then his being born I guess  are happy memories prompted by  as I said  today because of  of  the uh of Saint_Joseph's day 
about the  da about Saint_Joseph's day 
it's a  it's a feast day in  in the  uh in the Roman_Catholic calendar that comes just after Saint_Patrick's day which I think  overshadows  overshadows it 
and it's  um as the Irish celebrate Saint_Patrick's I think Saint_Joseph's day is mostly celebrated by the Italian_Americans and by Italians 
and there's a special pastry that is consumed 
and it's called a Zeppole or the  the donut of Saint_Joseph 
it's quite rich creamy fattening cholesterol laden but quite delicious 
uh if you  if you meant my son's birthdate um we prepared for uh childbirth 
uh I was to be a coach 
it was very early in the time when the socalled painless childbirth developed or Lamaze 
um but the hospital at which my wife was to deliver didn't allow fathers in the waiting 
so  even_though we prepared  we prepared for uh the day of birth going to childbirth classes  Lamaze classes 
when it  when 
pun intended 
when push came to shove I couldn't go into the waiting 
uh so  I hadta wait outside the way fathers hadta typically do in those days 
but I was with her up to her being taken into delivery 
and  and I  we did use some of the coaching 
so it  and  and she did m uh employ some of the um uh techniques that were taught to her 
um so  yeah  so  that was  that was the day of his birth 
a boy is kicking a soccer ball which goes through w a house window smashes the glass 
and it's falling into the lap of a man who's sitting in a chair in the house 
he picks up the ball looks out the window  actually looks through the hole in the window 
 okay 
the mother is handing an umbrella to  her child because it's probably raining outside 
he uh is saying 
 no I won't  don't want the umbrella 
he walks outside 
it's raining 
didn't listen to mom 
he runs back with water now drenching him  the rain drenching him 
back in the house mother's not happy 
she's frowning 
the boy's frowning soaking wet 
he leaves the house this time with the umbrella 
well  a cat is stuck up in the tree 
and this child's father probably he  he did climb the tree to try to get the cat 
uh but he now himself is stuck up there 
the dog is barking at him 
and someone called the fire department 
and two firemen are rushing over with a ladder 
and they're gonna take him down as_well_as retrieve the cat 
okay 
Cinderella is a young girl who  um whose mother died 
and she's brought by her father to live with uh I  I think  a sister of his who herself has three girls about Cinderella's age 
uh father meant well 
but uh the stepmother or the woman to whom she was brought uh and her daughters treated Cinderella shamefully 
uh she became uh their maid essentially and uh hadta clean the house uh take care of the fireplace hence the name Cinderella uh do the cooking do the washing while they uh enjoyed life and uh uh did what they wanted to do to  to please themselves 
one day the prince 
they  they lived in a  in a principality 
the prince uh whose father wanted him to marry uh was uh asked to or  was told that there would be a ball held at which uh many of the or  all of the single women in the principality would  would be invited 
and the idea would be that he would  the prince would eventually uh pick one of them to be his wife 
the three  Cinderella's three stepsisters prepare for the ball 
the mother  their mother's very excited 
and of_course Cinderella is excluded 
she cannot go to the ball 
uh and so she's left at home alone while the uh stepmother and her three daughters go to the ball 
click she's visited by her fairy godmother uh who uh grants her uh her wish of attending the ball 
because Cinderella says 
 how am I gonna get there 
 what am I gonna wear 
uh so  the guh fairy godmother uh makes a very nice gown for her out_of magic uh takes a pumpkin causes it to become a coach 
mice become the horses 
uh I guess one of the mice becomes a coachman too 
I forget  which animal becomes the coachman 
they take her to the ball 
um she's not really recognized by her stepsisters and  and the stepmother 
click uh but they  the fairy godmother had told her that she must return by midnight 
otherwise  or at midnight everything would turn back to what it was 
the coach would become the pumpkin again etcetera 
so  she promises to return at midnight 
but she's having so much fun that she's still at the ball as the clock is striking midnight 
so  she panics 
rightly so 
runs uh gets back in the coach and is taken home 
but one of her slippers  glass slippers that was part of what the uh fairy godmother made for her is left behind 
and the prince uh at  at the ball was captivated by Cinderella and uh wanted to  to know who she was 
because she was going to be the one 
uh and the only thing he hadta go on was the slipper that she left behind 
so  he uh has all of the young ladies in the  munici uh in the principality uh try the slipper on 
uh it  their  it's brought to each of their houses 
and the  of_course the idea being that the one whose foot fits is the one uh he was looking for the one who was at the ball 
and sure enough um it is Cinderella's foot that fits uh the glass slipper to the great surprise and dismay of her stepsisters and stepmother and  but to her great delight 
and um the prince marries her 
and they live happily ever after 
well  I would take um two pieces of bread 
on one of them I would uh take a knife and spread the peanut butter 
and on the other  piece of bread I would take this jelly from the jar spread it on that piece of bread and put those two pieces of bread together 
and I'd have a peanut butter and jelly sandwich
