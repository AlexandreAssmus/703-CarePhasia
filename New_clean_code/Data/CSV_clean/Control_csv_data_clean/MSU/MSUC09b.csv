yeah well the big one is my cancer uh Hodgkin's disease 
was diagnosed about three months after I retired in twenty eleven 
I had symptoms before then but didn't connect the dots 
I had night sweats 
I was tired and yuh just didn't think much of it 
but then I noticed that I was losing weight 
and that's what caused me to seek a doctor 
so  I went to 
I hadn't been to a doctor in years 
uh so  I ended up going to the physician that my wife Firsname uses 
she's now both  uh our physician for both of us 
she did uk an office exam and uh was concerned enough to send me for a sonogram cause she palpated and she felt something uh the lymph nodes turned out 
so  I went for a sonogram 
and that was positive enough for me to have a Cat scan and a Pet scan 
that led to the need for a biopsy 
so  b at that  by then it was becoming clear that there was something wrong 
uh the decision was gonna be is it 
it  it was lymphoma 
but is it gonna be Hodgkin's lymphoma or Non_Hodgkin's lymphoma 
so  I went to Mountainside hospital ih in Montclair for a needle biopsy but that wasn't enough  uh th not enough tissue was obtained 
so  I hadta go into the city  into New_York to Sloan for uh a more complete biopsy 
and that clinched it 
uh it was Hodgkin's lymphoma which in the great scheme of things was the better of the two 
uh Hodgkins's is much more treatable at a higher success rate 
so  I started chemo 
and uh after the first session I developed a rash 
and we d weren't quite sure what was going on 
one of the nurses 
the  the oncologist wasn't sure 
and he was gonna proceed with the treatment wuh for the  for the Hodgkin's 
but one of his nurses said 
 this is an allergic reaction 
and it turned out it was a severe allergic reaction to Allopurinol 
I think I mentioned this last time 
um which is a drug given to chemo patients to protect kidney 
it's actually a drug for gout 
but it has a protective effect uh for kidney  function 
that landed me in the hospital with  with what's called Stevens_Johnson syndrome which is treated like a burn 
it  ips people with Stevens_Johnson are often sent to burn units 
my mouth was inflamed 
I  I  it was just awful 
I couldn't drink water 
it  j it burned 
that of_course suspended chemo 
I  w we w worked through the laughs Stevens_Johnson 
I was looking forward to chemo 
it was  it was so bad that the chemotherapy was going to be the vacation 
uh so  um and I ended up having really a mild case ih ih from what I can gather 
but still I  I couldn't take solid food for  for t uh two weeks or so nor water 
it was  it was  the only thing that really worked was  was um uh iced tea 
um so  I got through the Stevens_Johnson went back to chemo and had chemo for several months 
it ended  last May 
um had my Pet scan at that time which was clear 
oncologist waited another six months 
had another Pet scan 
that was clear 
uh and things were so good that on this past Friday my port was removed 
I don't know if you know about ports 
uh so  that sorta  that sorta clinched the  uh the idea that I'm you_know home free 
you_know  I hafta be monitored every six months 
um and chemo ih wasn't  it wasn't all that bad 
I_mean  Firstname got me through it if  as I said last week 
I ub broke down 
um she was just super uh in getting me through all of this 
and the chemo wasn't bad 
I  I really wasn't nauseous 
um my appetite started to come back 
in_fact  we would have lunch while I was hooked up to the chemo 
we'd send out for lunch 
um so  the  it was  t it was tired 
I'd  I would get tired 
um but I had chemo every two weeks 
and uh my hair came back 
and  that's where I am now 
uh not all that much 
um clears
I'm a  I'm a very bad uh eater when it comes to nutrition 
uh fish 
um but it  it  it wasn't all that much t to do 
the  the chemo was the  the primary source of  of treatment of_course 
uh the oncologist um was very responsive 
and he  you_know he  he gave uh me antinausea medication 
but I didn't  I took it once during the whole treatment time 
and  and even then it wasn't because I was starting to  to vomit 
I just felt a bit queasy 
um a_lot_of rest 
I slept a_lot um and had tender loving care from Firstname 
so  um ih ip it  I didn't do a_lot different you_know 
um  so  I  I really can't go beyond that 
it was the chemotherapy and the rest 
uh you_know  um that was pretty much it 
well  I guess one of the most important things 
I think  I think last week I mentioned my son's birth so I  I won't go through that again 
um another milestone was  was getting a job at Montclair_State 
uh I  I had  uh d I was a speech clinician um doing work as a  as a  s a speech language pathologist 
but I missed um interacting with students 
uh I had  and  and  and I  I had some experience in doing that because I  my undergraduate degree was in history 
and I actually did student teach uh at a high school uh ih ih in history and had planned to do that 
uh but then things  things sort_of changed obviously 
um but I  d I  I missed that kind of interaction 
I worked mostly with children uh when I was a speech clinician 
and uh mur Firstname was teaching English at the high_school level 
and she would come b back home with stories about you_know working with students and discussions they had in class 
and I was sorta jealous um of that 
and so when I was invited to  um to become an instructor here I jumped at the chance 
that  that changed everything 
um click and I was warned that  from  from ih friends  ug uh uh colleagues that I was taking a big d risk in  in doing this because I wasn't going to get tenure 
that they were  guh I was gonna be taken advantage of 
uh I don't know where they got the idea 
um uh but that I would  you_know I  w I would work for xl number of years and when it came time for tenure I wouldn't get tenure 
um but I wanted to be in the classroom so much 
um and it was more that than doing research actually 
it was actually teaching that drew me to it 
uh that I said 
 uh the heck with it 
 et you_know  I'm gonna do it 
and so I  I did 
and it  it changed everything 
and that was a very very positive uh event you_know 
and I spent forty five years after that laughs being here 
yeah 
so  yeah 
yeah laughs 
well no lucky for you 
okay  a young boy is kicking a soccer ball 
he's out uh I guess  in the backyard 
but as he's  k uh when he kicks it it goes through a window in the neighbor's house or maybe his own house um and lands on the lap of a  of a man sitting in a chair uh who then gets up holds the ball in his hand and looks out the  the hole in the window 
um and that's where it ends 
so  we don't know if he's gonna run after the kid if the kid is his own child or what 
but he's just I guess staring in disbelief that this happened 
this is a story about not listening to your mom uh especially a boy not wanting to carry an umbrella 
mother is suggesting that he  he do that 
that he's  i there's  r it's going to rain 
and he's  f he's rejecting the whole thing 
um says goodbye 
and mother's a bit dismayed because he's not taking the umbrella 
and sure enough once he's outside it starts to rain uh hard enough that he f hasta run back to the house 
he's not very happy 
um he's soaking wet 
mother is looking at him almost saying 
 see I told you show 
and next we see he's out back in the rain but with the umbrella 
well  it seems as though uh this y young girl's father climbed the tree in an attempt to rescue a cat who's up on a limb 
uh he himself though ends up being stuck 
his facial expression indicates that he  he's having difficulty ib ih moving one way or the other 
and uh ih being of no help the dog is uh barking making a racket 
and s someone evidently called the fire department 
and there are  two fireman have rushed over to the tree with a ladder 
and they're going to try to get him down 
his ladder  uh father's ladder um is on the ground uh I guess too far for anyone to retrieve it for him 
so  the fire  f fire department has come to rescue him and the cat I hope 
story of a young girl whose uh 
I guess she's uh a uh teenager 
whose mother dies and father remarries 
and she's introduced to her stepmother who herself has three daughters 
and um they immediately take advantage of Cinderella 
uh z s she becomes essentially their maid and housekeeper and uh hasta at at attend to their needs and the needs of the household 
and evidently father ha was of no help in mediating uh any of this 
so  the girl ends up uh uh being in a household but  but being rather a member of the household being a  uh a servant as I said 
one day uh a ball is announced 
she  s she lives in uh I guess  a principality uh headed by d you_know royalty 
and one day a ball is announced 
if I recall correctly it's because the prince uh is in need of finding a wife 
his father z s tells him that it's time for him to marry 
so  a ball is uh organized 
and all of the eligible young ladies uh in the principality are invited to attend 
um and the three stepsisters and  and uh their  muh their mother um go  plan to go 
and they get their gowns ready 
and Cinderella hasta help them with that too 
but it turns out that she's not gonna be allowed to go 
uh she of_course is very sad about that 
enter her fairy godmother 
um th th they g  they go off to the ball  the  the  the  the stepsisters and stepmother go off to the ball 
fairy godmother arrives on the scene and says to Cinderella 
 you're gonna go too 
 and we're gonna get you there by turning this pumpkin into a coach and these mice into coachmen 
um and I guess the mice too become horses 
I'm not sure which animals become the horses maybe the mice 
um she's outfitted  Cinderella's outfitted with a gown uh and a pair of ih ih gol uh glass slippers 
why glass 
I don't know 
um but she's told she hasta get home by  t by midnight 
because at the stroke of twelve everything's gonna turn back to what t it was 
the coach will become the pumpkin 
the coachmen will become the mice 
ih she'll lose her beautiful clothing 
so  she goes to the ball promises to  to leave by twelve 
uh but she's having a great time 
and the prince is very much drawn to her 
and uh she's still dancing when the clock strikes twelve but gets out in time um and gets  gets back home uh in time 
but as she's running out one of her slipper  uh g slippers comes off 
and the prince picks it up 
and it turns out that uh uh  she's the one that he wants 
and he figures he'll be able to find out who she is by fitting her foot or the foot of some young lady uh into the  s into the glass slipper 
so  um a hunt is organized so to speak where the prince goes around to each of the households in the principality and I guess  with his assistant asks each young lady to put a foot in the glass slipper 
and the  the  s the stepsisters of_course try 
and they don't fit 
and they try to f push their feet into that slipper 
and it doesn't work 
and they're very upset 
and lo_and_behold Cinderella's foot fits perfectly 
it was her slipper 
and they're very very surprised shocked and upset 
uh but  she's the one 
the prince is delighted 
and they end up being married and live happily ever after 
well as I said before I'm not very good at nutrition 
so  I would not use what looks like whole wheat bread 
I would use American white bread um two slices 
on one slice I would spread the peanut butter 
and the other slice I would spread the jelly and put the two together and have a sandwich
