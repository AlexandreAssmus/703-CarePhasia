haven't had that many 
but um when I was I guess  around twelve or thirteen I was a cheerleader 
and I was in practice 
and I was doing 
which I can't believe I did 
 but headstands and head  back flips 
and doing a flip I fell 
I tripped 
and I came down 
and I broke my arm 
so  I remember that instance 
I remember it quite clearly being driven 
uh it was a CYO thing 
so  I remember being driven in  in the car by the priest and the  my  my other friends around me and going to the hospital and  um and having my arm taken care of and having surgery 
so  
I was in a cast 
you hafta remember it was a long time ago 
so  I was in a cast 
and I was in a cast for a long time 
I do remember my father making me s um slings that were um  the holidays 
so  because it went through many holidays 
and  um and then once it was  uh you_know once it uh m 
I went back to being a cheerleader again 
um it's a_little misshapen 
but it's fine 
so  I no longer do back flips to say the least laughs 
well  my husband had a stroke in two thousand and eight 
well  the problems were that he  could not communicate 
right after his stroke he really had no language at all 
so  the speech therapy started very quickly for him in the hospital and  um and has continued at this clinic 
um and this is almost four years later since his stroke 
so  I've seen the development of the speech patterns emerging 
and um what I have seen is him  is him recapture language 
I I think very similar to what I see in a child 
so   in moving in  in increments moving quite quickly but moving in the same sort of pattern is what I see 
okay 
well  I guess the thing that always uh st stays with me right now is my husband's stroke and receiving that phone call early in the morning and  and hearing them say to me that my husband has had an accident 
and  and I remember asking the question 
 is he alive 
and it was such a strange question 
but uh I needed an answer to it 
and they said on the other  on the  su the other side of the phone um they didn't know 
and I remember getting dressed and rushing to get dressed and  and getting out there 
and I remember hearing the sirens as I was  as I was approaching 
and when I got there um you_know he had already been in a  st he had already been out 
um he didn't know who I was 
and he didn't know who anyone was 
but luckily and  um but luckily it was the police officer that found him who knew him 
so  they knew that he wasn't drunk 
they knew that he wasn't impaired in any other way 
and he knew enough to know that he was  he had a stroke 
and  I remember he was the one who said to me 
 get him down to UMDMJ as quick as possible 
and where the other people were asking me what hospital to take him to 
and I remember this police officer 
and luckily this police officer was someone who knew Anthony and was with him um when Anthony was on the force 
so  he came in as a  as a younger guy when Anthony was a lieutenant 
and so you_know I remember going to the hospital and following him down there and thinking that this was such a strange thing you_know in that it was very much like a  um like a movie or you_know 
but and I remember getting down into the  in into the brain attack center 
and um everybody was doing what they needed to do 
and it was all this kind_of prescribed dance that went on 
and um you_know getting him there and  and getting him that shot and  and that starting 
and  and  you_know  and then from there it was just the recovery 
it was the day in day out routine 
but um I do remember that 
that stays with me 
yeah  it does absolutely 
okay 
well  a boy is outside 
and he's playing  looks like soccer 
so  he's kicking the ball 
and lo_and_behold it goes  into the neighbor's or his own um window and crashes through that window 
and there's the  f the man who's sitting and either watching t_v or talking or having a conversation 
and the soccer ball comes through the window hits the lamp 
and um the gentleman inside is really quite surprised 
he then um has the ball in hand stands up and is looking for the young man 
and the mother is saying to him 
 take this umbrella because I think it's going to rain 
and he's saying 
 no no no I don't need that umbrella 
 I'm leaving 
so  she's got the umbrella in hand 
and he's out the door 
and then gasp lo_and_behold the rain starts 
and he is caught in the rain 
and he is really wet 
and he makes his way home 
and his mother is looking at him saying um h h 
 I told you so 
 and let's get the umbrella 
 and then you can go back out 
well  it's a series of circumstances 
and  the little girl's cat is in the tree 
she was  looks like she was riding her bike 
and she was  s um she saw her cat up in the tree 
she could have called her dad 
and her dad said 
 okay I'm going to help you and go get the cat 
and took the ladder 
and it doesn't seem like the ladder is quite as  l as uh high as what he needed to 
so  anyway the 
no  I'm sorry 
then it looks like he used the ladder 
and the ladder has fallen 
and he is stuck in the tree 
and  the dog is barking  because they are all up in the tree 
and the firemen hafta come and rescue 
when Cinderella was a little girl she was brought to a house 
and there was um a stepmother 
and the stepmother had two  daughters 
the father dies 
and the daughters  um the stepmother um has a sense of favoritism towards her children  her two daughters and relegates poor Cinderella to being a scullery maid and they  so to speak 
so  um Cinderella becomes a friend of the animals and a friend of the servants and  and all of that 
and then the  um the  s the stepsisters um  grow meaner and meaner as the time goes 
and the mother grows meaner and meaner and more  jealous of Cinderella 
um and then comes the  um the opportunity that the prince wants to marry and the opportunity for the  um for there to be a dance 
and everybody is all  um is all you_know looking for dresses and doing all of that and finding the  the perfect outfit 
and  and Cinderella um is not going to go to the ball 
and she is at home 
and  and  um and the sisters are all dressed and whatnot 
so they find  I think Cinderella finds a dress or something in the  in a   in a hope chest or I guess  what I would call now a hope chest 
and um so that becomes 
I don't  n wait a minute 
I guess that becomes the dress that she ends up wearing 
um so  the sisters go to the ball 
and  and s poor Cinderella is home with her mice 
and  and the fairy godmother makes her first appearance I believe 
so  the fairy p godmother creates the  um the carriage to take her in 
and the horseman and the dress and everything is perfect 
and  and her fairy godmothers then help her um to go to the ball 
so  when  when she goes to the ball she is the most gorgeous there 
and uh everyone is just gasp 
takes her breath away  and she takes their breath away 
and she meets the prince 
um and they dance 
and they have a wonderful time 
um but what happens is the clock strikes twelve 
and she needs to be home 
and um she is running out the door 
and her slipper is  her shoe is left behind 
so  she goes home 
the sisters and whatnot they all go home 
and  and now the prince is in search of this woman with the glass slipper 
and he combs through the village 
and the stepsisters wish to have their feet fit into the slippers 
and it doesn't work 
and then lo_and_behold he finds Cinderella 
and the f shoe fits 
they get married 
and they live happily ever after 
the end the end 
and way too many girls are looking for Prince_charming 
but that's a whole other issue yes 
I would get the bread 
first  well I would get the bread out_of the 
for me I keep my bread in the freezer 
so  I would take it out_of the freezer and let it defrost 
um my peanut butter stays in a cabinet 
my jelly is in the refrigerator 
so  the bread comes out first 
the peanut butter and then the jelly comes out 
um once the bread is defrosted I will then get a butter knife and put the peanut butter on first 
and then put the jelly on on top of the peanut butter 
put the other slice of bread on 
and slice it in a triangle motion 
there you go
