hm  you mean in terms of how I felt or what happened 
uh I was  I was thrown off of a horse once which was was quite traumatic 
and uh the horse reared up and seemingly simultaneously kicked back 
and I was thrown in the air and tumbled uh pretty much head over heels in front of the horse 
and I was out with a group of horses uh riding along a beach 
and the  the rest of them were behind me and just went galloping over me 
and um it  it was  that was really scary 
I  I love horses 
I love all animals 
but I never went uh horseback riding again 
it was serious and I ended up with a serious back injury 
it didn't manifest right away which I found out in my travels through the uh osteopathic world that they oftentimes don't 
sometimes years can go by before you realize that there's been a disc injury or anything like that which is why most people don't connect it with an accident 
sometimes you_know great  a great deal of time could go by  years 
and suddenly they aren't saying 
 oh  I remember I fell off that horse five years ago 
you_know  they're thinking what happened to me yesterday or last week laughs so 
but that was traumatic 
 noone trampled me but it  it 
yeah  and the  the terror of watching them you_know running over me laughs 
it was pretty bad 
yeah  yeah  no  it was very scary 
my back 
oh  yeah 
um when it first went out so to speak I uh um ended up seeing an orthopedic  surgeon 
uh didn't want surgery 
totally against it 
was lucky enough to find an osteopath who um 
he's not a chiropractor but they do manipulations 
and I've met people who have had surgery 
and I'm doing way better than them 
I've had um about three rounds of physical therapy 
and I also um began doing weight work to strengthen my upper body 
there was a time where I could you_know be taking a gallon of milk or a half gallon of milk out_of the dairy case 
and it would go right to my fifth lumbar 
so  now my  my biceps and shoulders have been strengthened with regular weight work 
so  there are things you can do you_know 
and I'm doing better than  many people 
the disc d was cracked 
so  uh but surgery never seems to be a solution 
 no 
 no 
I understand how to lift and bend 
and I just strengthened myself 
mhm 
not really 
I_mean from time to time in our day to day you'll encounter people um but never you_know a  for a sustained period of time or did I ever work with any person like that 
oh yes 
no  it usually goes pretty well 
 a combination of um demonstrating and signs you_know showing them something and what little what few words I do know 
well  um maybe more than a few words in some languages 
and they tend to know a little bit of English 
um I remember I was  I was in Frankfurt once by myself and I ended up going to uh a pub 
I don't think they called them that in Germany laughs 
but anyway uh I had a wonderful time talking to people 
I don't speak German 
and a_lot_of Germans do have some you_know language recognition in terms of English 
but I tend to get along  okay 
there are way  other ways than words to communicate 
and it's fun 
um when my daughter was born laughs 
favorite day of my life well the worst and the best 
um I had  I had a marvelous pregnancy and the birth from hell 
and it was just  it had no  like you_know that old song what a difference a day makes laughs 
I_mean laughs from the pregnancy which was just wonderful 
I ate everything I wanted 
I felt terrific 
I was working full time 
uh my freezer looked like an Oreida convention 
I could eat my  you_know my crinkle cuts my shoe strings with pasta 
I could do anything 
I looked like Meatloaf by the time I got to the hospital I hafta say 
laughs my  my  my obstetrician you_know during the  the buildup to this would say you'll be sorry laughs 
and I said you_know I cannot imagine regretting this 
you_know  I'm eating  I'm making ice cream sandwiches with the  the  the  the 
it's two pieces of pound cake you_know with the Hagen_Dazs in  in the middle 
so  then I get to the hospital 
and um it was really nasty laughs 
it was really  it was probably the worst experience I ever had 
um I was told that if I had um um automatic weapons there would have been noone alive left on the maternity ward laughs 
that's what I was told laughs 
and um I did  um it did spark um revenge in me that I actually carried out 
you_know  um my  my obstetrician kept coming at me with first what looked like a crochet hook 
he said 
 well  we're just going to break your water 
 it'll move things along 
I said 
 no laughs 
 don't 
 step back laughs 
 step back 
 just leave me alone 
 I can do this myself you_know 
and then um he kept saying 
 relax 
 I don't understand while you're not relaxed 
and this is psychological I'm sure 
every time he said relax I became even more infuriated 
you_know  this is the effect it had on me 
and he wasn't listening when I said stop saying that 
when you tell some one to stop doing X you expect them to stop doing that 
so  anyhow to fast forward my daughter was beautiful 
she was born smiling right away recognized my voice 
it was just the  n the most special experience of my whole life 
and um so now I went for my first postpartum checkup 
and I'm sitting on the table 
and he you_know does the finger pricks and  to get some blood out 
and he turns around 
and he puts the little tube in the machine 
and then he turns it on 
and the machine is whirring 
and I s quietly slid off the table and got him into a headlock 
it happened really fast 
and I threw him on to the table 
and then I jumped on top of him put my knee in his groin 
and I was r 
his glasses were askew 
and he  hi his tie was crooked 
and I said 
 relax 
 relax 
 I don't understand why you're not relaxed 
 what's the matter you_know laughs 
it was such a calamity 
and  laughs although you_know it was all in good fun because later on you_know he 
and his wife useta work in his office 
and they had a nurse too 
and they said 
 selfishly Linda we really would love you to have another baby because we never had an experience like that in our lives laughs 
 it's really selfish on I  on our part 
laughs  so that was it 
that's it Keli 
that was a big big experience you_know Pee_Wee's big adventure laughs 
well  it seems there's a boy out playing 
kicks the soccer ball 
unfortunately it goes right into the window breaks it 
I'm gonna guess that's his father sitting there 
now he gets the ball 
and he's looking at the  surveying the damage and his son  I guess 
and um it doesn't  doesn't look like it's going to end too  too well laughs 
might be a problem 
okay  well  here's this little child I guess  leaving for school 
mother saying 
 take your umbrella 
child says 
 no no I don't need an umbrella 
very optimistic 
I do the same thing 
now it's raining 
and now it's pouring 
and then the child comes home you_know obviously soaking wet 
the mother is kind_of in her I_told_you_soqadj mode 
and the little  the little boy I guess it is  he learned a lesson 
and there he is outside in the rain with his umbrella 
life is learning from one's mistakes laughs 
listen to your mother 
well  the cat's up in the tree 
they get stuck in trees  I guess 
I've  I've heard stories like that 
I guess it's the  um the father or maybe some friend passing by who stops to help the little girl that looks like she's ready to catch the cat 
the little dog of_course wants the cat down for different reasons 
and then the fire department shows up 
which  they're good like that 
they got the ladder 
and all is well 
so  Cinderella is sent to live with this  uh with a family 
and she is basically a  uh a maid 
and um they  there are the two  um stepsis the two 
I think it's the wicked stepsisters  if I recall 
and they were  they were rather homely laughs 
and uh Cinderella of_course was very pretty 
and she's very you_know sweet and helpful 
and these two are kind_of spoiled and you_know not very pleasant 
and there's going to be uh uh a ball 
and I  I believe invitations go out 
and the two sisters are going to  um uh they're going to go to the ball 
and Cinderella is not invited 
and somehow the fairy godmother steps in 
and Cinderella ends up with uh 
well  it's all magical you_know right 
the pumpkin that turns in to a beautiful coach 
and by dint of you_know luck and good favor from the uh fairy godmother Cinderella does go to the ball 
I believe that the caveat was that she needed to be home by midnight 
so  she's dancing with the prince having a wonderful time 
the other two sisters I  I forgot where 
they just kind_of melted into the background 
they weren't very popular laughs 
I could have told you that from the beginning you_know 
but anyhow um Cinderella finds out what time it is 
and she needs to leave you_know uh to get into the  the  the carriage to go back before midnight 
and she  um her slipper fill 
and the prince finds it 
and then a whole edict goes out in the town or the village that you_know he wants to find this  uh this beautiful girl who lost the slipper and whoever fits into the slipper 
uh I remember the details now from my own picture book 
put it on 
when  when one of the sisters took her shoe off she even had ugly feet 
and the slipper was like even half  not even half the size of her foot 
so  anyway they locked Cinderella up 
I think nobody wanted them to find her 
and the mice helped 
they brought the key 
and the mice  she  you_know the animals loved her 
they were her friends 
and of_course it all ends happily ever after 
she does  it does  it is discovered that the slipper fits her 
and she lives happily ever after with the handsome prince 
just the way we all live 
it's exactly what my experience has been laughs 
it's the same thing 
it's like they  it's like they met me 
and they  reali you_know they  they  it was the  s you_know really it was like they knew me 
it's so uncanny 
alright  well  first of all I would like two pieces of bread to be in this picture 
um now when I make a sandwich 
and it's not just with peanut butter and jelly 
I  I like to make sure when I put the slices out that the contours are going to match up you_know 
it's got to be just right 
so  anyway depending upon how you like things you could put the peanut butter 
again two slices of bread is nice but for this we'll put the peanut butter on first uh with a knife 
and then I usually use a spoon for the jelly a little teaspoon so I can spread it around 
and it  it just works better than with the knife 
and that's it 
you_know  in this case you could cut it in half fold it in half get another piece 
you_know  if I had two pieces I would have put the peanut butter on both sides the jelly in the middle you_know like that 
and that's it 
I like a good sæmɪdʒu
