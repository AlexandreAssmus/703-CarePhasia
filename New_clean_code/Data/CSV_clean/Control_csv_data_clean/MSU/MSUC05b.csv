oh that's right 
I  uh injury  I broke my right wrist one time in nineteen ninety two or three when my son was just an infant 
I was going to a store to get some  an ice cream 
I was really hungry 
I had just worked really hard that morning 
and as I was walking up I was looking at the sign saying 
 if they sell cheeseburgers I'm getting one 
and with that I tripped over the parking cement block and fell on my wrist 
and immediately a big uh ball popped out_of my wrist 
and I couldn't move my fingers 
so  I drove myself left handedly to Mountainside hospital to the emergency room and hadta wear a cast 
and it was  uh it was  it was interesting mainly in my  c my  um in the way I hadta take care of my son more than anything 
but of_course I couldn't work either 
um but it presented a challenge 
I learned how to do things lefthanded 
I hadta write lefthanded 
I hadta be able to take care of him and open baby food jars 
and that was in  um I think it was in May 
and I know he had a surgery a few weeks later so I was in the hospital in Columbia_Presbyterian with him with the cast on 
we have these pictures 
and I remember he had like a little um kind_of like a scrape on the back of his head or just  not  not a  like a bloody thing but a  w a  kind_of like a wornout spot from when I would scoop him up with the cast 
um I don't actually remember doing physical therapy 
once I had the cast off I think I was fine 
and I regained all the strength in my wrist 
I think six weeks 
yes it was my dominant hand 
yes I do 
you_know  my cousin Ann um she's seventy one now 
and she had a stroke when she was sixty six 
and so she's lefthanded 
and so she lost the use of her right side 
her hand is all mangled and her foot also 
and her communication skills are very limited 
she  it's aphasia is what I think she has 
and uh she's gotten progressively better over the years 
initially she could just repeat the same phrase over and over again 
she useta always say 
 zoom zoom zoom zoom 
and uh I always thought because she was in a car  she was sitting in a  p her parked car when she had the stroke 
and um she doesn't say that anymore 
but a_lot of the people where she lives that's her nickname Zoom_zoom because she useta say that a_lot 
but she's very challenging to communicate with 
um and I'll go see her and spend and hour or so 
and we have lunch 
and um things and we try to communicate as well  as best as we can with asking her simple questions 
and she communicates in sort_of a roundabout way 
she has three children 
and when she wants to talk about them she aw can't always get their names but she'll say one two or three 
and that's how we know because sometimes she brings a_lot_of numbers in 
so  when she tries to tell you she's in pain she'll t take her good hand 
and she'll say 
 one two three four five uf pain 
 I don't know 
 I don't know 
like that 
she  somehow it's amazing how she communicates 
I give her a_lot_of credit 
yeah 
okay  um I would like to tell you the story um about my grandfather 
because he was the  one of the most important people in my life when I was a child 
and I was  g it was the summer when I was going into kindergarten 
it was in July 
and um it was just a normal day 
I was a happy carefree child playing with my friend down the street 
and it was back in the day when there was a_lot_of freedom 
you  you went out the door and came in for lunch 
and then you went out the door 
and there really weren't very many parameters 
and there were lots of fun adventures to be had 
and um came home to find out that he had had a 
he  th they didn't use the word stroke but that's what he had 
um that he hadta go to the hospital from work 
and so my friend and I remember got cookies together and put them on the counter saying when grandpa comes home he'll have these cookies 
and then the next morning I remember waking up 
and I still have the scene in my mind of what it looked like 
I have that feeling of what it felt like um to find out that you know he wasn't coming home and just as a child an innocent child um kind_of coming to terms with life and death saying wow and really being blindsided by the whole thing 
having that be my first experience with death 
and um you_know I had  my four sisters were there and my cousin who um is in the nursing home 
she was around because she  she kind_of lived with us for awhile 
and it was just  she actually  I remember she slapped me because I was crying so hard 
everyone went to the  all the adults went to the funeral at night 
I just remembered that 
and I was hysterical crying 
I was so so sad 
and she didn't know what to do so she actually slapped me to get me 
and it worked 
she wasn't being mean 
but I was beyond being consoled at that point 
and I  I felt very alone in my um grief for some reason even though my sisters had a nice relationship with this man who's my grandfather 
but anyway that  that  that was a theme that came through my life in lots of different ways in the future 
and I remember a time when um I was in sixth grade 
and we were having a sleepover in my friend's back yard 
happened to be with a  w a girl who lost her dad in the Newark riots a girl who lost her young brother to leu leukemia a  g the other girl who lost her grandmother 
and I had lost my grandfather 
and we  it was like they  they could make a movie about the bond 
we were all in the tent 
and  and we were just talking 
I re can see us all sitting there 
and we each took a turn to share our story about this loss in our life 
and we put it out there 
it was probably the safest place to ever let it go 
and we all just  just let it out 
and I remember feeling so empowered by that and finally feeling like I could share this 
and it's t a good thing 
so  that's why I think this story is  is m so important to me was because it's something that affected my life you_know as I grew up 
and also as I had mentioned yesterday that um I didn't know about angels then 
but now I believe very strongly that my grandfather is part of this other part of the universe 
and he can uh sort_of watch over me if you will 
yeah uh one fine spring day this young boy was happily playing outside with his soccer ball kicking the ball 
and inadvertently it went through the window uh of his  his house where his dad was sitting inside reading the paper 
and the ball came in and startled the dad and knocked over the lamp 
and he stood up and looked out the window 
and he saw that it was his son that had knocked the ball through the window 
he um kind_of shook his head but remembered when he was a kid and did the same thing 
and he was going to go speak to his son about that 
okay  well  i Johnny was on his way to school 
and before he left mom had heard the weather report so she said 
 Johnny take your umbrella 
and he said 
 nope mom 
 I don't think it's going to rain today so I  I don't wanna take it 
so  off he went without his umbrella 
and sure enough it started to rain 
and it  it started to rain harder 
and he got wet 
so  he turned around and came back home and faced his mom and said 
 you were right mom 
 I needed my umbrella 
then he took his umbrella and went off 
and mom hoped that he had learned a lesson of uh taking her advice next time 
it's always good to give him the benefit of the doubt though 
 okay um Sally and her dad were uh walking around the park one day 
Sally was riding her tricycle 
and um as they were coming along they noticed that a dog chased a cat up a tree 
and her dad  um she urged her dad to help the cat 
and um so uh he fetched a ladder and climbed up the tree 
and then the ladder fell down because the dog knocked it over 
and um some neighbors nearby saw that this was going on so they called the uh fire department 
and sure enough the fire department came to uh help retrieve the dad from the tree  and the cat 
and at the end of the day every one was fine 
sighs once upon a time  in a land far away there was a uh little girl named Cinderella 
and she was brought to the home of a  a woman and two daughters because her family could no longer care for her 
and she thought this would be wonderful to have some sisters 
but as it turned out the sisters were not very nice and neither was the  the mom  her stepmom 
and they actually put her to work 
and she hadta do many of the chores in the house while the other girls were left to do whatever they chose 
um but Cinderella  was happy nonetheless 
and she busied herself with her chores and her animal friends the mice and the  birds and such 
and she was a very kindred spirit that Cinderella 
and um she got news or overheard news that in the kingdom they were going to have a ball where the prince would be looking for a bride 
and they invited all of the eligible women from the kingdom 
and in her heart she thought 
 oh  I would just love to go to that ball 
and uh she soon found out from her wicked stepmother that of_course she wasn't going to go to the ball because she was just Cinderella 
and uh but the stepsisters were going to go 
and she hadta help them prepare their outfits and get ready to go to the ball 
and uh Cinderella was sad 
she went off to the side and had some quiet time with her animal friends who were very encouraging and said 
 we'll help you Cinderella 
and they brought out some ribbon and some  some threads and put together a beautiful dress for her 
and um she had the dress 
but she had no way of getting to the ball 
and she was out in the garden when suddenly someone appeared 
and it was her fairy godmother 
and her  fair my 
 don't cry my child 
 I know you wanna go to the ball 
 and  and I can help you 
 just fetch me a pumpkin 
 and I'll turn it into a coach 
 and your mice friends will be the coachmen 
and so she worked her magic and turned these things into the coach and the  the coachmen 
and off she went to the ball feeling like the luckiest girl in the world 
and when she got there she w approached the ball and looked down the stairs 
and there everyone was dancing 
and they saw her come in 
they turned and looked at her 
and sh the prince  looked 
and he thought she was the most am amazing and beautiful woman he had ever seen 
he invited her to dance 
and they just had a nice connection 
and she um engaged him in dancing and perhaps some singing 
and um suddenly the time had gone by 
and it was midnight 
and she had been warned by her fairy godmother that the magic would end at midnight 
so  quick she ran from the castle 
and in doing so she lost one of her shoes which was a glass slipper 
and she found her way home 
and um clears
so  he went from door to door throughout the kingdom to uh find them 
and everyone tried on the slipper 
and when he came to the house of the  where Cinderella and her stepsisters lived the stepsisters tried to jam their big feet into the slipper 
and uh it didn't quite work 
but the  Cinderella apparently was locked up in her room upstairs 
and the mice gave her the key 
and she got out 
she came down 
and she said she'd like to try on the slipper 
and with that she tried on the slipper 
and her fairy god 
but as it was they  she tried on the slipper 
he knew that she was the princess that he wanted 
and they got married 
and they lived happily ever after 
I'd like to think that she forgave the stepsisters laughs and was kind to them in spite of their wickedness 
yes  well  if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would get two pieces of glutenfree bread from the freezer 
put them on a paper towel on the counter 
I'd get the peanut butter out and the jelly and a knife and a spoon 
and I'd open up the peanut butter 
and I'd  scoop out  some peanut butter spread it on the bread 
close the jar 
I'd use the spoon to get the jelly out_of the jar 
I'd put it on the other slice of bread 
clear
put the jar  the lid back on the jar 
I'd put the peanut butter and jelly back 
I'd put the lid 
and I probably would not cut it in half 
and I would take it to a table 
and I would enjoy that peanut butter and jelly sandwich
