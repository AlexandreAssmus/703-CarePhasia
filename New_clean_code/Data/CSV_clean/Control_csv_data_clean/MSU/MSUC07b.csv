alright uh back when I was in high school I broke my collar bone uh in physical education class 
I was a senior in high school 
and I was playing third base in gym class 
we  pl we were playing softball 
and I was playing third base 
and it was a ground ball 
I kind_of moved over toward the short stop 
and the short stop charged in to get it and ran into me and kind_of hit my shoulder and snapped my collar bone 
and it was uh in the springtime 
so  it was  I  uh you_know they hadta  I'd never broken a bone 
they hadta call my father and get him to come and get me 
and take  uh then I  we  the field was about half a mile from the school 
so  I hadta walk back to the school with this dangling arm 
and  um and they said my arm was broken 
and they put this harness on me that kind_of pulls your shoulders back and keeps it straight 
and uh so I got to wear that for my prom and for graduation 
and there was a uh miserable injury 
I'll say that 
no  really you just  it's a harness that they hold your shoulders back so the bones line up and uh you_know meet up when  while they heal 
and uh otherwise it's just limited activity for awhile 
right around the funnest time of the year 
 yeah it did 
um yeah I uh go  uh I distribute communion in the uh nursing home once a month 
and many of the residents of the nursing home are at different stages of their life where some of them are very communicative and are making a_lot_of sense and some are not so communicative 
and you_know you end up you_know using  my modified sign language and trying to talk to them and trying to you_know coax them into talking to you  communicating with you 
and uh you_know you do a_lot_of different things like make  you_know with trying to make facial expressions and trying to  you_know to just kind_of jar them back to the present so they can determine whether they're even ready to take communion 
uh but you_know that's kind_of  it's a_lot_of  it's a_lot more  a_lot less verbal and a_lot more you_know trying to make a personal connection with them 
uh when 
I'll talk about my other daughter 
when Erin was born uh and we  it was uh a little postdated the energy  s
and she was a little bit late so they decided she would  they would induce her 
and she  we went to the hospital 
it was all planned 
it was only going to be a couple of hours 
and it ended up being of_course like thirteen hours 
um but the exciting part about it was when the baby was finally born being able to go out and get my parents and Eileen's parents from the waiting room and bring them into the room so they could see the baby 
and it was the first  my parents' first grandchild so a really exciting time 
and I have three brothers 
so  it was a really exciting for my parents to have a granddaughter too to have a girl 
so  um you_know it was  ju the whole  thing was just that  being that  we knew the day it was going to happen there was a little more planning to be done 
and a little  but it made it so exciting because we knew our  gran that the grandparents could be there 
and we could be  you_know it could be exciting for everybody 
yes it was 
so  the boy is practicing playing soccer and kicking the ball up in the air 
and he kicks it just a little bit too hard 
and it goes through the window uh of the house 
and lands right next to his father and knocks the lamp over 
and his father gets up and gets the ball and looks out the window at him angrily 
and uh I'm sure he's on the other end running from his father 
the little boy is getting ready to go to school 
and his mother is suggesting that he take the umbrella with him to school and  uh because it's sposta rain 
and he tells her he doesn't need it 
and he walks out the door 
and you_know he just barely gets away from the house 
and it starts really raining hard 
so  he hasta run all the way back to the house soaking wet and see his mother and then ask her 
 you know what you were right 
 I needed the umbrella after all 
uh the little girl's cat climbed up the tree 
uh it was probably forced up the tree by the barking dog 
and she  so the cat got stuck in the tree 
and the little girl got her father to come with his ladder and try and get the cat out 
but when the father got up into the tree to try to retrieve the cat his ladder fell 
so  then they hadta call the firemen to come and rescue both the cat and the father  and get the barking dog away from the tree 
so  once there was a little girl and her father who lived alone 
and the father met a  w a woman and decided to get married 
and this woman had two daughters 
uh and the  so the  they became a family 
and quickly the new mother who  uh became hostile toward Cinderella in favor of her own daughters 
so  she  they forced Cinderella to do all the chores around the house and take care of all the needs of the uh stepmother and the two  the stepmother's two daughters 
uh and as they grew up Cinderella just started taking care of all that stuff for everybody 
uh and then one day there was going to be a ball 
the king was going to have a  a large party for his son because he wanted his son to meet a wife 
and he invited all of the unmarried women in the kingdom to this party 
uh and Cinderella wanted to go 
but her  step her stepmother said that she could go as long as everybody else's needs were taken care of first everyb her  the two sisters' dresses were ready and everything else 
so  Cinderella got it all ready 
and in the meantime her  the mice sewed a  a beautiful dress for Cinderella to wear 
um so  after she got all of  everybody ready to go she went up and got ready herself 
and then the sisters saw the dress that she had was more beautiful than theirs 
and they tore it and tore it basically off of her 
so  she thought she wouldn't be able to go to the ball 
and then she met her  she w ran out into the back garden of the castle 
and she met her  fairy godmother 
and the fairy godmother told her that you're going to go to the ball 
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach 
and she gave Cinderella a beautiful gown 
and she put the  she turned the mice into the horses 
and she went off to the ball 
and the  but there was one stipulation is that she hadta be home  she hadta leave the ball by midnight because at midnight everything would go back to the way it was 
so  she went to the ball 
and she met the prince 
and they fell in love 
and then the  all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock strike twelve 
and she immediately tried  ran out_of the ball hadta get out_of there before she turned back into Cinderella 
and she lost her shoe on the step of the  uh of the palace 
um but there was nothing she could do 
she just kept running 
and the next day the king's  minions if you will went around from house to house until they found which one of the fair maidens lost that shoe 
and they found that it was Cinderella after they tried the shoes on the two stepsisters who couldn't fit into it 
they found Cinderella fit into the shoe 
and she married the prince and lived happily ever after 
I would put the bread down 
and then I would spread the peanut butter on top of the bread 
and then I would spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter 
and then put a second piece of bread on top of it
