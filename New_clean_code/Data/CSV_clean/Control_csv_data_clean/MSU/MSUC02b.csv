uh well  the illness would have  the big one I guess  would have been uh breast cancer 
and I had that in two thousand and five 
I had an elec lumpectomy in October 
and then they didn't get it all 
and I hadta have another one in  in December 
and they didn't get it all 
and it was my last chance in_order_to save my breast 
I had  I had one more in February of two thousand and six 
and that one worked 
that was  that was good so 
um it  uh I remember recuperating was a long process 
I also had radiation 
and it made me tired 
um but I worked  I worked every day 
I didn't miss any work 
still came to work 
um it was therapeutic to come to work uh just to  because if I was home I would go nuts thinking about stuff 
so  it was good to be busy and come to work 
and um I got through it 
you_know  and  and luckily all is well yet  you_know 
so  that's a uh 
but it's uh it was a long haul at the time 
sleep a_lot 
I slept a_lot whenever I was tired and  which would happen randomly 
um not at work 
I didn't  I didn't sleep at work though you_know laughs 
but I felt like it  I know 
but I  um like I'd  I'd come home from work and just take a nap before I even had dinner with my husband 
like we'd  we'd take a nap 
and then  uh and then got up and had dinner and took another nap and then went to bed 
but uh I slept a_lot 
um that's about all I remember as far as the uh 
it  w I guess it was a way of uh dealing with it too 
like you_know at the time I  I was  if I slept I didn't hafta think about things 
so  it was uh 
but uh my husband was real great 
he took good care of me 
and my daughter 
and  and um I don't know what I would have done without them 
they were  they were good 
yeah  have good support you have  it makes you better real fast you_know 
uh well  I have  I have an eight eighteen month old grandson who's just learning how to speak 
and uh um but yet I understand what he wants you_know by  by you_know like the different sounds mean different things even though they're not English 
uh you kinda know what he's talking about 
and uh uh otherwise uh 
well  I do have a  my  my  my  um my stepdaughter's inlaws uh speak Spanish 
and uh the  the  the  uh her mother inlaw does speak a little English but not much at all 
and the  f her father inlaw doesn't speak any English so 
and I don't speak any Spanish so 
but we do  we do have a conversation 
it's kind_of funny 
I don't know if we're talking about the same thing 
but we  you_know we both seem to think we are 
but  uh and we  uh like he passes me the things when I need it at the table  you_know 
like if there's salt and pepper like uh 
so  I  d we  you_know you do  you find sign language 
but you make your own sign language I guess  if you  you_know if you don't know sign language 
which but you you_know you  there's ways of indicating what you need or wants  m
I guess they know 
that uh but that's I guess that's the only  I  my mom had a stroke in two thousand and nine uh but didn't recover from it 
she  uh she  she passed away from it 
so that was  you_know so that was  I only had three days of dealing with uh her  her speaking 
but uh and it was  it was repetitive 
like she was like stuttering speaking at that point 
everything was uh 
 I  I need  need  need  need 
you_know  it was like that kind of talk 
it was hard for her 
but  um but then I really didn't  I didn't have that long a  long a time t t to really develop any kind of a language with her 
about something that happened 
hm  well I remember when my kids were  my  my son and daughter were in um middle school 
and every President's_Day week we useta take the auto train down to Florida for that week and meet my parents down in  um down Di by Disney_World and go to Disney_World 
and uh the one time we got on the train my husband worked for the train 
and uh there was a deadhead 
uh deadhead means when they're towing uh the  a part of a train back to where it needs to be 
there was a deadhead  deadheaded presidential car being towed back uh to uh 
well  actually I guess it's  we  r we rode it the whole way 
it was going down to Florida 
because it  it wasn't just to DC 
well  we picked it up in DC 
so  we went all the way to Florida in that one 
uh so  we ended up uh being able to use the presidential car 
and uh we each  on the train we each had our 
my  it was my son my daughter myself and my husband 
and we each had our own bed our own bathroom 
um it was  and it was just  uh it was just amazing to go  to travel like that 
how I guess the  uh the rich and famous travel like that 
but it was  I said to my kids 
 enjoy it now because we're never probably gonna ever do this again you_know 
it was  it was amazing 
but it  uh and to lay in bed and watch as you're looking out the window at uh the scenery going by 
it was just  and we had two pillows each you_know 
it was  it was just living it on the train 
it was so nice 
and uh and we went to Disney_World too 
that was fun too 
but the train ride was an amazing trip 
it was  it was fun 
and uh that was I guess  one thing that I do remember 
that was fun  a really fun time that we had on the train 
well  there's this little boy who's outside with a soccer ball 
and he's kicking it around 
and he's kicking it around 
and all_of_a_sudden he kicks it a_little too hard 
and it goes into the window where it comes almost on the lap of uh the man sitting in his chair 
and uh it startles him gets him scared 
and he gets up 
and he's looking out the window for that little boy 
I'm sure that little boy took off 
you_know  but he  uh he's looking out the window for him 
well  there's this little boy again and his mom 
and he's off to go to school 
and his mom says 
 you_know it looks like it's gonna rain 
 you better take the umbrella 
and he says 
 mom I don't need the umbrella 
 it's not gonna rain 
 I'm not gonna need it 
and he leaves to go 
and all_of_a_sudden it starts raining 
and it starts raining raining 
he gets drenched 
and he hasta turn around and go back and tell his mom 
 you were right 
 it's raining 
 and I need the umbrella 
and he gets the umbrella and goes off to school 
that's  uh moms always know 
well  it looks like I think  there was a cat that was being chased by a dog up the tree 
and the little girl it was her cat 
and  she's  she wants her cat to get down from the tree 
and so I imagine it's her father that uh decides to climb up the tree 
but he gets stuck up the tree 
he can't get down 
and finally somebody called the fire department to come rescue all of them 
they  uh the father and the cat were stuck up the tree 
so  uh they  uh the fire department came through again 
so  it's a story about a daughter and her father 
and her mother dies 
and her father remarries 
and the woman he mar marries has two daughters 
who  the  the stepmother thinks her daughters are  beautiful magnificent and uh does doesn't want Cinderella to get any  anything once the father passes away 
like makes Cinderella do all the work 
and uh her  she wants uh Cinderella to be her servant and  uh and clean the house 
and there's this handsome prince that lives um in town 
and the f prince's father the king decides it's time for his daughter 
and he sends a notice out to everyone in town all the women that are eligible to come and uh to a ball  to dress up and come to this ball 
and Cinderella wants to go 
and uh the  she gets her dress 
I think it was her mother's dress if I remember correctly 
and she's gonna wear that 
and the sisters find her trying it on 
and they  they rip it on her and make a mess of the dress 
and so she can't go to the ball in that dress 
and off the  sis the  the stepsisters go to the ball 
and the fairy godmother comes and helps Cinderella out and makes her this most gorgeous woman in a white dress and her hair up 
and she looked just  gorgeous 
and sends her off to the ball with a coach and a coachman 
and uh goes to the ball with glass slippers 
and dances with the prince 
and the prince falls in love 
and the only one thing was that she hadta be  leave the ball by twelve o'clock on the strike of twelve 
she hadta  get out_of there or she was gonna turn back into her rag clothes again 
so  she was having a wonderful time 
and she  hasta leave the ball when the  when the clock starts striking twelve 
and she loses one of her glass slippers 
and the prince finds the slipper and sends his men out to find who can fit this s glass slipper 
and finally they  they  um they weren't gonna try Cinderella because she  they  nobody thought she was at the ball 
but they finally try her foot in the slipper 
and it fits perfectly 
and she turns back into this gorgeous gown and clothing again 
and  and uh the prince marries her 
and they live happily ever after 
okay 
uh to make a sandwich if I'm gonna make a whole sandwich I would use two pieces of bread 
and smear the peanut butter on one half and the jelly on the other half of bread 
and then put them together 
and cut it in half or fours whatever way you like it 
and eat it
