yes I had in  um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst that was being monitored by my doctor 
and he told me that if  as long as I resumed regular activities nothing would happen 
and two days later it ruptured 
and I was rushed to the hospital in an ice storm 
and uh fortunately it was  y he needed do surgery 
but after that I was  fine 
and I remember the pain being worse than any pain I've ever experienced 
so  that's the f first thing that came to mind 
it was sposta have been done laparoscopically 
and it could not be 
so  it was full blown surgery 
and I remember being  um I was m obviously much younger 
I remember being very sore for a very long period of time and that walking across the street was a painful experience 
and I hadta go very slowly 
and I was out_of work for a long time which is what I remember the most 
and then little by little I just got my strength back until ges
I had the  the privilege of working um with a hippotherapy um organization at one of the riding academies with occupational therapists who uh worked with children with multiple sclerosis and  uh and other debilitating diseases who could not communicate verbally 
and it was very interesting to learn cues and learn how to interpret what it was that they were saying 
and also how not to be manipulated by the fact that they knew that the right cry at the right time would  would elicit your sympathy 
and you just sort_of hadta tell them to you_know to b to buck up and do it 
um but it was very  it was a very interesting learning process to figure out how to do that 
and now of_course here I'm doing that in  in  um in a much broader spectrum 
there are several 
um let me think what would be a good story 
well  very recently um two thousand six my husband and I decided to go on a quest to see a baseball game in every major league ball park in the country 
and since we didn't have complete leisure time we div divided it up year after year and geographically planned a way to get to see a baseball game in every major league  coun uh major league stadium in the country 
and in two thousand twelve we completed that 
and we have actually seen thirty games in thirty stadiums in  in thirty  cities 
yeah  and it was absolutely wonderful 
and then of_course they went ahead and built a new stadium in Miami 
so  on Memorial_day weekend we flew down to Miami for a day to see a baseball game there 
and um in August we'll be driving out to Minnesota to see a game there because they built a new stadium there 
so  when we hear if you build it they will come we think it's meant for us and that we're going to go see baseball games 
um and even_though I had been in the travel industry for many many years and we had traveled extensively internationally these baseball trips were the most fun we have ever had 
it was hours and hours and hours in the car seeing parts of the country that we'd never seen or never would have seen 
and it was just the  the  the best six years the best time I can  I can recall 
and we love to talk about it 
yep 
okay  um there's a young boy kicking a soccer ball 
um he doesn't know his own strength so he kicks it har very far and very hard 
and it breaks the window 
and the gentleman sitting inside the living room is very surprised to see the ball 
and then picks up what looks like an animal of some kind and is looking out the window to see who kicked 
oh that's the ball 
I'm sorry 
he's holding the ball 
and he's looking out the window to see who kicked the ball 
okay  um a little boy is leaving for school 
and his mother obviously thinks it's going to rain or knows it's going to rain offers him the umbrella 
and he says 
 no mom I don't need it 
 see ya 
 I'm leaving without the umbrella 
and as he starts walking to school it starts raining and raining harder 
and he gets really really wet 
so  he comes back to the house to a very disapproving mother who then gives him the umbrella keeping him dry 
and he's  he's happier at the end 
okay  the beginning of the story is that there is a cat stuck in the tree 
the little girl seems very distraught that the cat is stuck in the tree 
uh a man who I would assume is her father tried to climb the tree to save the cat 
and the ladder fell either by the dog or by its own measure 
and now the man is stuck in the tree as_well 
and the  defi the fire department is coming with another ladder to get the man and the cat out_of the tree 
okay  um Cinderella is a story about a little girl uh who goes to live with her stepmother and her two stepsisters who are spoiled 
and she is not treated as an equal 
she is treated as a real stepchild 
and she gets the name Cinderella because she hasta clean the cinders out_of the fire 
and she grows up in that role where her  s her stepsisters are always treated like princesses and she is not 
and the king of the kingdom decides that he wants to have a ball for his son to meet a woman to marry 
and the invitation comes 
and Cinderella is very happy until she realizes that she will not be going to the ball 
and her sisters get all dressed up and go to the ball 
and Cinderella thinks she won't go until her fairy godmother shows up and with the help of the woodland creatures um makes a dress for her so she can go to the ball 
noone knows who she is 
and part of that is the glass slippers 
she has her glass slippers 
and she gets into the pumpkin that's turned into the carriage 
she rides to the ball 
but she must be back by midnight because all the spells will be gone after midnight 
so  she goes to the ball 
and she has a wonderful time 
and the clock strikes twelve 
and she's running out_of the ballroom 
and she loses a glass slipper 
and the prince decides that since this is the woman he wants to marry he's going to try that glass slipper on every woman in the kingdom until he finds his  his true love 
and he comes to the house where the stepmother and the stepsisters live 
and the two  stepsis two stepsisters try on the slipper 
and of_course it does not fit 
and just as he is going to give Cinderella the slipper the stepmother tries to trip him 
but the slipper does not break 
she tries on the slipper 
it fits 
and they live happily ever after 
and that's about as concise as I could make the story of Cinderella 
I would take a knife 
um I would open up the jar of peanut butter and the jar of jelly 
and since there is only one piece of bread I would spread the peanut butter first 
and then I would spread the jelly 
and then I would fold the bread in half
