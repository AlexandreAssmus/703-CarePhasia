 the  sighs the most  the most memorable event was 
it  but I think I did tell you about it 
the  the yeah 
it was about the  the possible scare 
it was just a lump in  in my breast 
and that  w I'm  I'm pretty sure I recounted that I was alright with it because I had the focus of  of our son to think about 
and I didn't think because of my age or the  the risks that were involved that it was really going to be anything um more than precaution to do the  um the procedure 
click but as close as I came was uh you_know the  the hospital experience and people who were so attentive and  g and caring 
and I  I felt supported the whole  the whole time 
just that um I  I think I did tell you that when I woke up I wasn't sure whether the breast was gone or not because the bandage was so  um the uh dressings and bandage were so tight 
but I just remember thinking um the  s the they'll be  I'll do whatever I hafta do on it 
and whatever's next I'll find out about and take care of 
so  it's a moving progression 
I don't usually write the end of a story um if it's something like that 
if you tell me I'll say 
 oh  we'll go through it step by step 
 and we'll get there 
it was like that 
so  I'm fortunate that it hasn't been anything worse than that 
just  f I can only remember being busy because with  uh with uh a toddler 
he was a year old then 
and  uh and a dog and just the usual things of cooking cleaning and taking care of one another 
it was nothing short of click uh show up for a doctor's appointment but stay focused on other things that hadta be done 
so  I didn't think about 
uh I knew I had  it was a sigh of relief when they said it was alright 
so  it wasn't much to do except you_know just take care of  of the healing part uh and cooperate 
but uh I was sure everything was going to be alright 
something important 
well I think   I think oddly enough uh fi of  of meeting and  and continuing a  a life with Joe 
it was um I'm sure the most important th thing that ever happened 
um the most memorable day was the day our son was born 
but I think when I just go back to meeting Joe and how  how interesting that all was 
we were students at Montclair_State 
and in those days  freshmen still hadta wear beanies and wear a sign around our neck and get certain signatures and  in an effort to break the ice and meet people from campus 
we hadta sing the  the alma_mater 
but w the meeting for Joe was just a chance meeting at  s at Life_Hall 
and he noticed the sign and said something about 
I think I had  part of it was covered 
and he said 
 are you a  a speech major 
I said 
 no English 
and I  I un unveiled the  the words English 
but he was a senior 
and I was a freshman 
and so I got to meet one of the  you_know the upperclassmen got his signature 
and then later um we just had  it was an easy conversation 
we just  we talked a_little 
he  laughs he continued um when I  whenever I saw him to say hi 
and I  uh people would tell me 
 he's a BMOC 
you_know  he's a  he was a  a vice president of student government 
and I said 
 oh_my_goodness 
but the more we hadta talk about 
I was a student leader in my high school 
and I thought when he  when the phone call first came that it was to work on a committee laughs 
but it turned out that he we  he was interested 
so  our first date I think  was the 
it was something like the Kingston_Trio or something like that 
some folk group 
it was really nice 
they were on campus laughs 
and Joe had probably arranged for them to come clears
that was one of his duties 
but when I just s think of how all that unfolded just uh 
I knew I  I was gonna finish school 
and so we  we paced ourselves I guess  you_know to  to be logical about things 
get to know each other no surprises uh along the way 
because you have time with a person and you  you see them in all the seasons and all 
but I think when it finally came to  to getting married um I don't think there was a formal uh 
we  we  people ask us but this was f not even a formal proposal 
I think everyone around us assumed we would m marry 
click so  we did 
laughs and so I  I wasn't engaged 
you_know  I w we  I was pinned 
and someone said to me the next day 
 you_know you're  you're engaged to be engaged 
I said 
 no  I'm not 
and they said 
 well  that's what that means 
and I said 
 oh  I thought it meant sort_of going steady college style 
they said 
 no  you're engaged to be engaged 
I said 
 well  we have some time to go before 
I said 
 it means what it means to the individual couple too 
so  I tried to assert myself 
but I guess they might have been right 
but I don't  I don't care 
it didn't mean anything 
but that it  when you think of turning points and how you meet and how paths cross I_mean that's  that's probably the most important thing that happened was college and Joe and getting married 
and all that happened at once 
it all converged 
it's alright that we've done this before 
okay laughs same story 
now um uh was it little Ned 
no  this must be bigger Ned is kicking a soccer ball enjoying himself 
and the trajectory is off 
it goes right through a window 
and we hear the crash 
and um the lamp has gone over 
and  and I'm assume this is Pop or a neighbor but somebody who's startled that this uh intrusion goes to the window has the ball in his hand and is preparing the lecture 
and he says 
 I told you not to kick the ball around in the yard 
okay laughs 
it's still raining 
okay  in the first picture it's about to rain 
mom is telling little sweetie 
 take your umbrella with you because I think it's going to rain today 
and the little  little Sammy this time says 
 no no no no no I don't need it I'm a big kid 
and as he says goodbye his mom is just g offering it one more time 
he says 
 so_long 
see you later 
but as he steps out the door wouldn't you know it the first few drops of rain begin to fall 
and as he's  getting more and more soaked he holds his head and says 
 oh  drat 
and when he back  gets back home and looks at mom I think she's restraining the 
 I told you 
and he's looking a bit sheepish little Sammy 
but he's out in  in the last frame clears
but he's still going in the opposite direction here 
okay 
we're in a time warp you_know 
you guys have not moved forward from last  last week laughs 
okay 
groundhog day clears
no  this is cat up in a tree day 
click oh_my_goodness my_goodness 
uh this is little sweet Sue 
and her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree 
and I believe that dear dad must have tried to help her because there is a dad sitting on the heavier limb 
the ladder that he must have taken to  to get to  um to the cat has fallen 
so  he's stranded 
and little Fido is barking and saying 
 what the heck are you doing up there 
but thankfully the  the firemen are on their way 
kindly neighbors must have called and said 
 help help help 
and so they're rushing along with the ladder 
they will rescue him shortly 
and uh I think they'll get dad down before they get the cat down 
I think that's the priority 
and the bird alongside is just singing away because this is the joy to the world 
it's all going to work out just fine 
alright  I think last time it was a combination as_well 
what  uh once upon a time there was a  a family uh where the  f there was a widow 
and apparently he was interested in introducing her to uh a woman he had met 
but the woman had two daughters of her own 
and so after the introduction and I assume the marriage after uh the woman and her daughter the  became the stepmother and the stepsisters and a joined the  f the um household of Cinderella and her dad 
I'm assuming he traveled on business because he is away as I look at the pictures again 
and she must deal with the family  her new family 
and they're not very kind 
there's  uh they're um mean as in the stereotypical mean stepmother 
and the stepsisters were awful and took advantage of  Cinderella at every option 
and so she did the serv uh chores and she was treated badly 
um simultaneously there is another father and a s and a  sib and a offspring a prince this time 
and the father is a king 
and the king lives in a palace with his handsome son 
and I assume that it's time for him to be married 
and so the prince  uh a ball is going to be held during which the prince will have a chance to look over the beautiful  maidens who are available 
an invitation goes out to Cinderella's  stepmother  to the household 
and everyone is smiling 
and Cinderella I guess  assumes that she might be able to go 
but this is not going to happen 
um this  the  the book 
and I don't know what's going on with that little book yet 
but she I  maybe conjures up her fairy godmother or the little creatures that are around the house 
the little animals or  uh begin to help out 
but somewhere along the line Cinderella is going to be given a chance to go even as  sh as the stepsisters are preparing for the ball and everyone else is getting ready 
and Cinderella uh now knows that with the help of her f godmother she will get to go 
there is a little admonition from  after she's dressed in a beautiful pink dress from the fairy godmother who says something with her finger pointing probably 
 be sure you're home by midnight 
and then it switches to the  ba to the ball 
and I  and the prince sees and falls in love with um at first sight this beautiful Cinderella who is a wonderful girl even behind all the beauty 
when he could see all that 
so  they dance and dance 
and at the stroke of midnight she runs down the stairs to run back to home and leaves her glass slipper on the staircase 
I guess the the  the right hand man  the  the first secretary  first VP of the king is running after her to say 
 w wait a second 
 wait a second 
but she runs back to the  to  to home 
and uh then comes the search for who matches the slipper 
and it's he in your little booklet  the uh first vice president then who comes to the door 
and there's a funny little picture of somebody tripping laughs and a cushion 
but I don't remember any of that from my stories or my film memory 
but uh apparently there uh the key  there was a key there that still doesn't mean anything much to me 
they must have let him in 
um the  the match m is made when she tries on the slipper 
and so I  I suppose the  the fella 
 xxx we've got our girl 
my memory was the prince actually slipped it on her foot 
and I don't know why I thought it was th direct 
but he could afford to hire help to do that so  so the help took care of it 
anyway um uh it's a happy ending 
they  uh they get back together again 
and I'm sure it's um the prince and his sweet Cinderella and hap life is f happy from then on happily ever after 
 oh_my_goodness 
did you try it with the little wall 
and did we say there's only one piece of bread and we want  we think we want two 
we can do it either way 
we'll do a half one this time 
we'll use the  just the one piece of bread but we're going to make it the same way 
we're gonna lay all the ingredients out first because I'm analretentive 
we get everything out 
the knife  butter knife 
we open up the peanut butter first 
and we spread a  s a thinnish layer in the middle because we're gonna need the extra for a little wall that we build around the outside edges 
all four edges will have a slightly raised click um perimeter 
we're going to put ry red raspberry jelly 
uh s open that cap up 
and spread out just a little layer like a little raspberry lake that doesn't cross over the walls so it doesn't hafta spill all over the edges and drip down your  your hand as you're enjoying 
but you can have a half peanut butter sandwich 
if you like you can fold it over which was the way a_lot_of people in my neighborhood did it 
click but I think that's it 
that's how we'll do it
