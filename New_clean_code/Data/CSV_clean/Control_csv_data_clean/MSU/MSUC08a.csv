 click the closest I came to anything serious was a scare about a lump that was in my breast  my right breast 
and  our son Joseph had just been born uh a year ago  a year before the  di the diagnosis or the concern anyway 
and so uh I realized that in terms of priority I wanted to get whatever it was over with and get back to him 
but there was surgery required 
and there was a waiting period 
and I remember just trying to keep the focus on him not on  not on me so_that I could get back to um taking care of him 
as it turned out everything was fine 
the lump was removed 
it was benign 
and everything was alright 
so  but it was a scare for awhile 
and uh important that I kept the priorities that I thought was  were important 
there was very little recovery 
I remembered being bandaged very tightly so I wasn't too sure whether they had removed the breast or not laughs when I first woke up from um the anesthesia 
but right after that I think there was minimal dressing changes a couple of visits to the doctor and because everything was alright 
and I was so busy 
I don't recall anything special laughs other_than  a dressing and uh  keeping up with whatever medications  o whatever they told me to do 
but I  di nothing was  in was bothering me after it was o over 
yeah 
mhm 
um I useta teach English as a second language 
and so many of the pictures you showed me reminded me of language stimulation  exercises that we did 
I always uh tried to keep it relevant and build on what they knew 
but uh yeah there's difficulty when someone is not fluent in  uh in your language 
um click sigh sometimes with elderly 
click I um took care of my mom and my dad uh as they were really in advanced years 
l nineties 
and uh sometimes my father would go back to Italian 
um it was a place of comfort I think  especially as he was uh maybe dying 
and I just kept trying to keep it grounded somehow 
all I  real but there were times I wanted to go there with him to see what he was seeing and thinking 
but click it was uh memory retrieval for him and the shift from one language to another 
but keeping things real enough to take care of his needs too 
but I was very interested in where he was going with  uh with the Italian at the end 
 with my mom she was more  more grounded 
sometime it was hearing  it was her hearing problem 
was a_lot_of shouting laughs going on 
so  it's  sometimes for me it's that 
it's like trying not to shout but to keep communication lines open and keep it hopeful and positive 
yeah 
you're welcome 
oh I've had so many happy things 
laughs oh what's happy 
I'm sure the happiest day was o the day Joseph was born 
click um we were in East_Orange_General hospital 
I had a wonderful doctor 
um my husband Joe clicks who had a_little too much background in s language uh problems that can occur with babies and children laughs made sure that I was never taking anything during the pregnancy like  monosodium glutamate like diet anything like Chinese food 
whatever the heck his  he worried about my doctor removed from the diet 
so  when it was time for Joseph t to be born I tried very hard to keep everything very natural 
we had gone to childbirth preparation classes 
so  when the day come  came I  for Joseph's birth I was one lesson short of the full  le of the full  course I guess of childbirth preparation 
so  I was going fine without any medication 
it was just taking awhile 
and then I said to them 
 this is all I know 
 I don't know any more 
so  they were laughing 
and they said 
 um we'll take over 
and they just pushed my head from the pillow and said 
 let's line up the mirror correctly 
everything was going fine 
still no medications 
everything was going fine 
Doctor_Sobol my doctor said 
 Firstname this is going on 
 I wanna get home for supper 
I said 
 I'll get you home in time 
laughs so  it was a little bit longer but at five twenty on December ninth ninety sixty nine Joseph was born 
no medications 
no  nothing 
I was on a high 
I can  I've never been on such a high 
laughs but it was  it was such a happy day 
and everything was fine 
it was the way Joe had hoped  without any interference 
he got a really nice Apgar s score 
yes he was a ten right off the bat 
so  I said 
 well  did my job 
 now comes the scary part 
 raise the kid laughs 
so   happiest day 
for sure 
mhm 
once upon a time a bright and sunny day little Ned is kicking the soccer ball 
um and  not having judged the trajectory quite right it goes right through the picture window where  dad is sitting in his comfy arm chair 
and shocked out_of his  ennui  clicks he looks out the window and  with ball in hand  has  judged  correctly that he's going to hafta go outside and  speak to little Ned 
well  I think this is my daughter  inlaw Tanya 
and this is Nick 
and t Tanya is trying to convince Nick that he must take an umbrella with him um to school that day 
and as he's waving goodbye he is reassuring my  daughter inlaw that he surely doesn't need an umbrella independent little soul that he is 
um within uh the first block on the way to school he  it begins to rain 
um as he's sloshing through puddles and getting wetter and wetter he  understands what his mom was trying to say after all 
click a bit reluctantly he has returned home and uh  just hasta stand there sopping wet  while my daughter inlaw tries very hard not to say 
 I told you so 
but he  um clicks he happily accepts an umbrella and returns  to school in the opposite direction it looks like laughs 
returns to school 
umbrella 
and dry 
and happy 
enough 
laughs well  this is little Mary  little Mary_Boyle who has uh click noticed that her cat Fluffernutter is up in the tree 
and  uh and has called the only person she knows who can rescue uh Fluffernutter and do anything that hasta be done in the household 
and that is her dad 
um he has gone to help her uh climbs the tree 
but the ladder has gotten away from him 
is falling 
as if things aren't noisy enough uh the dog has come out to bark and bark and bark 
and so now the neighbors I guess  have heard this whole commotion and have called the fire department who are now there to rescue  in this order dad Fluffernutter 
and they're not going to bother the little bird who is sitting there because he's the only one who belongs up in that tree to begin with 
there you go 
you're welcome 
there was a  uh a widower with a daughter n whose name was Cinderella who had remarried  a  f a mean woman 
uh he didn't know that at the time but that's what marriage reveals over time laughs 
she had t two  s two daughters 
and so his stepdaughters um were part of the household that  clicks Cinderella and her father had enjoyed 
clicks but things changed once they all arrived together 
and Cinderella was relegated to a position that was much like servitude 
um the stepmother and the stepdaughters took advantage of her  in every way 
she performed servile  tasks 
um clicks at one point an invitation comes to a ball 
and uh they're considering uh happily going 
Cinderella's face is lighting up 
but she doesn't realize uh what's going on 
the ball was held because the  uh the King decided that his son  it was time for the son to marry 
and so the ball was for him to be introduced to the young debutantes of  the town 
well  Cinderella would love to go 
and uh it just turned out that there was never any possibility of her going because the mom and  uh the stepmother and the  s and the stepsisters had the focus only on themselves 
so  they prepared  uh had given her lots of chores to do and kept her busy 
but sh she was  there was never any plan for her to go as part of the family 
well  there's a book in the picture  and the b picture book I don't remember at all 
she discovers a book 
I don't know if that's where she um comes across an incantation 
but a fairy godmother appears 
and uh because in fairy tales people do not hafta go through things alone the sweet little creatures the mice and the little animals decide to help her 
fairy godmother helps her 
and so Cinderella simultaneously can prepare for the ball too 
and as  um as she arrives as she gets to be at the ball um I'm going to just remember that she uh dances with the handsome prince 
and at  s as she runs back  um tries to get back home she leaves her slipper on the stair 
I didn't see much in the book about the time frame but that was a big thing in the movie though 
I remember just clock ticking and downward clicks to midnight 
but she hadta get out_of there by midnight 
and uh she does 
but then there's the  there is the return of the slipper  uh the finding of the slipper so that was the one that would match what uh he remembered about his beautiful  date for the night 
clicks um but as I said the book seems a little bit different 
there's a key 
and I guess when she lets everyone in  finally 
where is he 
why is the key there 
I don't remember that part 
but um as I just remember the story ends happily 
that he does find her and the slipper 
and they're u reunited 
and so happily ever after 
uhhuh 
click well click I would  click keep all my ingredients um at the ready the peanut butter the bread the jelly 
lay the bread down 
get a nice  butter knife 
and I begin with  spreading a  s a smallish layer of peanut butter on every bit of the bread raising a little bit of the  e the well around all four sides so_that when you put the red raspberry jelly on there it doesn't actually go over the side 
it just stays within the  the borders 
click um click I useta like mine folded over laughs 
I think I  I like it just the one slice 
so  it just looks really kind_of beautiful with a little wall  a lovely little lake of jelly in the middle 
okay 
you're welcome
