hm I remember um toungue
I was playing on the swings with a friend 
and we were swinging 
and I fell 
and I did come down right on the back of my head 
and I got a concussion 
and my parents took me to the hospital 
and they were very concerned 
and I was very sick to my stomach 
and um they were going to keep me overnight at the hospital 
but my mother hadta get home 
she had three other children at home 
my dad worked in the evenings then 
and she had promised that she would wake me up every hour 
so  I do remember that 
and the next day remember resting on the couch in our living room and getting all kinds of visitors 
and um yes the neighborhood children were all coming in 
and um yeah it was a day or two until I felt better 
no 
yeah  I just remember my mother having to wake me up every hour or so even through the night and being extremely tired and wanting to sleep but her continuously waking me up 
I'm sure she didn't yep 
I have 
um some that I think of are um talking with people who had difficulty with maybe disfluent speech 
they were stutterers 
and really trying hard not to finish their words for them or um their statements 
and alth also um patients with aphasia 
just really sitting and giving them additional response time 
um and also working with children with um difficulty with language and with articulation 
and mostly with them just modeling correct production for them 
mhm  um tongue
I guess that was an important day in my life 
and um I remember I was student teaching as a speech language pathologist 
I was working hard 
back then we didn't have Super_Duper speech company so we hadta make everything 
and I had contact paper that I was laminating pictures with 
and my husband 
now he's my husband but then he was my um boyfriend 
had called and said 
 oh  let's go over to the park 
 let's do this 
and he was acting kind_of funny 
and I thought 
 I don't really have time for this 
and um even when he came to the house he was acting kind_of funny 
and I said 
 oh  you_know  I really wanted to finish what I was doing 
so  we went to Brookdale park which is where we live right now across the street from Brookdale park now 
and um that was the day that he asked me to get married  to marry him 
and then um I was so shocked 
and then I went home 
and my  my parents knew 
so  then they had invited my brothers over 
and it was this whole like small party 
and I kept thinking 
 oh  this is so wonderful 
 but I really hafta get back to what I'm doing 
my husband was like 
 really 
 like we're engaged 
but I guess I was a conscientious student then too 
 I think so 
so  um yeah and then it was nice 
because the next day I went in to the  you_know to where I was doing my student teaching 
and it was nice to tell my cooperating teacher 
and all the children were very excited 
it was nice 
you're welcome 
one day a boy was playing soccer 
and he wasn't being very careful 
and he went to kick the ball  to his friend 
but he kicked it through a window his neighbor's window 
his neighbor had been sitting there watching television and was very alarmed and upset that the ball came through the window 
when the neighbor looked to see who had kicked the ball the boy had run off 
you're welcome 
okay 
um one cloudy day a mom was encouraging her son to take his umbrella to school with him 
she warned him a second time before he left 
but he said 
 no  I don't need it 
I guess hoping that it wouldn't rain 
but sure enough it did rain that day 
it rained on the way to school and on the way home from school 
when the boy got home he was soaking wet 
and his mother looked at him and said 
 I had told you that you should bring your umbrella today 
um and then from then on he carried his umbrella and learned a lesson 
okay  one beautiful day a cat ran outside 
and a dog chased it up the tree 
a little girl was riding her tricycle and saw that it was her cat stuck on a branch in the tree 
she ran and got her father who got a ladder and tried to help her retrieve the cat 
but the ladder slipped off of the tree 
now both the dad and the cat were stuck in the tree 
the mom called the fire department 
and they came 
they were going to help both the dad and the cat get down from the tree 
and everyone would be happy 
sure 
Cinderella was a young girl whose mother passed away 
and her father married a wicked woman 
she had two daughters of her own 
and they  maltreated Cinderella 
she hadta clean the floor 
she hadta bring them breakfast 
she hadta make their dresses 
and one day um where they lived th an invitation was brought from the prince who lived in this castle in the faraway land 
and all of the unmarried women in the   in the area were invited to the ball 
and um the two stepsisters were going to go 
and Cinderella helped them get ready 
and she on her own made her own dress with the help  actually with the help of the animals 
she was very kind to animals 
um tongue
and then the night of the ball the stepsisters saw her 
and they were evil 
and they ripped her dress and tore her dress 
and they told her she couldn't go 
and she cried and cried 
and they left 
and she cried 
and then all_of_a_sudden a fairy godmother appeared 
and she told Cinderella 
 I can help you get to the ball 
and she used her magic wand and made a beautiful dress 
and she turned the pumpkins into a coach 
and she had coachmen come 
and Cinderella got to go to the ball 
and sure enough when it was her turn to dance with the prince he did um fall in love with her 
I forgot to tell you that the fairy godmother told her once she did all of that spun all of her magic for her that Cinderella hadta be home at midnight 
that if she was not home b when the clock struck midnight then everything would turn back to its original form 
so  Cinderella was at the ball having such a wonderful time 
and it was getting closer and closer 
and she didn't realize 
and all_of_a_sudden the clock struck 
and she ran out_of the ball 
and as she ran down the steps she lost one of her beautiful glass slippers 
and the prince found it 
and that was all that was left of Cinderella 
so  the next day he spoke to his father and to some of the people who worked for him 
and they said that if they could find the beautiful princess whose foot fit in to this gl fragile glass slipper that would be Cinderella 
so  the wicked stepmother and the girls locked her away 
and they tried on the  the glass slipper 
but it didn't fit either of them 
and the mice snuck the key under the door to Cinderella 
and she was able to get out just in time um so_that she could try on the glass slipper 
and sure enough it fit 
and the prince's um servants brought her back to the castle 
and she and the prince lived happily ever after
