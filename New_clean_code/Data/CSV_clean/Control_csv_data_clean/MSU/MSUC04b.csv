um in nineteen eighty I had an ovarian cyst 
and my doctor had told me that I could just  do normal activities and nothing would happen 
and unfortunately um it did rupture 
and it burst 
and it was February 
and it was an ice storm 
and it was the middle of the night 
and it was very treacherous getting there 
but I  we did 
and it was sposta have been a laparoscopic um operation 
and they couldn't do it that way so it was a fullon operation 
and I remember it was  I was moving very very slowly for a very long period of time 
and eventually I just got back to my own  my old self 
um I don't remember too much about what I did to get better 
I do remember though that th I was encouraged to move and encouraged to walk 
and I remember one specific incident where I was actually going with my mother and my sister to shop for her wedding gown 
and it required crossing a very busy street 
and there was no traffic light 
and I remember them being able to cross very easily 
and I hadta wait until there was not a single car coming in  in either direction to inch my way through 
um but I think it was just a question of little by little just getting my strength back and being less and less afraid to  to move 
and now I don't even remember how long it took because it was a long time ago but gest
yes 
okay  thank_you 
yes my first experience was um back in the late nineteen nineties 
um I worked with uh a physical and an occupational therapist with a hippotherapy program for children who had multiple sclerosis and cerebral palsy and other challenges 
and the  the purpose of the therapy was to get the children moving and having their muscles work better than they  had been 
but it was also to make them feel like they could do anything that another child could do and ride a horse 
so  that was my first experience was  t was taking cues and learning how sounds and movements actually uh substituted for words that could  that could not be understood 
and  um and the  the kids were great 
and they were  you_know they would manipulate because if they didn't know what to do they would just start to cry 
and uh you'd hafta  you'd hafta be able to tell or I learned how to tell which were really tears of pain and which were just tears of just like I don't wanna do this 
and um now of_course fast forward to here um this has been an amazing experience working with both children and  and adults who have had strokes who are unable to communicate 
and what they're doing you_know to  to make themselves better 
and I'm  I've taken cues from the people w f with whom I'm working um what not to do and  and what to do 
and  and really work on not making people feel like they have challenges or handicaps 
so ges
yes I'd like  it's something I love talking about 
um my husband and I set out in two thousand and six to see a baseball game at every major league ball park clears
and we started in two thousand six and we finished last year 
and we chose them geographically so we knew we could see as many games in  in the south and then the midwest and 
and um even_though we had traveled extensively internationally and while that was very very exciting this was the most fun that we have ever had 
and when we were done we really felt like we had accomplished something 
and we were also very sad that it was finished 
uh but every time they build a new ball park w we'll be going 
so  um and  and the other thing that we did that was fun with that is we actually created our Christmas cards  our holiday cards from photographs that were taken as we were traveling 
and we made the sentiment of the card correspond with um with the  the trip itself 
and the first one um it said 
 from baseball season to the holiday season may you always be safe at home 
which  which was mine 
um but it was nice 
and um it  in addition to seeing the parks we saw places in the country that we never would have seen 
we saw cities we never would have seen 
and we interfaced with people that we never would have you_know communicated with because they're very different when you leave the New_York area 
so ges
okay  um this story begins with a boy playing soccer 
and he's kicking the ball in the air 
and he kicks the ball too hard in the wrong direction 
and the ball goes crashing through um the window of a home 
and there's a gentleman inside the home who is quite surprised by the sound and the sight of the soccer ball coming through his window 
and at the end he picks up the soccer ball and looks outside to see who  kicked it from whence it came 
okay 
um a little boy is leaving the house 
he does not want the umbrella 
he says bye mom and leaves without the umbrella 
and as he starts walking it starts to rain 
and then it starts to rain even harder 
so  he turns around runs home soaking wet realizes he made a mistake 
his mother is not very happy that he is soaking wet 
and then he  takes the umbrella and starts out again 
I would take this picture to mean that a little girl had lost her cat in a tree 
and she was very upset that the cat was in the tree and would not come down 
so  her dad takes a ladder climbs the tree and tries to rescue the cat 
unfortunately the ladder falls 
he can't get down 
there's a dog barking at the bottom of the tree so he really can't get down 
and here comes the firemen as rescue with a new ladder to get both the dad and the cat out of the tree 
uh Cinderella is a little girl who comes to live with her stepmother and her stepsisters 
and even_though they are very well off she is never treated like one of the family 
in_fact  her name Cinderella comes from the fact that she sits by the fireplace and cleans out the cinders 
and she is kept down at heel even_though they are  wealthy and uh  snobby 
and an invitation comes to a ball 
and the  the stepsisters are very excited as is Cinderella about going 
but it's quite clear that she will not be going to the ball 
um the purpose of the ball is for the prince of the kingdom to choose a wife 
and Cinderella's f friends from the field make her a dress 
and she's all ready to go until her stepsisters see it and say 
 you're not going 
and they destroy the dress 
and she's devastated as she watches everyone else go to the ball 
and suddenly her fairy godmother appears 
and her fairy godmother gives her a dress 
um she turns a pumpkin into a carriage 
she turns four white mice into four horses 
I could sing it but I won't laughs 
I really could 
um and the only warning that the fairy godmother gives her is that she must be home by midnight because the spell will be broken 
and everything will turn back to the way it is 
sh she goes to the ball 
she meets the prince 
she dances with the prince 
they're falling in love 
and the clock strikes twelve 
so  she hurries out 
and in her haste she drops one of the beautiful glass slippers that the fairy godmother has made for her 
and the prince resolves that he will definitely find the woman he's fallen in love with 
so  they set out to try the  r the glass slipper that was left behind on every maiden in the town  the village 
and even_though the stepmother and the stepsisters try again to sabotage it they eventually find that it fits Cinderella 
and they live happily every after 
okay 
um I would take  I would open both jars 
I would find a knife 
and first I would spread the peanut butter on the slice of bread 
and then I would take the knife and take the jelly and spread it on the piece of bread 
and since there is only one piece of bread I would just  I would then fold it in half and make a sandwich
