okay 
um I remember uh hurting my back about five or six years ago 
and I really didn't do anything to hurt my back 
I just kind_of moved in the wrong direction and hurt my back 
and it was weeks of uh going to the doctor going  finally just having physical therapy to  to fix it 
but it all worked out 
yeah 
it was a_lot_of exercises 
I went to a physical therapy center right here in Bloomfield 
and um they had me lift weights and do uh different exercises stretching  mostly stretching my back 
and they used some kind of electronic uh like  stimulation therapy 
and that really helped 
it was the big part 
yeah 
uh  not really 
I_mean a little bit here and there 
you_know  I've know people who have had strokes and 
uh I think a_lot_of it was sort_of just waiting them out 
sometimes they just couldn't get out what they wanted to get out as quickly as they wanted or using sign  uh sort_of a sign language where they kind_of point to what they're looking for or what they need 
uh that was mostly 
 kinda what did it 
I guess I'll tell you about when we adopted our daughter Grace 
um it was a long  haul 
it was a_lot  you_know a_lot_of discussion with my wife Eileen about possibly doing it 
and we  probably over the course of years we talked about maybe adopting maybe becoming foster parents 
and uh w at one point I would be kind_of more wanting to do it 
and Eileen would be busy 
her parents were ill 
and we were trying to take care of them 
and then it would swap 
I was busy at work 
and she was more interested in talking about it 
it went back and forth for probably seven or eight years before kind_of we were on the same page at the same time 
and um we made this decision kin to  to  that we should look  possibly look at foster care 
and we looked into it closely 
and it just wasn't going to work right for us 
and then we decided to  to adopt 
and um we  identified this little girl who was three years old and needed a family 
and we um looked into all of her medical records and things 
and um then we traveled to China 
it was several months of waiting and getting approved and going through home studies and things like that 
and then we  mov then we went to China 
and actually the adoption occurred there in China 
uh and we have an older daughter who came with us also 
uh so  we're all part of  all became one big family all at once 
thanks 
well  there was a little boy who was playing  practicing his soccer kicks 
and uh looks like he kicked the ball a_little too hard uh right through the  living room window uh where his father was sitting there watching tv and keeping an eye on the baby 
and uh his father hadta gather up the ball and look out the window at him and  and say you_know 
 what are you doing kicking the ball re right near the window 
okay 
a little boy was on his way to school 
he's getting ready to go to school 
and his mother uh offered him the umbrella to take with him in case it rained on the way to school 
and he said 
 no  thank_you  I'm fine 
and he walked out 
and on his way to school it started raining really hard 
and he hadta turn around and run home 
and uh get  you_know when he got home his mother wasn't happy that he did not take the umbrella from the beginning 
uh and he  uh he took the umbrella 
and off he went again to school 
 it looks like there  a little girl's cat uh climbed up the tree 
the girl must have been playing with her cat in the yard 
and the cat ran up the tree 
and she went in to get her father to help her 
and he got his ladder out and brought it over to the tree and climbed his ladder and got into the tree to try to help air 
and uh the  while  once he was up in the tree the ladder fell too 
so  they hadta call the fire department to come and save both the cat and the father from the tree 
and the little girl was worried the whole time that the cat was going to jump out or fall out_of the tree 
okay  um there was a little girl named Cinderella 
and her mother died 
and her father got remarried to a woman who had two children of her own 
and the new mother the stepmother didn't really care for Cinderella that much 
she was more concerned about her two daughters 
and then as they grew up the  the  she made Cinderella become more or less the slave or the servant to the two sisters and to her 
and uh one day there was a  an invitation to a  uh a big ball to meet the prince because the prince was looking for a wife 
and uh his father was having a big party  a big ball to  so he could meet all the eligible women in the  in the  kingdom 
so  she wanted to go to the  the ball 
but she was too busy 
her stepmother said you can go if you get everything done for  everybody else uh because they all hadta have their clothes made  cleaned and ready to go 
so  she  in  she started to get everybody's  everybody else's clothes ready and get them ready to go to the ball 
and in the meantime her friends the  the  mi the mice put  sewed a dress together for her and got her all set that she could to the ball 
once she got everybody off and going she can then get ready and go 
uh but the sisters found out 
and they tore up her dress 
and she was  uh she thought she'd never get to the ball 
uh and then she met her  s her fairy godmother 
she went out in the yard and was crying 
and the fairy godmother came 
and the fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a coach and turned the  the mice into horseses 
but told her that she needed to be home by  mid leave by twelve o'clock midnight or everything was going to become as it was at that point 
so  she went off to the ball 
and she met the prince 
and they fell in love 
and all_of_a_sudden she heard the clock chiming twelve midnight 
so  she uh hadta run out 
and she ran down the steps of the  the castle 
and left the prince 
and she lost her shoe on the way 
so  the prince thought he would never see his  this girl again 
and so the next day the father and the  and his assistant took the shoe to every house in the kingdom until they found the right girl that the shoe fit on 
and that was Cinderella 
so  then she married the prince and lived happily ever after 
I would take the bread 
and I would spread the peanut butter  open up the peanut butter and spread some of the peanut butter on the bread 
and then open up the jelly and spread the jelly on top of the peanut butter 
and then put another piece of bread on top of it
