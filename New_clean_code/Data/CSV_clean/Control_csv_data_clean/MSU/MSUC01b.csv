I will tell you about a cheerleading accident 
um and I broke my arm 
and I was in I th believe it was sophomore  it was my sophomore year in high_school 
and I was in the gymnasium 
and we were practicing 
and I did a back flip 
and I came down on my arm 
and I remember hearing it crack 
it was CYO so it was  it was not uh uh like in a public school 
and um I remember the  some of the girls that I was with ran to get the priest 
and then in the back of his car he took me and a couple of the other girls to the hospital 
and I remember that um I was in the hospital for almost a week 
I'd never really been sick and have since really been sick 
but  um  so  I  I remember being in a cast for quite a long time 
and  and  um and I remember my father making me slings that would match the seasons because it took so long 
I had a Christmas sling and a  and whatnot 
and I think I ended with a fourth of July sling 
but um  I can now tell the weather 
oh  well  I was  I was fourteen years old 
your body just gets better 
I  f I  there was no sort of physical therapy or anything like that 
it was um going back  I never went back to the squad 
I tried to do twirling 
and I just couldn't do the hand motions 
and um so I never went back to that 
so 
besides my husband 
well  after learning about it myself and trying to understand what it is that happened to him um  and realizing that  he needed time for processing and  and sort_of  understanding that he knew the words he just needed to find them 
so  that with his aphasia that he still kept that capability 
so  he  he was able to do that 
so  after finding out about it and finding out what he was able to do it and then sort_of s a little bit of self teaching and  and um and giving him time to find his words and  and thinking of the process as as  as a child learns speech again 
so  I tried to educate myself on  uh on how children learn language 
and then from that um he sort_of followed that same process but only speeding it up 
so  he had the foundation there so shrugs 
um but mostly just giving him time 
happy sad

uh um in the summers we would go to the beach 
and it was not just my family but it was my cousins 
and we were always close 
and we went to a place in um Long_Branch 
and it was this sort_of little shack or this bungalow type of place that families would  would get into a room  would get a room 
and then you would get a parcel of a  of a kitchen 
and  and you_know when you think about it now 
but  um and so we would go 
and my folks never had much money 
and  and um so they would sort_of save up for this week 
and  and we would go to the  and we  we would all stay in this one room 
and I remember it had two beds and a cot for my brother 
and  um and we would just  we would go to the beach 
and we would just have a great time 
and I  so I remember um going to the pool 
they would have salt water pool 
I remember it being really cold 
so  you would jump in in the morning 
and you_know you would just spend your whole day there 
and you would be spent by the end of the day 
and  and I still remember the smells and the sights of it so 
you_know  and I remember the  um the routines 
being Catholic on a  on a Saturday 
there was a place called Rutt's_Hut which I think is still around 
um but it was this little um over the boardwalk over the beach kind of place 
and it was um 
and on Friday nights my  my mother and my aunt and m and  they'd wake us all up to go to r Rutt's_Hup 
and that would be like our  our treat 
we were probably like all in our pajamas 
and  and  but w we would all get out there 
and  and so it became a  a  sort_of a ritual that we all did together 
but uh I remember just playing on the beach and th you_know th 
so  it was just a good time 
yeah it was 
it was a_lot_of fun 
and with those cousins we're still close and still share a_lot_of things  so 
a boy is outside 
and he's playing a game of soccer 
so  he's out for the afternoon and playing with um 
I don't see any friends so I think he's just playing sort_of a kick the ball 
and he's in his  in his neighborhood 
and uh lo_and_behold the ball finds its way into a window of a  either his own family or  um or a neighbor next door 
and um there is a gentleman that's sitting um maybe watching tv 
I don't see a newspaper so he's watching some tv 
and um the window 
he gets up to see who it is 
and you kind_of wonder did the boy run away or is the boy still there 
I guess the mother heard the weather report because she had an umbrella in hand as the  as the little boy is walking out the door 
but he I guess  took a look outside and said 
 no you_know I don't see any  w I don't see any rain so I don't wanna take a  an umbrella 
so  he says goodbye to his mom 
and um he's walking out the door 
and then maybe he gets a couple steps 
and here comes the rain 
and he's like 
 uhoh I better get back home and um see if I can get that umbrella 
so  he gets in the door 
and his mother is looking at him and saying 
 I told you it was going to rain 
so  let me give you the umbrella 
and then you can walk to school 
and you'll be dry 
 a girl is riding her bike 
so  she's  she's out on her bike 
and she's going through the neighborhood and um all_of_a_sudden looks up and sees her cat in the tree 
and calls to her dad and asks her dad to come on  come over and help her get the cat 
and the father brings over his ladder and puts it against the tree and starts to go for the cat and the ladder falls 
and so now he's stuck in the tree 
and the dog is barking trying to  get everybody's attention I guess 
or he's barking at the dog 
or he's really barking at the cat probably 
and um  the girl has  the father takes out his cell phone 
we'll put it in that situation now 
calls the firemen 
and um he calls the fire  uh the fire people from his town 
and they come on over 
and they um will rescue the cat and the  and the man 
and the bird will uh still sing their 
and the dog will stop barking 
well  the story opens with um Cinderella's dad um coming home with his new wife and their two children  and  and her two daughters 
and what we find out later on is that the father has died 
and this woman now becomes her stepmother 
and as they grow then um Cinderella becomes more of the servant to the  m to the stepmother and to the two girls 
and um a letter comes to them or  an announcement comes to the family 
and there is a  there's going to be a ball 
and the ball is going to be held at the castle

and then later on um the stepmother and the  s the stepdaughters find out about it ridicule her kind_of take the dress apart disassemble it

and um so they  they whip her up this brand new dress 
and she um is then able to  um to go to the ball 
and the ball is set for a reason 
and the reason is  is that the prince is to find a wife
