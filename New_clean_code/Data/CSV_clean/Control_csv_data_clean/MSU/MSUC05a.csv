okay  um I had fallen at one point 
and I fractured my right wrist 
and I remember that 
well  it was um how many years ago 
it was probably in nineteen ninety th two or three 
and I was stopping at a place to get an ice cream 
and I was looking at the sign 
and then I tripped and fell 
and I was holding my keys in my right hand 
and so I've  but I got a little fracture 
and I hadta go to the emergency room 
hm well I was casted for quite a while 
and I had an infant at the time to take care of so that was the biggest challenge I think  was my being more concerned about taking care of him than my own  recovery 
um but it wasn't really a bad thing all in all 
I had the cast on for awhile 
and when they took it off I regained full use of my wrist 
yes  I do 
I have a very dear friend  cousin who is  um has aphasia 
she had a stroke when she was sixty six and she's now seventy one 
and I visit her regularly 
and we communicate in a very interesting way 
well  I ask her questions that she can answer yes or no to 
and I don't give her many choices 
and we do a_lot_of hand motions 
and she has a way of communicating 
she's pretty amazing 
um she does have phrases that she repeats because those are the ones she just repeats a_lot 
she  she likes to say she wants to go home  indicating her frustration with her situation 
but I can see when I speak with her that she's very much in tune with her feelings and in her thoughts 
she has the thoughts she  if she could only put the words together 
and it is very very frustrating for her 
but I think that she's kind_of come to terms with where she's at 
it's hard 
wow  well the first thing that came into my mind because I'll  I'll take it from my life perspective of being a child and the world being a wonderfully innocent beautiful place 
and the most  so it's a trauma event where my grandfather passed away 
and he was not sick 
he went to the hospital one day because he had a stroke when he was um at work 
so  he went off on a normal day 
and I remember playing you_know with my friends in the beautiful summertime just feeling that freedom of being a child with no worries to finding out that he was in the hospital 
and a friend of mine and I made  put some cookies together and  for when he was going to come home because we didn't entertain the thought of this person  because it was my first experience with the death 
so  it's kind_of a sad story 
but I just remembered the impact that it had on my life um in the sense of the pro cycle of birth and death and whatnot 
so  it turned out he passed away that night 
and I never did see him again 
and I was very emotionally distraught by this because he and I had a very close relationship 
and uh so that was probably the most traumatic event of something that I would remember from my life 
and then looking back on it as an adult now um realizing that this man was really an angel of mine 
I didn't realize it then but I came to believe 
and I don't know if you wanna know about my personal beliefs but I believe now in that kind of connection between people who have passed on that there is still a connection there 
came to learn about that 
and it just served as a  a real learning in my life in many different ways 
okay  well  this young lad was having a wonderful time kicking a soccer ball outside when suddenly it went out_of the way and broke the window 
not his intention but it was an accident 
and lo_and_behold his dad was sitting in the living room 
and the ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp and startled the dad 
and um the dad stood up and looked out the window and probably didn't see the boy because the boy ran away in fear 
um this is the story about a  uh a little boy who was on his way to school 
and mom probably heard the weather report and said it was going to rain and wanted to give him the umbrella 
but he didn't wanna take the umbrella because he didn't wanna be bothered with it or maybe he enjoyed the rain 
so  he went on his way 
he got caught in the rain 
it started to rain very hard 
he got very wet 
and he came home 
and he got the umbrella 
and then he was back on his way to school which just proves you should always listen to your mom 
 that's right 
it was nice of the mom to let him go without the umbrella to learn the lesson 
 okay  well   little Sally was out riding her tricycle in the park  with her dad 
and as they were going along they noticed that uh a cat was running along the field 
and a dog was chasing it 
and don't you know the dog chased the cat right up into the tree 
and she was very distressed by that feeling that she wanted to help the cat so 
she encouraged her dad to uh get the ladder because they lived right across the street 
and uh the dad got the ladder and he got up in the tree 
but then he got stuck in the tree 
and uh looks like they hadta call the fire department to come and finally get the dad and the cat down 
so  I'm sure someone had a cell phone in this picture even_though it's not shown 
so  the firemen came and rescued the dad and the cat 
and they all lived happily ever after 
hm okay once upon a time there was a young girl 
and she hadta go live with um her stepsisters and her stepmom because her dad couldn't take care of her anymore 
so  he brought her to this house where these uh stepsisters and stepmother lived 
and they took the  the girl in 
and um turned out they really um didn't treat her like a regular family member that this girl hadta do the cooking and the cleaning while the other girls were pampered and got every thing they wanted 
and she was sort_of like their maid 
and her name was then Cinderella because she spent a_lot_of time among the cinders by the fireplace 
and in the town it came to pass that there was going to be a ball 
and all of the eligible women in the kingdom were invited to the ball 
so  when they got the announcement uh Cinderella knew about it 
but of_course the wicked stepmother wasn't going to let Cinderella go to the ball 
but she was going to make sure that her daughters could go to the ball 
so  the preparation for the ball is the stepsisters were getting ready and preparing their things 
and Cinderella was among her little companions who were the mice and the little animals who lived in the house 
and then they saw how sad she was 
and they wanted to help her and help make her a dress and get ready for this ball and such 
but um Cinderella  I guess she knew in her heart that she couldn't really go to the ball 
so  as the day became closer the stepsisters were getting ready to go 
and they had beautiful dresses 
and she hadta help mend them 
and um let's see what happened um clears
um she  I think she went out in the garden 
and she met her fairy godmother because she was sad 
and she was crying 
and she really wanted to go to the ball 
and her fairy godmother had said you_know 
 you may go to the ball just um  change 
she changed her frock into a beautiful dress 
and she said 
 fetch me a pumpkin 
and then turned it in to a coach 
and shen 
and they became the coachmen and the drivers of this pumpkin 
and so she was able to go off to this ball 
and when she got there the ball was in full swing 
and the stepsisters had already had their chance to dance with the  the prince 
and unfortunately as much as they tried to be gracious they really weren't gracious people 
and one had a tic and a n creaky knee 
and someone else had fluttered their eyes and just 
things that they just didn't know how to uh interface with the king in a proper way or  the prince in a proper way 
and then when Cinderella came all eyes turned to her 
and she came down the stairs and danced with the prince 
and there was this magical thing that happened that we'd like to think is love 
and um they were dancing and whatnot and really connecting 
and suddenly the struck 
and um she realized she hadta go because the fairy godmother had warned her that this magic would only last until midnight 
and uh with that she ran away 
and in doing so her glass slipper remained behind 
she made her way home 
she was a_little sad because I guess  she thought she'd never see this prince again 
and then the prince s found the slipper 
and he was determined to find the girl in the kingdom who fit the slipper 
so  he and his coachman whoever they are went around to all the fair maidens in the kingdom and tried the slipper on 
and then they did come to the home of the  um where Cinderella lived 
then they  the stepsisters tried to get that shoe on their foot 
wasn't going to fit 
and then somehow Cinderella shows up from the background and comes forward to try on the shoe 
and it fits 
and they get married and live happily ever after 
that was not the best version of the story that I've ever heard 
well  if I were in my kitchen making a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I would um open up the freezer and get some glutenfree bread out_of there 
and I would um put a paper towel on the counter 
and I'd put the slices of bread on the paper towel 
then I would go in the refrigerater and get the peanut butter and the jelly 
put them on the counter 
and I would retrieve from the drawer a  implement to use for the peanut butter probably a knife and a spoon for the jelly 
and I would then open up the peanut butter 
and I would take a decent portion of peanut butter and spread it on one side of the bread 
and then I would close the jar 
and then I would open the jelly jar 
and I would take a nice heaping 
and I would put that on the opposite piece of bread and spread that around 
and then I would um put the top on the bread 
I'd close up the jelly and put the knife uh and the spoon in the sink 
put the jelly and the peanut butter back in the refrigerater 
and then I would put my sandwich probably on a plate 
and I probably wouldn't cut it 
and I would go sit down 
and I would enjoy  a peanut and butter and jelly sandwich
