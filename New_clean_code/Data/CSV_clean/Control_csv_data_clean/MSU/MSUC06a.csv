hm I can remember um when I was about seven years old I did fall off a swing 
I was swinging with a friend 
and we were standing facing each other 
and I hit my head 
and I did have a concussion 
um and I remember feeling quite ill 
and my mother was taking some nursing courses 
and they told her she could take me home and observe me overnight 
but sh I remember them just waking me up and waking me up and the next day having a headache 
and then I was fine 
 after a day or so 
no  I think just rest  rest yeah and have my mom wake me up periodically yes 
yes 
um all different people who've had 
I think um you_know I've encountered people who stutter 
and I will usually just try to um let them finish 
I'm pretty conscious of that not to finish their words for them 
and I've encountered people with aphasia 
and I'll often do the same 
unless they really look as though they're struggling 
and then occasionally I'll try to give them a cue 
um yeah so I would say that's the most that I can think of 
and children with um speech and language difficulties um 
and lots of times I just go into that mode of modeling the correct production of sounds or words 
mhm  I can remember um when I was about six years old my grandmother was in the hospital right before Christmas 
it was a couple weeks 
she had been in the hospital 
and she had not been ill 
but she was diabetic 
and you_know periodically she would be in the hospital 
and it was Christmas eve 
and we got a call that she had passed away 
and it was terrible 
my dad was at work 
and my mother hadta contact my dad 
and um it was a really very difficult time 
and I remember that was the first time I ever heard my father cry 
so  it was really something that I think I really remember 
in addition to me being sad I thought about how difficult it was for my father 
um and back then we always decorated our tree and everything on Christmas eve 
we put everything up then 
and then we would get up 
so  my mother did have all of us do that 
but I remember thinking how sad my mom was 
and that she was still able to do that with me and my three brothers 
and my dad didn't come home until very late 
and then he was there of_course on Christmas morning when we got up 
but it was a difficult Christmas 
and I do remember that very  vividly 
yeah mhm 
one day a boy was walking home from school playing with his soccer ball 
and he was being careless and kicked the ball through his neighbor's window 
his neighbor was sitting watching television 
and the ball came through knocked over his lamp and caused quite a  and caused quite a loud noise 
his neighbor stood up and looked through the window to see the young boy running off 
one cloudy day a mom encouraged her son to take his umbrella with him to school 
he said 
 I will not need the umbrella 
um however when he was walking home from school that day it was raining very hard 
it rained and rained 
he hadta run through the puddles 
and he got wet 
he tried to cover his head with his hands 
when he got home his mother said 
 look at you 
 you're soaking wet 
and he thought about having an umbrella 
psh and the next day when it was still raining he took the umbrella with him having learned his lesson 
 one day a girl was riding her bicycle 
and she saw her cat had run up the tree in her yard 
she looked and saw a dog at the tree and figured that the dog had chased her cat 
she went and got her dad who brought a ladder 
he started to climb the tree 
and the ladder fell 
so  now both her dad and her cat were stuck in the tree 
sh someone called the fire department 
and they were rushing to come and save both the cat and the dad 
Cinderella's mother passed away when she was a little girl 
and her father was raising her 
and he met a woman that he thought would be a good wife 
and she had  three daughters of her own 
um and they got married 
and they lived together 
but Cinderella was not treated fairly there 
Cinderella was always doing all of the chores 
and the stepsisters would say 
 Cinderella get my lunch 
 Cinderalla clean the laundry 
 Cinderella you_know do everything 
so  and the stepmother was not kind to Cinderella 
and one day um an invitation came that all of the unmarried women in  uh young girls in the  village could go to a ball and that it would be for the prince 
they needed to find  a suitable  wife for the prince 
so  Cinderella heard about it 
and she dreamt of going 
and she was a friend to the animals 
she was a kind girl 
and the mice and the animals helped her 
and they made a beautiful dress for her to wear that night 
but when it was time to come they said that she could not go 
and the wicked stepsisters tore her dress terribly 
they were very very mean to her 
and the wicked stepmother would not let her go 
and they locked her  away 
but the mice came and they helped her 
they got the keys 
and they opened the door 
and all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother was there 
and she helped Cinderella 
and sh there was a beautiful dress for her 
and she changed the pumpkins into a coach and coachmen 
but she did tell Cinderella that you must be home by the strike of twelve midnight 
so  Cinderella went 
and she danced 
and sure enough the prince chose her to dance with and thought that she was quite something and that he may be interested in her 
but then the clock struck twelve 
and out Cinderella ran out_of the ball 
and as she was scooting down the steps she lost one of her shoes 
um and then um she turned  um she turned back into Cinderella 
and she made it back to the  to the  um the house where she lived with her wicked stepmother and the stepsisters 
and a few days later um some of the prince's men came 
and they had  Cinderella's shoe 
and they said we can try this on 
and whoever it fits will go and meet the prince 
and all of the stepsisters tried it on 
and Cinderella I  th I believe she was  she was locked away then too because they had noticed  they knew  the stepmothers  m
they realized 
so  I think they had locked her away at that point as_well 
and they helped her get out 
and she tried on the shoe 
and sure enough it fit 
and um she was able to see the prince 
and they lived happily ever after 
aw

well  first you would get out your bread and you  and a knife 
and you would open your peanut butter and spread some peanut butter on the bread 
and then you would get  I would get a clean knife 
I don't mix my peanut butter and jelly 
and I would open the jelly and spread the jelly on top of that 
put another piece of bread on top 
cut it in half 
my mother said if you cut it in half it's a little extra love in that sandwich 
so  we would always cut that in half as_well
