oh gee 
hm actually I fainted  once 
and that's a terrible feeling 
and I guess  you_know I guess we could compare that to a  a stroke in the sense that it's a sudden onset 
and uh you do have a  a short window if it's the same as a stroke 
there  in my case there's a short window of realizing something is really wrong 
and you do have time to  to be cognizant of being in big trouble 
in_fact  I remember one time I  I uh  I fainted 
I happened to be in the upstairs bathroom at my house 
and that was  I was really afraid of  of the fact that I was in a hard tile room 
and um my daughter was downstairs 
I guess she was oh maybe around seven or eight 
and I  just in a panic I said 
 Dolly call nineoneone 
so  I knew I was in trouble 
and I  I  then I  I was able to just slowly go down myself 
and then I went out_of the picture 
and uh the paramedics did take me to the hospital 
and I had food poisoning 
and uh when I got 
th now that was really frightening as you_know they  they're racing me through the uh the e_r 
they're asking me you_know all sorts of information 
and  and the pocketbook disappears 
and then you_know testing and monitors and all that 
and they said 
 you_know your potassium level is in the basement 
so  it was really a 
and you_know you read these stories about people who have food poisoning and end up either you_know in the hospital or even dying 
and they told me yeah when the potassium levels go down to uh those sort_of sublevels organs can start shutting down rather quickly 
so  it was truly an emergency situation 
so  and my daughter as young as she was you_know I credit Natalie with you_know the fact that it wasn't worse 
that she  she just listened to me and didn't question it and dialed nineoneone 
yeah  so I can imagine that a stroke victim probably has a little notice  I think 
right 
and that's probably as scary li just like that 
yeah  yeah 
I was in the hospital for the night 
and uh they gave me a liquid potassium 
and then uh in i_vs 
and then um I left the hospital with uh 
well  before I left they were giving me lots of orange juice and with instructions you_know to  to call 
but it was liquid potassium and i_vs for uh many hours 
and they were monitoring me and you_know taking blood work and checking blood pressure and all that 
so  but you_know I was out you_know by the next morning 
but still 
I felt really weak and tired 
I_mean you needed to recover 
the  the  the rest of that day was really kind_of not on the map you_know 
but I_mean I  I just felt really really tired 
and j wiped out maybe is better 
tired  tired doesn't capture it 
laughs you_know it was scary 
you_know  when you see these stories right 
you  you hear them 
somebody died 
like how do they die 
right  right 
it can be serious 
and I had been doing a good deed that day 
I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium 
at the time  and of all things at the time I was a volunteer for the Mountainside hospital foundation 
and I was at the Yogi_Berra stadium working um an event 
it was family day 
and they had  uh I had some chicken 
and that's  that's what did me in laughs 
trying to do a good thing  right laughs 
they almost killed me laughs 
yes 
unfortunately in this particular case there was nothing I could really do about it 
um a very dear friend of mine was  was  had cancer and was dying 
uh you_know  she was at that you_know close point 
and uh she  I guess it was uh the liver starting to shut down 
you_know  the  again the organs the  the kidney and liver especially the liver 
and she was incoherent 
and she was s speaking to me 
this was a very strange experience 
she was speaking to me 
um but I couldn't understand a single word that she said 
and it was just gibberish 
and she thought she was speaking in a normal way 
and she would  it would be frustrating for her that I  wasn't understanding what she said 
and it sounded like words too 
but it wasn't 
and um I spoke with the  uh the uh nurse who was caring for her 
she was at home 
and uh I was told that th when the liver starts to shut down these types of things happen 
not sure what the exact connection is in terms of you_know the medical sequence of events 
but  but that  that's very frustrating to be 
and I could see the frustration on her face 
and then uh I feel badly 
and I feel frustrated too because I  I really wanna understand and  and can't 
well  you could only have simple communications at that point sort_of like point to things 
and then I would  um I would  I would tell her at di different ilver intervals 
 I cannot understand what you're saying 
and she would feel t even worse 
and so I stopped saying that because she thought she was  saying words 
I  w I realized that pretty  pretty quickly 
she  she thought she was you_know saying things 
so   I was left with no choice but to keep it simple and write things or point to things or um  just  pretend sometimes I even understood 
unless I thought it was something that she wanted like water or whatever 
you_know  then she would  it would be pretty clear I'm not coming with the water 
but that  that  that's very frightening 
and  and it's frustrating for everyone 
you're imprisoned in your own body in a way aren't you 
yeah  that hasta be a hell 
hm 
something important 
uh  I guess a_lot_of important things sort_of happened you_know 
um be hard to uh 
I think  I think um  in a sense I made my own important things 
um for instance um uh I grew up uh in a family 
uh I was one of five children 
and now I don't want this to sound you_know politically incorrect but laughs my father was uh Italian of Italian descent 
and he had this mind set that girls just don't go to college 
and unfortunately four of us were girls 
so  he didn't  that wasn't a 
he wasn't pleased with that either I don't think laughs 
and I was the third one 
can you imagine 
in a row 
no boys yet 
mm so  anyhow  laughs it was made very clear that uh college was not on the map 
uh and his  his  his idea was that um 
 I've been supporting you all these years 
 and now  you owe me 
 you_know you hafta go to work  and contribute to the household 
so  this was a builtin thing 
at the time I wasn't realizing how grave it was 
in_fact  there was something that felt almost exciting about it 
that I'll be going to work soon you_know laughs 
and the good news was that I was also an honor student 
and I got to high_school at twelve 
and the bad news was at sixteen my education was complete laughs 
and now I was going to work laughs 
so  my guidance counselor at the school was  she was suicidal I think when she heard I wasn't going to college because I was an honor student 
she actually wanted to call him 
and I was very calm about the whole thing 
I said 
 there's really no point 
 you_know it's  y you're not going to get anywhere 
this is the state of things 
it's the state of the art at the Lastname household 
and that's that 
so  anyway um she then uh decided to take me under her wing and um knew someone down on Wall_Street and  uh who worked at a personnel department at what was then the Irving_Trust_Company which no longer exists 
and they took great pride in that  that company 
th they  they were at one Wall_Street 
and they considered themselves at the top of Wall_Street 
and this was verbalized 
so  anyway laughing um she called her friend 
and uh I'll never forget her 
her name was Firstname_Lastname who I went to see 
so  I  I put a suit on uh went shopping and bought myself you_know a very inexpensive type of thing and went for the interview 
and I think I was a shooin because her friend the guidance counselor had called her 
and so she hired me 
and I ended up in a subbasement 
not just a basement 
it was a subbasement 
I think I was lower than the vaults 
in a secretarial pool where else laughs 
I could be a genius but I was going to the secretarial pool 
I did 
and good  good on me 
I did have the wherewithal when I was still in school to 
even_though I had an academic um uh course of study I combined it with a commercial course of study 
and I  and I  I took typing and stenography 
I thought this might help me 
and maybe my job won't be so random 
I have at_least a specific skill rather than just the resident genius wherever I end up you_know laughs 
so  I end up in a secretarial pool 
and um they  banks are notoriously very frugal 
and uh back then the things were even worse 
and the Irving as they call themselves were a very conservative organization 
and um I  I  I preface that because they didn't tend to call employment agencies when they needed extra help because there's a fee involved 
so  if somebody you_know in the upper floors above sea level needed some help for a day or however long they would call down to the trenches you_know where I was 
so  I got there on Monday and by Wednesday a call came in 
it was sort_of like I could imagine little orphan Annie at the or at  being at any orphanage where a call comes in 
and they pick you laughs 
so  they  a call came in that one of the executives in the personal trust uh department on the twelfth floor 
he was a  a  a senior vice president of the bank 
uh his secretary was unexpectedly out 
and uh they needed a fillin 
so  they selected me 
and up I went laughs 
and I walked in 
and you could hear a pin drop in this place 
I could tell it was going to be 
I didn't know how I was going to generate any level of you_know lightheartedness 
you  you_know it  it was almost as though they should have a font of holy water 
and you should genuflect you_know before you  to sit down at your desk laughs 
so  there I am 
and uh it turned out that his secretary 
I'll fast forward a_little 
so  here I was 
you_know  my skills were good 
I'm answering the phone 
I'm taking shorthand letters 
uh things are getting  things are humming along laughs 
everything is great 
and um it turns out that she  the secretary whom I was replacing was not coming back 
uh she was pregnant and uh was having some uh difficulties some complications so the  the absence was going to be long term 
and they hired me 
so now  uh and I had a raise right away 
I thought this work life is a cinch 
I'm here for a week and I got a raise laughs 
I got out_of the subbasement you_know 
I'm in the light of day 
things were  you_know like things were moving along so quickly that I  I figured I was going to have some meteoric rise down on Wall_Street laughs you_know 
it was the trajectory I was on 
so  one day I was there  I was there for about three months I guess 
and I was out uh to lunch still trying to you_know explore the area 
uh it's a very exciting place you_know 
Wall_Street 
and I found the New_York Stock_Exchange 
and I  you_know I was cum sort_of like a pseudo tourist 
so  I was walking up Broadway one day 
and I encounter the Marine_Midland_Bank a very modern glass structure with this large orange cube huge went up a few stories 
and I thought this looks like a much more lighthearted place to work than the Irving 
it just  you_know  it was a great place light and airy modern 
I went in 
and I asked the security guard where the personnel department was 
so  I was directed there 
I sat down filled out uh an application 
and um I was drunk with power by then you_know because I had gotten the raise 
things were moving so quickly 
so  I filled out the application 
the interview with the personnel uh manager went very well 
she told me about three different types of positions I could have 
and uh visited all three of them 
and I could pick whichever one I wanted 
so  I picked the one in the international department 
that sounded really interesting to me 
and was working for an executive there 
and um it was just a wonderful environment 
and I was in the Latin_American division 
and we covered Peru Mexico Equador Bolivia and  Chile 
and it was very exciting because at the time that was when uh there was the coup_d'etat in Chile when Salvador_Allende was 
and we had lots of money 
uh we  we issued credit lines essentially is what we did for major companies and banks in the Latin_American area 
so  those were  those were some pretty exciting times 
and I then I was there for a few years 
and uh my direct boss who was the  he was also a senior vice president of the bank was being sent to the Paris office 
I had a choice of going there or staying here and working for his successor 
so  of_course you_know how romance always wins out 
I had a boyfriend 
I didn't wanna move to Paris 
and many people probably would have said Paris you_know 
and like it would have been 
I look back 
I probably made the wrong choice because the romance didn't work out either 
but that's okay 
so  I decided to leave instead of work for his successor only because I I knew enough at that point that it seemed to me the brokerage business was a_little more fast moving and exciting 
I  I figured ts this is a good you_know juncture to get out_of banking 
it seemed very staid no matter where you were 
so  I  I  I got a  an agent 
I had you_know kind_of felt my way around you_know how things work down on the street by then 
and then I ended up working for some brokerage firms 
so  to fast forward 
hope that wasn't too long a story 
laughs then I  I  I  I had my daughter 
I was a stay_at_home mom 
and the college thing was always on my mind 
so  I applied to Montclair_State 
and  and I was accepted 
uh I came in at the time was a second career program 
and uh the important thing was that I did it 
I got my degree 
and I graduated summa_cum_laude 
and I had marvelous experiences 
and plus I was a day student 
um and that was another thing for me 
I realized that I could still kind_of live the life I might have 
when I mention a day student it's because I was a young  uh always among young mainstream students 
and I thought 
 gee  maybe I'll be sort_of ostracized from main society here 
but I wasn't 
and they liked me 
and I liked them so it was a wonderful experience 
so  I got the degree anyway 
and here I am 
yeah 
you're welcome 
yeah  this is that same disaster that we had last week laughs 
disastro 
the boy is outside having fun you_know kicking around the soccer ball 
and crash 
it goes right through the window 
looks like his father 
knocks the lamp over too I see 
the father was happen  happened to be sitting in the chair 
and uh he gets up 
and uh he's got the ball in his hand 
he looks out the window 
and um seems like the boy is going to have um a bad evening 
I think the father is pretty annoyed about that 
funny he was just sitting there 
you don't even see a newspaper or something you_know 
he was just sitting there like waiting for disaster to strike laughs 
well  we have what looks to be a mother and her child 
it's funny 
my first impression is a girl  a little girl 
but in other pictures I don't know 
I think it's a little boy 
maybe it's sposta be ger generic 
and the mother is telling the child to take the umbrella 
child says no 
you_know  that  that whole idea is rejected 
mother offers the umbrella again 
 no bye 
uhoh  outside started to rain 
now it's pouring 
child comes in soaked 
the mother is standing there with that you_know I_told_you_soqadj attitude and  and kind_of annoyed  I guess 
but that's what mothers do you_know 
y y you wanna protect your child 
and the child  they don't like the idea 
they think you're mean and difficult 
you just don't want your child to fall down and skin their knee 
you don't want them to get wet 
you don't want anything to happen to this child 
I know that's how I was laughs 
and so now it's another rainy day 
or later  maybe later that day and the child is walking out with an umbrella 
learned a lesson 
listen to the mother 
and you_know so maybe a lesson learned for the future 
that maybe mommy you_know isn't that bad after all 
trying to protect me 
well  we have a cat uh emergency here 
the cat is stuck in the tree it looks like 
and I guess the  father or maybe some  well meaning friend or neighbor or whatever had used a ladder 
got up in the tree 
he's stuck up there too now 
the dog is trying to climb the tree probably not to be of help but to  get the cat 
and now I see the fire department is on the scene 
and they're going to rescue them so every one is going to live happily ever after 
well  for reasons that weren't entirely clear to me Cinderella ends up as a  being a maid working for this family 
and it was a mother and her two uh daughters 
they were  just very shrill and very unattractive young women 
Cinderella was pretty and pleasant and sweet and uh just  just very nice 
these two were  were very spoiled and  and didn't have any appreciation for anything 
I_mean  Cinderella was so nice even the barnyard you_know animals loved her 
the horse the  whoever was out there 
mice even laughs you_know 
she was a delight 
anyway  um there's a  a  an  an announcement comes to the uh unattractive mother and daughters was delivered to their  their  their mcmansion I guess  where they live 
they weren't in a castle 
uh they got an invitation to  to a ball 
the prince was going to give a ball 
and Cinderella useta  she could gaze out the window and see the castle off in the distance 
and so when news came of this ball uh she was also silently very excited about it 
but the two girls you_know of_course they were going 
they had an invitation 
uh and somehow  I forget some of the details in between 
but there was a fairy godmother who ends up you_know helping working some magic 
and Cinderella does go to the ball 
uh like a pumpkin that  that  that  what was  that gets turned into a  a  a carriage and with horses 
and she's got a beautiful gown on 
and she just looks  really just beautiful 
and she  uh the prince of_course you_know um sees her right away 
and uh you_know one of those across the crowded room 
and they danced all night 
and it was very romantic 
and you could see the sour faces on those two stepsisters the  that  or whoever or that  they were 
was that the stepsisters or was that another story laughs 
the wicked stepsisters  I don't know 
anyhow um those horrible faces like grimaces laughs 
so  anyway  the  the one caveat was that Cinderella hadta be home by midnight 
and you see the  the  the clock is  is striking twelve 
and she's saying goodbye to the prince 
and of_course he doesn't wanna let her to leave 
and she's late 
she's running down this  you_know a large flight of stairs and loses a shoe 
one of her glass slippers 
and uh the uh butler or whoever  majordomo from the  the palace was sent around you_know to the town to find who fits into the shoe 
and uh Cinderella gets locked up 
you_know  the mother the  that horrible mother thought that you_know they'd cram the shoe on one of her daughters' feet laughs 
and I remember their feet were ugly too laughs 
and uh the mice end up getting 
oh she was locked in this room you_know 
they didn't want her on the scene 
and um the mice brought her the key 
she got out and um tried on the shoe 
of_course  it fit perfectly 
she married the handsome prince and lived happily ever after 
one hopes 
and I hope they weren't the bridesmaids at the wedding those  those  horrible people laughs 
okay 
now I really wish they had two pieces of bread here 
otherwise it's an open face 
they don't call it a sandwich right laughs 
so  be nice 
we'll  we're pretend we have two pieces of bread 
and uh I like to line them up according to the contours of the side of the bread 
then the peanut butter I put on with a knife on each piece of bread 
if I had two I would put the peanut butter on both 
then I like to use a teaspoon for the jelly 
and just gently spread that on 
close it up maybe cut it in half 
because I love sæmɪdʒɪzu 
but I don't like a bite of the crust first 
on a peanut butter it's 
so  that's why I 
yeah  and I like to cut it like on the diagonal 
hasta be a particular way  you_know
