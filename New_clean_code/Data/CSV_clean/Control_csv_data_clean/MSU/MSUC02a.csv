uh just anything about it 
well  I  r I  I'm a breast cancer survivor of five years 
and um I remember um being operated on three times for lumpectomy 
and um the pain you_know you remember that 
and the  the  the  just I guess  the rehabilitation part of it 
the  the being tired all the time 
and then finally getting better you_know feeling more like a human being again 
that's  uh and then knock on wood you_know I've been okay 
I slept a_lot 
I still do 
I  I like to sleep 
but I  um uh I worked 
I  wor um whenever  pe people would say 
 why you coming  you_know why you going to work 
 why don't you just 
I  I found that to be more therapeutic than being home sleeping 
y you_know I  I slept at night 
but I'd  but I'd rather come to work and work 
um so  soon as I had the radiation I came to work and worked a whole day and went home and collapsed and you_know 
but um th that to me was more therapeutic than anything just to keep going 
do I have a difficult time 
uh well  I guess I  I should say  yeah 
I guess through illness and like my grandson is not  he doesn't speak English yet 
he's  uh he's only one and a half years old 
so  you_know  like he doesn't  he  but we communicate in a different form 
so  I guess you  you_know you understand what they're trying to say eventually 
you_know  they'll  they'll make a point of telling you somehow 
you_know  you figure it out 
some form of sign language if anything 
that you_know 
uh well  um we have our own little sign language right now 
like uh i I don't know why but everytime he sees me he goes 
 ah gestures laughs 
and that's  um that's the grandmother does this  I guess  you_know 
so  he you_know and uh 
s he  and then right away it means getting a cookie out of the drawer 
uh uh like you_know so he knows  he understands like I'm the one that gives him the cookies all the time 
so  you_know but it's fun 
and uh y yeah I guess y you_know and in  the you want  you_know when he wants his  uh uh a sip of water 
y y you_know there's different  just like with any child you_know there's different um ways that they  they present themselves that they  they let you know that they want their lunch 
and they start laughing when you show them the right thing you_know 
it's  it's  uh it's a rewarding experience when you finally get it right you_know 
hm something important 
I guess the most important thing I can remember is when my children were born 
that was uh the most  uh the best day of my life on both occasions like giving birth and  and holding them in my arms and  and uh what a miracle it was you_know 
that  that was uh an amazing experience 
I don't think there's anything that comes close to that like uh out_of everything I've ever done 
but um the uh I guess  and the day I got married 
that was  you_know like different events I guess  that were  were important  you_know 
but um I guess the  the most important ones were the day  day  the days uh I gave birth 
those  I had a son and uh a daughter first and then a son uh two years later 
well  the little boy's having fun kicking his soccer ball 
and finally he's walking down the street 
and he kicks it too hard 
and it goes into the window 
and uh ih the man is startled when the ball comes flying through 
and ev eventually the male  man's got the soccer ball looking for the  the little boy that  that broke the glass out the window 
um  I don't know if he's a relative or he knows him even 
but  but nodshead 
he's  he's looking for him 
he doesn't  he doesn't look like he's anywhere around there laughs 
okay 
um  looks like the  the mom is trying to give uh the little boy an umbrella 
but I think he decides he doesn't need it um and goes outside 
and it starts to rain 
and he hasta  he comes back soaking wet 
and his mom's like 
 I told you you needed the umbrella 
and then he leaves with the umbrella 
and he's all happy 
and uh the  uh he's  he's  he's walking in the puddles too 
that's something I would do 
hm 
looks like uh  uh the little girl's cat got stuck up a tree 
and  a man went to help get the cat out_of the tree 
and uh a dog came chasing after him and is barking at him 
and finally the firetruck is coming 
uh the firemen are coming with the fire  fire ladder to get the  both of them out_of the tree 
and it looks like the bird's laughing at both of them 
but  uh and the little girl's yelling 
 jump 
and it 
but they both are scared 
they don't wanna jump down 
but thank God for the fire department 
both of my son in laws are firemen 
that's great 
well  um Cinderella's father gets married to a woman who has two s uh daughters 
and uh and then her father dies 
and the stepmother uh knowing her  her  her stepdaughter is so beautiful and everything uh makes her sleep in the uh um 
oh I don't remember where she slept a actually 
but uh makes her do all the housework and clean and act  act like a servant maid in the house 
and um Cinderella befriends all the animals 
and uh the birds love her 
and the uh  all the animals love Cinderella 
and um the uh king uh wants the son to get married and uh has a ball 
and everyone is invited 
all the young women in  in  in the  uh in the coun country are invited to go 
and the stepmother finds out that Cinderella was planning on going too 
and uh they all destroy her dress 
and  um and they um say that  they told her she couldn't go 
I  rem in the movie they  I know they lock her in the room 
but um her fairy godmother comes and uh um makes her the most gorgeous gown and makes her look so beautiful and glass slippers 
and she goes to the ball 
and the prince falls in love with her 
and  but she hadta be back by the stroke of midnight 
and um as she realizes as the uh clock is  um uh that the tower clock is uh uh chiming that she hasta leave and get back before she turns back to her old rag  rag clothes 
and she loses her slipper on the way 
and uh the prince finds it and sends his  um his uh countrymen uh well  his  uh his servants out to find out where she is  who  who wear  m
and they finally find Cinderella 
and they live happily ever after 
I would take um  actually I would take two slices of bread 
and I would put peanut butter on  smear peanut butter on the one slice and jelly on the other  s  the other half 
and then put them together 
and cut it in half 
and serve it
