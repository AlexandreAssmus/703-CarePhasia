I think I do fairly well 
I think very well 
not fluently 
I've not had a stroke 
and I guess  no  I've not had a serious illness 
um my sister had a mild stroke years ago 
and this is the same one who just had um cardiac surgery um about a month ago 
mhm 
well  she's still in the process 
she's still  she's in a nursing home now 
they took her 
and that was all part of the plan 
she had the surgery 
she had mitral valve whatever  or a leaky valve or something 
and um so she's in a nursing home now 
and she's feisty as ever 
um so  yeah  she's recovering and probably driving everybody crazy 
that's off the record 
a happy memory 
and I've done this in training so I  I didn't pull this one out from  out_of the air 
um I was um the president of the black alumni association at Collegename in m 
no  I was the vice  president many years ago 
and we had the first black president of Collegename while you_know I was in the post of this um office 
and so we invited him for the community  to meet the community 
and I literally organized everything 
and my father had a liquor store then 
and I had the people in the liquor s store  um the liquor business contribute 
and I think people smoked then 
Phillip_Morris contributed cigarettes 
and um I had the chemical bank contribute money and had all kinds of you_know cheese 
it was one of the best events they have ever had at the school 
and they have said that 
it was well attended by the whole community of Collegename 
we did an instulement 
we did everything for this guy 
it's still one of the things I like best 
it really was 
exactly 
and even the president said 
 you should really have been the president 
and I could have been 
I just didn't want the job 
I didn't realize I was gonna do his work anyway 
right 
so  the little boy went out to play kickball that day 
I forget what  it's a soccer ball  I guess 
and he never expected to  when he kicked the ball that it went through the window  somebody's window and broke it 
went in 
the gentleman who was in the house was shocked by the noise he heard 
and he sees a ball coming 
and he went to the window to find out who did this because he was gonna go after that kid and tell him about how to be safe and whatnot when you play good games 
oh  okay  just the beginning  middle  and an end 
okay  so  then I hafta look at it so you don't hafta hear all my thoughts 
um there's a mother getting ready to send her child off to school 
she tried to urge him to take an umbrella 
obviously she's heard the weather report 
he went and he didn't listen to his mother 
so  he went out and got wet 
when he came back he looked very sad 
and his mother looked very annoyed 
and the next time he took an umbrella 
there's a whole lot going on here 
um well  okay 
I guess it looks like maybe a dad and his daughter are playing outside 
and he  and he  he's up on a tree for some reason 
oh  there's a ladder so he was obviously trying to do 
oh  he was trying to get her cat and  um from the ladder 
and he  the ladder fell 
he's stuck up in the tree 
the daughter is still upset because the cat's still up the tree 
the dog is barking because everything's out_of sorts for him 
and so the fire engine comes with a ladder  ready to come to the rescue and get the cat down and get the father down and tell them 
 don't do that again 
yeah 
not one of my favorite 
I forgot all about this the wicked witch and her stepdaughters 
okay  you hid the text 
you don't want me to know the text 
I gotta  I gotta make up my own 
and cinderq means she's sweeping up the cinders from the chimney 
and the ugly stepsisters 
I don't remember this 
they are talking about how there's some young lady they've never seen before 
I don't really remember 
oh  the invitation  whatever 
I don't really remember it too well 
not one of my favorite stories but anyway 
um so she  the wicked witch talks about the party 
the sisters don't want her to go 
isn't that awful how they talk about stepsisters being ugly 
and then the xxx fairy godmother helps her go 
she captures the eye of the prince charming 
she hasta leave before midnight 
he doesn't know where she is 
she's in her tatters 
and her coach turns to rats and a pumpkin 
the wicked godmother locks her in 
but then they bring the key 
and they take the key to the cellar 
they try every maiden in the um town whatever they call those old things parish to see who the shoe belongs to 
and it belongs to Cinderella 
and she marries the prince and gets  prince and gets 
lives happily ever after 
Cinderella is this  um she's living with her wicked  the wicked stepmother 
I guess it's her stepmother 
I don't know where her father is 
um and the stepmother has these two um not attractive daughters 
and Cinderella  she's very pretty but she's left in tatters and rags 
her job is to clean the hearth and get rid of all the  you_know the cinders from the whatevern 
and the fairy godmother treats her abysmally poor 
and so one day there was going to be a ball 
the king 
and he makes this announcement 
and she wants to go as_well_as his daughters  her daughters 
um but they're figuring whom you you_know 
but her fairy godmother comes along to the rescue and tells her she will make  um you_know turn 
get me a pumpkin and some rats whatever 
and the pumpkin will be your coach 
other rats will be your coachmen  I think 
she gets her a great dress or something to wear 
her hair  they don't even talk about all that 
and so she goes 
and um the prince is dancing with all the young ladies but she captures his eye 
and um he dances with her 
and of_course it's love at first sight 
and she realizes at the stroke of midnight she hasta be home 
so  she runs out there before he can find out who she is 
and um in running she drops one of her slippers 
she runs into the coach which turns into a pumpkin before she can get home  I think 
the rats t turn  the coachmen turn into rats and whatever 
so  the  the king  the prince decides he wants to look over his kingdom to find out who this chair belongs to 
he's gonna go to every house and um see if the shoe fits 
and the fairy godmother is like  she's trying to get her daughters now I remember this  their big feet into the shoes 
no  it doesn't work 
and they say 
 is there anyone else 
 we see this young lady 
 oh  it wouldn't be her 
but it's her  you_know 
it's  um so  she sits down 
and they  the shoe fits perfectly 
he knows he's found his princess 
and he whisks her off 
and they get married 
and they live happily ever after 
that's a long story 
okay 
how I would make it 
from the word goq 
go to the cabinet and take down a jar of peanut butter 
I'd probably have the jelly in the refrigerator because it spoils or something 
so  I'd go to the refrigerator and get the jelly out 
and go to the refrigerator where I also keep my bread 
take out two slices of bread 
I'd put them  open them there 
I would take the peanut butter first 
and smear it on the  on one side of the bread 
pretty thick though 
I like a_lot_of food 
then I'd take the jelly and put that on  over top of the peanut butter  still on the same side 
and I would take the other side and put it down 
and then I would take it and cut it in half 
and then I would start eating it
