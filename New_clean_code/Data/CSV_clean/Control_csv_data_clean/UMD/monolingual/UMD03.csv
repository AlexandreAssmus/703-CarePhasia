we have a dear friend who recently passed as a result of Parkinson's 
but we saw her progressively get worse and worse over the years 
and it was  it was  yeah  it was obviously a very sad kind of thing

 meeting my bride forty seven years ago 
no  uh laughs 
okay 
I'm one of the few people who can say I met my wife in church 
we  we attended Quaker meeting in  in Florida Avenue Friends' Meeting down in Washington 
and I sat behind her 
and after a meeting was over as  in the manner of Friends we shake hands with people 
and I looked into her eyes and said 
 would you like to buy a cup of coffee with me 
and that was our first date 
so  there you go 
see  I didn't find her in a bar 
little Ralphie had just received for his birthday a new soccer ball 
and he was out in backyard kicking it 
however he wasn't a very good soccer player at this point in his life 
and he had inadvertently kicked it through the picture window of his neighbor mean old Mister_Smith 
Mister_Smith was sitting calmly in his chair in his living room when the soccer ball crashed through the pane of glass knocking over a lamp on his table and startling old Mister_Smith 
Smith was a mean sonofabitch 
and he looked out the broken window and held the soccer ball and yelled 
 you want this ball  little boy 
 you'll hafta come and get it and pay for the broken window 
the end 
oh  same story 
oh 
these are in order  aren't they 
alright  it looks like little Charlie is refusing to take an umbrella from his mother 
he's leaving  I presume  for school 
his mother's looking sternly at him with the umbrella in her hand 
but he's waving goodbye and seems content to go without it 
however halfway down the street on his way to school the rain begins 
little Ralphie's covered with rain 
he's wet 
he's unhappy 
he's stomping through puddles 
he realizes he's made a tragic mistake 
he gets home w drenched looking unhappy 
and his mother looks uh I  as_if 
 I told you so 
and the final pane of the picture shows little Ralphie with an umbrella in the rain whistling a happy tune 
laughs presumably the story begins when Melissa's cat Fluffy climbed up a tree and wasn't able to get down 
she called her dad who was  who thought he could climb up the tree with a ladder and bring little Fluffy down 
but clearly he was chased by their neighbor's dog 
and consequently the ladder that his dad  her dad was using to climb the tree fell down 
so  he was trapped on a branch 
Fluffy was still on the branch 
the dog is barking at the base of the tree 
and some wise neighbor called  like they should have called in the first place  firemen 
firemen rescue cats in trees 
and in this case they most  may hafta rescue the dad 
the end 
I'm sorry 
laughs of  once_upon_a_time there was a little girl who 
 the Disney with the bluebirds 
oh  yes 
 okay  I don't believe I need to look at the book unless it's  it's changed since 
Cinderella was a poor girl who lived with her evil stepmother and her two evil stepsisters 
Cinderella was young and lovely 
but she was forced to work cleaning the cinders out_of the fireplace 
her two evil stepsisters were mean to her 
never let her go out and socialize 
the night of the ball at the local palace the stepsisters and Cinderella all thought they would love to be invited 
however because Cinderella was a  s a cinder girl dressed in rags she was unable to go 
however a fairy godmother appeared 
granted her a wish 
the wish being 
 can I go to the ball 
the fairy godmother equipped her with a dress and shoes specifically little glass slippers and a pumpkin carriage to take her to the palace where she met and danced with the handsome prince but said 
 I hafta leave by midnight or I will turn into a pumpkin  or my coach will turn into a pumpkin 
the prince didn't believe her 
but she ran down the steps  reached the pumpkin  be the coach before it turned into a pumpkin pulled by mice  but left one of her glass slippers behind 
the next day the prince searched his kingdom from top to bottom looking for the owner of this delicate little glass slipper because she was such a lovely young thing 
they went to the house of the wicked stepmother 
the two wicked stepdaughters tried desperately to get their fat ugly feet squeezed into the little glass slipper but failed 
and Cinderella was  luckily was there 
and the prince said 
 you try it on  sweetheart 
and it fit perfectly 
and she lived happily ever after marrying the prince 
and threw her stepsisters into the fire 
no  I don't know what happened to the stepsisters 
is that close enough 
I neglected to talk about the bluebirds of happiness 
but they were Disney's creation 
the mice  yeah 
oh  there's Dumbo  oh 
and the little engine that could  oh 
and the pokey little puppy 
and the tugboat  oh 
you don't remember those 
yeah  he dug under the fence 
and his mom wouldn't give him dinner 
and he hadta go to bed without dessert 
yeah 
okay 
how  how I would make one 
 okay 
I would take two slices of Wonder bread a knife a jar of peanut butter and a jar of black raspberry preserves 
and spread the fixings on the bread 
and slap them together
