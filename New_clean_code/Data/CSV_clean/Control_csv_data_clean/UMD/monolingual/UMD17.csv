how do I what 
very well 
excellent 
well  I have noone to talk Yiddish to so I don't know whether I should include that 
well  I  I can speak some Yiddish 
but there's nobody to converse with so I don't know whether that would qualify 
no 
would you consider Alzheimer's 
yes  my husband 
what 
well  it started about six years before he passed away 
I noticed that he was very forgetful 
he couldn't remember what building we lived in and other things 
and even driving  his driving was erratic 
and um I became aware that things that he was doing prior like playing bridge and  uh and canasta that he no longer wanted to play 
he didn't want to  we used to square dance quite a bit 
and then he decided 
he never gave me a reason 
and at first I didn't quite understand 
and um he dropped out of a_lot_of the things 
he was a volunteer at the Kennedy_Center 
and he loved it there and they loved him 
and the next thing I know he wasn't uh going anymore 
and I tried to figure out why 
and he said 
 well  they want me to use a different technique when I write up a sale 
write it so_that he would write it  write the sales for  by hand 
and then they put it in the computer 
so  the final straw came when uh  I hadta bring somebody in the house to stay with him 
and uh that became very inconvenient for all of us because I had like three shifts 
and he got very confused with the different women 
they all happened to be black 
and so he mixed them up 
and when one wanted to feed him he'd push her hand away 
and it got to the point where I realized that they couldn't handle it and I couldn't handle it 
and that's when he went into a nursing home 
and he remained there 
and he deteriorated quite a bit 
he forgot how to walk 
he forgot how to teach  to um feed himself 
uh he didn't remember  whether  where to put the shoes whether on his feet or on his hands 
and so um they took good care of him 
he was always neatly dressed and clean  out_of bed  until he reached the point where he stopped eating 
and he eventually passed away peacefully 
I've had so many happy memories  I don't even know where to start first 
just one 
um I can't think of anything outstanding 
I guess the day I got married 
uh when my children were born 
um I'm trying to think of 
one  one really stands out 
we were fortunate enough to have my parents babysit for the children so we could get away 
and we went to Jamaica for a week 
and that was one of the most wonderful enjoyable vacations we ever had 
the weather was fine 
the food was great 
the  the entertainment 
the  just being together and um 
from all  we've been on many vacations but that one really stands out 
the scenery  the beach in front of you and um 
it was so enjoyable 
that was the only time that I remember crying the night before we hadta go home because I said 
 I don't want to leave this place 
so  I guess that's the one 
 have you been  have you been 
well  it's one thing to go with friends 
but it's another thing to go with a husband 
that's  that's what was perfect 
this one here 
is this supposed to be one story 
or is each picture supposed to be a story 
well  uh little Johnny is outside playing 
kicking a ball 
seems to be having a good time 
and lo_and_behold the ball goes through a window and it breaks 
and it goes through the window  practically onto the lap of this man who's 
is that a baby there 
 that's not 
it knocks over a lamp 
is that it 
or is it 
I see two feet here 
is there 
 it  it came through the window 
and he's sitting here 
now this is his hand 
but that looks like another leg here 
and that also looks either like a lamb 
xxx a chair 
what is this round thing over here 
is that a lamp shade 
and the man is quite surprised 
and he is wondering  could his son have done that 
and he decides to go to the window and check 
and there's nobody there 
so  he doesn't know who to blame for this 
and I don't know 
xxx 
well  this mother who tells her son that he needs to take an umbrella because you are going to school and you'll get wet 
and he said 
 no  it's not going to rain 
and uh he insists upon going without the umbrella 
and lo_and_behold as he's walking it starts to rain 
and his shoes get wet in the puddle 
his head is wet 
he comes home drenched 
and his mother is quite upset by this 
 now why haven't you listened to me  young man 
 don't you know that mothers know best 
and he is a little bit remorseful about that 
and as a result of listening to his mother  the next time he goes out he takes the umbrella 
mother is happy 
he is not getting wet 
and everybody is very content with their life 
for some reason dad has decided to climb up the tree 
he's out on a limb 
and maybe he went to s rescue the little pussy cat that was there because his daughter is quite upset that the cat is up on the tree and can't get down 
now the dog is barking because he would like dad to come down 
somewheres 
and we're in the midst of a serious rescue 
do we pacify the dog 
do we take dad down 
or do we rescue the cat first 
what a dilemma 
these firemen really have a big job on their hands 
I'm just wondering who comes first 
yeah  I think so 
according to this book 
0  flipping pages 
hm  I don't remember who this man is 
the father is the 
okay 
the best I can 
Cinderella had a stepmother 
two stepsisters 
Cinderella was beautiful 
the two stepsisters were mean  ugly  vicious just like the mother 
and um she did all the chores in the house while the two sisters just uh indulged themselves 
and then they announced that the  the king would have a ball in the palace 
and uh everybody was invited 
of_course Cinderella was not 
and uh she would have liked to have gone to the ball 
and um along came the fairy godmother 
and he  s
 we'll get you dressed up and get you to the ball 
and she got into a beautiful gown and a  um a coach 
but um that she would hafta be back by midnight 
I'm improvising 
and off she went to the ball 
and um the Prince_Charming asked her to dance 
and she danced with him 
and I think the sisters were envious and so was the mother 
and at the stroke of midnight Cinderella knew she hadta return home 
so  she quickly uh ran down the steps to get into the coach  and in the process lost one of her slippers 
and uh she got back to the house with the stepmother and the stepsisters 
well  Prince_Charming was enamored with her but he didn't know who she was or where he could find her 
so  he decided to pick up the slipper and go with his attendants to the various houses in the village to see whose foot would match the slipper that was left at the ball 
and when they got to the home with the stepmother and the stepdaughters they tried to squeeze their feet into them  into the shoe 
and it wouldn't work 
and um Cinderella  they would not let Cinderella do it 
however the prince or the attendants said 
 why don't we have this  uh this young lady try on the shoe 
and they finally did 
and the shoe fit 
and that's when the Prince_Charming realized that this was the little princess who was at the ball 
and um she uh was  she went back to the palace 
and the  the king granted a marriage for uh his son Prince_Charming and Cinderella 
and they were married 
and they lived happily ever after 
well  I guess you would take two slices of white bread 
smear some peanut butter on one side  some jelly on the other 
put them together 
see that they  the top one matches the bottom one 
cut them up  across in a diagonal 
put them in some Glad bag 
and then give it to your son
