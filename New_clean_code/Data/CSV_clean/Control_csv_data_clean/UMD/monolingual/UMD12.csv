okay 
the boy's kicking what looks like a soccer ball 
only it goes through the window 
breaks the window 
and it alarms this man who notices what's happening 
he s looks out the window to see who's done it and what's happened 
okay 
well  the boy I believe it's a boy  is leaving home 
and his mother  probably his mother  is um suggesting that he take an umbrella 
she  I think she's suggesting pretty strongly 
he says no he doesn't need an umbrella 
probably says it's not gonna rain 
walks out and it is raining 
walks along further and it's raining even harder 
even perhaps windy because the rain is slanted 
he's walking through puddles 
he gets home pretty wet dripping 
and his mother or the woman is pretty mad 
got hands on her hips 
she gives him the umbrella again  I assume 
and now he's walking out a_little happier with the umbrella over his head 
this is a switch kind_of 
okay then  um the little  the little girl here who's riding a tricycle apparently 
and her  the cat went up  she either notices the cat up the tree or saw him go up 
um I think her father or somebody was trying to get up there to get the cat 
but he got stuck 
and he looks kind_of dismayed 
the dog here is barking up at the man um in the tree  stuck in the tree 
and for all of this they  the fire department has come out to rescue everyone with a ladder 
and rescue the man and the cat
