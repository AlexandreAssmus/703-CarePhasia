well  not bad 
I've given several speeches 
um haltingly 
um  I've had um  uh prestroke incidents 
TIAs 
serious illness  yes 
I was um flat on my back for a year at age ten with uh rheumatic fever 
the days before there were antibiotics 
so  there was no way to cure it 
and I was one of the few who survived at that time 
that was one of the close calls 
hm well  I  uh I was  uh when  when they told me I could get up I uh was very happy 
and I was gonna go out and play baseball 
and I crawled out of bed and immediately collapsed 
I hadta learn to walk again 
um  so   I got into all sorts of athletic activities 
um my father bought me a trumpet to build up my lung capacity again 
and uh he also bought a uh one arm printing press because he wanted me to exercise on this printing press 
so  I went into business uh printing things for people and went bankrupt at age twelve 
uh but I  I maintained uh some form of athleticism all the way up until  uh up  up  up until the time that I uh enlisted in the  in the navy 
I was a uh long distance runner in school 
I played basketball with half hour quarters 
but there were no substitutions because we could barely get together ten people at a time  laughs 
um  and it was a little bit after that that I took up skiing and  got into as much of that as I could 
and uh I think it  had a salutary effect 
that's the um naval air core flight test which is the toughest uh physical 
it's four days of uh physical examinations um as_well_as um um academic 
you hadta be at the top  top ten percent of your class to get started 
then came the physical 
that was a challenge 
and so that's why I got into the navy 
yeah  there's no  there's no aftereffect from the rheumatic fever 
um the few other people who survived  the low percentage who survived at the time I got it usually ended up with a heart murmur or heart defect of some sort 
and uh the first time I went through the navy exam they said 
 well  you've had rheumatic fever 
 you have a heart condition 
 get out 
so  when I went back again I  I checked to make sure I didn't 
and then I went back again 
and I didn't fill out the paper first 
I went through the exam and got through  got to the end and they said 
 uh well  have you had any conditions 
 yes  rheumatic fever 
 well  you  you can't be here then 
and I said 
 well  I just passed your exam 
 well  alright  if you wanna go  go 
oh  there's so many 
what kind of a story do you wanna hear 
uh  well  there  there was  there was one uh interesting time uh when I was  uh when I was trying to map malaria in Ethiopia and trying to find out why our program there wasn't working 
we  we had a  we had a good program by all appearances 
we had a cadre of people who had their own uniforms 
and they looked like an army 
and they'd go from village to village spraying up everything in sight 
and still malaria 
why 
so  I went out looking for answers 
and on this one occasion I drove for  across this desert area for about oh  musta been six hours 
I'd been warned not to be caught on the desert after dark 
and I'm getting a_little concerned 
I was also warned about the Danakil people uh also called Afars 
very um  no uh I don't think you'd call it hostile 
but they didn't have many friends because their  their  uh the way they qualify for marriage 
they had these mass weddings that were made 
the way they qualified it was by demonstrating that they could protect their intended bride and usually that meant by mutilating someone else and bringing back part of the body 
so   after about six hours uh we happened upon this little group of tuplesn  round mud houses 
and we stopped the uh Landrover 
and we were surrounded by about twenty guys 
and the minute I saw them I knew they were Afars 
I thought 
 boy  I shouldn't be here 
and it turned out that about a third of the community  maybe more  were down with malaria 
and they assumed that I was a physician because they'd  on the only white people they had seen before were physicians 
just by sheer accident I had a car full of  medication 
so  for about the next two hours I was a physician  laughs 
peering under eyelids and  and baby bottoms and  and administering this medicine 
and uh at the end of that time everybody seemed to be happy 
and suddenly the chief appeared 
seven feet high  long slender guy in this long white robe and a deep deep voice 
and he ordered them to bring up what I was told was the ceremony for honored guests 
I said 
 what's that 
they said 
 smoked camel's milk 
and I had had an upset stomach for the previous two days 
I said 
 apologize for me and tell them that I appreciate the honor but 
and the driver kicked me and he said 
 you've been doing fine up until now  FirstnameJ 
 don't ruin it 
so  we had smoked camel's milk 
it's better than Pepto_Bismol 
it really works 
and I kept asking for seconds and thirds 
and the chief got a big smile on his face 
it all ended well 
I don't know whether this is in your interview or not 
but um at my age I very often uh forget the word that I want to say 
and it's getting a_little worse  laughs 
names especially 
well  the dad sends the son out to get a_little exercise 
and  he finds the soccer ball ending in his lap 
and he looks out there and he says 
 good shot  son 
end of story 
oh  this reminds me of my childhood 
um  mom wants son to take an umbrella with him 
and he says 
 I don't need that 
 um it's just something to get in the way 
and is surprised on his trip by running into a rain storm 
he comes home drenching wet 
mother says 
 I told you so 
and son has learned a lesson 
just like my childhood 
laughs this  this is an instant right out_of my life 
girl's  girl's cat has crawled up into the tree 
and the dad says 
 well  I'll go fetch it 
why is the dog barking 
I don't know 
possibly because there's a man in the tree 
uh and in the course of fending off the dog he accidentally kicks down his own ladder 
somebody called for help 
here comes the firemen to get him out_of the tree 
this happened to the fellow next door to me 
uh when I had a house nearby he got up on the roof to repair it and uh accidentally kicked down the ladder 
and he called me over and said 
 can you pick the ladder up 
and I said 
 well  not for a while 
 I wanna call the neighbors here 
 maybe I can charge admission to see this 
mhm 
vaguely 
this goes way back 
wow  I don't remember this version 
yeah 
these these two  first two pages I don't remember at all 
xxx 
uh 
good lord 
this is gonna be tough to remember 
0  flipping though book 
something missing here 
oh  there it is 
hm  what's with the key 
I don't  remember that part 
0  humming 
and I don't remember those  first two pages 
but I gather that this is a wealthy young lady here who  lives on an estate 
and uh  is um  is to have a um ball  maybe coming out party 
I don't know 
is that the way the story goes 
mhm 
well  as I recall  Cinderella and  and her  sisters were all workers in this estate 
and uh  she being the youngest one was the most discriminated against 
the others uh uh treated her badly 
she always got the worst tasks to perform   and longed for a different life 
uh  I don't remember the bit about the key  uh her 
her sister locks her in the room 
I don't know 
uh  well  that comes a_little later 
a fairy godmother comes along and grants her wish because she's been such a  good person 
and uh uh  the arrangement is that she can attend the ball but she hasta be home by midnight 
and uh  at the ball she meets this charming handsome gentleman who takes an interest in her 
uh but then hasta flee uh on schedule to avoid  the  uh  being converted back into a chambermaid 
and in the process  loses her shoe 
the uh handsome gentleman  uh upon  upon discovering the shoe  determines he's gonna look for a person that  uh that that fits 
uh  and the evil sisters are determined it's gonna be one of them 
so  that must be where the key comes in 
they lock her room 
I don't know  I don't recall how she gets out 
but at any rate uh it's eventually discovered that she is the person that it fits 
and everybody lives happily ever after except for the mean old sisters 
almond butter 
absolutely 
well  I usually put almond butter on one uh  slice of bread and  and jelly on the other and fold it
