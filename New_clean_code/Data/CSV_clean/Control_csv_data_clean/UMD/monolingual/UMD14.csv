mhm 
okay  the boy kicked the soccer ball 
and it  flew into the  window on the house next door probably and broke the window 
and it fell inside  the man's house 
and it hit the lamp and broke it 
and the man got the ball and looked out real nasty at the kid 
trying to  and the kid probably ran away 
he's gonna go knock on his daddy's door and say 
 pay me for my broken window 
mama said to the little boy 
 it's supposed to rain today 
 take your umbrella with you to school 
and the little boy says 
 ah no 
 I don't need an umbrella 
 it's not gonna rain on me 
and then he walks to school 
and it starts to rain 
and it rains really hard 
so  he hasta run back home 
and he's all soaking wet 
and he's not happy 
and his mother's not happy either 
and he hasta change clothes probably 
it's hard to tell 
and then he gets to walk to school with the umbrella and stay dry 
well  the little girl has a cat that  the  dog chased up the tree 
and then a nice man  maybe her daddy  came along 
and he had a ladder 
and he climbed up in the tree to get the cat 
and then the ladder fell down 
and then he's stuck in the tree 
so   somebody else watched this whole deal while the dog's still barking at the cat and called the fire department to come and rescue everybody 
and they came with their truck and ladder 
not quite there yet but they're getting there 
and there's a bird singing on the branch probably laughing at all of them 
the cat's on the other side of the tree 
says 
 I'm gonna catch the bird and eat her 
and the firemen rescued them all 
yes 
hm that's interesting 
I don't think I remember the beginning 
 I obviously don't remember a_lot_of this 
 I don't remember any of these things from when I was a kid 
I used to read science fiction 
I still do 
well   let's see 
if I remember Cinderella was maybe a little orphan girl 
the nice man took her home to his family or somebody 
and the stepmother had already had  daughters 
and they took her in 
but they treated her like  a servant 
and she did all cleaning and cooking and sweeping and stuff 
and she got leftover clothes and things the other girls had worn out  to wear 
and she was usually in the kitchen cleaning 
and an invitation came to the family to attend a ball I think in honor of uh  Prince_Charming or somebody 
and the mm evil stepmother wanted her daughters to  get the prince to fall in love with one of them so they could get married and  be rich 
and um so they all got fancied up to go to the ball 
and Cinderella wasn't asked if she wanted to go 
and she wanted to go 
and she was crying about it 
and  a good fairy godmother came along 
I'm not quite sure how she got there 
um and she  was able to  turn ordinary  things and creatures around her into fabulous ones 
and she turned a pumpkin into a coach and the old nags into beautiful horses 
and  she turned the mice into something 
anyway  and she gave her a beautiful dress and glass slippers 
and she went to the ball after everybody else had already left 
and when she came in the prince saw her and thought she was beautiful and wanted to meet her and dance with her 
and they danced the night away 
and the evil stepmother and stepsisters were very angry 
then the mm fairy godmother had warned her that at midnight all of those special things would turn back into what they were in the beginning 
and so she hadta be sure to leave by midnight 
and she was a little late 
and she was running down the stairs to get to her coach 
and she lost a glass slipper 
and the prince picked it up and was calling out to her  I think 
and she jumped in the coach 
and it ran away  they ran away from the ball 
and it turned back into a pumpkin 
and her clothes turned back into rags 
and she had one glass slipper on her foot 
and then the prince was very sad 
and he wanted to find her 
and he  they took the glass slipper she had  that had come off her foot when she was running down the stairs 
and they went to all the ladies trying to see if it would fit 
and the evil stepsisters tried to get their big feet in the slipper 
and it wouldn't fit cause they had big feet 
and uh finally Cinderella got to try on the slipper 
and it fit 
and the prince and the  was delighted that that was the lady he wanted to marry 
he was in love with her 
so  he found out 
they told him  I guess 
and  all the rest of the family was really put out by it and jealous of Cinderella then 
and she married the prince 
and they lived happily ever after 
the end 
um so  we're gonna do something a_little different 
well  oddly enough I never had peanut butter and jelly growing up 
I still haven't had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
it was not part of my growing up 
but I'd take two pieces of white bread 
and I'd put peanut butter  probably if it were me I'd put it on both pieces of bread 
and then I'd put jelly in the middle 
and I happen to like   well  grape jelly I think would go good with peanut butter probably 
strawberry is nice too 
and then I'd smush it together 
and then I'd cut it in half diagonally 
I believe 
we didn't eat peanut butter growing up 
I still never had a peanut butter and jelly sandwich at all 
occasionally I eat peanut butter out_of a jar because it's a protein 
and I  my stomach is growling at me  you_know 
adequate 
a few words of French occasionally 
I listen to people speaking Spanish 
and you_know I picked up a word or two 
and I usually can figure out what they're saying when they're trying to speak English 
and people who speak  
I don't know what language is pakis that Pakistan 
and that there's multiple languages 
and I hear Arabic I  people wherever I go 
so  I hear English that's accented that way 
most of the time I  can figure them out too 
no 
illness 
well  my daddy died of a heart attack 
and my mother probably died of a stroke although they said heart attack 
strokes ran in her family and heart attacks in his 
and uh my mother had emphysema 
I guess these days they call it COPD 
she  well  her family were coal miners 
and you talk about secondhand cigarette smoke 
well  my family's got secondhand coal dust 
because they carried it in 
and by the time she was  in her early twenties  she already had stuff that showed up on the tv xrays that they do because she worked in a school cafeteria 
back in the days where they actually cook real food 
that's mostly  I_mean I've got glaucoma and you_know those kind of things but 
that's  well  I have diabetes 
that seems to run in the part of  my daddy's family 
hm well  I always wanted to do horseback riding 
and a friend of mine who was about ten years older when we were working up here in the mid sixties saw a notice for like half a dozen horseback riding lessons at Rockcreek_Park_Stables in the district 
and she wanted to go but she didn't wanna go by herself so she asked me to go with her 
and since I'd always sorta wanted to do that I went with her 
and they taught um English_style riding 
and we took this introductory group of uh lessons 
and she quit and I kept on 
and um in fact one summer when they have like summer camp for the school kids  my boss was nice enough to let me take a week of leave and go to summer horseback riding camp 
yeah 
but it was lots_of fun 
I learned a_lot 
and uh I enjoyed that for a couple years until I had sort_of a accident 
they tended to put me on this nasty little horse that would shy 
you_know  we'd be gestures 
and he'd go like that gestures at sound 
and I usually went right off  you_know 
and  uh so a couple of times  and I don't land on my feet 
so  I sorta landed on my lower back and so that's caused me problems 
and uh I didn't go back after that 
but it was really nice while I did it 
little bit of  almost jumping 
the best part was riding the jump trail in Rockcreek_Park which is a  a horse trail that they've let the little  little usually trees fall across 
and it's rough 
and if you take  and my horse because he didn't like his neighbor horses 
we were always at the end of the line 
that's not a good place to be when other horses are moving along 
because horses being herd creatures  they wanna catch up 
and stay with their good buddies 
and so the front of the line is trotting over the obstacles 
and I'm in the back of the line 
and he's running to catch up 
and um it's a_little more exciting being at the end of the line 
but it was really  it was really good 
but now I do helicopters and it's better
