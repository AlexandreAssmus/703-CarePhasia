I speak pretty well  I think 
the language is certainly 
no INV
no 
 oh  yeah serious illness INV
uh I mentioned the um um appendix  the ruptured appendix 
I think that was 
well  I was out_of work for about eight weeks 
I was in the hospital for about fourteen days 
yeah 
I was pretty sick 
my current favorite story is um a day last year 
it might have been the year before last 
it was Christmas time  getting towards Christmas time 
and I was to meet some friends for lunch at Zaytinia downtown 
and I realized when I got down there that I was an hour early 
it was kinda cold 
DC sets up a um a kind of a Christmas bazaar down on G_Street 
I guess it's G_Street 
and they had closed the street to traffic 
and there were wonderful little kiosks along the street with really nice stuff 
and I was kinda cold so I bought a wool beret 
and then I felt fine 
I walked around 
and I walked  I was walking up Seventh_Street 
and up ahead of me on the right in descending letters it said Regal_Cinema 
just across the street was another sign also descending that said Legal_Seafood 
and on the window of the bank facing me right below that sign was coming soon Eagle_Bank 
I love  I love Washington 
okay 
I make up a story 
okay 
okay  we've got a  a  a perfectly okay little boy playing with a soccer ball 
and he kicks it 
and it goes through the window of the house  probably his own house 
and it breaks the window knocks over a lamp and causes quite a startled reaction on the part of a man who is probably his father 
who then picks up the ball stares out the window and probably swears at the  at the little boy 
um this is another little boy 
they're a_lot_of trouble 
um this little boy does not want to take an umbrella to school 
you can tell he's going to school because he's got his backpack on 
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella 
and he's saying 
 nope 
and he walks out the door and waves goodbye 
and it starts raining on him 
and he runs home 
and he's soaking wet 
and his mother is frowning at him 
and the next thing you see is him wi with  walking with an umbrella 
okay 
the cat went up the tree 
the little girl wants her kitty_cat down 
and the father clearly tried to go up the tree and get it 
and he got up there 
and the ladder fell 
okay 
um Cinderella's father married um for the second time when um Cinderella's mother had died 
and he married a woman who had two rather unpleasant daughters 
and then he himself died leaving her in the care of this woman who treated her as the family servant and made her um clean the fireplaces  hence the name Cinderella 
and do other menial work 
 um at some point the prince of the  whatever  principality it was um was in need of a wife 
said his father and the I don't know   minister of whatever  marriages 
so  they cooked up a scheme to have a ball 
and um they sent out invitations to um all the eligible young women  in the principality 
Cinderella got one but she of_course could not  did not think she could go because she didn't have the clothes or even transportation 
but then her fairy godmother came and dressed her in beautiful clothing and magically created a pumpkin as a coach with um white horses and a footman and so_forth 
so  she was able to go to the ball 
but the provision was she must must leave at midnight 
she went to the ball 
and she was quite beautiful and very much celebrated 
and the prince danced with her and basically fell in love 
midnight came 
and she suddenly realized when the clock began to strike that she hadta be out_of there 
so  she hurried away 
and in her hurrying she lost one slipper which was a glass slipper that the fairy godmother had created for her 
um she was able to get to the coach and drive away before it turned back into a pumpkin and the horses into mice and so forth 
but she managed to get home anyway 
and um later  the  um the prince was very depressed 
he had fallen in love with this woman 
and she had disappeared 
all he had left was a glass slipper 
and he refused to entertain the notion of marrying anyone else 
so  the  his father  who I guess was the king  and the minister of marriages um went from house to house with the prince with the glass slipper and made every eligible young woman try it on 
and of_course it would not fit anyone at all  including the two unpleasant stepsisters 
even_though I believe in one story one of them cut off a toe in order to fit  try to fit in 
but it still didn't work 
and it got blood all over the place 
but finally the prince saw that there was one person in the household who had not tried on the slipper 
it was Cinderella 
and of_course she was just um um a sladeyn 
but he insisted that she try it on 
and sure enough it fit 
so  he had found his bride 
and there was great celebration throughout the land 
and they got married and lived happily ever after 
how I would make a peanut butter and je 
the first place I would be doing it for somebody else because I hate it 
but I  you would  I would take two pieces of bread 
and I'd put peanut butter on one using a knife 
and I would use a different knife to get the jelly out and put it on the other piece of bread 
and then I'd put the two together 
and I would probably slice it 
because it would be for a kid I'd probably slice it in quarters
