Spanish 
no 
my mother had M_S 
in her case it was medicine  medical and therapy  physical therapy 
mhm 
how much detail do you want 
I got married in nineteen seventy six 
the story of it or a story that goes 
you just wanna hear me speak basically 
at the reception back in those days I was not much of a hugging type person 
my brother inlaw is very much a hugging type person 
he's a big burly guy 
so  we're going down the reception line 
and when I got to him he xxx 
I stuck my arm straight out at him like 
 no  you're shaking my hand 
oh  okay INV
the boy kicks the soccer ball 
the soccer ball hits the window 
the soccer ball breaks through the window into the man's house 
it knocks the lamp off the table 
and now the man is looking out the window holding the soccer ball as_if to find out where it came from 
okay 
okay 
the mom appears to be telling the boy  the child to take the umbrella 
the child doesn't want the umbrella 
he wanted  no  he's not 
he goes out walking 
and it starts raining 
he turns around and runs back home 
and he's all wet 
and the mother's looking at him like 
 I told you so 
and then he ends up carrying the umbrella and going out after all 
we've all been there and done that 
no  I don't need an umbrella 
when I was a kid umbrellas were like girl things 
 boys didn't wanna carry umbrellas 
we wear a raincoat or a hat or something 
okay 
the  kitty is up in the tree 
the little girl  it's obviously her kitty 
she's got her hands out waiting for kitty 
the man went up the tree apparently to get the kitty 
the ladder has now fallen down 
there's a dog down there barking 
so the man can't jump down but the fire truck with the real leader has finally come to the rescue 
a book oh_boy 
Cinderella 
alright 
yes 
okay 
let me make sure I'm remembering the right fairy tale then 
you_know  we had these when I was a kid 
oh  yeah 
xxx a little Golden_Book 
come_on little Golden_Book 
okay  evil sisters  evil stepmother 
she's the good kid cleaning up 
her sisters are snobs 
xxx 
um  you didn't alter the pages  did you 
no  no  no  I mean the storyline  no 
well  it's kinda weird because we go from that to that 
I don't  I don't remember it skipping like that but it's been a long time 
she goes to the ball  Bippity_boppity_boo 
oh_lord  I can hear the music 
she meets the handsome prince 
he comes around to find out whose slipper  glass slipper 
he comes around to find out whose it is 
and the evil mother hides her 
yeah  I guess so 
okay 
Cinderella is the daughter 
I'm not sure from the story if she was the adopted daughter or what she was 
but Cinderella was the daughter that the rest of the family didn't particularly care for 
there was  she had a mother and of_course stepsisters who didn't like her 
they were basically jealous of her 
and um  when it came time to go to the ball they were not gonna let her go 
they wouldn't give her any nice clothes etcetera because she wasn't worthy of going to the ball with them 
along came her fairy god 
so  they go to the ball 
and she's stuck at home by herself 
along comes her fairy godmother who does her magic with her wand and gets her a beautiful gown turns a pumpkin into her carriage turns the mice into horses to pull the carriage 
and they go off to the ball 
she was obviously the most beautiful thing at the ball 
the handsome prince fell for her 
but she hadta leave by the stroke of midnight or all her magic went away 
so  she goes rushing down the stairs to leave at the stroke of midnight 
and one of the glass slippers falls 
and it gets left behind 
she comes home 
everything turns back to normal 
nobody knows any better 
but then the prince starts scouring the land with the glass slipper because he knows if he finds the girl who fits the magic glass slipper he can find his princess 
gets to their house 
the two stepsisters can't fit into the shoes 
the mother insists there is nobody else 
but lo_and_behold somehow Cinderella comes out and is found and fits the glass slipper beautifully 
and there she has her handsome prince 
and they live happily ever after 
I would make it  I would take two slices of bread 
smear peanut butter on one 
smear  probably spread the jelly on the same one 
and then put the  other piece onto it
