did you want something to  raise it up 
oh  I think I'm a very good English speaker 
everybody tells me I'm very articulate 
just like a smattering of Spanish  just really a few words 
no 
uh well  I think the most important thing that happened to me in my life was the move from New_Mexico to the east coast 
it was such an immense change culturally 
and we  also we lived in a very uh rural area in New_Mexico up in the mountains 
we lived in Towes which is the biggest town we lived in which is not a very big town at all 
so  when we came here it was absolutely shocking 
I_mean  just the fact that they had sidewalks alone 
they just amazed us 
and the street lamps and everything 
I think one thing that's different about the rural areas in the west and the urban areas in the east is the east has so much more money 
it's so much richer 
and they can afford to do all of that you_know 
we had a_lot_of unpaved roads out there 
of_course there's  the  there's a_lot um uh sparser population 
so  a_lot_of times they're not gonna pave these huge long roads all over the place 
but here it was just amazing to us  all the asphalt and concrete and steel and the immense size of the city 
it was just  indescribable the impact that it had on us 
I think it took us years to really kind_of overcome the culture shock 
so  I  I_mean I remember that period of my life all the time 
what  just the immense change that we underwent 
in fact we had um uh Spanish accents 
very heavy 
my parents always did their whole lives 
but we had such a terrible time at school  people teasing us and everything 
and we really tried hard to emulate um English speakers especially 
I used to listen to David_Niven for some reason 
I was really crazy about him 
and I wanted to sound like him 
so  you_know and it really was a  it really  it had a huge impact on us  each in their own way 
okay 
alright 
um this little boy Tommy found this ball 
oh yeah 
found a soccer ball and decided to try his luck at kicking it around 
so  he got quite aggressive with it and gave it a real big kick 
and sure enough it went through the  his neighbor's window 
his neighbor was watching television 
and suddenly a soccer ball comes crashing through the window  knocks over his lamp 
he looks out the window but there's nobody there 
okay 
there's Tommy again 
his mother s that morning knew that it was gonna rain 
she'd been listening to the weather channel 
she told him to take his umbrella 
no  he's positive that there's not gonna be any problem 
also he doesn't wanna look like a sissy with the umbrella 
and he says goodbye to his mother 
and he'll be fine 
and about two minutes into his walk it starts to really rain 
so  he runs back 
his mother's quite annoyed with him because she'd argued with him 
and he said it was not gonna rain 
he feels bad 
finally takes the umbrella and goes to school 
okay 
Susan was out playing with her dog 
and uh the dog chased a  a cat up into the tree 
and  oh  I guess it was actually her  cat 
so  she became quite upset about it 
and her neighbor came out and said 
 well  that's okay 
 don't worry about it 
 I have a ladder 
 and I'll get up there and get your cat 
so  he put the ladder up against the tree and got up on the limb 
and the ladder probably slipped and fell down on the ground 
and then he couldn't get down 
partly because his dog was down there chasing everything up the tree 
so  somebody hadta call the fire department 
and they came out and rescued the both of them 
oh yeah 
uh yeah 
I don't remember these animals 
I forgot what an involved story it is 
okay 
okay 
um Cinderella uh lived with her father and her mother in this little village 
uh when she was very young her mother passed away 
it was just her and her father 
and at some point her father told her that he was going to remarry 
he met somebody there in their village 
and he remarried 
and uh then sadly he passed away very shortly after that 
so  she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters 
and it  they turned out that the stepmother was not very nicely  she was not very nice to Cinderella 
so  uh she made Cinderella into kind_of a little maid who hadta sweep out the 
sorry 
yeah 
it's another one of these turtlenecks 
these are my favorite things 
uh so  um they turned her into a little maid 
and she hadta run around and do all the work and wait on her sisters  her stepsisters and her stepmother 
and they pretty much just made her into a little servant 
she was very unhappy 
but she didn't really know what else to do 
there was nothing else she could do 
then they heard that there was gonna be a ball given by the king and queen who had a son  the prince  who was 
uh they were trying to find a suitable bride for him 
so  they were giving a ball and inviting all of the hoi_polloi of the area 
so  the sisters decided they'd go 
and  uh  at first Cinderella thought that she might go 
and they laughed at her 
told her she didn't have anything to wear 
she was not pretty 
so they went to the ball 
she was very sad sitting among the cinders 
and her um fairy godmother shows up  appears and tells her she'll get it all set for the ball 
so  she gives her a beautiful gown and turns the little pumpkin into a carriage and mice into horses 
and I forget what she made her dress out_of 
so  she goes to the ball 
oh she gives her these beautiful glass slippers 
so  she goes to the ball 
and she meets the prince 
the prince falls madly in love with her because she's the most beautiful girl there 
but the  fairy godmother had warned her at midnight everything would turn back to what it was 
so  she saw  midnight approaching 
so  she hadta leave suddenly the prince 
you_know  she hadta run away from him and hide  run away  jump in her carriage 
and just as she got back she jumped out_of the carriage 
and everything turned back to what it was before 
so  she real thought 
 well  that's gonna be my one night of happiness 
 but I'll always remember it 
but the  pri she had left behind  the way she was running out_of the castle she had left behind her glass slipper 
the prince had run  been running around trying to find her 
and that was the only thing he found was the glass slipper 
so  he told  um his minions that he wanted to find the person who owned this glass slipper 
so  they went around to all the  villages 
and they  they had them try  had the women who might possibly be  that  uh Cinderella try on the glass slipper 
so  they got to the house of Cinderella 
and they asked her 
 how many girls do you have 
 no  I only have two 
because they had found out what was going on 
they were having them try on this glass slipper 
so  she hid Cinderella  forced Cinderella to stay inside her room 
and she  they tried the slipper on to the   um  uh the stepdaughters 
and the first one was   uh  was  the heel was too big 
so  the mother said 
 no  no  that  it'll fit 
and she took a knife and cut off part of the heel 
but it still didn't fit 
and they tried on the  for the second woman 
and  but her toe is too big 
and the mother says 
 no  no  it fits 
and she cut off her toe in secret 
but it still didn't fit 
so  they said 
 no  this isn't her  these aren't their shoes 
so  then they were leaving 
and then they thought for some reason that there might be somebody there 
I don't remember exactly  who  what clued them into that 
so  they insisted on  looking around 
and they found Cinderella 
and sure enough they tried her  the shoe on her 
and it fit 
so they took her back to the castle 
she married the prince 
and she was very forgiving 
she brought her sisters to live with them 
um well  when I make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I toast the bread 
and then I let it cool off 
and then on one side I smear the peanut  peanut butter 
then on the other side I smear the um jelly 
and then I put them together
