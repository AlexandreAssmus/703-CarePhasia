I presume you needed a special one for that  is that right 
extremely well 
a little bit of French and a little bit of Spanish and some Yiddish 
um just the neuromyasthenia INV
it  it meant I had a  six month old daughter 
uh and I was paralyzed 
so  I did hafta hire someone to help me 
but I knew that very often people do die from that 
but I live by 
 anything is possible 
and  uh and it works for me 
it did take several years 
and I did hafta have rehab which was not very effective so many years ago 
uh and I  I guess I must have had a residual from that because um I was doing reasonably well 
as a matter of fact I  I was leading groups  uh as we traveled and organizing trips and so on for Montgomery_County 
but uh the  I  I did find I then needed two hip replacements 
and recently I  about two years ago I was in an auto accident 
so  I do use a cane now 
but I'm fine 
and  and  and the daughter is fine 
this is a tough one but I'll say it anyway 
it was a sad one but it had a great impact on my entire life 
I was eight years old 
and we were extremely poor 
and uh we were dispossessed from our apartment 
and it was ice on the ground 
and at that time when that happened I made up my mind that I will never be poor again 
and that I will not rely on a man 
that I can make it on my own 
and I certainly have 
okay  here's a little boy who's having a good time 
and he kicks the ball and unfortunately it breaks a window 
and uh the  the ball rolls into the  uh a man's home 
and he's very very disturbed over this 
he looks at the window holds the ball and looks to see who kicked the ball 
I want you to know I'm enjoying this 
this is my thing 
um mama is telling this little boy 
 it's raining out 
 you hafta take the umbrella 
and he's saying 
 aw shucks  I don't need an umbrella 
so  he goes outside 
and of_course it is raining 
and he's annoyed with himself 
and he's trying to hold his head uh to get out_of the rain 
he comes in 
and he finally admits to his mother 
 yup  I guess I need the umbrella 
and he walks away with the umbrella 
 okay 
a little girl was riding her bike 
and the  the cat was following her 
and the cat ran up the tree 
she comes back crying to the father and the mother 
and the father says 
 don't worry about it 
 I'll get the cat out_of the tree 
and he takes the um  ladder 
and he climbs the tree 
and the ladder falls down 
in the meantime  a dog comes along and is barking at him 
and the cat is also a_little afraid of that dog 
so  it doesn't come down 
and the kid's still crying 
 I want my cat 
 I want my cat 
anyway  either the man uses his cell phone or she cries to her mother 
and they get the  the fire people to use the ladder to get the cat down 
yes 
a little bit 
okay 
uh Cinderella lives in a home with a wicked mother and two ugly mean sisters 
and she's really abused in every way 
they take tremendous advantage of her 
she's the cleanup person  she wears rags  and all that sort of thing 
anyway  they hear that there's a great ball coming up 
and uh the two daughters and the mother are going to the ball 
and of_course they're gonna leave Cinderella home 
they want Cinderella to help them dress and get organized for it and so on 
and so she does 
and uh she thinks about the ball 
and she's really very very sad 
and she makes a wish 
and the wish is that she can go to the ball 
when a fairy godmother appears and tells her 
 yes  you can go to the ball but you must be back by midnight 
and she says 
uh okay  I will 
and the fairy godmother dresses her magnificently well 
and she gets into this big pumpkin 
uh what can I call it 
anyway  it's  it's something that carries her to the ball 
and when she enters the prince sees her and begins to dance with her and really falls in love with her 
and she hears the midnight stroke 
and she gets tremendously upset since she had made the fairy godmother a promise 
so  she goes running down the steps 
and she loses her shoe 
and uh she gets home okay 
the prince is hunting all over to see who the shoe will fit 
and it doesn't seem to fit anyone 
and the  the ugly  the mean mother has him try on the  the shoes on the two ugly daughters 
and uh finally Cinderella comes down 
and although the mother doesn't want him to  he tries on the shoe 
and it fits her 
and I believe he  he then wants to marry her 
uh I would try and get good bread  like whole wheat bread or something like that 
and I'd first put on the peanut butter and make it medium thick 
and then get uh raspberry or strawberry jelly or blueberry jelly and put that on 
and put the second slice on top of it 
and then cut it in quarters for a young child
