okay 
I do very well speaking English 
I'm a native English speaker 
I've been speaking since  I guess  the normal age 
when do kids start to speak 
a couple of 
young  very young 
and I've been reading pretty young 
I've learned  sort_of selftaught myself to read when I was about four 
so  I was reading pretty well by kindergarten 
my speech is  I think  fluent and generally understandable 
I talk a_little fast sometimes 
that's about it 
no  not really  no 
not that I know of 
yes  my mother had a stroke 
and my grandfather had two small strokes 
my grandfather's strokes or my mother's 
my mother had a stroke when she was fifty four 
so  she was very young 
they think it was because she had um blood clots thrown from some uterine fibroids that passed through an undetected PFO xxx in her  um in her atria 
and uh then she you_know unluckily got a very large clot lodged in her left carotid 
and it basically took out essentially a fistsized portion of her left hemisphere 
um so  it's left her pretty severely impaired 
um my grandfather's strokes were smaller 
I believe they were right hemisphere 
he had some serious apraxia 
but he had no evidence of aphasia 
he was still able to read and write and did not make a_lot_of effort to speak 
I was fairly young 
um and he was  mm hemiparesis and used a wheelchair 
but again he also just was very stubborn 
he did not engage with any kind of therapy at all 
he just sort_of refused to do it 
so  he kind_of just lived in his own head for the last um maybe ten years of his life 
she's been pretty good 
um it's been ten and a half years now  almost eleven years 
yeah  it's been a long time 
uh she's been going to speech therapy pretty much continuously since then 
um initially she did uh about a month 
initially she was  after she was discharged from the hospital about two weeks after she was in subacute 
so  she was in nursing for a couple of weeks before we got her a placement in acute rehab at Hospitalname 
she was there for about a month 
and then she went back to subacute for a few weeks 
um and actually no sorry  she went home 
then she went back to the hospital just a few days after returning home to have a uh hysterectomy to remove the source of the clotting 
um and then  after that  went back to subacute because she faced some setbacks 
and then we did about a year of outpatient PT uh and got to about the 
she was not as cooperative with that 
she found it very uncomfortable 
and  right  and we got to the point where it was clear she was likely to make very little additional progress 
especially given that she was not willing to  to work at home besides doing um range of motion exercises which she does twice a day totally on her own 
she's very good about that 
so  we made a deal that if she maintained her level of function she could stay out_of physical therapy 
and she  she's doing that 
and then  but we  we continue to do speech therapy 
we've done it here for at this point  I guess  almost ten years 
and um she's done a mix of group and individual 
and she goes to an adult daycare program where she's very social 
we don't spend a_lot_of time with friends outside of that 
she has a few old friends that she sees now and then 
but we hafta make an effort unless she's sick or has something else going on to get out_of the house at least once a day even if it's just for a small short activity 
it can  it's  it's hard 
it takes a_lot_of time and effort 
and for her  uh not every activity is easy 
um so 
see  now you make me wanna think of a really good story 
well  I've told you about my mom 
that's probably the  like the singular event that's most significant 
okay  I'll tell you a story 
this is a story um about an event that I am both sure and not sure happened because it seems so weird 
but it's so clear in my mind and it still doesn't make any sense 
so  my first semester of  my first two years of college I went to Universityname in Cityname 
but my family was from DC 
and I had a car 
uh so  I would drive back and forth over break time with my car 
um it's about a thousand miles 
so  it generally takes about two days 
uh so  the first semester back  um it's winter and I'm driving across I_Eighty which is  goes through a bunch of very flat states with a_lot_of corn 
so  it is an extremely boring repetitive drive 
there is a_lot_of you_know driver tunnel vision that happens 
and it's cold and gray so it's not even pretty green fields 
it's just empty empty empty fields 
um but I'm  I'm kind_of proud of myself because it's  my first semester went well 
I was you_know independent  excited 
um so  I'm on I_Eighty in sort_of the middle of Illinois 
and there is a slowdown 
and it's very flat so I can see ahead 
I don't see that there is construction 
I don't really see an accident 
but I you_know figure something's happened  probably a minor accident 
it looks like it's a rubbernecking delay 
it's kind_of pissing me off 
I_Eighty at this point is only two lanes in each direction 
um and there's like no exits  nothing  built along it 
and we get closer and closer and closer 
and I still cannot see what's going on 
I'm just like 
 what could this be 
and we get a_little closer 
and I see okay it looks like I'm in the left lane 
um and then there's a median between the you_know east bound and west bound routes 
and I'm going east 
um and I can see that there's something over in the median to my left 
and it looks  as I get closer  like an animal 
and I get closer 
and it looks like a fairly large animal 
and I'm thinking 
 is it a cow 
 is it a moose 
I_mean  there wouldn't be a moose in Illinois 
but it looks  it looks fairly large and there's something unusual about it 
so  I'm a_little more forgiving of the rubbernecking delay 
but I'm still kind_of internally rolling my eyes going 
 why are all these people slowing down to look at a dead animal 
 wasting my time 
 I just wanna get home 
um and I get closer and I can see that there's these kind_of large hind legs 
so  it's oriented where basically it looks like the butt of the animal is basically facing the car 
and there's kind_of a long tail 
and it's brown 
and it's this big hump 
and I'm getting closer and closer and closer 
and I  you_know my mind is doing that thing where it's just trying to do the pattern matching  going 
 what is this thing 
 I don't 
 it's not a cow 
 it's not a deer 
 it's too big to be a dog 
and I'm literally  as I'm passing it  like my head is tu 
you_know  we're just creeping along 
my head is sort_of like turning and watching it and getting more and more into view 
and it's only until it's like at my shoulder and I passed it that it  my mind kind_of pattern matches and goes 
 it's a kangaroo 
and then you_know again I hafta turn around and look at the road 
and everything's cleared up behind me 
and I spent like the next five miles going 
 that's no way it was a kangaroo 
but it wasn't anything else 
it was a kangaroo 
it was clearly a kangaroo 
I saw the ears 
I saw the big massive tail 
I saw the big hind legs 
I saw the little tiny front legs 
it was a kangaroo 
and so to this day it's this thing where I just don't know 
I just don't know 
I am so certain and so uncertain that it must have been a kangaroo 
I've even start  I_mean  this was 
okay  so  this was the winter of two thousand  two thousand one 
so  the internet was a thing but it's not like 
Google was around but there weren't really  if you didn't know how to search 
and I think I've subsequently every now and then done like kangarooq roadkillq kind_of to see if there's any  any information about this but no 
I'm pretty sure it was a kangaroo 
and there must have just been one of those like animal adventure parks or something like that 
so  it's not a significant story 
but it is kind_of a funny story 
laughs I just don't know how 
I just  I am so certain and so uncertain 
and I mostly just kind_of like remember the feeling of like my head turning and going 
 what 
it doesn't have a neat little conclusion 
I don't know 
I don't know 
if it wasn't a kangaroo there'd be no story of it 
it couldn't be anything 
nothing else looks like a kangaroo except a kangaroo 
I_mean  it had like the big big muscular legs with the hind  I_mean massive hind feet 
I don't know what else it possibly could have been 
anything else that it might have been  a wallaby or something like that 
wallabys are pretty small 
it still wouldn't have been in Illinois 
I_mean  basically if it's not a dog or a cow or a deer  it's something that shouldn't be there 
okay  what am I looking at 
okay 
okay 
a beginning and middle and end 
alright so  there's a little boy named Ralph 
Ralph is a science geek kid 
his dad is a former athlete 
his dad is always on Ralph's back about you_know 
 yeah  you gotta participate in a team sport 
 you gotta  you gotta learn to be a member of a team and to compete 
 and you_know  it's fine if you like science and you wanna become an astronaut 
 but you_know  you still gotta learn some skills 
 so uh here  I bought you this um  this soccer ball  so_that you can you_know 
 it's easy to play soccer 
 all you hafta do is run around 
 you don't even really hafta have some skill 
 but here's this soccer ball 
 let's go out and practice 
so  Ralph whines and whines and whines 
and his dad says 
 listen  if you uh  if you don't do this then uh I'm gonna hafta severely restrict your internet time uh to get you to be a wellrounded kid 
so  finally Ralph goes outside 
and he's practicing with the soccer ball 
and of_course he's pretty terrible 
and he  he can't quite get it 
he keeps doing the Charlie_Brown thing  running up to it  missing  almost falling down 
and finally finally finally he kicks it 
it arcs high 
he sees it 
it goes toward the house  toward the house  toward the house  into the living room 
Ralph's dad  we'll call him Jake  uh looks up 
and the soccer ball comes in and it knocks over this lamp 
but that's okay 
it's an ugly lamp 
he hates the lamp 
his wife might be mad but you_know for now 
uh and he's just  he's getting really angry 
and he gets up and he sees  he  he walks over to the  uh the window 
and he looks out 
and he's like 
 Ralph 
and Ralph's like 
 I was just practicing 
 can I use the internet now 
the dad Jake sighs and is like 
 yeah  you can use the internet 
he gives up at that point on ever making his son wellrounded and decides his son will just be the best damn astronaut that ever there was 
the end 
okay 
um well  this one's pretty simple 
there's a mom 
we'll call her Sally 
and there's a kid 
we'll call him Andre 
Sally has bought Andre a really really ugly umbrella 
Andre refuses to use it 
he gives it back 
he says to his mom 
 listen  mom 
 I'm gonna go out 
 it's going to be fine 
 I don't think there's gonna be rain 
 I'm a meteorology nerd 
 I saw  on our local news  my favorite meteorologist said there's no way there's gonna be rain 
 so  you keep your ugly umbrella 
 and uh if it does rain I'll come back and you get to say that you were right 
so  of_course little Andre  did I say  goes out into the weather 
and it immediately starts raining 
he thinks 
 ah gosh darn it 
 that meteorologist  I'm gonna hafta start watching channel nine instead of channel seven 
he runs back inside 
he's very upset 
he looks at his mom and he goes 
 you were right 
 the  the channel seven guy was wrong 
and mom says 
 well  I told you so 
 and you told me I could tell you so 
 here's your umbrella 
and little Andre goes out 
and he's got his umbrella 
and uh he's in the rain 
and he just thinks 
 well  I guess I'm a channel nine viewer now 
the end 
alright 
um there's a little girl Jenny 
she has a cat named Moggy 
Moggy  uh she's trying to play dressup with Moggy 
Moggy gets very upset 
he manages to dash out_of the door  um where he encounters the dog named Goldie 
Goldie starts barking at Moggy 
Moggy runs up this tree in the middle of the yard 
meanwhile little girl Jenny runs after them 
she starts yelling and yelling and yelling 
the cat won't come down 
he's terrified  little Moggy 
Jenny goes to the garage and gets out a ladder um and tries to  to carry it 
it's very awkward 
into the yard 
she's dragging it across the yard when her dad looks up 
he sees her out the window and starts yelling 
 no Jenny no  that's too dangerous 
so  the dad comes  grabs the ladder  sits it against the tree  climbs up it to try to get Moggy 
uh as he's climbing up the tree um uh Goldie the dog knocks the ladder over 
poor dad is stuck in the tree 
the ladder is too unwieldy for little Jenny 
she runs back to the house 
she calls the nineoneone 
uh the fire department comes running out 
on her way back she grabs her tricycle and tricyclesv out to the tree just to you_know save time 
and uh all this time the  the uh fire department comes out 
they rescue dad 
they rescue Moggy after a_lot_of difficulty 
and this whole time this little bird is just singing  enjoying the show 
the end 
sure 
okay 
well  I remember Cinderella but I will um give it a first shot 
oh_boy 
it's very much inspired by the Disney Cinderella 
okay 
once_upon_a_time there was a little girl named Ella 
she was the uh daughter of two loving parents 
only one day when she's a little girl  her mother dies suddenly 
it's very tragic 
everybody cries 
everybody loved her mother 
uh her father  in his grief and in his worry about Cinderella having a mom  goes out and remarries to a woman who has two daughters of her own 
all three women unfortunately are spiteful jealous creatures 
um he brings them all home to his lovely manor where they uh immediately take a dislike to Cinderella but mostly keep it under wraps 
until the father  partly out_of heartbreak and partly out_of just a really bad diet  also dies 
uh at this point the stepsisters and the stepmother turn Cinderella basically into a skivvy 
um they make her run around working all the time  then begin mocking her for being dirty 
and they call her Cinderella 
now their greatest ambition in life is to become even wealthier and more powerful than they already are 
so  one day when the prince who has been seeking a bride and apparently is very unhappy with all the other brides  all the other potential brides and princesses in the adjoining lands decides he will marry one of his own people 
or perhaps he's commanded to hold a ball 
um and he will invite all of the eligible women of his kingdom to the ball um to meet and hopefully find a match 
so  the stepmother and the stepsisters are very excited about this 
they spend almost all the money they have on beautiful beautiful gowns 
um Cinderella is both enchanted by the beauty of the gowns and wishes that she could go too just to you_know get out_of the house and to have a bit of glamour 
uh but of_course they won't let her 
because they  they tell her that she would be an embarrassment 
but mostly they don't want the competition 
so  they go off to the ball 
and uh Cinderella is left alone sort_of brokenhearted and downcast in basically an empty house 
and she begins crying 
and she's crying and crying by the fireplace when all_of_a_sudden a woman materializes from the flames and says 
 Cinderella  why are you crying 
Cinderella says 
 I just  I just wanted to go to the ball 
 I just wanted one night of happiness and joy 
and the woman says 
 well  I am your fairy godmother and it is within my power to grant this 
 so  can you bring me a pumpkin and some mice and uh some frogs 
 and um uh you're already wearing some dirty old rags and slippers so that will do 
and she waves her wand 
and the pumpkin turns into a carriage 
and her ball  her dress rags turn into a beautiful glorious ball gown  and her slippers into slippers of cut glass 
and you_know  none nearly as beautiful or interesting or dazzling 
and she turns the mice and the frogs into horses and coachmen 
and Cinderella is just overcome with joy 
and she gets into the carriage 
and she's about to ride off to the ball when the fairygodmother says 
 unfortunately my magical power is limited 
 and at midnight when the  the chimes go  uh everything will turn back 
 so  make sure that you are well away from the ball and  and out of you_know an embarrassing compromising situation before that happens 
so  Cinderella says 
 I will  I will 
and she waves goodbye 
she goes off to the ball 
and she arrives 
and it's even more dazzling than she thought 
and she comes in 
and everybody is just enchanted with her because she's beautiful and charming 
and uh in the midst of  of her being greeting by  by throngs of enchanted admirers the prince looks up 
and he sees her 
and he asks her to dance 
and they begin to dance 
and of_course they're both super hot so they immediately fall in love for no other good reason except that they think that they'd have really cute kids together 
uh and the prince is  is about to propose to her there and then on the spot 
and the clock begins to strike twelve 
and she says 
 oh_no oh yeah  I need to go 
she  she runs off 
and the prince is kind_of stumped for a minute 
he's thinking 
 wait a minute 
 there's a lady running away from me 
 what is this about 
uh so  she gets a good head start 
even_though she's wearing heels of glass she runs out_of the ballroom down the palace stairs toward her coach  uh the prince chasing after her all the while 
on the bottom of the stairs she loses one of her shoes 
she doesn't have time to stop and pick it up 
she leaps into the coach 
it starts racing out_of the palace grounds and  and down the road as the clock you_know slowly strikes midnight 
and um on the way it transforms back into a pumpkin and  and her clothes back into rags 
and she hasta run the rest of the way home 
the prince has been unable to catch up with her in time 
he did not have a coach at the ready  you_know being in his own palace and all 
uh but he has the shoe 
and he looks at the shoe 
and it's  it's very delicate and tiny 
and he thinks 
 I have a clue 
 and I shall not rest until I find this woman because truly she's the hottest lady I've ever seen 
um it's gotta be her 
nobody else 
so  he sets off the next day to tour his kingdom which is actually quite modest um but still a kingdom 
and uh goes to every house and tries the shoe on every person  every woman of eligible age 
and it doesn't fit any of them because they all have gigantic extra wide feet which everybody knows are unattractive for some reason 
and uh finally he gets to  to the manor house where Cinderella lives with her stepsisters and her stepmother 
and he tries the shoe on the first stepsister 
and it doesn't fit 
and he tries it on the second stepsister 
and it doesn't fit 
and he's about to leave um when he  he sees in the corner of the courtyard this  this little servant girl 
and she's  she's sweeping away all of the dust 
and he just has a sense 
he has a sense 
he says 
 I don't know 
 she's kind_of dirty but she looks kind_of hot 
 I don't remember if she's as hot as the lady I saw last night but let's give it a go 
so  he uh  he calls her over 
and the stepmother the whole time is like 
 no no  it couldn't be her 
 she's just a gutter wench 
 you don't want anything to do with her 
 she's dumb 
 she's ugly 
 she's infertile 
 why not consider one of my daughters 
 you_know  they're  they might not be your first choice but they're a pretty good second bet 
the prince continues to wave her away 
and he approaches Cinderella 
and he asks her to try on the shoe 
and she does 
and of_course it fits 
and he thinks 
 good enough for me 
and he whisks her away 
and they marry 
and depending on um your sense of vengeance possibly birds come down and peck out the eyes of the evil stepmother and stepsisters 
possibly they just feel really bad 
um supposedly everybody who should live happily ever after lives happily ever after 
the end 
well  clears
let's assume that 
I'm not gonna make the bread from scratch or grow the peanuts 
you would uh go to the grocery store purchase bread whatever kind of bread that you like 
if it's not already been sliced you would need to slice it at home or have it sliced at the grocery store or bakery wherever you prefer 
uh take two slices of bread 
take a jar of peanut butter 
again if you wanna buy you_know your organic custom ground at Whole_Foods you can do that 
or you could just get you_know your jar of generic Jif from Giant 
uh also jelly or jam or preserves 
there's very little difference between the two 
I'm sure somebody could tell you 
grape is traditional 
also purchase that at a grocery store 
open both up both of those jars 
might need one of those assistant little clamper things if it's really on tight 
um you need a plate 
put one piece of bread on the plate 
take a knife 
spread first the peanut butter on the bread 
then in_order_to avoid cross contamination  clean the knife 
put it in the jelly 
spread the jelly on the other slice of bread 
put the two slices of bread together with the jelly and the peanut butter facing each_other 
not outward 
it's not a sticky sandwich 
and uh then if you like you can slice it down the middle either in a diagonal or straight across 
and then stick it in your mouth then chew
