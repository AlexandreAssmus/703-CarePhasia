 I do great speaking English 
that's my native language 
I speak a little bit of Spanish 
I've never had a stroke 
um serious illness 
I don't consider it a serious illness 
ongoing  I guess  chronic pain 
yes 
I have had  yes 
um  a serious illness 
um my mother has had Eosinophilic Fascitis 
um years ago at age forty eight 
um and has slowly gotten better from that 
yeah  she has done physical therapy to help improve her condition 
um she does massage twice a week 
and she does um a little bit of exercise but no medication 
oh okay 
okay  so  I just tell you what happened in picture one 
okay 
so  there was a little boy who was kicking a soccer ball 
and he kicked it  outside 
and it went into a window 
and then it broke the window 
oh  I see 
and then it hit a lamp 
and  then  this man 
oh okay 
the ball landed  I guess 
the man that caught the ball 
and he saw  he looked out the window at the broken glass 
okay 
so in the first pi picture  okay  so  the mom is gonna hand  a little boy an umbrella 
um it looks like he's gonna go somewhere  with a backpack on 
then he goes outside 
and it starts raining 
oh  he steps in a puddle 
and his hair's wet 
oh  he came home 
his hair  his mom is angry at him 
I think his mom is angry at him 
maybe she's angry at him because his hair is wet 
then he went  maybe he forgot to use the umbrella 
I'm not sure 
then he went back outside 
and he used the umbrella 
was that right 
okay 
oh_gosh  there's a_lot going on here 
I see a  and there's  there's a cat in a tree 
and let's see 
the girl is trying to get her cat down 
so  maybe the dad climbed up the ladder to help get her cat down 
oh  then the ladder fell 
maybe he used the ladder to get the cat down 
then the ladder fell down 
she's trying to catch this cat maybe 
I don't know why these people are here 
maybe they're coming to help get the cat down 
and  I don't know why he's upset 
I don't know what the dog is doing 
is that it 
how I would make one 
I would use two pieces of bread 
and I would put them down on the table 
and then I would take the peanut butter out_of the cabinet 
and I would take the jelly out_of the refrigerator where I keep it 
I would take a knife and put peanut butter on one side of the piece of bread 
and then I would use a knife for that 
and I would probably use the same knife and put it in the jel or  I would probably use a different knife and put the jelly on the other side of the bread 
and I put the two pieces of bread together 
and then I would cut them either in half or on a diagonal 
and then that would be it 
and then I would wrap it in cellophane 
for one of the boys to take to school 
and then I'd put it in the freezer 
because I make five at a time
