so  Cinderella is the story of a young  woman who um 
she is very poor 
and she lives with her aunt and her uh three steps 
well   no  actually it was her stepmother and her three stepsisters 
and um they  they treat her very badly because she's the  the steprelative 
and they make her do all of the work around the house the cooking the cleaning and  while they sit around and eat bonbons and take baths 
um and one day they  let her come to the house saying that the king is going to be throwing this lavish party for his son and is going to be looking for a bride 
and the stepmother is just thrilled because she knows that the prince will want to marry one of her three daughters 
and Cinderella hears about it 
and the stepmother says you_know she's gonna hafta help to make the dresses for the  for her daughters 
and  um and she can stay at the house while they go to this fancy party 
and they you_know all get all excited and get ready and go 
and while um Cinderella's at home  cleaning up her fairy godmother comes and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball 
and she waves her magic wand 
and um the pumpkin turns into a stage coach 
and her tattered clothes turn into this beautiful ball gown 
and um she's whisked away to this lavish party 
and  um and she's uh also given these glass slippers to wear 
and  um and she   of_course  she comes into this party 
and nobody recognizes that it's her  including her stepmother and her stepsisters 
um and so she's this beautiful mysterious girl who comes into this party 
and of_course the prince is immediately attracted to her and not the  stepsisters 
he dances with her 
and they immediately fall in love 
and she  um and they have a  a dance 
and  in the middle of this dance she remembers her  god her fairy godmother's instructions that she needs to be home before midnight or else the spell will be broken 
and so she realizes that it's almost midnight 
and she runs from the palace 
and in doing so she ends up dropping one of her shoes 
and um she goes  she gets home just in time 
and um  you_know she  when the  when the stepmother and the stepsisters come home she you_know is  is home in her tattered clothes again 
and she's cleaning 
and she asks them how the party went 
and they  they're not happy because the prince didn't notice them of_course 
um but then the prince  he wants to find this mysterious girl 
and the only way that he has to find her is the glass slipper that he found 
and  but he decides he's going to go to every house  to everywhere any girl who was at the party lives and put the slipper on 
and that will be the way he will identify this girl 
and so he eventually arrives at the stepmother's house 
and of_course the three girls run right over because they  they know that they're gonna one  that one of them is going to fit the shoe perfectly 
and of_course none of them do because their feet are too big 
and they  the stepmother figures out that the  the shoe belongs to Cinderella 
and she tries to hide Cinderella 
but the  I think it was the fairy godmother who  who comes along and rescues Cinderella 
or maybe it was the mice 
anyway they   they free Cinderella 
and the prince sees her and has her put on the shoe 
and of_course it fits 
and everything is just wonderful 
and they get married 
okay 
um I would get two slices of bread 
and I would put peanut butter on both slices of bread 
and then I would take the jelly 
and I would put it on one slice of the bread 
and then I would put the one slice of bread on top of the other
