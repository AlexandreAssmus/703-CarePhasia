yes 
uh my brother inlaw had cancer 
and um oh serious illnesses 
um friends that have  I've had friends at work who had illnesses 
one of them died of cancer 
in the two cancer situations there was nothing to do to get better 
it was just you_know the progression of the disease 
oh  uh the birth of my children which is a happy  a happy occasion and one of the best things in my life 
um so  that was  those were  those times were both exciting 
and then their childhood and all the antics that go with that 
okay  um  a young boy is out in the yard playing soccer 
he's in his front yard playing soccer 
and he kicks the ball 
and it goes through his neighbor's window uh into the neighbor's family room where the neighbor is sitting there watching television 
and it goes right in to where the neighbor is sitting 
and the neighbor is jumping up 
he jumps up to find out where that soccer ball came from 
he looks out into the yard to see who kicked the soccer ball 
okay 
okay  little Johnny is getting ready to go off to school 
and his mother as  as he's getting ready to walk out the door his mother says 
 don't forget your umbrella 
and he tells his mother 
 I don't need an umbrella 
and he says 
 bye  mom 
 I don't want an umbrella 
 I'll be fine 
he gets outside 
he's walking 
and it starts to rain 
and it rains harder and harder and harder 
so  he turns around 
and he runs home and goes inside 
and he's drenched 
and his mother asks him 
 what's wrong 
and he says 
 I need my umbrella 
so  then she gives him the umbrella 
and he takes it and goes out  back outside in the rain where he isn't going to get wet anymore 
but I believe he has changed his clothes first before he goes back outside because he goes outside dry 
and he stays dry with the umbrella 
okay

so  um Cinderella 
her father uh remarried a woman after her mother died 
and this woman had two daughters 
and so Cinderella came to live with um her father and her stepmother and two stepsisters 
and then her father passed away 
and she was left with her stepmother and her two stepsisters 
so  um they were very mean to Cinderella 
and she became like  a housekeeper for them 
she did everything in the house and she cleaned and she cooked 
and  and they treated  mistreated her 
so  one day there was a ball given by the king and queen uh to find a suitable wife for their son the prince 
um so  the invitation came 
and the stepsisters were all excited 
but poor Cinderella she couldn't go 
she didn't have the clothes 
her stepmother and stepsisters said she wasn't invited to the king's ball 
so  she  um she wished she could go to the ball 
but uh she had no way to do that 
and she was very sad 
and so the night of the ball  the stepsisters get to go to the ball 
they're all dressed up 
they're very fancy and  and ready to go to the ball 
and out the door they go 
Cinderella is down in the basement 
and she's crying 
and all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appears uh and asks why she's crying 
and she says she wished she could go to the ball 
and so the fairy godmother said that she could 
and she  uh fairy godmother turned a pumpkin into a carriage and the mice that were running around into um uh carriage drivers 
and uh they had  she had horses for the carriage 
and she uh casts the spell 
and Cinderella has a beautiful dress 
and um she  her hair is beautiful 
she has a beautiful dress 
and she says 
 you will go to the ball 
 go to the ball 
 but one  one rule is that at twelve o'clock midnight you must be home by twelve o'clock because all of this magic is going to go away 
Cinderella goes off to the ball 
she gets there 
the prince becomes smitten with her when he sees her 
he's dancing with her 
her stepsisters are just seething because who is this  who is this girl that the prince has that he keeps dancing with 
they wanted to be chosen by the prince 
and the night is going wonderfully 
and then she hears the clock strike twelve 
and she remembers what her fairy godmother told her and knows that the spell is going to be broken 
and she runs out and down the stairs leaving the prince behind 
and as she's running down the stairs one of her glass slippers comes off 
because when the fairy godmother um cast the spell she had these beautiful glass slippers that she was wearing 
one of them gets left behind on the steps 
and she runs home 
and she  um she gets home before  you_know as the spell is being broken

and he wants to find throughout the kingdom where this wom  who this woman is 
so  he sets out  he finds the glass slipper on the steps 
knows it belongs to her 
and he sets out to find out who can wear that glass slipper 
who does that shoe belong to 
so  they go throughout the kingdom trying the glass slipper on all of these women 
and noone can wear the glass slipper 
it fits noone 
so  they finally get to the house where Cinderella is living 
but she's downstairs 
and they're keeping her in the basement because they know that the prince is coming 
and they don't want her out  you_know out and about  where she could talk with him 
um and he tries the glass slipper on her two sisters 
and it does not fit

and he takes that news back to the prince

he realizes she is the  the young lady that he was smitten with 
and they are married 
and they live happily ever after 
and she never hasta be the housekeeper for her stepsisters again 
and so  they live happily ever after 
I would get a loaf of bread 
and  get the peanut butter out_of the cabinet and the jelly out_of the refrigerator 
and I would uh remove two slices of bread from the loaf of bread 
I would open the peanut butter jar and take peanut butter on a knife and spread it across the bread 
then I would spread  open the jelly and spread jelly on top of the peanut butter 
and then take the second slice of bread and put it on top of the first slice that has the peanut butter and jelly on it
