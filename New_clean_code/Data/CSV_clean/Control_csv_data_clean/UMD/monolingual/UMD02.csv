um people in my family have 
um I really haven't um not in the past eight years 
you_know  I've been  um hospitalized once 
oh you_know  and I've had a_lot_of  general baby boomer problems that people in their fifties have but nothing that's serious life threatening or anything like that 
um well  I  sighs  I discovered yoga 
I started taking yoga 
I realized that that  was something to do that's made me a_lot calmer and um stronger 
it's  I  it caused me to sort_of move my life forward in ways that I hadn't done prior to the hospitalization 
which was a stress reaction to my father passing away 
thank_you 
well   I think uh giving the first speech I ever gave was a good thing 
I was very anxious about it because noone had ever asked me to give a speech before 
and I carefully wrote everything down and wrote four pages of notes and um got up 
and f I knew I had exactly fifteen minutes or no more no less 
um I had a group of about twenty five 
I read my notes 
I threw in a couple of spontaneous jokes and um finished in twelve minutes 
so  everyone seemed to like it 
okay 
okay 
I think I can do it 
um first panel has a kid kicking a soccer ball 
the  the ball goes through um the man's window 
it ends up knocking over the man's lamp 
and the man stands up with the soccer ball looking at the hole in the window and thinking about what he's gonna do next 
okay 
oh  I can do this 
uh it's a mother and her son 
the mother is trying to tell the son that um he needs an umbrella 
he's gonna go out because it's gonna rain 
the son is telling his mother that he doesn't need it 
he'll be fine 
he goes out in the rain and gets really wet and comes back home 
and his mother's doesn't like how wet he is 
so  he make sure to goes 
okay 
oh  this is a story about a tree 
um there's a cat that's stuck in the tree um probably because um the dog has chased the cat into the tree 
a little girl's crying because her cat is um stuck in the tree 
and she's come over on her tricycle 
um a man probably the girl's father has climbed the tree with a ladder 
and he seems to be stuck too 
and um the fire department shows up with a bigger ladder 
and presumably they're going to get the cat and the father out_of the tree 
yes 
well  yeah 
okay 
okay  this is 
oh  okay 
oh 
I can't explain all of these 
but I can 
okay

well  Cinderella was the littlest of three daughters 
I think maybe the other two would've been her stepsisters 
and they all wanted to go to the ball 
uh the stepsisters got to go 
but Cinderella hadta stay home and do chores that involved a_lot_of sweeping and dirt 
uh however uh a fairy go godmother shows up and does a_lot_of hand waving with her wand 
and she has a beautiful dress 
and the problem is that she hasta leave at midnight or else her um coach will turn into a pumpkin 
um the prince falls in love with her and um wants to know how to see her 
uh she ends up leaving at the last minute uh but manages to leave a glass slipper behind 
um the prince tries to figure out whose foot gets to go in the glass slipper 
and the two stepsisters can't fit in the glass shoe 
but she can 
and the prince says 
 that's great 
and they live happily ever after 
the end 
well  you take two pieces of bread 
um you put them out 
you take a jar of peanut butter 
and put several scoops of it on one side 
and then you take a jar  on one slice of bread 
and then you take um a jar of jelly and open it up and put jelly on the other slice of bread 
and then you put the two slices together
