okay 
a young boy is kicking a soccer ball 
and he accidentally kicks it through a window 
the man sitting in the room hears and sees the soccer ball come through the window 
and he retrieves the soccer ball and looks out to see who may have kicked it 
oh thank_you 
okay 
should I start 
um a boy's mother offered her son an umbrella 
the boy refused to take the umbrella 
when the boy went outside however it started to rain 
and it rained hard 
and the boy came home sopping wet 
he regretted not taking the umbrella 
the next time he went out  he walked with the umbrella outside 
that's okay 
I guess you don't usually have a class when you're doing this 
you need a soundproof room laughs

and the dog was barking  at the man at the top  at the  on a branch in the tree
