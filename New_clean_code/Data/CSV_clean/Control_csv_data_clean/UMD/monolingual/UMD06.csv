I think I speak English adequately 
uh a few words here and there  and  a few words  maybe phrases actually  of French 
but that's all 
okay 
when I was a little girl I may have been eight or nine 
I don't know 
and I was in a play 
and the play was  Alice_In_Wonderland 
and my father came from work to watch me 
 and somewhere there was a line about uh  giving a dog a biscuit 
and I said this line 
I gave the dog a biscuit  a bone  a biscuit  a bone 
and I saw him laughing at me from the audience 
and I will never forget 
laugh 
yeah 
there's a young boy who is kicking  what's probably a soccer ball 
it could be  something else too 
and he kicks it and  right into a window 
breaks the window 
um goes right through the window practically on top of the lap of this guy who's sitting there 
and he gets up  and has the ball in his hand  and is standing by the window and looking  out 
okay 
the child is going outside 
and the mother is standing  the mother is standing there with an umbrella 
and I don't know whether she's taking it away from him  or giving it to him 
in the second one it looks like he's reaching out for it um  although maybe he just gave it back to her 
and he's outside now without the umbrella 
and it's raining on him 
and he's not very happy about it 
he goes back  to his mother 
she's not happy 
and he's not happy 
and then he takes the umbrella 
puts it over his head 
and uh he looks  a_little happier because he took it and is not getting rained on 
okay 
laughs 
so  here we have  a cat seems to be stuck in a tree 
and  a little girl is right below worrying about him 
wanting to get him down 
she has a bicycle 
and it's probably the daddy  sitting up in the tree 
whether he used the ladder to try to climb up there or climbs up without it  I don't know  but he seems stuck up there 
the dog is on the ground barking at the   barking 
what he's barking at I'm not sure if he's barking at the man 
the firemen are coming with their ladder 
the truck is  sitting on the street in the back 
there's a bird singing away in the tree 
the  daddy looks a_little abashed 
yes 
oh  sure 
okay 
am I using the book with the pictures 
you might want to cover that up 
okay 
now  um  there is a picture of a handsome prince with his wonderful xxx standing by a fountain  I think 
and Cinderella is standing next to him 
and he seemed very nice to her 
and she xxx 
but lo_and_behold  out_of the window the mean stepmother and her two mean sisters were watching 
that's what happened 
and they don't look happy about what's going on down there 
then xxx 
um  the prince is talking to his father 
and  they arrange to have a  ball 
and uh the invitation somehow get around 
and the stepmother and the girls hear about it 
and um let's see 
I guess she asks to go with them 
I'm trying to remember if that was pictured or not 
and of_course they say no 
um  and the fairy godmother comes 
and she trains the mice  into  white horses 
and um  she turns the pumpkin into the wonderful couch 
coachq is the word 
um I guess she doesn't come home 
and uh Cinderella's stepmother locks her uh out  locks her in with the key 
and the mice find the key and bring it all the way downstairs or all the way upstairs and uh  let her in or let her out 
and um the prince comes around 
and the shoe fits her 
and they all lived happily ever after
