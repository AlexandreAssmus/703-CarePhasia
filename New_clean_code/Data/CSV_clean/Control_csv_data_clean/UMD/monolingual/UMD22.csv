very good 
average 
no 
I'm doing very well  thank_you 
no 
no 
not now 
do you mean everq 
well yeah 
they've  they've had serious med uh you_know medical situations from time to time as they've gotten older 
sure  um happy memory uh when I got married and when I had children 
uh sad memory when my father passed away 
we've been married for twenty four years 
uh very happily married 
and we are living in Cityname_Maryland 
three kids 
living the dream 
I would first get the peanut butter out_of the cabinet 
I would get the jelly out_of the refrigerator 
I'd take them back over to the counter 
I'd pull out a plate come over and get a knife then go over and get the bread out_of the bread bin 
take out two slices 
and I would uh put the peanut butter on first one slice and then the jelly on the other 
and then fold them and combine them together 
okay 
uh I see a boy out on the field 
and he is  kicking a soccer ball 
and the boy is kicking the ball into the air 
and it seems like the ball is  in the second picture going through a window  uh the window of a house 
not sure if it's his house or a neighbor's house 
but it's breaking the window and going inside 
to the third picture where there is a gentleman who is sitting in a chair 
don't know if that's a family member  father  or a neighbor 
but it breaks through the window 
and the ball comes right at him 
and the man in the picture seems to be uh a_lot older 
probably very scared and startled 
and he  going into the fourth frame picks the ball up and looks out the broken window to  to see if he could see who  kicked the ball through the window 
I see a   uh a lady and a smaller child 
I do not know if it's a mother  daughter 
the lady is holding an umbrella 
they seem to be talking 
and in the second it seems to be a little girl but not sure 
the second frame  they seem to be continuing the discussion 
and the older lady seems to be holding the umbrella and listening to the child 
and it seems like the child is discussing the fact that he or she does not need the umbrella 
and the child goes out  uh into the um outside in frame three 
and they notice  he or she notices it's starting to rain 
and he or she puts her hand out uh and feels the raindrops 
and this child's going somewhere because there's a backpack on his or her shoulder 
and in frame four the rain is coming down a_lot harder 
the child is uh panicking and turns the other way and puts their hand over their head and is running presumably back to the house 
in frame five uh the uh little uh boy or girl meets the lady again 
I'm presuming it's the mom 
and he's soaking wet 
and the mother  presumably gives uh the child an umbrella 
and the child goes back outside in the rain with the umbrella open and goes off to wherever they're going 
okay here 
um it is a picture of a man in a tree 
along with the man in the tree there's a cat and a bird 
and there's a dog at the base of the tree barking up 
and there's a little girl uh underneath the branch where the cat  is sitting 
and her tricycle is there along with a  ladder 
and to the right of the tree the fire department  two fire men are bringing a ladder  presumably to rescue the cat from the tree which the older gentleman  seems to be trying  to rescue 
uh but from the look on his face has not succeeded 
and the little girl is very upset because  she thinks the cat is endangered 
okay  Cinderella  uh was a young lady who lived with her two  uh stepsisters and stepmother 
and they treated her very badly and uh made her do a_lot_of work 
and one day a gentleman came to their house and announced that there would be a ball that the  uh king was having for the prince to find a wife  a princess  for the uh prince 
and they were all very excited 
and Cinderella thought she was going 
uh but her mother  um stepmother said 
 no  she's not going 
just the two other sisters were going 
and she was very sad 
and  they got ready to go to the ball and left 
and as Cinderella was working her fairy godmother came and changed her into a beautiful princess and changed a pumpkin and two mice into a carriage and horses 
and they went to the ball 
but the fairy godmother said 
 you hafta be home uh by twelve o'clock or everything will disappear at twelve o'clock 
so  she went to the ball and met the prince and had a wonderful time 
and the prince fell in love with her at the ball 
and it was just about twelve o'clock when she realized she hadta go and ran away from the ball but left one of her shoes  uh crystal shoes at the ball 
and she barely made it home 
and poof  uh the carriage and horses turned back into the pumpkin and mice 
the prince wanted to find her 
took the shoe and made a decree that they'd check every uh girl in the village until uh Cinderella was found 
and they came to the house 
and her two stepsisters  they tried the shoe on but it wouldn't fit 
and they finally found Cinderella 
and they put the shoe on Cinderella 
and it fit 
and Cinderella was reunited with the prince 
they got married and lived happily ever after
