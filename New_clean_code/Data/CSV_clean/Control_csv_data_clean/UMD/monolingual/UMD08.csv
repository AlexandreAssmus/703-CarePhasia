well  here's a neighborhood guy playing soccer 
kicking the soccer ball 
and oops  he kicked it too hard 
and it went right through his neighbor's window into the neighbor's lap while he was relaxing 
and so then the neighbor looked out the window with the ball 
and that's the end of these pictures but I imagine that he found the guy and asked him to repay or  correct the mistake 
 oh 
okay 
I guess mom offered  a young child an umbrella to go out 
and the boy of_course said 
 no  I just don't need this umbrella 
and he goes out 
and he starts walking 
and um he may be walking to school because he has a backpack 
and it's starting to rain 
and it's starting to rain really hard 
and he's getting really wet 
and he's really unhappy 
so  then he goes home to mom 
and he walks in really sopping wet 
and mom doesn't look too happy either because he is really sopping wet 
and finally he takes the umbrella and goes to school 
okay 
um the dog chased the cat up the tree as often happens 
um and the girl is very upset 
and she wants to get the cat down 
so  she tries to get her dad to the climb the tree to get the cat 
and he's not too successful
