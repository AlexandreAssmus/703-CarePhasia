 well 
probably not good 
when you say  when you say the ability to tell a story like from  like creative 
pro if the  will the pict pictures be making a picture 
probably 
 no 
no 
um when you say serious illness 
you only thinking about things like strokes 
that kind of  uh not like cancer 
okay 
cancer yeah 
my sister had cancer my mother my father 
oh  yeah  well  she um she was in a pa 
what is it  um what kind of study where you're um clinical 
yeah 
she lives in New_York 
she was advantaged  
and it  it include I think chemotherapy and a whole bunch of  a whole bunch of stuff 
um and she still goes back I think every six months for checkups and INV
 oh yeah 
 she had a hysterectomy 
and that was the end  that was  it got all the cancer 
but she still hasta go back you_know for um 
I have such problems with that 
oh_gosh um 
oh_lord 
something happened 
mm yeah  I went 
I have such problems creating stuff and tell it 
you_know  when somebody says like 
 I went on a cruise 
but I can only probably say  I liked the food  something 
you_know yeah  um like entertainment um 
uh that's about it 
but  but  but really describing everything and that kinda thing  I'm never good at 
okay 
there's this child playing with this kickball or something 
breaks out the window 
person sitting in his house probably doesn't have tv or something 
and the ball comes in 
and then looks like he just looks out the window to see who um there 
hm 
okay 
it looks like maybe she tried to give him an umbrella 
yeah  I think he  because he's out there he decided he didn't want to take it 
he goes out and gets wet 
walks a little bit 
decided to come back 
and I guess she looks like she's  scolding him  I guess 
and he's looking 
 yeah okay 
and then he takes the umbrella and goes xxx 
it look like it didn't start at the beginning 
um  the cat's in the tree 
and it looks like that's what happened  what should have happened first 
um I don't know why she's standing there with her hands up 
alright  anyway  then I guess he goes up to get the  cat down 
and I guess  but it doesn't look like he's getting the cat down 
he's just sitting there 
um oh  wait a minute 
I don't know 
and then the dog 
oh  looks like he's barking at the man 
so  maybe the man's scared to come down 
I don't know 
um and then finally I guess somebody calls the fire 
ye yeah  I guess 
I probably don't remember all of this 
I  I absolutely don't 
I probably remember very basic because I don't even know what they're doing 
um  xxx 
okay 
I'm not very good at any of this 
oh_god 
 wow 
any of  any of I really don't remember all of this of Cinderella 
all I remember of Cinderella is 
should I read  be reading from the bottom 
 hm 
oh_gosh 
 um okay 
let me just say what I know about Cinderella 
um she had these  stepsisters  I think 
um and um I think they made her do all the work 
um and according to that it looks like she had  that animals were her friends 
um  and  I'm not even sure how she got to  to the ball  to go to the ball but she did 
and  um and I think she was supposed to be back b by midnight or then she turned into a pumpkin 
so  that  that's not it 
I don't remember that 
and after that's kinda what I remember 
and I  I think she almost didn't make it back 
but I think she did 
and  um and I don't even remember all the stuff about meeting the prince 
but according to that you_know some kinda way she married  met the prince 
and they got married 
and  and had the animals at the  at the wedding 
I don't know 
ugh 
okay 
um I'd have two pieces of bread 
um I would put the peanut butter on one slice 
and let me see 
I haven't made one lately 
but um I think I would probably put pea um jelly on the other slice 
and then just put it together
