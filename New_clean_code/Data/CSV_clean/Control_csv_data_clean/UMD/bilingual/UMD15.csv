suddenly I met my wife at some gathering like this 
and we decided to get married 
in the few minutes a decision 
laughs and  laughs and the  uh her mother wanted that I  she should shee see me before um she gives okayn 
and finally it ended up in marriage 
that's the real surprising thing is anything can happen 
in  in our customs  that they use prearranged marriages 
you don't meet  a girl and a boy  and then said 
 yes  you are getting married 
that is something surprising and uh a happy memories to me 
I took decision on my own

it's just uh some something uh different from our customs 
sixty seven  we got married 
two thousand uh 
yeah  sixty seven  I got married

so  I hadta come get married after twenty four years 
so  I had wait

 I hadta get clearance from them  that I want to get married to soandso 
then my ministry hasta clear me 
that you are okay 
I accepted 
the girl is accepted 
xxx 
so  then that took time 
then of_course she passed away in two thousand ten 
well that's  so  that's how it took 
 it's fine laughs 
it's the normal way 
uh she was actually outpatient 
so  so  managed to prolong for seventy years  up to seventy years of age 
normally uh uh any  any person can go off by thirty forties 
but we managed to  to   to do it at medical care 
so  that's seventies 
huh 
yeah  those children 
she was an xxx 
and uh then she was practicing but had her own problems 
my mind being a xxx person 
all these xxx are irrelevant 
like a xxx 
in our country xxx 
since I have all the uh facilities available to me then could manage 
besides her suffering which you can't xxx 
and with this there is sad part of the story 
xxx 
okay  go ahead 
 you want to record it xxx 
 are we recording it 
oh 
it's mind where this where I used to play uh ma uh ball 
we call it uh football 
and I imagine myself hitting xxx on the window pane 
it really happened in my 
remember this 
laughs I shoot the ball the  out_of the window 
it fell onto my brother's uh lap 
and he was not a simple fellow to  to spare me 
and after that the  the ball is gone 
and I had my session to a thorough beating from my son  uh my brother 
I still remember what it  the way I got hit laughs 
okay  fine 
you want me to do more laughs 
I think I told longest story I did 
uh this is  um sighs this is uh my sister and me 
when I was in very young age my sister's cycling merrily 
and I useta forget normally 
whenever I'd go I useta always leave my things 
and my sister is uh like a minimother to me 
like she's always next_to me to hand uh my umbrella 
and I still remember uh going on the way to school without uh the umbrella in my hand 
I said 
 look  I don't need it 
so  I know the agony which I had gone through 
when I think back again my sister's uh not a s someone to spare me 
and I remember now 
I don't miss the umbrella xxx 
and I'm a happy memory with my sister looking after me 
oh  I have a 
oh  there is a girl sister I had 
and I can see that 
okay laughs 
um uh I had my daughter 
she useta be very mischievous 
but she is very fond of pets 
and we have a cat 
we have a dog and everything 
and uh someone I don't know what  the dog were  started chasing my cat 
and cat went and sat on the  on the top of the  the tree 
and I'm not going to leave my cat there 
and I press myself  my daughter press me 
 look  go and get my cat 
I managed to go up and couldn't reach the cat 
and I hadta sit down 
and I can't come down on the tree 
so  then finally nine eleven is called 
and they came and then brought us both down along with my cat 
then I realized 
look  here afterwards even whenever my daughter asked for something I hadta be careful not to climb onto the tree someday on the  on the hills 
so  at least nine eleven is there to attend to all problems before they got rid of the tree 
yeah
