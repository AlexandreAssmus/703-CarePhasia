I think I speak well 
yeah 
I  I_mean it has evolved uh it  in the last twenty eight years INV
so  it has been a gra gradual 
I useta speak English then and then even now 
but then I think the accent and the vocabulary has evolved 
and hm it has conformed to the place and culture 
I still may need to work more on it 
I don't know 
it's a  it's an unconscious uh work 
so laughs 
with the people and yes and daytoday language  yeah 
it's Hindi  Hindi 
and uh there's another language  Punjabi INV
so  I could say I can speak and understand that one too 
no 
that's short laughs 
that's hard 
I  I need  I think the saddest thing that happened to m was  that comes immediately is the sudden death of my father in nineteen eighty three 
and uh that was very shocking and xxx 
he died of a massive heart attack  the first heart failure 
yeah  and uh about five years ago my mother had a stroke 
so 
and my dau sister had a stroke the same year 
they are getting better 
but yeah I_mean sister is still recovering 
it was very bad 
but uh my mother is doing okay 
but she has some uh hm issues which are not that severe 
but  but they are both on  pretty much recovered 
 so  I  coming to the life turning events  I_mean those are the closest people 
yeah  and then the happy part is like you_know my kids born  being born 
so  that  that is xxx the times 
and getting married and 
 good things 
good and bad 
 so  that's what I think life is made of laughs 
and I just want you to look at them and tell me a story with a beginning a middle and an end 
oh  I need to make a story by looking at the pictures 
s like a boy's playing ball 
and then in front yard or back backyard of a house 
and then the ball smashes the window 
and it hits uh the l table lamp 
and uh the man sitting next to him picks up the ball 
and it seems he's not happy 
and he turns back and looks out of the  of the window 
and I don't see his expression so I don't know if  if he's happy or sad 
he must be unhappy 
 so  it seems the story of a small boy and his mom 
and um I guess he's leaving for school 
and um hi think his mom is telling him to take an umbrella but there  because there may be a forecast for rain 
he seems to be arguing that he doesn't need it 
and he steps out without the umbrella 
and it starts to rain 
and then keeps walking until I guess  he realizes  turns back  comes home 
and his mom is not  hap doesn't look happy 
and he takes the umbrella 
and he walks back  maybe to school 
 hm seems like um maybe a small girl and her dad 
and they talk 
they came to a park or something for a stroll 
and uh for some reason the father climbed the tree 
and seems he's having problem coming down 
and then the  there's  there's a firetruck that comes to help with a ladder 
although the  the dog and the girl are both trying at their end to do something 
and xxx 
yep 
hm well  I don't know if I can put it coherently 
but  um so  I'm supposed to close the book 
yeah 
so  it's the story of the Cinderella um  who lives with her I think  stepmom and her stepsisters 
and then the  and uh she's not treated well by her stepmom 
and the stepsisters don't treat her well either 
she's supposed to do all her household chores 
and  um and she s seems she lives in kind_of um a den where  with animals 
and then there's an invitation for a party where she's in  like she doesn't get to go 
and her sisters and all go 
and th she's locked into  in the house 
I can't recall how  how she ends up being there because she wears this um magical shoe or something that she wears 
and she turns into a princess 
and then in a  there's a carriage in which she goes to the party where she meets this prince 
and um they like each other  dance 
and she has a great time 
and I don't know who tells her 
and then once the clock strikes twelve or something she's supposed to turn  go back home 
and then in a hurry to rush back home she drops one of her shoe 
um and then when she reaches home she realizes that 
and this prince comes and gives her the shoe 
and they get married 
and then they live happily hereafter laughs 
just take two pieces  slices of bread 
put peanut butter on one 
put jam on the other 
put them together 
just cut it into half 
and that's how
