not a stroke 
and not a serious illness 
my dad had a heart attack 
yeah  so  about fifteen years ago he had a heart attack 
and um um xxx 
um um my dad's recovery 
um he  first of all he got excellent care because my brother who's a doctor was also 
um he took care of him 
and the fact he probably was a xxx 
he had low residual effect 
and he was essentially back to normal life um within a month 
he was back to working twelve hours a day as he  as he does 
and um everything else was normal 
the most important thing that happened is you_know um my selection into a medical school and the top medical school  which I had not expected 
um um it appeared like you_know 
or even for um going for  appearing for the exam um was like a fluke 
I just went to give the exam only because my friend had decided 
my friend pushed me to going and giving an exam  a test  the entrance test 
and then finally when the results came out it was my friend actually who told me that I had got into one of the top medical school 
and unfortunately the friend who had pushed me to do all that she didn't get in that year 
she got in the following year 
but um that was one of the exciting things 
um my parents were very happy 
and it  at the time about um twenty five to twenty seven years ago um females in India going into medical school was a very very rarity 
so  that really made getting into med school um  um 
really was a turnover  a turning point you_know not only in my life but other  other cousins and all who followed suit 
um they looking  they looked at me getting educated 
they also then got the opportunity to get education 
I'm ready 
the kids are playing soccer in the um field 
I'm sitting on my chair relaxing 
and um so um one of the kids hits the ball 
and the ball goes and hits the window 
the window cracks 
the ball comes and hits me 
and you_know I kick the ball 
and I look outside to see that even_though my window is broken  my glass's pane  I want to return the ball 
but the kids who were playing  seeing that the damage has been done  they all run away 
and the field is totally empty 
and I'm left with the ball in my hand 
so  um  the kid is ready to go to his school 
he says byeq to his mom 
the mom says 
 you_know  why don't you take an umbrella 
 the forecast says that it's going to rain today 
the kid as usual argues with the mom and said 
 no  the forecasts are never true 
 why should I take the umbrella 
and so xxx  and so he doesn't listen 
and he goes out 
and he has walked only a few yards when it started pouring 
and he realizes he's getting wet 
so  he goes back  he goes back to the house and  wet 
mom looks at him and said 
 I told you it's going to rain 
 you didn't listen 
and say 
 okay  go and change 
 put on new clothes 
 and here's your umbrella 
 and now you off to school 
so  I take the umbrella and walk to school 
 okay  so  playing in the playground with my cat and on my bike and my um dog 
and suddenly my cat  you_know she runs fast and climbs the tree and is hanging on a branch 
and I actually start crying for help to see if you_know somebody comes and rescues the cat 
um a man stand nearby 
he stops 
and he climbs the tree branches 
and he tries to help 
in the meantime the other people in the  in the playground see this 
and they call nineoneone 
so  nineoneone the rescuers come 
they bring the big ladder 
and one big um  one of the rescuer climbs up and rescue the cat 
the cat is very happy 
I get the cat 
and I'm very very happy 
sure 
so  you boil the water and  wa and add the tea leaves or tea bags  whichever is available  to the  um to a cup of boiling water 
let the  you_know the water seep 
and  you add  after that you add some milk according to the taste and some sugar according to the taste and stir
