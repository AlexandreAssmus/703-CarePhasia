I had a really good  uh uh pretty good experience xxx in England 
I applied for a visa to the US 
and my visa was rejected twice 
and the second time they put on a stamp on my passport that I'm not eligible xxx visa 
but somehow I  I presented my case through my high commissioner in England to the US ambassador 
and they agreed to accept my application 
and like they immediately offered critical continual xxx 
and that was a milestone in my career 
I don't understand what this picture is 
clouds and stars and that sort of thing 
there's a window xxx 
okay 
uh a gentle  a boy is playing uh soccer 
and uh it's maybe eh dark because uh he's seeing the  we can see out_of the window and they're the clouds and the stars outside 
and uh what happened to the window 
the  soccer ball came to the room and uh hit a gentleman 
he took the ball and the  foot the soccer ball in hand and started looking out
