how do  repeat the question 
I would say okay  not great but fine 
I get by 
yes  I speak Hindi  Marathi  a little bit of Gujarati 
no  I haven't 
yes  my dad had a stroke 
well  unfortunately I was here when it happened 
he was in India 
um and he passed away within three days of having a stroke 
so 
so  I wasn't really there to kind_of elaborate on that 
um I'm happy my daughter got a job recently 
and I'm happy that my husband is back from his eight week trip to India where he traveled a_lot 
and he visited people he hadn't seen in twenty plus years 
okay  there was a guy whose kid was playing outside 
and he obviously hit the window with his ball 
and there was another man sitting in the house quietly  probably watching tv 
and he realizes that the window is cracked 
and it shatters his window and the lamp 
and he picks up the ball 
and he's trying to find who was  who did this to his window 
and he can't locate the kid 
okay  there's a child who's getting ready to go to school 
and then his mom tells him 
 you hafta take the umbrella um and go to school 
and he says noq 
he goes outside and gets wet 
he realizes he was being foolish as all kids do 
he goes home 
he asks his mom for an umbrella 
he takes the umbrella 
and he walks out with the umbrella 
there is a cat who's gone  gotten herself on a tree and obviously can't get out 
there's a man who's trying to save her but obviously can't 
there's a dog barking at the man to come down 
and they obviously called a fire truck 
and there are two firemen coming to rescue the cat and the entire family 
take a slice of bread 
or take two slices of bread and toast them 
put peanut butter on one with a knife 
put jam or jelly on the other 
and put one on top of the other 
and cut it into two triangles 
that's how I would make it
