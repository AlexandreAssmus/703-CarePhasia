it was a  very cloudy day 
a man was trying to dress up to go out and play with his ball 
I see young  ma young man going with his ball 
and he's kicking the ball 
and he's very happy 
and then he came back 
and he's sitting down for a  w uh with his ball in his hand  in his  in his side  on his side 
and um th then he  he  he's up  he's standing up 
and I think he's planning to go out and play again 
I think I can see the sun shining 
so  uh more or less I think he's ready to go out and play again 
he had a rest break in_between 
and then he's going out to play 
 this is what I can see about the picture 
um I  I think so 
he broke this  he broke his  the  um he broke the window 
I can see his  he broke the window through the  through kicking the ball 
and it's a crack 
I don't know if that's right laughs 
 I think uh a little boy ready to go to school with his backpack 
and his mother  it's a rainy day 
so  mother is getting him ready to go with his umbrella 
but for some reason the boy didn't take his umbrella 
so  he's really closing his uh head with his ha arms 
and um then at  uh at the end of this picture I can see him 
I don't know from where he got the umbrella 
but he has an umbrella again 
beginning of the story  he doesn't have an umbrella 
his mother is trying to give him but he's not taking it 
he's walking 
and then he's getting wet 
so  I think mother ran out and gave him an umbrella 
so  he's walking to school with his umbrella to protect himself from the rain 
okay 
okay 
 a little girl was playing with his  with her uh dog and a bicycle 
and uh she saw a kitten stuck in the  on the tree  on the top of the tree branch 
so  I think she called for help to get the kitten out  get him down from the tree 
so  there came the m fire  fire engine 
um two men came 
and they were trying to get the cat help to come down 
uh so  they have a ladder 
I see a ladder and a fire truck 
two men uh dressed up in their uh fire uh suits 
um I still s di didn't see the cat coming 
but the dog is barking 
and uh the girl is anxious to get the cat down 
and I see a man going up and sitting on the  a branch close to the cat 
and I guess they got the cat down safely 
okay 
long time ago 
uh not much 
okay 
it's a common story for children 
but I  I don't remember very much 
0 
yes 
I have a vague idea of the story 
okay 
okay 
there was a little girl once_upon_a_time lived with his  lived  lived with her stepmother with two sisters  stepsisters 
the stepmother was very cruel 
and she wasn't very kind to the  the little Cinderella 
and uh she was asked to do all the  the housework  sweeping  and all the rest of the work 
and uh one day they were all  they heard about  um um  they heard about a party or something 
I don't remember exactly what it is 
but they were going to uh a nice gala  I think 
it's a big gala for a  uh for uh a prince 
so  they were going dressed up  really dressed up 
and then Cinderella was not allowed to go with them 
and Cinderella was very sad about it 
but um she just took it easy 
and then she was sitting down 
and mother and the two girls got dressed 
they were going 
then I think they  at the end they told her to come along 
and um as she was going 
no  uh she  l she was left behind 
she wasn't going with them 
she was left behind 
but somebody else was coming around at  uh and gave her a shoe  nice uh pair of shoe 
and then she was going to the gala 
and for their surprise um she was going 
and um some in the way  on the middle of the way I think she lost her  uh one of her shoe  uh going around 
and then the shoe was found by a prince 
and uh the prince  they were looking for  uh for everybody who will fit to the one shoe 
she  Cinderella had one shoe 
and then the next the shoe was with the prince 
and then he came 
when he came 
and they were coming around to the houses to check and see who will fit 
and the mother and the daughters were very surprised to see that fitted uh Cinderella 
so  the  uh I think the shoe became a pumpkin 
I see  I see a pumpkin 
I'm not really sure what  what is 
no  pumpkin was made into a chariot for her to ride to the gala 
and uh she was the one exactly fit the uh shoe 
so  the pumpkin was made magically became a chariot 
and the  she  Cinderella had a nice little gown outf real nice one 
and then the  she was going to the  she was taken to the gala 
and uh the prince was there 
and then the  uh she was happily married to the prince because the shoe fitted her leg  feet 
and um the  the mother  stepmother and two sisters they were anxious whether their shoe will fit 
she  they didn't want her  her  their sister to uh get the shoe fitted 
but it was all happen that she was married to the prince and happily lived after 
I don't remember what
