okay 
there was a kid who was going to go to school 
and uh the mother was telling that he should carry an umbrella 
but the kid decided that he is not going to carry the umbrella 
and he went outside 
and it started raining 
so  he got wet and he ran back all wet 
and when  when he came in  mom saw him all wet and then suggested that he take the umbrella 
so  he picked up the umbrella and went again 
and this time he was not wet 
okay 
there was a kid who was playing with a soccer ball outside some house 
and as he was kicking  he kicked so_that the ball hit a glass window and broke the glass 
inside there was a gentleman who was sitting who just suddenly sees this ball coming in and then notices that the window is broken 
yeah  luckily

so  there was this little girl named Cinderella INV
and uh the stepmother was really harsh on her and making her do all the housework and everything 
and  uh well  the other two were enjoying  the other sisters of hers 
this was in a kingdom where the prince uh wanted to get married 
and uh so he arranged for a major ball 
uh and uh all the uh ladies were invited 
so  the stepmother and the two uh stepsisters started getting ready to go to the ball 
and Cinderella was really upset and disturbed that she couldn't go to the ball 
so  uh she was crying when her fairy godmother comes in and tells her that 
 Cinderella  you can go to the ball also 
and she takes the pumpkin and converts that into a um uh carriage for her and a couple of mice as the horses 
and gives a beautiful gown for her to wear along with some glass slippers 
and tells her that she must return by midnight 
otherwise everything will turn back 
so  Cinderella goes to the ball and dances with the prince and ha is having a really great time 
and prince is falling for her tremendously when she notices that it's about midnight 
so  she just abruptly leaves from there 
and in the process one of her glass slippers is left there 
and she gets back home and uh is being teased by her uh sisters that she hadta stay home and all of that
