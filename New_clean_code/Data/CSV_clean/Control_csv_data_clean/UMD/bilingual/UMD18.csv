 okay 
I should start now 
okay  this is a boy who has kicked a ball 
ball hit the window and hit the person who was sitting in the  on the sofa in the room 
and then he probably got really angry because his window break 
I think that's about it 
okay 
kid is going to school 
and mom is giving an umbrella 
uh there's chance of rain 
but   and then  yeah  so  it's raining 
and he's walking and didn't open the umbrella 
got all wet 
 um  next time mom said 
 make sure use an umbrella 
okay 
um there's a cat who got  climbed up on the tree 
and s the kid um is uh asking  you_know want to get the uh cat down 
and I think the father went up to get 
but I think it's  uh a branch is too skinny for him to go 
so  they call the fire department 
and the firemen came and went and got the cat down
