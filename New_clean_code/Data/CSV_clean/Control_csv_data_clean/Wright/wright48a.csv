today is Johnny's eighth birthday 
and all of his friends from school are coming over to sing happy birthday and have a piece of birthday cake with him 
a as  when mommy and Johnny stepped out_of the kitchen they walk back into the living room to find that there was a big chunk of cake taken  chunk  there was a big bite taken out_of the cake 
and they looked to see that the prints led right to the dog under the couch 
mom ran to get the broom to reprimand the dog as Johnny's guests arrive 
and Johnny cried 
the guests  as the guests walked in they said 
 oh_my 
 what are we gonna do now 
but the mother was too busy reprimanding the dog to hear anything 
so  the parents and the kids left the gifts on the table and went home 
in fourth grade I was outside um during recess in New_York 
and as you may or may not know they have  um we play in the streets in the public schools anyway in the inner city laughs 
we don't have a playground 
so  they put up the barriers 
and all the cars are there and everything and you're playing in the street 
so  um I was standing against one of the cars 
and a friend of mine ran right into me 
and uh my wrist went right around the  um the rear view mirror and broke 
so  um they uh called my mom 
and my mom came 
and I was just crying 
and she rushed me to the doctor 
uh we took  I think we took the bus because she didn't wanna pay for an ambulance 
so  I'm in pain on the bus 
I'm crying 
I'm trying to keep it still 
and um we got to the hospital and they hadta put a cast on me 
and that was my first time having a cast 
and um got back to school and all my friends signed it 
and um so that was cool 
and the part that I didn't like so much was when it itched inside 
and so I remember one time my mom used like uh one of the uh straws from the broom to try and itch 
and it broke in there 
so  then that was even more annoying because I couldn't get to to it 
um and that was about all I remember about that 
and I 
oh  and then I remember using it as a weapon too laughs 
if somebody bothered me I'd hit them with it 
but then I would feel it too laughs 
so 
yeah  that was my first experience with a cast laughs 
 as far as language barriers or 
um I'm sure I have 
I can't think of anything off the top of my head though 
language yes 
sure 
well  most recently you_know when we call to pay a phone bill or something um we get somebody in another country 
and so a_lot_of times like they can't pronounce our names 
so  we'll be like are you  first we hafta figure out if they're calling the right house 
and then you_know after they say it a few times then we do understand 
um and just to switch really quick 
actually when we've called to get help with like computer service or something that's when it becomes a really  it becomes difficult because we're trying to first understand what they're saying and then do what they're saying and trying to figure out if they understand what we're asking what for we need 
so  yeah that's a interesting experience 
plenty 
laughs um  scared 
okay 
let's see 
gosh I can't 
mhm 
okay 
um during my childhood 
yes 
okay 
so  I have one 
um I grew up in New_York the first part of my life 
and so in New_York it was like you_know you don't trust anybody you don't go with any strangers you_know everybody's bad in New_York 
we had the completely different view of California 
California was like this fantasy land you_know awesome place to be you can trust everybody and everybody loves everybody 
so  when we moved here or  when we moved to California from New_York I would sometimes walk home from the babysitter's or what have you 
and one time this um man stopped 
and he was like 
 do you need a ride 
and I was like  it was one of those days where it was  the evening was coming and bats were like flying around 
and I was like 
 oh_my_gosh 
 I'm so scared 
 am I going to make it home 
 these bats are 
so  it was like a godsend when he stopped  you_know 
I was like 
 oh  okay 
 I can get a ride 
 I don't hafta deal with these bats 
and I'm thinking 
 well every  and everybody in  k we're  I'm in California so this person can't possibly do me wrong 
so  I get in the car 
and I'm driving 
and it's like 
 how are you and you_know what's your name and where do you live 
and um then it  s then it just started getting weird when I said 
 make a right 
and he said 
 well  I'm gonna make a left 
and I'm like 
 no  go right 
and then that's when I was like 
 okay  something's wrong here 
and um so I just prayed at that point like that he would go right go towards my house 
and um he was like 
 are you sure you don't want something to drink you_know 
I'm like 
 no  just  please just go right 
and so he turned right 
and then I said 
 here's my street 
 please turn 
and um I  um anything  I didn't know what was gonna happen at that point 
he pulled up in front of my house 
and he was still kind_of rolling 
and I just kind_of opened the door and just kind_of jumped out_of the car while it was moving and just prayed that somebody was even home for me to get in the house 
and nobody was home 
so  then I'm knocking on the door 
and the sun's going down 
and I'm like 
 oh_gosh  what if he's like just still like right there waiting for me 
and so when I thought he was gone I ran over to my neighbor's house which is my  you_know my best friend's house at the time and stayed there until I knew my mom was home 
flooding began in Arizona this past weekend 
and um it flooded one of the  um no  one of the streets 
and um one of the washes um over flooded 
and um a little girl was uh playing in the park where one of the washes are 
and she um got pulled into the current 
um she started yelling for help 
and they called the local I don't know  fire department 
and they came a with all their gear and uh tried to figure out how they could get to her 
and um one of the firemen was able to jump into the water and grab onto a branch and pull the girl to safety 
the little boy went outside to kick his soccer ball around 
and innocently he kicked it right into his neighbor's house 
it shattered the window and fell right into the neighbor's lap or actually in  hit the lamp right next to where the neighbor  his neighbor was sitting 
the lamp fell and broke 
and the gentlemen said 
 oh_my_gosh 
 what's going on 
he looked and saw that the ball had  came through the window 
he picked it up walked over and looked out the window where the ball had come through and didn't see anybody out there 
the little boy ran away because he was scared 
the little boy is ready to go to school 
but before he gets out the door mom says 
 it's cloudy outside 
 it just might rain today 
the little boy says 
mom says 
so  he starts walking to school and sure enough the rain drops start coming down 
then it starts pouring 
and the little boy says 
I'm gonna go back and get that umbrella 
as he walks in the door mom s is looking at him drenched in rain and says 
 what does mama say 
and the little boy says 
 mama says I should listen when she tells me to do something 
and mom gives him back his  umb gives the little boy his umbrella 
and he starts walking to school with the umbrella over his head
