well  th the sickest I've ever been I think  was um  gosh  about five years ago 
and I was sick for like two weeks 
I couldn't eat 
um  it's just really gross 
I couldn't shower 
I was really tired 
um everything was green that came out_of my nose 
I n it was just really bad 
and I don't know if I had the flu or not 
I just know that I just couldn't handle s even standing up 
but I finally did get over it 
 no 
yes 
 oh um  um well sometimes um someone will ask you for directions 
and um you'll try to s say it the best you can but 
I don't know how to explain it 
or you try to speak as clearly as you can but they still don't understand even that much English 
um try to simplify it and they still don't understand 
or they don't understand your accent 
or if they repeat it back to you you don't quite get it  what they're trying to say 
um when I was younger my brother and I um liked to go to my neighbor's house 
and he had a pack of Dobermans 
and laughs we would tease the dogs because they were fenced in 
um laughs and we would go on our way 
it was  it was nothing 
it was nothing 
we didn't abuse the dogs 
we would just mess with them 
um and then we would go on our way home 
and inevitably the dogs would always get out 
and we'd literally hafta run for our life with a pack of Dobermans on our heels 
and I was afraid of dogs pretty much my whole life um until about two thousand because I had images of dogs chasing me for dear life 
but they never did catch  u catch us 
um and they never hurt us 
but still I was afraid of dogs
