okay 
it looked like this little girl was out riding a bicycle 
and she happened to look up and see a cat in the tree 
now the cat might have been up at the tree because he saw points
but that's what hafta be happening 
and I guess the father came by with a short ladder and tried to help 
and he got up in the tree 
the ladder fell over 
and he was stuck there 
and the little dog who happened to g be out walking with the father at the time  is at the tree barking to help his father 
and the fi two firemen came to the scene 
and they have a better ladder 
and they're going to go up and rescue the cat 
and the little girl can then go on and continue her bicycle ride 
and get the father down off the tree 
and he can continue his walk with the dog 
well  the closest thing I ever had that  the oddest that's ever happened to me 
oh I've been hospitalized 
I got two new knees 
and many other things but  
we were  I was working at Stony_Brook_University 
I was building what then was a six hundred 
oh I was electrical foreman 
a six hundred room dormitory for their students which eventually became the administration building for Stony_Brook_University 
and during lunch hour we were doing a make up game 
lil little football game you_know when you go out and eat your sandwich then you throw ges
belches and I went out and caught a pass 
but in the interim somebody did a_little more than touching me 
and I fell down and I hit my head 
and I didn't realize it 
I was knocked out 
and then finally I woke 
and I  uh laying on the ground 
I couldn't figure out why 
and they says 
 well  everybody let's get back to work 
 you okay Paul 
 oh  yeah  I'm okay 
I didn't remember anything 
the men I had laughs working for me 
 what's your name 
about fifteen to twenty minutes or a half hour I was in funny land 
and that was the most laughs exp an and everything else 
and th they were asking 
I says 
 hey laughs I don't know where I'm at 
and that was it 
I don't know uh 
no  I don't uh know if I had or hadn't 
well  I was just i 
 okay  well  I was in Rome 
and uh I didn't speak the language INV
I just said th this and that 
and when you do that they sorta get upset you_know 
and I just says 
 hey shrugs that's the way it is 
well  I call up and had asked them to pick up my laundry 
and they didn't pick up my laundry 
and we were leaving the next day 
and I went down 
and I said to the guy little communication skill is what I give him 
and the guys w going out there 
and I said 
 what happened to my laundry 
and he says 
 uh well no we couldn't get that 
then he says 
 sorry 
and then he says

and I says 
 no we're leaving 
and I walked out 
and the guy says 
 buonas
and I purposely didn't ans answer him 
because I wanted to show my ire 
and I walked ges
we went and had dinner in that little restaurant I found and came back 
and then my son was with me 
and we came into the hotel 
and he knows that I  uh I said to the guy 
and my son says 
 oh  well  let's go up the room 
and I says 
 no I wanna see the clerk 
my son says to me

I says

so  I went over and I saw the clerk 
and I saw that them  a ga there was two of them there 
I told them I says 
 hey 
because I didn't want them to have any the bad respect 
and I says 
 I apologize

I says

I says 
 I don't know your language 
I says 
 I got a little upset 
 I was rude when I walked out the door and you said buonas
 and I didn't answer you or say thank_you or nothing like that 
and I says 
 I was upset at something that wasn't your fault 
 so  I hope you accept my apologies 
and that's the way it goes 
and we went points
about fifteen minutes later my son calls me on the telephone 
and I says 
 what 
he says 
 come on over 
he says 
 I've got something for you 
and I says 
 what is it 
they sent up a bottle of champagne laughs and a whole bunch of horss
and that was my problem with communication 
and we gave the  when we went to Capri we gave the  we  we took the champagne with us 
and we left it for the maid in Capri 
it looks like the river as was frequent at this time of the year has risen above its banks 
and in one section this little girl  got trapped 
she was probably with her mommy or her daddy in the car or with a friend playing on the banks and fell in 
and the river is with a xxx coming down 
and she managed to hang onto a branch   a little thicket 
and while she hung onto that branch people had noticed her 
and they called the fireman 
now the fireman with great great courage went out into the water to save the young girl 
came out to the branch 
picked her up 
tied them to  tied a rescue line 
put a safety jacket on her 
as you can see points
the harness that will go on her with her safety jacket 
tied a rope to it 
and then they pulled both the fireman and the young girl to safety 
young boy was out practicing his soccer balls and kicks and everything else and 
like anything else that happens with a young boy and a pane of glass and a sports object you know the pane of glass is gonna get broken 
and bam there it goes 
it not only breaks the ball when he kicks it  not only breaks the window 
it also knocks over the lamp 
and disturbs the father 
or worse yet it could be the neighbor next door who wasn't a very nice person 
but they pick up the ball 
and he says 
 I'm going out and straighten this mess out 
young boy is on his way off to school 
and he's  now he's in second grade 
he's a big guy 
he don't hafta worry 
momma says 
 here take the umbrelly 
 it looks like its gonna rain 
he says 
 mom 
he says 
 come_on  don't give me that 
 I don't need the umbrella 
 why I'll be down to school in  ten minutes 
and then when  as he gets out the front door and into the street it's coming down 
and he says 
 should I or shouldn't I 
and he says 
 no 
 I'll try a little further on 
 I  I  I don't wanna say I was wrong 
but then it got so bad he hadta run home 
and when he goes ho home he's soaking wet 
and mom says 
 see I told you to take that umbrella 
and he doesn't have anything to say 
he's just feeling like 
 oh  I just  it just happened 
but he took the umbrella from mom this time 
put it on 
and cheerfully went back to school in dry clothes 
well  the story starts with Cinderella being into  eh with her father there 
and I guess the mean old aunt came in 
 with the two horrible two beyond despicable daughters 
they were terrible 
they just looking at her as a downgrade 
and eventually while the father's away the aunt's running the house 
and Cinderella then becomes a servant 
she hasta cater to them feed them clean the house wash their things 
and she's treated just as a lowlife servant 
she can't do nothing about it because Daddy's gone 
and there's nothing we can do about that 
and then all_of_a_sudden the aunt gets an invitation to the great ball 
or the king was saying to the  before that time the king was saying to the son 
 you hafta have this ball 
 and you should find your princess that we're looking forward to all your life 
 you get to be an old man 
and he sent out invitations to all eligible ladies to attend the ball 
so  they sent out the invitations 
and the aunt read the invitation 
and here's Cinderella thinking that she's gonna become  going to the ball 
and she found this old dress and laid it out 
and reading about the ball and everything else like that 
and all of the friends that she got to know being in the house the mices and the meeses 
they all got together 
and they fixed the dress up adorable 
and they ges
and the princess tried it on 
and she looked beautiful 
but then the aunt and the two siste eh cousins come in 
and they were terrible 
the stepdaughters they were going 
 blah blah blah blah blah 
and they took the jewelery 
and they took the dress 
and they says 
 you're not going to the ball 
 points
and they got dressed up 
she helped them get dressed 
and they went to the ball 
and then Cinderella is sitting there crying and upset 
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother appears 
and says 
 Cinderella you're gonna go to the ball 
and she touches her magic wand 
and then Cinderella's beautiful in her white dress  flowing wonderful 
and they even down to glass slippers 
what an elegant touch 
and as they're walking out the door 
and she says 
 but how can I get there 
and she touches ges
and then all_of_a_sudden ges
she says 
 this will be your transportation 
she says 
 but there's ges
and she says 
 you must be home by midnight 
 as  if you're not home by midnight  all this will vanish 
she says 
 oh  I will 
and when she went to the ball and the prince saw her he was so taken with her that he spent the whole night dancing with her and having such a wonderful time 
and unbeknownst to her but those two c sisters or  cousins or  whatever they were  stepsisters 
they were so upset and depressed 
and they're squawking and everything else like that 
and being that she's having a wonderful time 
she forgot to notice the thing 
and then all_of_a_sudden the clock strikes twelve 
the first tick goes off 
and she says 
 oh  I must go 
and the prince says 
 no stay stay 
 we  uh the evening's young yet 
 we're still going a_lot before us 
and she says 
 no I must go 
and she runs down this great staircase of g red velvet carpet 
it was wonderful 
but she lost one of her slippers  one  of the glass slippers 
and she ran home 
and when she got home the only thing she had left was one slipper 
but it will always be the memory that she was there 
and she did this thing 
and it was so great 
but then the king yeah  the young prince realized that this slipper belonged to the woman he wanted to marry and to be his princess forever 
so  he says 
 we will go l scour the valley 
and get everyone who was invited to the ball 
 and whosever foot fits this slipper becomes the queen 
and he comes on 
and he tries it onto the other big footed co stepsister 
and sh she was nowheres near it 
she's so upset 
and the mother says 
 well  here try it on uh Milder over here 
she's  she  uh sh her foot was oo corns and aches all over the place 
terrible feet  that wouldn't 
and then the prince says 
 and  and who's this young lady here 
and she says 
 oh  don't worry about her 
 she's just our scullery maid 
 she don't know 
and he says 
 oh  I hafta try it on all  women in the things 
and there's the slipper on her 
great 
uh p silk uh red pillow ges
and he takes the slipper off and then puts on 
and magically it fits her feet 
and the prince realizes that she is Cinderella 
and then Cinderella stands up 
and he sees her for what she is 
really a wonderful person and not those scullery maid things 
he sees back in that wonderful gown and remembers the dancing 
and he proposes marriage 
and they lived happily ever after
