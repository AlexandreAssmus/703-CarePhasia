 well  I been pretty lucky  all my life 
I  about the worst thing I can think of is I had a knee replacement 
and I was in the hospital for six days 
and had a_lot_of therapy 
lots of therapy 
my husband gave me therapy 
and  uh and  shrugs head
and my knee is fine 
but that's  and  but it  it was painful head
but uh e he gave me a_lot_of therapy 
and  and I got it in the hospital 
therapy in there 
and head
just  just head
and  uh um and that's just about the only thing 
I shrugs had my tonsils out laughs 
it's been a long time ago 
many  many years ago 
but I been real fortunate 
 when I was frightened or scared 
oh from the beginning 
well  when I was little my dad was a barber 
and uh uh he  he  p his points barber shop was right next to a grocery store 
and a  and a  so h my  mys m a friend of myself and me we went to the  went in there 
and I decided I was gonna uh s charge some candy to my daddy 
he had account there 
so  I went in 
and I bought some candy 
and uh  my mother found it out 
and after my mother found it out 
then she told my dad 
he was very good 
head
my mother did 
and she gave me a really  a good one  head
and that scared me 
and that's one of the things 
I can still remember that 
she had a little switch 
and she just switched my legs real good 
laughs wasn't  wasn't head
but  but head
and  uh and uh I cried and cried and cried 
but that's one thing I can remember long time ago 
and uh let's see anything else that scared me 
now when Kenneth had a heart attack it scared me 
and uh he said 
 you should call nineoneone 
and I did that 
and uh tha it's in  early in the morning 
and uh I don't know 
that was uh  about ten years or twelve years ago 
and I was head
head
and then not long ago he uh broke th two ribs 
and uh w one day  and about two days later 
he fell ges 
broke them 
and about two days later he came in one morning 
and he s 
that's the  recently 
 came in one morning and said 
 you better call uh nineoneone 
 I think I'm having a heart attack 
so  I call nineoneone all scared again 
I was kind_of calm al 
but I was pretty scared 
and uh we uh went to the hospital 
and uh doctor  they took tests and they  just for that day 
and then that evening  that afternoon  evening his own doctor came in 
he looked at him real good  and 
real real good 
he said 
 Ken you head
 you've got two broken ribs 
well  we were very relieved 
but it was scared me points in the beginning laughs 
head
I don't know  I don't know of anybody that 
I  I head
head
I can't remember anybody 
I can't 
head
head
 well it looks 
 that's water isn't it 
that's water 
 looks like a little girl f fell into the creek or  in the river  river  where there was branches or  logs or  or  branches from trees there and sw twigs 
she fell in there 
and I guess she was hollering and scared et hollering 
and perhaps the people 
 wait I can't see that 
 maybe it was in a  a boat or on the bank or something with them lifejackets on 
and they jumped into the water 
and I don't know what that is there 
jumped into the water 
and saved the little girl 
she hadta hold onto the branch  to save the little girl 
but there's really dangerous 
but evidently she was saved xxx laughs 
well   well  the little boy was out 
you ready 
 the little boy was out playing with the basketball I guess  soccer ball 
kicking it  and playing 
and it   it went right  he kicked it right through a window and broke the window 
and inside of the house was  probably his father sitting there 
 it knocked over  broke the window 
it knocked over a lamp 
and his dad looked very surprised 
the last picture he looked at the window 
the father was just loo 
he has the ball 
and just looking at the window 
and  that's it 
 that's what I can see laughs 
 the little boy was going to school  I guess 
he was going to school 
and uh it was ready  ready to rain 
his mother wanted to give him the umbrella 
and head
so  eh she was giving the umbrella 
and he wouldn't take it 
he said 
 bye bye 
he's going on to school 
so  when he got out there it started raining real hard 
he ran back to the house  in the rain 
and his mother  told his mother 
she gave him an umbrella 
and he went on to school laughs 
once a 
there was once upon a time a  a motha ugly mother and her two ugly  gir and her two ugly girls  daughters 
and they were very selfish children 
and evidently the 
I don't know who it was 
 but it brought  it brought the other  Cinderella to her home to take care of 
she hadta take care of the  ch the Cinderella 
well  Cinderella was a very beautiful little girl 
and uh th they  the stepmother and daughters treated her terribly 
so  she just went  uh uh try to do the best she could 
she hadta do all the work for them 
and one day uh she looked in a trunk 
and there was a beautiful dress in there 
so  she hung this hand
and uh I  and then the fairy godmother came and  to her and was talking to her 
so  then the  w evidently the fairy godmother must have talked to her 
then  the  the  moth the h ugly mother received a invitation to the  uh a ball for them all 
and Cinderella wanted to go 
and the fairy godmother was there  for her 
and uh uh  she ges put on  I think she put on this pretty pink dress 
and then there was  uh m then when she  then the m fairy godmother evidently ordered a pumpkin with four horses and a fellow to  to uh  take her in there 
and she was dressed up 
then they had put beautiful clothes on her 
beautiful clothes 
and uh she danced all evening 
then when the clock struck twelve she hadta leave 
she had this glass slipper on 
beautiful clothes 
she had this glass slipper on 
and th she was leaving she dropped it 
and they looked all over for the slipper and uh where the little girl was 
because uh the prince was very enchanted with her 
 well  I guess the jester or the footman or somebody had tried the  sli the slippers on all the other daughters and the mother 
wouldn't fit 
but it fit the little girl Cinderella 
then  cinder then uh I guess the bo footman went back to the prince and told him 
and the prince went to her and fitted her foot with the shoe 
and they lived happily ever after xxx laughs
