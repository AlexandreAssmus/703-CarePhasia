gee 
I haven't broken a bone since I was five 
and  I haven't been hospitalized since I was twenty nine 
I haven't been really sick 
so  it's gonna be hard to come up with something  laughing 
let's see 
 oh  okay  I will laughs 
I was  uh  I was five and my folks were  we were 
I was an only child 
so  the three of us had gone to  um to see the Von Hindenburg 
which had  which was a big dirigible that was transporting people across the ocean 
and it was the last one before  as it turned out before it exploded and  um in  in its return trip 
and so my dad was real anxious to see this thing that  that he had been talking about 
so  we went to see it 
and on the way back they decided they'd stop at a little uh kind of amusement park but it had uh monkeys and other small animals down in the front area 
and so uh my mother hadta go into the restroom 
she said 
 now you watch her 
 don't let her get into trouble 
and so I was watching the monkeys 
and he was standing there talking to me 
I poked my finger in the cage 
and the monkey ges
uh so_that although it didn't actually break the bone it twisted my finger so_that it's always been crooked 
and of_course when my mother came out she said 
 it does look like for five minutes you could watch her 
laughs and I remember that very vividly  laughing 
because  laughing because it was my fault but my dad got into trouble laughs 
laughs it was laughs 
sighs not really 
yeah  that gets to be difficult 
oh okay  laughing 
well  um I spent last summer taking an ASU class in Florence Italy for a six week summer session 
and of_course I do  do not speak Italian 
so  it became imperative that I be able to at_least read enough so that I knew what was going on 
but lots of times I misunderstood 
and so I would hafta um point to what somebody else was eating if that's what I wanted to order 
or uh we'd go in a  caf a cafeteria and so I could point to the food that I wanted 
and um I needed directions I hadta show them the map of where I wanted to go 
and  laughing  and point to you_know what I wanted to do 
and then they usually could point me in the right direction 
so  I used objects 
I used um food that other people were eating 
and I used a map 
uh and I tried one of the few of my other words but they weren't very good so 
laughs they would always smile at me 
they usually figure out what it was I wanted  laughing 
I don't get so 
 I  I can't remember any time when I was really scared 
um I me I  uh I've never been in fear for my life 
but um I did have an automobile accident 
um I was driving south on Central 
went to turn on Bethany home 
and I looked at the oncoming traffic and there wasn't anybody 
but there was a car about a block down the street 
and I started to turn 
and before I got through the intersection the car hit me uh broadside 
and knocked me into the telephone pole 
and my  I had on an Indian necklace that had a wire that was strung on jeweler's wire 
and they hit me so hard that it broke that necklace off my neck 
and the pieces went all over the xxx 
and I wasn't frightened from that 
but I was really nervous because we didn't have very much money and the car was relatively new 
and I didn't wanna hafta go home and tell my husband that that I'd wreck the car laughs 
and so when I got home 
my mother uh came and pick me up because he was out_of town 
but she called him 
and told him that I was  that I'd had an accident 
so  he came home 
when he got home I was standing out in the driveway waiting for him 
and he said 
 oh  what did you do 
laughs and I told him 
and he said 
 oh  as long as you're okay 
 I don't  the car can always be fixed 
and so that was as close as I came to really being scared laughs 
 oh I  it was 
it really was 
oh  I guess I hafta take that back 
the only time I really was scared when I went in to take my dissertation defense laughs 
 okay 
the young woman fell into the icy water 
and she was calling for help 
and they called the uh fire department to come and rescue her 
the police the fire  de the fireman put on a inflatable vest 
and he had a tree limb that he was holding onto 
trying to help her uh out_of the swirling water 
which he was successfully able to do because of the team that helped him as he uh wrapped the belt around his arm and around her to help pull her out_of the water 
so  she was not hurt 
laughs 
okay 
young boy was playing soccer 
and he hit  kicked the ball 
and it went through the window 
the man inside was very upset because it not only did it break the window but it knocked over the lamp 
and glass shattered all over the living room where he was sitting 
then he picked up the ball and looked out the window to discover that it was his son 
and so he called him inside and said 
 how are we gonna take care of this 
and the boy agreed that he would pay for the window out_of his allowance 
 laughs 
laughs 
um the mother wanted the little boy to take an umbrella to school because it looked like rain 
and he said 
 oh  no 
he didn't need it 
but he got halfway there 
and realized that it was already raining 
so  he ran back in the mu mud puddles 
and he was all wet 
his mother made him go change clothes 
and gave him the umbrella 
and he started off with the umbrella again in dry clothes 
Cinderella had a very happy home 
but her mother died 
and uh after a bit her father remarried 
and stepmother had two very unattractive and unpleasant daughters 
and they made Cinderella's life miserable 
um as they grew Cinderella became the  the housemaid and took care of everything for the  um for the girls 
did what they wanted her to 
fetched whatever they wanted from her 
and in the meantime the young prince had grown 
and the father was disturbed because he hadn't found uh the princess that he wanted to marry 
so  he decided to have a ball for him for his birthday 
and he sent out invitations all over the land for eligible young women to come to the ball 
so  the stepsisters were just thrilled because they got an invitation 
so  they got their new dresses 
and had Cinderella polish and shine everything so_that they would look just elegant 
and so because the invitation went to everyone Cinderella decided she would prepare a  uh a dress to go too 
all the animals had helped her prepare it in the movie 
and she sewed this lovely little 
it was simple dress but very very pretty xxx 
and when she  um what this  the time came for them all to dress and go to the ball why she helped the stepsisters get dressed 
and then she went up and put on her pretty little pink dress 
and when she came down the stepsister says 
 oh 
they couldn't  she could not go with them 
that was absolutely impossible because she was nothing but a chambermaid 
and so they actually tore her dress so she couldn't wear it 
they got in their coach and left 
and Cinderella cried because she really wanted to go to the ball 
and the sisters were so mean to her 
and all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appeared 
and she said 
 I will take care of this 
 I will fit you a dress that is the prettiest one in the land 
which she did 
and it was just gorgeous 
and Cinderella hair was fixed and she just looked beautiful 
but she said 
 how am I going to get there 
and the fairy said 
 bring me the pumpkin and mice 
and she made a coach out_of the pumpkin and horses  and mice became horses 
so  they carried her to the  to the ball 
when she entered the prince was just dazzled by her 
and he asked her to dance 
and they danced again 
and they danced again 
and finally it struck midnight 
and she knew that she hadta be back home because she promised the fairy godmother that she would leave as soon as  uh before midnight 
so  she dashed out_of the uh ball 
and in her hurry she lost one of her slippers  um glass slippers 
and got into the coach and uh took off 
but unfortunately before she got home it did strike twelve 
and she had nothing but a pumpkin and mice 
and she had lost her pretty dress 
but she still had one single glass slipper 
and so she put that in her pocket to remember the good times she had because she didn't think she'd ever see the prince again or have this good an evening as she had 
and the  the sisters came home 
and they were talking about this strange young woman who was there 
that she took up all the time and the prince was so taken with her 
and they wondered who she was and how_come he was so taken with her and would dance with him more than once 
and then the prince was dis  so distraught that he sent out a search party trying to find the young woman that belonged to the glass slipper which he found when he ran out chasing Cinderella 
and the  um the envoy finally came to their house and said he would like to try on the slipper uh on all  all of the eligible young women 
and so the stepmother said 
 we have only two 
and um so he  they tried to push their big feet into the sli sli glass slipper and it wouldn't work 
they were too big 
and he said 
 but isn't there another young woman here 
and Cinderella came out 
and she said 
 yes I'm here 
even_though the stepmother said 
 no no no we don't have anybody else 
and the envoy said 
 oh  well  then you must try it on 
and so she pulled out the slipper that was in her pocket that she'd been carrying 
and said 
 I think this matches 
and he slipped the other shoe on her foot 
and they both fit beautifully 
and he then took her back to the palace 
and they had a beautiful wedding 
and Cinderella married the prince and lived happily ever after laughs
