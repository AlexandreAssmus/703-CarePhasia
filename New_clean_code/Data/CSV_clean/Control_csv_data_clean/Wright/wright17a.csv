uh to make a uh peanut and jelly sandwich you needta get out the peanut butter um the jar of jelly a plate a knife bread 
and so then you would take with your knife 
uh I would put the peanut butter on the bread 
and then I would take and  the knife and put the jelly on top of the peanut butter 
to put the two slices of bread together 
cut it in half on my plate 
and go for it 
well  I'm very lucky because I'm basically very healthy 
I was ill as a young girl 
and um so this is why my family moved to Arizona was for my health 
they said that possibly I could grow out of it so I think I did 
so  going along pretty healthy 
you_know  I had uh one child and had a very easy pregnancy and very easy delivery 
no drugs no anything 
so  I did have a tough time a few years ago because I was having terrible terrible pains 
and they would be like between my waist and my boobs 
and they would last like four hours 
and they were bad 
I would be down on my knees on the floor trying to find a comfortable position you_know where I could just get some relief 
you_know  and you kind_of felt sick to your stomach but it was  pains were terrible 
so  this happened a few times and you_know you decided you gotta go to the doctor and find out what's wrong 
so  you tell them all of this and they think 
 hm
in the back of their minds you just know they maybe have an idea but they're not telling you a thing 
so  they send me a for a sonogram 
well  I've never had one of those 
and so I told them at the place I said 
 if you find a baby in there and I'm like sixty years old 
I said 
 we both can make a_lot_of money 
so  it kind_of made everything fun for all of us and easy for the technician and easy for me 
well  the report comes back later 
and so I have a gall bladder problem 
so  you_know it's like what do I do about it 
and um you_know nothing happens few little simple attacks 
but my husband and I are in Tennesee 
and the day before we are leaving from Tennessee I have one of these attacks 
scared my husband to death because he could think what if it had happened the next day and we were on an airplane 
so  when we get back I go back to the doctor again 
I schedule surgery and all that to take care of my gall bladder 
and that's the way life goes 
yes um the other people uh would be my mother because I do feel like she's maybe possibly has dementia losing her memory 
and I want her to be my mother and like she always useta be 
so  it's been very hard like in about the last five months to remember that I hafta communicate with her a little bit differently 
I try not to tell her 
 can't you remember 
um because I'm now learning that she can't 
um so  it's difficult because it's a learning process 
it's changes weekly maybe even daily 
um that's the main communication problem right now 
um I  I've been  I was frightened or scared uh many times w when I was young and growing up 
um we lived in a small town like six hundred people 
but I did live in the town 
uh my  fa I guess I was uh scared maybe because my father uh would go away to work into the big city 
and he would leave like on a Sundy night and not come home until Friday night 
um my father being that he didn't live with us all the time I think we had two routines in the family 
one the Monday through Friday with mom who was sweet and pleasant and  and nice and participated in some of the school activities and everything in a small town 
then we had uh a different kind of family on the weekends when he was home because he was um loud and um I'm gonna say verbally abusive even_though I didn't realize that at that time 
and um so he would scream and yell and uh maybe not som always treat our mother like we thought 
and so it would be scary because of the loudness and  and the difference 
uh well  here in Arizona we sometimes have flash floods 
um we had one and a young lady and her vehicle decided that she could drive off across this wash no problem 
guess what 
there was a problem 
uh the s car stalls 
the water comes up to the sides 
she's able to get out_of the car and get on the roof 
but then she's stranded 
the water is just roaring like crazy 
um but people on the shore on the banks see her 
uh they call rescue people in 
um they have all the equipment 
they work their way to get out to her 
uh they're gonna rescue her with their  their ropes and their belts and their ties 
uh they're making sure that they can safely get her attached to them so they can get her to shore 
what a learning lesson for the young lady 
we have a neighborhood boy Billy who loves to play soccer 
um there is no playground nearby so he plays soccer in his front yard 
uh he's having a good time one nice day 
and oh_my_gosh he kicked the soccer ball further than he  than he ever expected 
and it went right into the neighbor's window 
oh_gosh 
the neighbor is there 
he's sitting in this chair 
he was relaxing 
and all_of_a_sudden a soccer ball comes through his window 
well  he goes over got the soccer ball checking outside and he's deciding what should he do 
should he take it back to Billy and tell him not to do that again 
should he just wait and les let Billy come to the front door 
well  who knows what the man will decide 
um the little boy is getting ready to go to school 
he's got his backpack on and he's ready to head out the door 
mom says 
 no you're not ready 
 you need an umbrella 
 it's going to rain 
the little boy said 
 no it's not 
 it's going to be a fun sunny day 
mom said 
 no  you needta take the umbrella 
well  little boy doesn't 
he's walking to school and sure enough it starts to rain 
oh 
it  rain gets harder 
it gets on the top of his head 
his head is all wet 
he's making puddles on the sidewalk 
 I've gotta go home 
he doesn't like it 
but he tells mom 
 I'm all wet 
 it's raining 
 I'm sorry 
mom says 
 here's the umbrella 
 go back to school 
 have a nice day
