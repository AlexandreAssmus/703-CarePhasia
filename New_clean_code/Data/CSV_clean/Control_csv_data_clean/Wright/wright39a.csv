when suddenly someone notice  notices tracks on the ground 
 what is that 
 where does it lead to 
 oh_no  it's the cake 
 what's happened to the cake

they look like paw prints 
so  Sam and his mother track down the dog 
and he is underneath the couch 
 Mommy  you get the broom 
 my guests are coming 
 what are we gonna do 
 my cake is ruined 
in the meantime the guests arrive 
and everyone notices the commotion 
little Sam's crying 
his mother's trying to get the dog out from under the couch 
a
after they take care of their dog the party continues 
and everything turns out al okay 
okay 
it was a spring day in Bluefield_West_Virginia 
and my best friend Grace and I were at the Seven_Eleven which was new to town 
enjoying a Slurpee because every Friday we got to go to Seven_Eleven to get a Slurpee 
my mom decides to cross the road 
and fill up her gas tank 
uh Grace and I decide we got our Slurpees so quickly we'd go across and meet her at the gas station 
uh g we cross one lane no problem 
get across to the other side 
Grace decides to cross back because she doesn't like the traffic going across the next road 
um I stay 
and there's a_lot_of traffic 
and I decide to cross 
sure enough I cross 
there's a blind side 
uh I'm hit by a car 
flipped 
and we find out later my leg is broken 
it happened so fast I didn't remember any of it 
my mom uh unfortunately got to witness the entire thing 
and uh called an ambulance 
they took me to the hospital 
set my leg 
I had a cast up to my hip 
I went home 
and was homeschooled for about three weeks 
but all in all it was very comfortable 
friends came to see me 
and it turned out it was a student teacher at our school laughs that hit me 
that was kind_of um an odd coincidence in our town 
but I healed very well 
and that's my story laughs 
can you imagine how the poor 
I take a class 
and at the class I noticed a
and then I heard him speak to the teacher 
and ges
it was s slightly impaired 
but you could understand him 
but it was uh uh very kind of nasal in the back of his throat 
um this is a tap class 
so  we dance 
and I was amazed to find out later that he actually was deaf 
um and he wears um heavy duty ges
I don't know much detail about it 
but yet he can feel the rhythm 
and he can tap dance 
but to understand him I just hafta look at him 
and listen very closely 
and I can understand him completely 
he's a responsible adult 
holds a job 
um and it hasn't affected him negatively in any other way 
um it just  you just hafta take time 
and listen carefully 
and watch him 
and that's how we've overcome it 
okay 
um my friends and I decided to go for a hike 
uh one is especially adventurous 
uh his name is Leo 
and my roommate Suzette and the man I was dating at the time was named Lee 
we took off on a hike 
well  equipped with backpacks full of snacks waters 
it was an beautiful day 
uh coo
and we planned to spend the whole day 
a_lot_of it  uh our plans were based on Leo 
he was uh more advanced in hiking and very adventurous and outdoorsy 
so  we went not knowing where we were going 
we just trusted him 
we got along 
had a snack 
and been gone about two and a half hours 
and nex
ready to head back uh to our destination 
and we're lost 
um three of us have absolutely no clue no concept of where we are 
we're surrounded by green canopies of trees everywhere you look 
so  there really was no direction 
and we had not been paying attention because we were very reliant on our one friend Leo 
uh Leo doesn't panic 
I started to feel a_little panicked because I had uh twisted my knee a little bit 
so  I had a_little compromised gait 
and it was a_little tender 
but I didn't wanna complain 
and I knew there's nothing we could do about it 
we just hadta get back home 
so  for the first time I really felt quite uh afraid that we might not make it 
and what to do about my knee 
we persevered 
we trusted Leo 
he  he uh went off on a couple wrong paths 
but he got us back on track 
got us back to the car 
my leg was fine 
and it all ended very well 
it was a great memory 
we laughed about it 
and um I won't go hiking with Leo again laughs 
the end laughs 
it had been raining for days and days 
and everyone knew the river was rising 
residents in the area were warned to leave town 
and to find shelter elsewhere  elsewhere until the r river  river waters went down 
uh one family the Jones would not leave 
they were not afraid 
they'd seen the river ride for many many many years 
and never felt like they were threatened 
well  this day the river rose up 
and came up to the bottom level of their house 
they decide to move upstairs 
and the water was still rising 
the rain was still coming down 
it was becoming nar nighttime 
they moved up to the top of their house where they were able to sit on the roof 
and uh Mister and Missus Jones looked around 
and they didn't see their daughter 
their daughter had run back to her bedroom to try to get their teddy_bear 
and the water had already risen that high 
so  she had been swept away by the river 
the parents suddenly realized 
they heard a yelling and a screaming 
they looked from the rooftop 
and they saw their daughter clinging to some trees that were just overhanging the river 
luckily with our technology the Jones had a cellphone 
they dialed nineoneone and were able to get the rescue services to come to their aid 
Arnold the local fireman was the first one out 
they threw out a line across the river 
it was secure 
he climbed out clinging to the rope 
and saw the Jones' daughter 
he reached down 
grabbed her 
she grabbed ahold of his arm 
he wrapped a th s uh device around hi her waist to secure her body to his 
and climbed back across the rope back to the riverside 
Jessica was safe 
the family were delighted to see that she was okay 
but they learned a lesson 
next time the river rises and they get their warning they will evacuate their home 
the end laughs 
alright 
it's a beautiful summer day and Sam was glad school was finally out 
he did it  what he loves most wi an was  was to play soccer 
he took his ball out 
and was kicking it along 
walking along down his neighborhood street 
when suddenly one swift kick 
and crash the ball came crashing through his neighbor's window 
the neighbor  is taken by surprise when the ball comes sailing in 
and lands on his lap as he's relaxing on the couch 
he picks up the ball 
walks over to the window 
and looks out 
 who could've kicked that ball 
he couldn't see anyone 
 must be that neighbor boy that's always out in the yard with his soccer ball 
 must be him 
 I'm gonna call his parents immediately 
 first I'm going to pick up my  glo pick up the glass off this couch laughs 
 and get it cleaned up 
 and then I'll call them 
 and find out what's going on 
he calls i the neighbors 
M
n and the  and the  the man says 
 does your son  is your son missing his soccer ball because I see some initials here 
 Jl Rl 
 isn't your son James Rob 
and Mister Smith says 
 ah yes 
 what happened 
 did you find his ball 
said 
 yes I found it in my living room 
 it came right through my glass 
Mister Smith said 
 I'll take care of it 
he calls his son 
and says 
 James Rob are you missing your soccer ball 
uh James said 
 no I have  I have about ten soccer balls 
 if I'm missing one I wouldn't really notice it 
and his dad says 
 well  our neighbor found one on his lap 
 it had sailed through his window 
 and he is livid because it broke his window 
 could that possibly be your ball 
 well  no  Dad 
 that couldn't possibly be my ball 
 I  I  I was out kicking the ball today 
 but I didn't  don't remember it going through anybody's window 
and he said 
 well  that's a shame because they  your initials are marked on the ball in the Sharpie 
 remember  I reminded you to do that so you wouldn't lose them 
 and your initials are on the ball 
 oh  oh  well  I was too afraid to tell anybody  Dad 
 I'm sorry 
 what can  what should we do 
and he said 
 well  the first thing you needta do is to get some money uh from your piggy bank 
 and take it over 
 and offer to pay for his window 
 and then I think that you better apologize 
 and never kick the ball out near his yard again 
 okay  Dad 
 that's what I'll do 
 sorry  Dad 
he said 
 well  you've learned a lesson 
 next time s an accident happens come s straight to me and tell me 
 and we'll take care of it 
 but don't ever hide from your responsibilities 
 okay  Dad 
 I will 
so  the next day they went over to the neighbor or  that evening excuse me they went over to the neighbor's house 
James_Rob brought his piggybank 
and he said he was willing to pay for the broken window 
and said how sorry he was 
neighbor said 
 don't worry 
 my homeowner's  associa my homeowner's insurance covers it 
 um I know it was an accident 
 I appreciate your honesty and your integrity for coming forth 
 um by the way when's your next soccer game 
 I'd really like to come see 
 you've got quite a kick 
so  all ended well for the family and the neighbor 
the end 
okay 
 Jim take your umbrella 
 it's gonna rain today for sure 
 it's eighty percent chance 
 no  Mom  I'm not gonna take it 
Jim decides to take off 
he's not afraid of a little rain 
he walks to school 
drip drip drip 
 oh_no mom was right 
drip drip drip 
the rain got harder and harder 
so  Jim runs right back home 
his mother is displeased because now he's going to be late for school 
and he is soaking wet 
 I'm not driving you to school 
 you're still gonna hafta walk 
 and you explain to the principal why you're late 
so  James takes his umbrella 
walks on to school 
ready to face the consequences of not listening to the good laughs advice of his mother 
the end 
okay 
there was a young woman and her father 
and they lived in a town all alone 
her mother had died 
the father was lonely 
and one day he met a another woman 
and decided to marry 
make a new family 
s the woman had two daughters 
and it looked like a wonderful new family was going to be created 
well  sadly the father died 
leaving his only daughter in the care of the stepmother and the two  her two halfsisters 
the stepmother was not happy about this 
and she did not see Cinderella as her own 
so  she made her more of a house servant than a daughter 
and she made her wait on th her  her two daughters 
and clean house 
and take care of them 
Cinderella was not happy about this 
but she felt like that was her destiny 
so  she  cleaned and cooked an and did everything that she was told to do 
Cinderella had a very sweet and gentle heart 
she made friends with the animals 
they were her only friends 
she was so busy 
she never had time to go out and do anything with other friends 
Cinderella's um gentle heart would carry her a long way 
she 
uh let's see hm 
let's back up a little bit 
um I ain't 
um on the other side of  of th the town the was a castle 
and clears_throat the town was ruled by a king 
the  kin this king had a son 
and the son was of age to be married 
they needed  when he  they needed a new heir to the throne 
um and if he wasn't married he could not become king 
so  the  the  fath the king decided to throw a ball inviting all eligible young women 
so  he would have a large  uh uh large number to pick from for his future bride 
uh the invitations were delivered 
and certainly the stepsisters were invited 
in_fact  every young eligible woman was invited 
Cinderella was so excited when she saw the invitation 
but the stepmother was not about to let her go 
so  she um was just distraught because she was forced to make dresses 
and prepare the stepsisters for the ball to have the time of their lives 
once in a lifetime opportunity 
but she was unable to go 
so  off the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball 
and Cinderella stayed at home very sad very lonely 
when suddenly uh uh some m magical event appeared  uh uh occurred 
and the uh ma or  her fairy godmother appeared 
and said 
 do not cry 
 you can go to the ball 
and Cinderella was very concerned about her dress 
and the stepmother 
and um turned a pumpkin into a carriage 
and the mice into horses 
and Cinderella had  uh was ready to go to the ball 
but one warning she was given was um 
 if you don't return before midnight everything  all the magic wears off 
 your dress will become rags again 
 and your uh carriage will become a pumpkin again 
and she said 
 don't worry stepmother  s
 I will 
so  she goes to the ball 
has a wonderful time dancing with the prince 
and he is entirely taken with her 
noone knows who she is because she's never been dressed this way 
the stepsisters didn't even recognize her 
well  it's getting close to midnight 
and Cinderella knows she must say goodbye 
and the clock starts to strike 
one two three four 
all the way up until it's almost twelve 
and she flees 
she tells the prince she hasta leave she hasta leave 
she takes off 
and as she's running away her clothes begin to change 
an yet one of her s glash 
she gets back to her house 
and finds that she still has one of the glass slippers left 
but she had a wonderful time 
it was a wonderful memory 
so  magical she can hardly believe it happened 
well  the next day the king set out to  fin the king uh realized uh that his son said 
 I cannot  I don't know who this young maiden is 
 I'll  I don't know her from our town 
 I've got to be able to find her 
and so they sent out um 
I don't know what you would call them 
uh sent out uh couriers to find out where this princess must live 
she must live in the community 
uh and the only way they know  they'll know if she's the one is if the remaining glass slipper that was left on the stairwell would fit her 
so  the  the uh prince's men take the slipper and visit from house to house in the town 
they come upon th Cinderella's home 
yet the stepmother in no way is going to allow Cinderella to try on the slipper 
only  she only wants her two stepdaughters 
because she wants one of them to marry the prince 
well  both stepdaughters try on the  the shoe 
and of_course they're trying to force it 
but it does not fit them 
Cinderella um is able to escape from the locked room 
and comes down 
and they try on the  sl the slipper 
and of_course it fits 
so  the prince finds his princess 
and they live happily ever after laughs 
oh_gee 
it's a beautiful spring day 
and the Carlson family uh are at home enjoying themselves 
and suddenly they hear a meowing 
 what is that 
is that Tabby the cat 
they run outside 
and they see the cat is stuck within the tree 
well  dad says 
 I can take care of that 
 I've got a ladder 
he runs to the garage 
gets the ladder 
brings it up to the tree 
climbs the tree 
and his daughter's clapping and clapping 
she's so proud of him 
next thing you know Misty their dog runs up with all the excitement 
and knocks over the ladder 
Daddy's stuck in the tree 
 oh_no 
 somebody please call nineoneone 
so  the little girl runs to the house 
tells mommy to call nineoneone 
 Daddy's stuck in the tree 
next thing you hear is an ambulance siren imit
and the fire firemen pull up 
and bring their ladder 
and rescue daddy 
and all is well 
oops  don't forget about the cat 
yes  the cat in the meantime had crawled off  crawled down the tree 
and found her way home laughs
