or not  or letting them reexplain  making them repeat back what I just said so they understand it 
so  I understand what they're  what they're listening to what I'm saying

I was worried about this  how serious it really was 
and it  I was afraid that it might have been a permanent injury 
and if it shrugs 
and I  how I dealt with it 
um I didn't 
I just rode it out and hoped for the best
