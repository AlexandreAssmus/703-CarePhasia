Dixie_Cup  Lisa's kitty  had gotten up into the tree 
and was caught up on one of the upper branches 
Lisa was calling for the little kitty to come down 
but the kitty was afraid so the kitty stayed up in the tree 
so  her father got the ladder 
and decided to climb up the tree to see if he could get the cat down 
well  while he was climbing up and the dog was barking  the ladder fell down 
and so he was stuck up in the tree 
so  the mother hadta call the fire department 
and the fire department brought their ladder a on their fire truck 
and they came to rescue father and kitty out_of the tree 
and here's the bird up here watching all the goings on 
okay 
 remove two slices of whole wheat bread from the
put them on a plate  side by side 
go to the refrigerator 
and get a jar of peanut butter and a jar of strawberry preserves 
get a knife out_of the drawer 
take um one  take a knife 
and put it in the peanut butter 
and spread the peanut butter on the one slice of bread 
take a clean knife 
put the knife in the jelly 
and spread it on top of the peanut butter 
put the second slice of bread on top of the first slice of bread 
use one of the knives to cut the peanut butter sandwich in half 
and proceed to eat 
n i_c_us were not um known then 
and so I was put in a semi private room which was um what they used during those days 
and my um classmates specialed 
what do I remember about it 
I remember being so ill  before I had the surgery that um I refused the baby because actually we thought  I thought that I had the flu 
and I was just feeling so badly 
and I remember that the nurses were very upset with me because they didn't know really what was wrong 
but they really didn't think anything was wrong 
they just thought that I didn't wanna take care of my little girl 
um finally after three days I had that 
she was delivered on Thursday morning like at three a_m 
and finally I had surgery at um Monday evening 
so  I was really very very ill 
in_fact  I had um peritonitis 
and they really did not think that I would live 
I was in the hospital for a month because at that time they  um that's just the way they did things 
and I actually chose  you could choose if you wanted to have the baby um to go to pediatrics where my family could of held the baby 
or the baby could of stayed in the nursery where all the babies are  um healthy and not ill 
and I chose the baby  to have the baby stay in the nursery which caused some problems because noone could hold the baby 
but what was nice is she was there for so long the nurses kind_of thought of her as their own 
and my husband said that when he went down she was always being held by one of the nurses 
and consequently from that uh I had ototoxic drugs 
so  I lost my hearing that way 
okay since I am hearing impaired um I understand that situation really well 
so  I can tell right away if someone is having a problem hearing  and not admitting it or not having hearing aids 
because you can  you just notice um that they're not understanding or they're not interested in what is being said or they're just on a different page 
and what have I done about it 
actually  what you do is you just talk to them 
and you just go right in front of them so_that they can see your face and your lips 
and also if you're in a really noisy environment go outside and  uh where it's quiet 
okay 
oh don't put that on yet I hafta think 
 laughs 
sighs  well the only time that I can really remember 
is it on 
okay  the only time that I can really remember that I was really frightened is my husband and I were on our honeymoon 
and we were driving in Florida 
and seatbelts were new 
and we were using the seatbelt in our new car 
and we were just driving down a country road 
and all_of_a_sudden this truck just came right out barreling down the side road 
and came right out in front of us 
and we actually drove into the ditch 
and if we wouldn't have had our seatbelts on we probably would have been injured 
but since we had our seatbelts on we just took  th my husband just turned the car 
and we continued on 
and that guy just never  that truck just never stopped and just kept going 
I_mean he was oblivious 
okay 
well  you sure like beginning middles and laughs ends don't you  
okay 
well  it looks to me that it had been raining for many days or  raining very hard 
and  this   hard to tell from the picture but it looks like it may be a young woman got too close to the water and was swept downstream 
and managed to grab a hold of a branch 
meantime someone saw her so the fire department rescue squad came in 
and uh the man is there rescuing her 
and pulled her to safety 
well  looks like Johnny got a new soccer ball so he decided to go outside and do some kicking 
well  Johnny was kicking really too hard 
and kicked the ball right through the neighbor's window 
and the neighbor was sitting watching television in his chair 
and the ball came through the window 
knocked over the lamp 
and the neighbor went 
 oh 
and the neighbor looked out the window to see if he could see who belonged to the ball 
 well  it looks like Johnny is getting ready for school 
and mother said 
 well  you_know  it's sposta rain today 
 you should take your umbrella 
and Johnny says 
 no  I'm not going to carry that umbrella 
 I don't like to carry umbrellas 
 I'm going to go to school 
and you can ha ke keep the umbrella at home 
so  he started walking to school 
and sure enough it started raining 
in_fact  it started raining very very hard that Johnny hadta cover his head with his hands 
and run through the puddles 
and run home 
and by the time he got home he was really really wet 
and mother said 
 see  I told you it was going to rain 
 why didn't you take your umbrella 
so  Johnny started off to school again in dry clothes with his umbrella 
okay 
oh sighs c 
 when Cinderella was the little girl her father married a lady who had two daughters 
and so Cinderella uh grew up with two stepsisters 
but then the father must have died because all_of_a_sudden it's the stepmother the two stepsisters and Cinderella 
and Cinderella became the um cleaning lady and the cook and the maid in the house while the stepsisters sat around all day 
um it was   the  everyone had grown up and gotten older 
and they received an invitation from the prince  from the castle because the prince was um old enough to get married now 
and he was looking for a bride 
so  they were having a big party at the castle 
so  the invitation came and the stepmother was reading it to the stepsisters 
and Cinderella overheard it 
so  she ran to her room 
opened up her trunk 
and got out her special gown that she'd been saving for a long time 
she tried it on 
and ran down to show everyone how pretty it was 
and the stepsisters were so upset they pulled the gown apart 
and told her that she was not going to be going to the ball 
so  the stepsisters and the stepmother went to the ball 
and Cinderella was left home all by herself 
now her friends the horse and the cat and the dog and especially the mice were  felt very sorry for her  and were very upset 
and then all_of_a_sudden a  f Cinderella's fairy godmother appeared 
and said 
 Cinderella we  you are going to go to the ball 
and so she fricked 
and gave Cinderella a beautiful beautiful ball gown 
and then took the pumpkin from the pumpkin patch and made it into a special coach 
and the horse became four horses pulling the coach 
and I think the dog became the footman 
and everybody went off to the ball 
and she had a wonderful time 
oh and she had glass slippers 
that was the special thing 
the g fairy godmother had given her glass slippers 
but told her that at the stroke of midnight she hadta be home because everything  the coach would turn back into a pumpkin 
and she would not have her dress anymore 
so  she had a wonderful time at the  uh party and s danced with the prince all night 
and then all_of_a_sudden the clock started striking midnight 
so  she ran down the steps 
and ran into the coach 
and ran all the way home 
but  she had lost her one shoe 
so  the prince had found the shoe 
and said 
 I will only marry  the  girl that fits into their shoe 
so  there was a proclamation sent around that the  uh prince's  uh footman would be going around with the shoe 
and every eligible young woman would be trying on the shoe 
so  s the stepmother suspected that maybe Cinderella was the person at the ball 
so  she locked her in her room and had the key in her pocket 
and the mice connived and got the key out_of the pocket 
and were running up the stairs when the prince and the footman came to try on the shoe 
and the stepsisters were bound and determined to get their foot into the shoe 
but they didn't make it as  um because their f feet were much larger than Cinderella's 
and it looked like the footman and the prince were going to leave 
and th the mice had just gotten the  door open to Cinderella's room 
and she came running down the stairs 
and said 
 may I try on the shoe 
and the footman said 
 yes of_course 
and he went over to  try the  put the shoe on her 
and the stepmother used her cane to trip him 
so  the shoe fell to the ground and broke 
and so the stepmother said 
 well  that's that 
and Cinderella said 
 no 
and she pulled the shoe out_of her apron pocket 
and said 
 here it is 
and so the footman put it on her foot 
and the prince said 
 oh  Cinderella 
and everybody was happy 
the mice were dancing 
and everybody was happy except the stepsisters and  the stepmother 
the end
