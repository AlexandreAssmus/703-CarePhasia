okay 
a little girl was playing outside in the yard with her kitty and her puppy 
and suddenly she realized her kitty had gone up into the tree and was lounging on the branch 
the birds were singing 
so  it must have been in the springtime 
and she was very upset 
she'd been riding her tricycle also 
and she was very upset 
she went and got her dad 
her dad came out 
climbed up in the tree 
but he got scared 
couldn't  the kitty was on a branch he couldn't reach 
and so he was sitting there and didn't know how to get back down 
the dog was barking at the dad 
and someone  mommy probably  realized what was going on 
she called the fire department 
and the fire department came with a ladder 
actually  it looks like a ladder laying there 
so  dad probably climbed up on the ladder 
and then the ladder fell down 
and he couldn't get up  get back down 
okay  sighs you get two pieces of bread 
and you get um your peanut butter and your jelly 
and first you put the peanut butter on one slice of bread 
and then you put the jelly on the other slice of bread 
and then you place the two slices of bread together with the peanut butter and jelly touching each other 
and then you slice it in half 
well  it was in
and it was April first 
and um I has  was working 
um and I had been ill for a couple of months 
going to the doctors  different doctors and doing tests 
and um I wasn't getting any better 
and I went to the doctor that day 
and he took one look at me 
and said 
 you're going to the hospital 
and so the hospital was right next door 
and I went next door 
and um they admitted me 
and I called work to tell them where I was 
and that I wasn't gonna be in 
but I was so kind_of out_of it I didn't even know where I was 
and laughs they couldn't figure it out for quite awhile 
and um  I was in the hospital for a week with them doing intraveneous 
which I've been on antibotics 
and they did all kinds of tests 
they couldn't find out what was wrong 
but I was slowly dying 
and they knew that 
and um that I was filled with infection 
and they couldn't locate it 
and so finally a group of doctors made the decision to do an exploratory 
and I agreed sighs because I knew that I was not gonna make it 
and so they went in 
and what had happened I had like peritonitis 
and um I'd had diverticulitis 
and one of them burst hands
and that would have been peritonitis with the infection bu
and they  h it had sealed it except for a ges
that ges
and so I was w I guess what they call septic 
and so they did the surgery 
and it was a long long surgery 
and um I ended up with a colo colonoscopy no  colostomy  colostomy 
it was the bag 
and um then I was in the hospital for two weeks after that 
um and then six months later I was able to go back in the hospital because they had removed a section of my colon 
went back in the hospital 
and they resectioned 
and I was able to not have the bag anymore 
sighs so  I can remember all of that laughs 
and  and it was life threatening 
but  um and I knew that 
and  and that's why I'm not afraid to die now because it was very peaceful 
it wasn't  it wasn't like a scary thing so 
yes 
well  it's still on going 
my mother as I said is eighty eight 
um she has a pretty profound hearing loss 
and has for probably uh at_least ten years 
but she refuses uh ta 
so  we have hadta deal with this 
um so  when I take her 
and I'm the one that's responsible for taking her to all of her doctors' appointments 
and when she's in the hospital communicating and keeping her medical records and so forth 
and so I hafta yell at her all the time 
and it's so rude and awful to be yelling at her 
and even when I explain to the doctors they still turn and talk ta 
um and that's uh frustrating for her 
um and once I leave I'm feeling really tense and frustrated because I've been yelling points
and our bodies  when points
and my mother also is getting some dementia 
and so the combination  a what I've realized is more to just allow her to talk 
and not really have a conversation with her anymore 
and that's very sad 
laughs it's  i I guess it's not that unusual fo 
and I've already told my boys 
and I've had my hearing test here that I won't do that to them 
you_know  it's really really bad 
laughs yes 
and right from the beginning so  that you_know you don't hafta make that huge you_know li 
and  and I don't think that it works as well when it's done later on you_know 
um so  anyway 
hm I'm sure there has been 
well yeah  um obviously I've got  with two boys 
um they're adults now 
but with them growing up there was you_know always something going on 
um because they were getting into stuff different things 
um probably one of the times that was really scary that co first comes to mind is my oldest boy 
um when he was maybe
and they were doing swim lessons and  i in the neighbor's yard 
uh wher with  the pool was next door 
and the neighbor  and the  and the instructor would come out to the pool 
so  he was very familiar with the pool 
and there was two friends there that 
and so we were over there um just as a  pa at a party 
and so he had been practicing going off the board ges 
it was just a little board 
but he'd been practicing doing that and he wanted to do that 
but then he got scared just as he started to jump off 
and he jumped toward the side ges
and so he hit his chin points
and it just opened it up 
and um of_course he was hysterical 
and I was getting pretty scared 
but it  wa you could see the bone 
I_mean it was really really scary 
and so we had ta 
and w he wasn't knocked out 
so  we took him to the hospital into emergency 
and then they  of_course they hadta do stitches 
and um yeah laughs it was kind_of scary 
but they survive those things most of the time 
laughs 
 there was a family that was going home 
um and there was um some water in the road where they were going to cross 
um and the father decided to go ahead 
and that they could make it 
but as they got about half way across the water was too deep 
and started washing the car away 
the windows were down luckily 
and they were all getting  ou crawling out the window 
and some people they had called nineoneone 
and there was a res first responder that came 
had on a life vest 
and grabbed a hold of a limb of a tree 
and was reaching out to save the little girl that was in the churning water that um had gone under but then had come back up 
and he was able to rescue her 
 there was a young man that was learning to play soccer 
and he was on the soccer team 
and he was excited 
and he was practicing with his kicks in the front yard 
and he kicked it really good 
only thing he kicked it too hard 
and wasn't careful about where he was aiming 
and it hit the window 
and he had kicked it so hard that it broke the window 
his dad was sitting inside when the soccer ball came through the window and knocked over the lamp 
um and he jumped up and grabbed the soccer ball 
and looked out the window 
and saw that it was his son that was practicing 
and so he understood 
he was  uh had been a boy before 
and knew that it was just a window and it could be repaired 
 sighs the little boy was getting ready ta 
he had his backpack on 
and Mom told him 
 it looks like and I had h read in the paper that it's going to rain today 
 here's your umbrella 
 no mom 
he told her 
 I don't need an umbrella today 
 it looks beautiful outside 
and so he went 
she wasn't happy about it 
but he started walking and was on his way ta 
and suddenly it started sprinkling 
and he was getting wet 
and he went running back through the puddles and through the rain back to the house 
and he was all wet 
mom looked at him and said 
 I told you so 
and so he got the umbrella 
and then he was walking to school uh with the umbrella even though he was already wet 
Cinderella and her father um lived in a lovely home with her dog 
and h father brings home the stepmother and two stepdaughters 
and introduces them to Cinderella 
and she's very happy to meet them 
um and then very quickly the stepmother and the stepdaughters become um mean 
they start being mean to Cinderella and ordering her around 
making her take care of them and do everything for them 
and wash and clean the house and um do all of the chores 
and Cinderella feels sad 
um but she has her  the little animals around the house 
the dog and the little mice and the birds 
and that keeps her happy 
and then the  uh the king where they live tells the prince that he needs to get married 
it's time for him to marry 
and uh they're going to have a big ball to a um invite all of the people in the kingdom for him to choose his bride 
and the stepmother finds the invitations to 
um and her and the stepdaughters are planning on going 
and they laugh and tell Cinderella she can't go 
they lock her in  I think they lock her in a  a room 
and um she finds a trunk with a beautiful dress in it 
and lays it out 
but then they come in 
and they  they rip it and laugh at her 
and they rip it apart 
and she's very sad 
well  they go to the ball 
and her animal friends and the fairy godmother comes 
and um they help her 
and um the fairy godmother uses her wand 
and a beautiful new dress for Cinderella 
and the little mice and all the animals they turn into a coach and um  white horses to pull the coach 
and she has on glass slippers 
and the fairy godmother tells her to have a good time 
and to be home  the only thing is she needed to be back by midnight 
and not to be later because everything would return as it was 
and um so Cinderella goes 
and the prince falls in love with her 
and they dance 
and he thinks she's beautiful 
and they have a good time 
and the stepsisters and the stepmother are jealous 
um Cinderella suddenly realizes the clock is um saying that it's twelve o'clock 
and um so she hurries down the stairs 
and loses one of her glass slippers 
and makes it home 
and she remembers how beautiful everything was and what a good time she had 
and then the next day the um groomsman of the prince comes around with the glass slipper to find who it fits 
and h it fits Cinderella 
and um so they live happily ever after
