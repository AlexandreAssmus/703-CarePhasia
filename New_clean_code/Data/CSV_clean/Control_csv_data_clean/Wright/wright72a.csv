lips_smack any time in  my whole life 
um  hm  lips_smack  well 
 inhales okay  in um  January of nineteen ninety five I was in Laughlin 
and I was feeling so sick 
I couldn't even play a slot machine 
so  I went up to our room 
lips_smack inhales and I took a bath a really hot bath because I thought I had a cold or the flu 
and I was sweating and I 
anyway 
inhales it turned out that I had pneumonia 
inhales I called down to have them call for my husband who was playing slot machine 
and um lips_smack  I didn't go in an ambulance 
but I was told  you_know 
 you should go to a hospital emergency room 
so we went across exhales the river
they did all kinds of tests horrible horrible tests and found out that I had pneumonia and a_fib 
 and they  started me on medication right away 
inhales and I went back to
inhales and  I was there for a week being treated for pneumonia 
 only in my dreams  laughs  
 lips_smack inhales well I know  maybe this is gonna be repetitive if you ever ask me for my first memory 
okay inhales 
uh I know when I was  only two or three years old my parents uh had moved to California 
inhales and I was caught  as  as part of the yard inhales there were chickens 
and I was caught in the end in the corner by the fence 
inhales and I was attacked by  a very fierce to me 
I_mean I was only two or three 
I was very little 
I could walk under this table 
 inhales I was attacked by a chicken 
it was just fluttering at me 
and inhales I wasn't injured 
but I was scared to death 
 laughs 
 yes 
 lips_smack the point was people communicating 
is that what you said 
yeah  
 lips_smack well these were experiences that happened  not frequently but from time to time with inhales dealing with special ed 
inhales and um  lips_smack autistic children mainly or retarded children 
inhales and although that was not my specialty inhales when I observed them in other classrooms or when I had  encounters with them 
we had a neighbor who was autistic 
inhales um I found it very frustrating because uh  inhales at that point I knew I  I could never work with nonverbal  children 
that was a determinant  for me  
lips_smack um this is a rescue situation 
uh the woman has been  s
she's definitely uh  having a problem 
and there's a rescuer there 
 and uh he's got the rigging  to hold on to her and pull her out 
he looks well equipped 
he looks very very strong 
and uh  he pulls her out_of the swirling  waters and  gives her a big kiss 
the boy is out in the ya
he kicks his soccer ball through a windo
inhales and the soccer
might be dad 
and the man  grabs the ball and looks out the window 
decides what he's going to do next 
okay lips_smack  
little boy is going out 
 and the mother takes the  umb  sighs he says he doesn't wanna take an umbrella 
so  mom lets him go 
and he's outside 
is going to school 
and it begins to rain 
and it rains harder 
and he rushes home 
 he's sopping wet 
 and he goes out again with the umbrella 
okay um lips_smack 
 Cinderella is introduced to her inhales stepsisters and her stepmother 
it seems to be a lips_smack family of uh  blending 
laughs so  we have lovely little Cinderella who was given terrible jobs 
she's with the farm animals 
inhales she's cleaning 
and her ugly sisters get to have a good time with beautiful clothes 
and Cinderella has all the menial tasks around the house 
and the little mice in the house seem to be her friends and they help her 
 and one day  someone came to the house I should say  castle inhales and said 
 there's going to be a party 
of_course  the stepsisters were invited 
inhales and Cinderella in her torn dress really wanted to go 
inhales suddenly her fairy godmother appeared and said 
 would you like this beautiful dress 
and Cinderella said 
 oh  yes 
inhales so  the fairy godmother touched her with a wand 
and Cinderella was the most beautiful person at the ball 
inhales and at the ball she danced with the prince 
and the clock struck twelve 
lips_smack and everything returned as it was 
so  Cinderella wasn't  in her beautiful dress 
inhales her beautiful carriage had turned into a pumpkin 
and  she lost her glass slipper because she inhales left the ball 
and later_on lips_smack inhales the prince came by saying whoever belonged to that glass slipper would be his bride 
and um he tried it on Cinderella 
it fit her 
it didn't fit her ugly stepsisters 
so  she got to laughs marry the prince
