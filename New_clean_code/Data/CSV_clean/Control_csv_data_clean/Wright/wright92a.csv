and I would get the peanut butter 
and I would spread the peanut butter on 
I put it on thick for myself 
and then I put the jelly on

and cut it 
and serve it 
the girl is playing outside riding her bike 
and she has her cat with her 
her dog  the neighbor dog comes outside and chases the cat up the tree 
so  the little girl is upset and calls her daddy 
and her daddy comes by 
and he brings a ladder to  hel to climb up to get the cat out of the tree 
so  the ladder falls down 
the dog is berk 
and the little girl runs to tell her mommy to call  to come and help her 
s mommy knows what to do 
so  mommy calls nineoneone 
and the firemen come 
and they're gonna rescue the cat and the  da and the dad 
but I don't know in what order 
so  when the cat is rescued and the dad comes down from the tree everybody is happy 
and they go home m 
one time a long time ago when we lived in Colorado we had a little dog 
we called her Heidi 
and  I had three boys then and the dog and a husband 
and we played in the yard 
when I   w I was running with Heidi and just chasing her 
and my left foot  bent 
I heard it crack 
and it made a snapping sound 
and I knew that was not a good thing to hear 
so  I went down on the ground 
sat down immediately 
and got off my foot 
 I don't remember where Heidi went 
the dog's name was Heidi 
and she was there 
but I went  I got up s the stairs because it was uh 
the yard stairs went into the backyard going ges
so  I hadta go up the stairs that my husband build this p porch 
it was a patio porch and  with stairs 
and we would sit out there and have our barbeque and that 
so  I climbed up the stairs with my knee and my other foot kind_of dragging it 
I would not step on the other foot that was broken 
so  I got upstairs and went onto the couch 
and I layed down 
and I  uh it was  wasn't hurting 
and when my middle son came home from school he said 
 what happened to you 
and I said 
 well  I think I broke my foot because I heard this snapping noise while I was playing with Heidi 
he said 
 well  you had better get to the hospital 
and I said 
 oh  no 
 I'm okay 
 I don't hafta go to the hospital 
he said 
 oh  yes you do 
he must have been in about fifth grade 
say 
 you hafta go to the hospital 
 s no I  no I don't 
and he said 
 well  I'm going next door to s talk to Steve 
 his wife is a nurse 
so  he went 
and he told Steve 
and Steve told his wife the nurse what happened 
since I wouldn't do what my son told me to do he s ran off to find out some other advice 
so  the nurse told him that I needed to see a doctor 
so  then I called my husband 
and my husband took me to the doctor because then I knew it was serious 
n nurse would know what to do not me or not my son 
but obviously he did know what to do 
so  when I went to the doctor he  they xrayed my foot 
I had broken my fifth metatarsal or think that's how you say it 
and it's the  the bone that's on the side of your foot 
so  he  they xrayed it 
and they saw that was broken 
and that being a  f the b foot has so many bones in it you cannot put a cast on it 
so  the doctor suggested  instructed me to buy a pair of heavy hard shoe  hard tie up shoes  hard toed tied up shoes 
and to get  to get to  the shoe to fit is to fit it in your good foot 
and then to stick your  s
I could lift my foot up and down 
but I couldn't  I couldn't move my  s
so  I did get the m shoes 
I still have them and haven't worn them 
they're brand new laughs 
and I wore the shoe like he told me 
and um the  s
and I was so proud of my son  for helping me laughs 
yes 
I worked  I was sixteen a teenager and I worked in a hospital 
and we uh  were walking  oh me were walking home another girl were walking to the bus 
and we had a friend there 
he was a older man 
he would joke with us 
and he would talk with us 
and he was friendly 
he's a very nice man 
and uh he wa was off a_little earlier than us 
so  he stood behind a tree 
and b by the time us girls got wa walking up close to him he jumped out in front of the tree to scare us 
and we just like stood there in a shock 
and you could feel your body go into holding your breath and adrendaline 
it would go  flow through your body 
not fall from the inside 
and you just stood there stunned for a minute 
he saw what he had done and was so sorry that laughs he scared the dickens out_of us  
it was obvious  also it was dark 
it was  late at night 
maybe seven by that time was  would be late for us because it was uh dark and in the wintertime which would be  is  shrugs doesn't matter what time late was 
it was dark  was dark 
and so shrugs that was it 
not really 
 laughs have I haver 
 sometimes you have a little trouble explaining something to yourself  to your children what you want them to do 
 well  you tell them  I would tell the children or  my son what to do 
and if he didn't do it he would get the belt 
well  they went on  he went on 
and he did it again 
so  can't remember what he did 
he  maybe he was
must have been pretty good to get the belt 
so  I told him 
 okay 
 you did it 
 you're gonna get the belt 
so  I would put  said 
 put your hands on the bed 
so  he put his hands on the bed 
gave him one  w one whopo with the belt laughs 
so  then  it would be next week 
head
so  I said 
 okay 
 if you don't stop doing it you're gonna get two belts 
so  he kept doing it 
so  he got two belt swats
so  he hadta put his hands on the bed again 
so  went on again 
and then he uh did it again 
so  I guess he wasn't getting the communication laughs part 
or I wasn't  communicating to him very well with the belt 
so  I said 
 you're gonna get three belts 
this was the time when you probably uh would  nobody knew what was happening 
so  you wouldn't get hauled off to  laughs to jail for whopping your son with the belt 
so  he got three  bel three swats with the belt 
and he must have d stop because I don't remember having to  hit him anymore laughs 
I remember after that it was like 
 okay  I'm not gonna do this this way anymore 
and just sit down 
start taking privileges away 
i though they get the message 
I think that you can whoop them a little time  little bit 
they get a_little more afraid of you 
and do what you told them because you're threatening them laughs with their  their life 
I let them live laughs
