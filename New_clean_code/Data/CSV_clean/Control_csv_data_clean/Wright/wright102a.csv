and the neighbor was at home while this happened 
freaked him out because uh a ball came flying through his window and crashed 
and um so the neighbor decided  wanted to know w what happened 
and so he grabbed the ball 
realized some kids must've been outside and uh kicked the ball through his window

and all he has left is a glass slipper 
so  he sends out uh his servant to find who the woman was with the glass slipper and makes everybody try out the  a glass slipper 
and finally they find  uh th they finally find someone who the glass slipper fits on 
and it's Cinderella 
and all the evil stepsisters are again so furious at Cinderella because she's the lucky one that fits the glass slipper
