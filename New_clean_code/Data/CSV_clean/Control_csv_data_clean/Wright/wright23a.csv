okay  so  one day uh I decided to go outside and enjoy the nice weather and go for a jog 
uh I noticed that I had been  that I was feeling kinda weak and feeling kinda nauseous 
um thinking that it was just uh part of getting back into exercise I didn't think too much of it 
however the following days it continued to get worse and worse 
um I started to get more nauseous and feel more weak 
and I was sleeping up to twenty one hours a day 
um finally I decided that I needed to go to the doctor 
and at that point I had become jaundice which is yellow  s yellow skin and the whites of my eyes had become yellow 
uh the doctor had sent me to the hospital and  where I was hospitalized for four days while they did tests to figure what might be wrong with me 
uh all of my family came to visit 
and they hadta wear gloves for protection since they didn't know what was wrong with me 
and after several tests and several visits from the doctor they discovered that it was Hepatitis_a 
and after several days of being on i_v and getting rehydrated uh I did recover as there is no cure 
and I  after about  about two months after that after I got out_of the hospital 
I was one hundred percent recovered and very happy that it wasn't something worse 
the end 
wait 
by language problems  uh communication problems does it mean someone that mighta had a disorder or is just it an issue communicating 
okay 
alright 
okay  
okay 
okay  so  a few years ago when I was in school uh I was taking a class where I was partnered up with uh a student from China who had a very difficult  who had difficulties communicating verbally in English 
um he  he was hard to understand 
but I did my best to communicate with him by um maybe not trying to understand his complete sentences but trying to pick out words out_of what he was saying and try to match that into the context of what was going on around us to piece together what he might be saying 
and also I helped the communication by trying to repeat what he was saying or continue the conversation on uh stating how I was understanding him so_that at some point if I didn't understand him he would realize that I wasn't understanding him 
and afrel after several weeks it just got easier and easier to understand what he was saying 
I would  just became accustomed to the accent and the words that he might choose to use 
and over time it got easier 
okay  so  it was  uh it was night time on Friday night 
and one of my friends was having a small gettogether over at her house 
just a few of us 
and she invited me over 
so  I went over there 
and I got to the house 
and the few of us were just hanging around watching tv having a good time 
and uh we hear a knock at the door 
and just thinking that maybe it was uh another guest or not thinking much of it uh the  uh one of her friends answers the door 
and it turns out to be a guy in a mask uh attempting to either rob us or rob the house 
and uh the first thing that the girl who answers the door says is that he has a gun 
and he  so he comes in 
and there's another uh man behind him that stays outside 
but one of  th one of the guys comes in 
and he proceeds to take things from the house and take things from the people that are in the house 
just very quickly grab some things and runs out 
and that's  that's the end 
so   without getting too detailed 
but   so I was pretty scared 
okay  one late afternoon uh a woman is returning home from work uh struggling to get through the traffic as it is very rainy that day 
uh the traffic is very heavy 
the  the streets are beginning to get flooded 
eh so  she decides to take a shortcut through a side street 
she gets into the side street and realizes that it is overflooded and her car gets stuck 
she jumps out_of the car but then gets  uh then gets stuck in  in the flood waters 
and uh she is unable to swim out 
uh an onlooker notices that the woman is stuck in the river and calls nineoneone 
uh rescuers arrive and use their special equipment and their life vests to rescue her 
one of the rescuers grabs onto a branch and pulls it down and  so_that the woman can grab on where she is rescued 
and uh sh she gets out_of the water and thanks uh the rescuers for what they have done 
she is very happy 
the end

and he sees the ball crash through the window and onto his lamp where he is very startled 
he picks up the ball and looks outside the window to see uh what is going on outside 
uh the boy has ran 
the end 
okay  early Tuesday morning the young boy gets ready to go to school 
uh he's getting ready to walk out the door when his mother insists that he needs to take an umbrella because it's sposta rain 
uh the young boy refuses to take the umbrella as he doesn't wanna carry the extra weight and doesn't wanna look uncool in front of his friends 
h he hands the umbrella back to his mother 
he is halfway down the road on his way to school when it begins to pour rain 
uh he begins to run through the puddle  t through the puddles as the rain uh beats down upon him
