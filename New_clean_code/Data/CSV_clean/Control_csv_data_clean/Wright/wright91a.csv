okay 
first of all I pull out the bread 
then I hafta go in the cupboard and get the peanut butter
and we keep our jelly in the refrigerator 
so  I hafta open up the refrigerator pull out the  jelly 
spread the peanut butter onto the one slice of the bread 
uh actually I like a_lot_of peanut butter 
so  I usually would put it on both slices of the bread 
and then just put the jelly in the center of it 
and close it up 
put the bread away into the cupboard 
and put the other items away of_course 
yeah 
the uh family pet  the girl's pet which is a cat got stuck up in a tree 
the father tells his uh daughter that he will get the cat down out of the tree 
climbs up into the tree 
and uh the  loses the ladder that he got up into the tree 
so  now the cat and the father are both stuck up in the tree 
the dog is of_course barking and barking 
but uh that's just to laughs see what's going on 
because the dog probably is the one that chased the cat up in the tree to begin with 
and then uh somebody called the fire department of_course to get everybody out_of the tree 
I got  uh I  head
I have a back problem 
I guess that's my worst problem right now 
and um I uh have pains points
and I have uh appointment with the uh neurosurgeon in March to see what it's all about 
but they think what it is it's a pinched nerve points
I have hand
and uh I have bone spurs and things like that up there 
so  I'm sure they probably are gonna be doing a surgery of some sort 
because I  right now I hafta take pain pills to get to sleep at night 
that's my only problem 
it doesn't bother me too much in the day time 
because it's not that great of pain 
I can  I can uh deal with it 
just at night I can't ges
because it hurts too much 
uh the pain does 
so  I hafta take a pain pill right now at night 
which I don't like to do 
because I don't really like to take uh any kind of pills 
the only any kind of pills I take at all are for high cholesterol 
but  uh so  I don't like that at all 
but um I do take those at night 
so  I can least sleep halfway decent 
and  uh but that's about all 
I don't really  I been  ges
 I've been  uh been fortunate basically uh throughout my life 
uh I never smoked and  and um only really drink at like Christmas and special occasions  and stuff like that 
so  I didn't drink a_lot 
the reason I don't do that is because my mother died from drinking 
and uh my father was German 
so  he drank a_lot 
so  maybe that's why I don't drink 
but uh uh uh so I been living a healthy life 
and um you_know I just head
sorry 
laughs 
yeah 
I was the  uz the other night 
um  
okay 
for the first time in my life um uh we went out to eat in_fact at Ihop points right over here 
uh because I didn't pull out anything for dinner 
and um so we decided to go and eat at Ihop 
we went over there 
and  and uh oh it was about  it wasn't too late 
it was about four thirty in the afternoon 
lips_smack uh I have a thing where I don't eat anything  anything with sugar in it uh like snacks or anything after six or seven o'clock 
because I found out for whatever reason I wake up in the next morning with a headache if I  if I have sugars in the evening 
but anyways we had  I  uh we ha both had a cup of cocoa 
and then I just had a hamburger 
so  can't believe it was the hamburger 
so  we figured it was the cocoa 
but anyways uh came back 
lips_smack and I started feeling queasy in my stomach 
and  and um uh I just  just was like  I was  it  wa I was like having anxiety attack 
my whole uh stomach was going all over the place 
and we usually go to bed around ten o'clock 
so  I went to bed 
uh Donna stayed up uh read a book for awhile 
and I head
I couldn't 
I had  all_of_a_sudden I was sweating like a stuffed pig 
um  didn't seem like my heart was racing 
so  and don't think it was any kind of um an attack of any kind 
uh but I was sweating 
then all_of_a_sudden I pulled all the covers off 
and then I was cold 
and  and uh so I got up 
an
and uh w about one o'clock laughs in the morning finally finally uh went back to bed 
but in the meantime I was just head
and I was sick to my stomach 
and it was just a  head
but if I ever had one I think that would've been it 
uh and head
and of_course I went to sleep 
but I was scared 
because I was  uh I didn't think it was a heart attack or  I was having 
uh I just you_know  we just come to the conclusion it was just too much sugar or whatever it was  
but it was so early in the evening 
we couldn't figure
but  I just couldn't figure out what else it was at 
but head
I just kept going over in my mind 
 oh  what  what if something happens 
or  whate I  maybe that was it 
and then I just  you_know I just  uh uh just uneasy 
 and uh it was bad 
it was bad 
but anyways  that was it 
um have you ever had any experience with people who have had a difficult time communicating 
 like talking 
you mean communicating 
 well uh only  only the experience of  of 
a friend of Donna's is  um um uh she's
and um so this was awhile ago when we first got here 
and so she made friends with her 
her name is uh Janine 
and she made friends with her 
and so she learned to do sign language 
be  so  she could communicate with her 
but I  of_course I don't 
it's too deep for me to learn 
so  I didn't learn it 
but anyway she did 
so  she can communicate 
but I would  um I went over there quite a bit to their house and everything 
and it was an experience because you hafta 
uh she could read lips as long as you talk ges directly to her 
lips_smack and so I went over there a_lot_of times because if she had problems with her uh uh computer I would help her out 
because I know quite a bit about computers 
and then uh if uh she had any problems 
like she had problems with her telephone company one time 
so   I called the telephone company for her 
because it's so hard for her to communicate with anybody 
because she hasta go through that TDY thing that you_know that  you have on the telephones 
but um that was quite an experience 
because uh you  you just  it's just not a normal thing 
because you hafta ges for sure 
you_know  you're so useta just taking to people 
 and you hafta get in the situation where you're always talking points in front of her 
 uh and this type of thing 
but it  it was a good experience 
and um I really enjoyed it 
and um you_know uh I guess got a_lot out_of it 
because you  you're so thankful then of uh head
and  and you don't  have things like that and everything else 
but uh anyways that was that 
looks to me like a couple uh go are  are uh tied up in a flood  rapids 
and uh they're washing them down stream probably 
he  they finally hung up on a tree 
and um he's got a belt around um 
I guess it must have came off of her because he's still got his belt on 
anyways  it uh looks like they  they got a belt tied around um  something 
and uh looks like uh hopefully they're looking up 
because uh hopefully the  uh uh the rescue people are in helicopter above them 
and are about to lower a line down 
and rescue these two people who are tied up in this situation 
this little boy's out uh playing with his uh soccer ball 
lips_smack and uh he kicks it  up in the air 
and lord behold it goes throu
um don't know laughs 
hopefully it's his parents window 
which would be a_lot better even_though it uh went through a window 
but anyways it goes through the window 
and  and lands in the living room where this uh man is sitting 
uh knocks over a lamp 
lips_smack uh the man gets up 
and looks out the window to see uh who threw the ball of_course 
um and uh hopefully he doesn't get too mad at the little boy that  kicked the ball through the window 
his mother  uh the little boy is gonna go  be going to school 
and the mother wants the boy to take an umbrella along 
because it's sposta be raining that day 
but of_course um most of the time the kids think they know it all 
and he says 
 no  Mom 
 I don't wanna take the umbrella 
 I'm alright 
sure enough on the way  to school it starts raining 
he hasta run back home 
of_course  by the time he gets home he
uh the mother is very  very angry at him of_course 
because he didn't  take the umbrella 
but all in all in the end the boy is happy now 
because he has the umbrella 
and he's dry again 
and it looks like with a
okay 
sil Cinderella was brought into the uh family as a stepchild 
and uh there were two other sisters in the  in the family 
and of_course they did not  uh k along with the mother did not like Cinderella 
they used her as basically a maid lips_smack to do all the chores and  and all the uh cleaning and everything else around the house 
in the meantime Cinderella  made friends with the animal
because uh um they wanted to make her happy 
uh an invitation came to the family for the  the sisters to go
and uh they of_course had their dresses ma

an
in the meantime Cinderella also wanted to go to the ball

and  and the animals basically made her dress 
uh and the fairy godmother  uh she met a fair 
no  no  no  no  no  no  she had her dress made 
lips_smack and uh when their mother saw her dress it was more beautiful than her sisters' was 
so  consequently they ripped it apar
um she uh then of_course got very sa
the fairy godmother appeared to Cinderella and told her that um uh she would be able to go to the ba
uh she would have her dress for he
and um they had a carriage which was of_course a pumpkin 
uh but the only uh thing was that Cinderella would hafta leave by twelve o'clock be  from the ball 
uh because if she didn't she would turn back into her normal or her regular self again 
so  she went to the ball 
and um uh uh all  and she was the most beautiful person there

and wanted to know who that beautiful woman was that belonged to the shoe 
and went around to the who

lips_smack uh he got  um came across the house that Cinderella lived in 
and the mother uh had her locked in a room 
because  she did not want her to be let out uh for the prince to even try on the shoe 
lips_smack anyways uh the mice found the key 
let her out_of the  ly let her out_of the room 
the  um the  uh uh not the prince but  the uh sh uh butler tried on the shoe 
it fit Cinderella 
lips_smack and um lips_smack basically uh she got married to the prince 
and they lived happily ever after
