okay 
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
first you would go to the fridge and get the bread 
then 
well  then you would take the bread and grab two slices 
and you would put peanut butter on both slices because I love extra peanut butter 
um then you would put jelly on both those slices 
then if you want you could put the banana in it but it's peanut butter and jelly so I wouldn't put banana 
and I would just put the two slices together hands
put in on a plate 
and then begin to eat it 
milk might go better but we're good 
alright I am 
so  the  it is little Johnny's birthday 
and he comes home  uh f comes into his house and kind_of is a surprise party 
people are arriving 
and uh needless to say his birthday is ruined because his birthday cake is half eaten by the dog who is nonetheless sleeping under the couch after a nice fat meal 
we all know how that feels 
and so he sees that and he gets mad 
the mother gets worse  even more mad and wants to go uh you know get the dog out from under the couch and you_know use her broom and bop him on the head and teach him a lesson 
and uh eventually they realize well it's alright 
it's not the end of the world 
uh they love the dog 
the dog only meant well 
the kid becomes happy 
he gets his presents 
the little girls and everyone plays 
and that's the end of today 
nope 
well  actually I've never been hospitalized or broke a bone 
knock on wood knocks
um I really  I wasn't the kind of person to really ever get hurt 
um I mean bumps and bruises but nothing too serious 
the only one time 
well  I could name two mainly 
but the  the  the most recent kind_of hurt was uh my senior year of high school uh no  my junior year of high school playing football 
I was during practice 
yeah 
I  um we were doing a drill and uh I had the ball 
and the other guy hadta tackle me 
and I was kind_of sposta let him tackle me 
so  I go and I let him tackle me 
and as he tackles me he you_know throws me to the ground 
and I land 
points
and I end up just landing on the ground on my shoulder points
and it like kind_of cracks 
I go 
 a
terrible terrible pain 
um and uh you_know I  I go off to the side 
and uh the coach checks me out and says 
 yeah  you_know you needta get checked out 
that  then I end up  I end up you_know that  the next day  or maybe that  I think it was that day 
I  uh I go to the hospital just to have them look at it 
and I_mean I don't know if I  I consider hospitalized overnight 
but I  I wasn't overnight 
just go in and look at it 
um  they say 
 well  you're 
why do I think this is 
I'm sorry 
I skipped a part 
I go to my sports doctor first 
he  um he looks at it 
points
um if I got this right the separation  the difference between a separation and a dislocation is the distance ges
ges
anything less is a dislocation 
and mine was at seven points
so  seven centimeters separated 
points
um so  yeah  he tells me that 
uh sends me to the  says 
 go to the hospital just to you_know have them uh get you uh the  the correct equipment points
and uh they put me in a sling 
I'm you_know and 
I_mean it didn't  didn't really  like I didn't  it wasn't really too painful 
it just hurt when I landed on it 
um and I_mean uh I was out f of football for like uh  all uh 
I think I was only out_of football for like two weeks because I didn't  really didn't  I really wanted to push myself and I didn't wanna miss that much 
so  I was out_of football for like two weeks 
came back 
and that was about it 
you_know 
yes  my brother 
okay 
well  the person I have had trouble communicating or has had trouble communicating that I know of uh that first comes to mind would be my brother 
even_though I've worked with many autistic kids 
I useta do a_lot_of volunteer work um at camps with autistic kids and manic depressive all those different disorders 
um I probably know my brother best 
and my brother uh I diagnose it as just a social problem 
but when he was younger he  he just  you_know he couldn't really say what he wanted or tell you or  or you_know kind_of socially get along with my  me and my friends or anything of the sort 
and um you_know just take for example one time he wanted to uh you_know play on the trampoline with us 
and we weren't sure what he was wanting and he was just jumping on the trampoline 
jumps jumps on and jumps into the middle of our game and you_know kind_of frustrates everybody 
and you_know I see that and  and after awhile 
this has happened before 
I  I understand what he's trying to tell me 
and I read that he just wants to hang out with us and have fun 
so  you_know I tell him 
 alright well why don't you do this 
and I have him do something else on the side and you_know then jump in and join us 
and you_know we kind_of end up beating the hell out_of him on the trampoline 
and he still laughs even_though we beat him up 
and it ends up turning into a_lot_of fun 
and  and you_know he's happy 
and  and eventually he learned to communicate better 
there have been times when I  you_know I've told him you_know 
 say what you want talk to me tell me 
and I'll tell you you_know 
 Dave don't come out with us or Dave come out with us you_know Dave do this tell us 
and um he has learned to communicate a_lot better 
and that's it 
oh I could tell you 
okay  I'm ready 
so  this was actually my sophomore year in college 
I'm with a bunch of my buddies 
my best friend Tal was with me 
we go to this party 
uh at this party um a friend of mine is playing beer pong 
his name's Harry 
he's a crazy crazy kid 
he has like  I think he's a manic depressive and bipolar 
he's crazy 
he's insane 
like he'll go off the walls 
so  um he's playing uh beer pong at this party in the back yard 
and there's ges
and um he  he wins 
he wins the game 
or he  I think he  he either wins the game or scores a point 
and he goes 
 yeah 
and he rips off his shirt ges
and another guy standing kind_of next to Tal and I in the middle of the table is like kind_of like 
 what the heck is that 
you_know  he kind_of says a curse word like you_know 
 what the fl are you doing 
and everything else 
and  and Harry's like 
 what are you talking about you_know 
and  and then Tal my friend  best friend is standing next to me and he turns to the kid 
and like he  I don't remember what he said too much but he was kind_of like trying to put him in his place telling him you_know 
 you better  better watch yourself 
 you better shut up or something 
and um uh the kid starts to get in his face 
and the kid's much bigger than Tal 
he's about the same size as me 
and he gets in his face 
and you_know I  uh he's  you_know they're starting to argue 
it's getting heated 
and all the while when things start to get bad like that or when things get scary or when I get scared the number  the thing that I always do is I get very quiet and I  uh I don't mean to do it but I kind_of get like  I heighten my senses 
I feel everything heighten 
and I just listen and look and feel and try to take in as much as I can 
and I get ready 
and make a long story short uh the kid gets in his face 
and I simply  my f friend Tal's ges
ges
ges
um uh I put my head kind_of closer to his near his shoulder 
and I just sit there looking at the guy and standing next to Tal 
and I  I'm scared because I don't like fighting 
I don't ever wanna see fighting 
I don't wanna see a punch thrown 
I don't wanna see 
even we  uh you_know in my mind I'm  you_know we could have had  we had a_lot more people at the party that we knew 
he didn't 
we  I_mean it  really we knew that it could have been bad for him 
but I still didn't wanna see anyone get hurt 
so  I'm getting scared 
and you_know I just stand there calmly and quietly and don't lose my cool even_though I'm nervous and um looking at the kid and just waiting for him to  to take a swing at Tal because then Tal knows and I know that we're gonna go buck wild on him 
and I'm not  it's not like I'm a big guy or a bad guy it's just  uh it's just that's how I feel 
I'm getting ready to jump in to fight 
and you_know they eventually go back and forth 
and um everyone says stuff 
and eventually you_know I  I don't know if  I think Tal says it 
Tal's like 
 dude  seriously  you better get out_of here 
you better stop because you  you're way outnumbered right now 
you  you have nobody with you 
w we could really 
and  and the guy's like 
 no 
but eventually it just quiets down 
I still stood my ground next to Tal and made sure he was safe 
and the guy eventually leaves 
everything calms down 
and it  it ends 
and that's it 
huh 
uh  this  well it's  you can interpret a bunch of different ways 
okay 
sounds good 
um so  a big  uh a big  um let's say a big uh hurricane hits fills up all the water and just wipes out you_know kind_of like uh the one in New_Orleans or something 
I don't know 
or the tsunami 
that's what I meant 
tsunami 
all the waters are filled 
uh make a long story short houses trees everything's going down through the  through the water 
and it just kind_of just looks like rivers now 
um a girl falls  is kind_of  not falls but  you_know because of all the  she's  just all the winds and everything she's stuck in the water 
she gets stuck in the water and she's going downstream and everything's going 
sorry 
everything's going so fast 
um  oh wait 
I'm not telling this as a story 
uh a girl 
sorry 
um a girl gets  uh falls in  uh gets pulled into the water by the tsunami 
and she's going downstream 
and the girl's you_know feeling hopeless and doesn't know if she's going to make it 
she's really scared 
and um out_of nowhere one of the uh rescue teams that came in to fight the tsunami uh come in and they  they see the girl 
and a guy jumps out_of the helicopter with uh you_know a life preserver and uh belts and  and you_know all equipped and ready to save her and fly  goes downstream 
and she's stuck on a branch 
and he  he uh you_know ges
and uh the helicopter comes and you_know ges
and she's safe 
and that's it 
okay 
yeah 
okay  so  a kid is playing soccer ball 
he's kicking it up in the air to himself messing around with the soccer ball trying to practice for the big game tomorrow 
there's a big soccer game 
and while practicing he ends up kicking the ball over the fence and through his window  through his neighbor's window 
the neighbor is sitting there watching television and notices a soccer ball come through his window and hit his lamp 
um the neighbor is astonished picks up the soccer ball looks out the window sees that the kid had did it um and realizes that it wasn't done on purpose 
the kid go  runs over to the neighbor says 
 I'm sorry 
 I didn't mean it 
the neighbor gives the kid  the ball back to the kid 
and the kid says you_know 
 I'll pay for it I'll fix it or whatever 
the neighbor says 
 no just  um it just  I'll  I'll buy a new glass and what_not and just help me fix it 
so  they fix it together 
uh everything is great 
and the day ends happily 
um yeah 
okay  so  the kid is leaving to go to school

 I told you so 
uh the kid's unhappy but he knows his mother is right
