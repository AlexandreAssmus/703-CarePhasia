there's a little girl and she was playing outside with her bike and her cat 
the cat got up in the tree 
and she couldn't get him to come back down 
so  her dad went out to try and help 
got the ladder climbed the tree 
then the ladder fell over 
so  he's now stuck in the tree with the cat 
and the dog is barking 
but he can't really climb the tree to help 
so  the firemen have showed up with a tall ladder to save the man and the cat 
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you need um some really good high quality sprouted grain bread 
maybe ges
so  then you'd take two slices 
and you wanna get um a nice high quality peanut butter 
preferably just peanuts 
maybe a little bit of salt 
nice organic 
and then you can spread the peanut butter ges
and then for your jelly you could actually use a preserve or fruit jam that you make yourself so it's got really pure high quality ingredients 
and you would just ges
and then you would introduce the two slices to each other hands
and you have a sandwich 
in elementary school I was rollerblading with my aunt 
and she took off down a hill points 
and I went behind her points 
and I ended up cutting my leg on a brick wall up to the bone touches
but I didn't really feel it at all 
I didn't feel any pain or anything 
I was just happy I had like avoided traces
but when I looked down and saw all the blood spreads
 oh 
and then I kicked into like a pain association 
so  I hadta go get stitches 
and a large man carried me into a wheelchair 
and it was awkward 
um
and there was an angry woman from the complex who was also out front 
and she was  um I think she was pretty spun on something else 
and she was just shouting having fights with everybody 
so  she came over and um attacked us 
and my friend was  she was trying to attack one of my friends 
so  we were trying to get in the way and um ges stop her from doing that 
and during the whole commotion as we were trying to separate this really upset woman um a guy came out from the car and actually knocked out one of our friends with like just a ges
and  um and then he was actually 
because my friend then got really pissed off because that was her boyfriend 
and she was just kinda screaming 
and he was about to knock her out 
so  that was a little bit high tension 
hadta break that up and call the cops and all that 
um I've had experience with someone that has a really hard time communicating in that they can't really have a genuine conversation with you because they can't get around their own 
just very self oriented kind_of selfish in a way 
can't really have a two person conversation because they don't move past a certain point in their mind 
they just loop the track and go right back to another place 
yeah  I try to just um be patient and um continually try to open those doors of communication 
so   it's  it's my mother 
so  laughs it's a lifetime process 
but maybe in the next twenty years or something laughs we can talk 
so  there's a little boy playing soccer outside trying to learn how to kick the ball better 
and he still hasn't quite learned 
so  as he kicks the ball it goes through the window into the house 
and there's a man sitting inside probably his dad who looks out and sees that the ball has come flying through and looks out to see what happened 
so  there is a little boy getting ready for school 
and his mom comes up and says 
 don't you wanna take your umbrella 
and he says 
 no 
he's asserting his independence and making decisions for himself 
so  he doesn't wanna take his mother's good advice 
he goes out for the day and realizes that it's raining  raining very very hard 
there are puddles everywhere 
it's really uncomfortable to be that wet 
so  he runs home totally drenched to get the umbrella from his mother and then walks out and feels a_lot better because now he has some weather protection 
so  there is a little girl whose mother has died 
and so her father meets someone else and wants to have a new mother for her 
so  she's introduced to her new stepmother and her two stepsisters 
she's excited 
but it turns out that the two stepsisters are actually very mean 
and the stepmother is very cruel 
so  all the years as she's raised with them during the beginning few years it's  it's okay 
it's not great 
and then her father dies 
and she's left alone with the wicked stepmother and sisters 
and they basically make her to be a maid 
they're never very kind to her 
and she hasta do all the work on the farm 
and she hasta work with all the animals and basically serve them all their food 
so  there's also in the same area um a castle and a prince and a king that live all the way in the castle 
and the king is getting very antsy and wants to find a bride for his son the prince 
so  he declares that there be an invitation sent out to all the homes in the region 
so  an invitation for a ball so_that the prince can choose a bride 
and they get this invitation at Cinderella's house 
the stepmother reads it 
and the ugly mean stepsisters are very excited 
they wanna go meet this handsome prince 
and they are just so convinced that they are going to be the ones selected to live in the castle and become a princess 
so  they get ready for the ball 
and Cinderella also gets very excited and wants to go to this ball 
she wants to go dance and have fun 
so  she hangs out with all her little animal friends and s is up all night with her little mice friends making this beautiful dress for the ball 
and when she goes out and is about to leave her stepsisters tell her that she's not allowed to go 
she's not going to go 
they rip off all of her jewelry 
they tear apart her dress 
and they leave her locked in the house as the stepsisters leave and the wicked stepmother goes as_well 
so  Cinderella's very sad 
she doesn't know what to do 
and then her fairy godmother appears and tells her that she's going to help her go to the ball and fulfill her destiny 
so  she taps a pumpkin making it a beautiful carriage for her to ride creates a beautiful dress for her gives her these delightful glass slippers and tells her that she has until midnight to go out and enjoy the ball 
but she hasta be gone by midnight because everything else will turn back to what it was 
so  Cinderella goes and is very excited 
and as soon as she arrives she is instantly noticed by the prince who is dancing with her all night 
and the stepsisters are very jealous 
they don't know who this woman even is 
and she's having a great time 
but then she realizes that this  the clock is about to strike 
and so she runs in such a hurry 
and the prince goes after her like 
 wait reaches
 you can't leave 
 why are you leaving 
and she just says 
 I hafta go 
and she leaves 
but one of her slippers her glass shoes is left behind 
he holds on to this shoe and takes it to  the men that work for his father and tells them to search the whole country for the woman who owns this shoe 
so  Cinderella makes it home that night and is just still very happy because she had such an amazing night out sitting on her pumpkin looking at her one shoe 
and the next morning the men from the castle arrive 
and they are trying the shoe on everyone in the house 
but it doesn't fit the fat foot of the sister 
it doesn't fit the fat foot of the other sister 
and it sure doesn't fit the fat foot of the wicked stepmother 
but it does fit the foot of Cinderella 
so  they know that she's the one that was at the party 
and she goes and marries the prince and lives happily ever after
