uh
get really good bread not the cheap factory bread 
inhales and you put some peanut butter on it 
and you put some jelly on it 
and you slap the two together 
and if you really want it  really want it to be good put bananas on it sniffs 
oh_my  looks like a family's having another picnic 
boy  they got a_lot_of picnics in this project  don't they 
anyways they went out to the country
and they're hanging out underneath the tree 
and uh looks like the cat 
what kind of a name for the cat 
let's call this cat Lindsey 
Lindsey the cat climbs up the tree 
and of_course everyone's worried about the cat 
so  even the dog is worried about the cat 
he's trying to kit 
and Daddy climbs up the tree to get the cat 
and then the ladder falls down 
sighs so fortunately someone has their cellphone 
and they call the fire department 
and the fire charten 
and gets the cat down from the tree 
and the little girl named Molly she's really happy now 
and they all go for ice cream and live happily ever after 
well  the last time I was hospitalized I was five 
so  what I'll do instead is I'll tell you about swine flu 
so  about a month ago  oh let's see was  I was out to dinner with friends 
and um was kind_of tired 
so  anyways I went home about shrugs eleven o'clock 
and then Sunday kind_of was all achy and just slept all day  pretty much 
I think I was like not sleeping for two hours 
but for some reason I just didn't shrugs head
you_know  I  w I'm oblivious to these things 
like when you're not married you don't have a wife that tells ya 
 go to the doctor 
so  went to work on Monday
and ended up drink  noticed I drank must have  like fifteen cups of tea 
and it was like 
 yeah you're probably sick 
 but yeah you're not 
 so  you stayed all day 
and then Tuesday I woke up feeling totally crap sighs 
in bed all day 
stayed home from work 
same thing Wednesday 
 and then Thursday morning I  f f uh Wednesday actually I called made an appointment for the doctor 
and Thursday I canceled the doctor appointment thinking 
 we
inhales and went to work 
and then by Thursday afternoon was sick again 
had really bad sore throat Thursday night 
inhales went to the doctor Friday 
and the doctor sa
 yeah  you got swine flu probably 
 but since you've had it for a week there's nothing we do about it 
 so  just go home and drink liquids and chicken soup and whatever 
inhales bad sore throat Friday night 
slept all day Saturday 
slept all day Sunday 
inhales a
went to work Monda
and then still kind_of felt tired the rest of  the rest of the week 
and that shrugs was swine flu 
so  it wasn't as traumatic as I thought it would be 
but still felt like crap shrugs 
frightened or scared 
 oh  hand
and this is why probably I pass out when I have blood tests 
inhales when I was five 
and that was actually the second from last time was in the hospital 
I was six was the last time I was in the hospital 
when I was five I went to the hospital for an eye operation 
look in the camera looks
inhales anyway  um  thee 
who you_know asked the questions 
and then she said 
 we're gonna poke your finger 
 and take a blood test 
and  she reached around her neck ges
ges
and attached to the cross was a needle 
and she rubbed it with alcohol ges
and jabbed ges
and then took ges
and I just thought  you_know thinking back 
that is the most bizarre thing that can ever happen 
I_mean it can turn you off to finger
inhales finger
so  there's my fear story 
since that day I do not do blood tests 
I haven't had a blood test since  I think  I was six head
 yup my mom 
she had um CBGD  I think it is 
inhales well  it was progressive 
she started out  she said she noticed it when she was like in her mid forties 
she was like an office manager secretary and 
but you_know whatever hand
she just kind_of got on with it 
and over  th ta over time she just kind_of talked a little bit slower 
and would use you_know shorter sentences 
and um course she had the arguing with my dad dynamic ges
so  hand
 but eventually you_know it was
they didn't really diagnosis it for awhile 
and then she went to University_of_Michigan where they have this inhales um neurology or aphasia center 
some type of where they do a_lot_of research in it 
thing is she didn't like the doctor 
and she told him to  fuck off hand
inhales so  um didn't really get um the whole research thing on it 
but over time um  she you_know just got less and less communicative 
inhales uh they thought she was having mini strokes for awhile 
 a
it was actually the evening of her sister's funeral 
they went out to dinner 
inhales and she passed out 
and they rushed her to the hospital 
inhales and um  the doctor 
well  the strange thing when they rushed her to the hospital 
inhales after she woke up  that evening she was talking perfectly normal 
 I_mean it  it you_know had gone away ges
she could full sentences and  as if  if she'd  nothing happened ges
like take ges
inhales she went to bed that night 
she woke up 
and then she was back to where she was  before ges it happened 
so  noone could figure that one out 
but meanwhile the doctor pulled her driver's license because she passed out 
and you_know considered a seizure or something 
and that really pissed her off 
then she took her  my dad hadta take away the keys 
she actually used the car a few times after that until she finally gave up 
and we actually kept her car  until she died 
she  we couldn't sell her car because you_know 
 when you get better Mom you can have your car back 
but eventually she ended up losing muscle control 
and you_know she was we working with a walker 
inhales and then within a year after that she was in a wheelchair 
she was in the nursing home for about the last  year and a half 
and when she went in the nursing home she could still speak three or four  sentence or  three or four word sentences 
and towards the end she could get you_know one or two words out 
but the weird thing is she knew what was going on the whole time 
and um then eventually she died shrugs 
she just decided she was not gonna eat 
and she didn't eat 
and the last  that was it 
nyup no  it's  it's  you_know kind_of brought the whole family together 
I_mean there's funny stories about it 
I knew th she had decided not to eat 
and you_know like one of her favorite caregivers walked in the room with this huge massive breakfast because she useta love to eat 
and you_know we hadta tell her 
 nope  Jean's decided she's not eating today shrugs 
so  I_mean it was all kinds of stories about it 
but shrugs  so that's my story about that 
lib Cinderella 
inhales well  there was this little girl named Cinderella who is like  really cute little girl 
an
I think she went to the  uh the rehab center in Switzerland for like two years 
and so Cinderella inhales hadta go move in with her uh evil stepmother 
inhales and  um and her evil stepmother had  two uh other daughters 
and the evil stepmother really liked the other daughters but didn't like Cinderella 
inhales so   Cinderella and  um you_know they're just  this  this evil stepmother makes Cinderella do all the work around the house 
she's gotta clean the floors and  vacuum and do the gardening and feed the animals and cook and all that fun stuff 
inhales so  anyways  you_know  the mom and the stepgirls they're kind_of reading the mail 
a
like the prince is like this totally hot dude 
where Cinder 
it's like he is like on television all the time 
and she knows what he looks like 
and is like  really wants to dance with him and stuff 
but the evil stepmother says 
 no you're not getting a dress 
you_know  it's like you_know 
 you're a cleaning girl 
 and you stay home 
 and you_know clean the attic and stuff 
 while  me and your stepsisters we're gonna go to the ball 
so  shey 
and they get  a bunch of dresses and makeup and jewelery and new shoes and everything 
and they go out to get ready to go to the ball 
inhales meanwhile poor Cinderella she's up in the attic 
and she's crying while they're all going away 
inhales and um  she's kind_of just wishing 
 wish I could go to the mall or  to the ball 
and all_of_a_sudden um her fairy godmother appears 
and uh Brunhilda the fairy godmother inhales says 
 what's  what's the deal dyuh Cinderella 
 what are you so upset about 
and Cinderella says 
 I wish I could go to the ball because I really like this prince guy 
 and I like to dance 
 and I like to get pretty clothes on and stuff 
 but that evil stepmother of mine won't let me go 
inhales so  anyways  there's  the   the   the uh fairy godmother you_know gets out the wand and  touches Cinderella 
and all_of_a_sudden turns her rag dresses into a really pretty gown  ball gown and gives her glass slippers that are really cool looking 
inhales and then they go out in the garden 
and they dig up a pumpkin 
and she kind_of does the pumpkin 
and inhales turns the pumpkin into a carriage 
and then she turns the nasty old horse they've got in the barn into these really cool horses that pulls the buh carriage 
and  because you hafta pull up the castle in a carriage or they won't let you into the ball 
 so  anyways inhales they get into the  ksh she gets into the pumpkin 
and the fairy godmother even put some like uh air freshener in there so it didn't smell like a pumpkin 
inhales and they went to the ball 
and they got to the castle 
and they were able to sneak in 
an
and  you_know the fairy  godmo er the evil stepmother and the other evil sisters 
they're kind_of on the other side of the room and don't really notice her 
and even when they see her they don't even think it's her because she's so pretty 
inhales anyways the prince comes in 
and inhales  you_know they have the dance 
and they're all dancing around 
and he inhales uh sees Cinderella kind_of hanging out in the corner with some of the other girls and says 
 I don't know who you are 
 who you 
and she s 
 well  I'm Cinderella 
inhales and he says 
 well  would you like to dance 
inhales and she says 
 well  I don't  not sure  I'm not sure I know how to dance but I'd love to try 
inhales but she doesn't really know that the stepmother  th er the uh fairy godmother  put a spell on the shoes 
so  anyone in the shoes can like dance like magic 
like and on top of that  the shoes will only fit Cinderella 
so  like Cinderella dances really well 
inhales and of_course the prince falls in love with her 
and you_know they talk schmoozy things 
and they're already talking about having kids 
and inhales  you_know kind of car should they get 
and what's she gonna to when she turns queen and stuff 
and inhales they're gonna get married 
but  then Cinderella finally remembers that the fairy godmother warned her that all the stuff turns back to what it useta be at midnight 
 inhales except for the shoes for some reason but they never told her that 
but  the pumpkin turns into a pumpkin 
and the horse turns into an ugly horse 
and the dress turns into rags at midnight 
and the clock starts chiming so they go running away 
or she runs the downstairs 
and runs home 
and she gets like around the corner just in time when all her clothes turn to rags 
inhales and the prince is like totally dumbfounded 
it's like 
 whoa this babe was for me 
 and all_of_a_sudden she's gone 
inhales so  he's like in a total state of depression 
meanwhile  his father's like saying 
 you gotta marry one of these other  two ges
because you_know she's got lots of money 
inhales and the prince says 
 no way 
 I'm gonna go look for her 
so  anyways inhales he finds one  er one of her shoes 
 and inhales goes to every house in the village 
and makes all the girls try it on 
he's a prince so he can make people do things like that  you_know 
inhales so  anyways  he finds Cinderella 
knocks on the door inhales and 
actually  Cinderella doesn't answer the door the sisters do 
an
 well  we'll try it on 
and it turns out like one sister wears like a size fifteen 
and the other sister inhales has shoes so big that they hafta be custom made 
inhales and then the mom even tr or  the stepmom even tries to try them on 
and course her feet have got big corns so she can't try them on 
inhales then Cinderella inhales she's like hiding in the back 
kind_of quivering while the  you_know this is all going on 
and the prince sees her and says 
 inhales you look kind_of like her except you look kind_of dumpy today 
 looks like your dress is gone 
 but why don't you try this on 
inhales and she comes out 
and the stepmother says 
 no  get back there 
and the prince says 
 no  she's trying it on or you're going to jail  lady 
 so  just shut up 
inhales so  Cinderella tries the schipper 
inhales and then when she turns the slipper on 
inhales this is me adlibbing 
it's not part of the story 
but all_of_a_sudden the dress comes back on 
the prince sees her 
and they hug and kiss 
inhales and they get married in the cathedral in the big city 
and they live happily ever after 
 okay  let's  well  let's see if we can throw some humor into this tragedy here 
we had  oh  it looks like we had two people that were going for a drive 
and they saw a wash 
and they decided to drive their big four wheel drive through it 
because they're really cool 
and they can do these things 
and of_course the four wheel drive got run over 
and they uh got washed off the truck and into the flood 
and fortunately while they were doing this they just happened to have a life jacket in the truck 
so  they grab that on 
and it ooks 
and she is um  holding on to him 
and hopefully the police are gonna come and rescue them 
or it could be that this guy's actually a fireman trying to rescue her 
and she was the one that drove the truck into the wash 
can't say for sure but 
inhales looks like they're hanging on to the tree 
and you_know maybe they're going to make it maybe they're not 
but  well let's assume that they do 
they do make it 
and they   Sheriff Joe arrests them for five thousand dollar fine for doing the stupid driver law 
driving through a middle of a wash 
but th after that they live happily ever after 
okay  it looks like 
let's get a name for this stupid looking kid here 
Reginald 
Reginald decides he's gonna go out to play 
so  he goes out in the front garden 
and he's playing with his football 
soccer's what they call it in America 
and he's not very skilled because he's an American 
and he's not like British or German or anything 
and he kicks it in the window of uh his neighbor 
and uh kid's actually pretty 
well  a doesn't  s don't see the kid anywhere 
looks like the kid ran away 
inhales so  looks like the neighbor's really pissed off because the window  it not only came through his window 
broke his lamp 
and he's looking out the window to seeing if the kid is going to confess up to it or run away 
and well we just don't know what happened 
whether that happened 
inhales let's assume the worst 
and let's say that the
and stecide 
and calls the cop in 
let's get Sheriff Joe in this again 
and the kid come 
Sheriff Doe 
turns out the kid's an illegal immigrant and gets deported 
life's hard but that's it is 
 well  it looks like 
oh  let's get a kid for this  name for this stupid looking little kid here 
oh  we'll name him after my nephew Eric 
looks like Eric is gonna go to school 
and his mom of_course is saying 
 you know what 
 I think it's time that you take the umbrella 
 because I'm guessing it's gonna rain out 
inhales and he says 
 no  Mom  I don't want the umbrella imit
anyways  somehow he gets out_of the house 
mom forces him to take the umbrella 
but then he hides it underneath the  inhales the  uh the car 
and he goes off to school 
and guess what 
of_course mom is right 
inhales and it starts raining 
and so he kind_of like gets halfway to school 
and then he comes running home to mom crying because he's all wet 
and mom kind_of gives him a lecture 
and doesn't let him have 
you_know  she actually reaches into his backpack and takes out the wa brownie she'd given him take for dessert at lunch and says 
 no  you can't have any brownies you naughty little kid 
inhales and gives him the umbrella 
and makes him go back to school 
and poor Eric then hasta go to school without any brownies because he didn't listen head
