oh okay 
first you take two pieces of bread 
and you get out the peanut butter and a knife 
and you smear the peanut butter on one side of the bread 
and then you get out the jelly and a knife 
and smear the jelly on the other side of the bread 
then you take the ges
and that's your sandwich 
um you dig a hole in the soil 
and then you take the flower out_of its pot 
and you hafta loosen the roots 
and if you want you can put Miracle_Grow laughs underneath 
I love gardening 
and you put the flower in the hole 
and then you fill it back up with dirt 
and then you water it 
it is the little boy's birthday 
he's having his birthday party today 
but the dog found the cake 
and ate a big chunk out_of the cake 
and left caky doggie footprints laughs all the way under the couch 
the mother is ma
she's got the broom 
I think she's gonna hit the dog if it comes out from under the couch which is probably why it's hiding 
and in the meantime the birthday guests have arrived 
so  they are coming in with their presents um seeing a  a mangled cake for the birthday 
oh  and it looks like the little boy is crying 
um okay  so  I was hospitalized well sort_of um in November for abdominal surgery 
and um I was really nervous when I went in because I have never been under general anesthesia before 
but it kicked in really fast 
like they tell you to take three deep breaths 
and you get halfway through the first one and you black out 
um and it was kind_of like taking a long blink 
and then I opened my eyes 
and it was like three hours later 
which was really strange because usually like you_know when you sleep you can feel time passing 
like it didn't feel like any time had passed 
so  it was a little bit of a adjustment for my brain to realize that you_know three hours had gone by 
everything was all over with 
um and then I was on pain meds 
I stayed overnight 
um and then I went home 
I was on pain meds 
um but then I  I was able to go off of those 
um I'm not sure what else you wanna know about it laughs 
um no not off hand 
um okay  so  I had a gal in my dance group who was not a good communicator 
um she would hold things in 
and you_know you could just feel the energy that she was upset 
but um she wouldn't talk about it 
I asked her on numerous occasions to  you_know if we could talk about it or if something was bothering her 
she always said 
 no 
um and then um she kind_of passively aggressively started you_know not participating in things or you_know just kind_of being rude  I guess laughs 
so  it finally you_know broke my last little straw 
and I yelled at her one day 
and kicked her out_of the group 
so  laughs that's what I did about it laughs 
okay  well  I'm afraid of heights 
even little heights 
even just climbing up a few steps on a ladder 
so  I decided uh one year to get my boyfriend a sky diving um you_know thing  you_know jump  I guess that's what you call it a jump  for his birthday 
and then I decided that it might be fun if I tried it too 
and maybe it would get me over my fear of heights 
so  we went sky diving 
and it was terrifying 
and when I  when we jumped out_of the plane you_know you're attached to someone else 
so  when we jumped out_of the plane and we were free falling I stopped breathing for like an entire minute laughs while we were free falling because I was just like ges
um and then the parachute opens 
and then you start gliding which is kind of nice 
that was  that was better 
it was a little bit more like being a bird you_know and flying 
um so  that was nice for a little bit 
and then we landed 
and then that was that 
and I said I'm glad I did it 
and I'll never do it again laughs 
and I'm still afraid of heights laughs 
um so  the story starts with the flood 
there's lots and lots of rain which is flooding out the city 
and the woman has gotten caught in the flood probably because she went looking for her cat  um to save her cat from the flood and the rains 
so  she got caught in the flood 
she got swept downstream 
and she was able to catch herself on a tree limb sticking out 
and she's been hanging there waiting for someone to come save her 
um someone saw her 
called the fire department 
and now the  the firemen are there 
and one of them has made his way out to the water with a life vest on 
and is probably gonna try and strap her to him I think that's what that looks like  uh to get her out_of the water 
and that's the end 
okay  the boy is playing soccer outside 
he kicks the ball really hard 
it goes crashing into the window 
um it crashes through the window into the lamps  m
um he jumps up 
he grabs the ball 
and he is looking out the window to see who kicked it 
yep 
the boy is leaving for school 
and his mom is telling him to take the umbrella 
it might rain 
and he says 
head
 I'll be fine 
 bye mom 
so  he leaves 
he goes outside 
and it's sprinkling a little bit 
and then it's r
and there's puddles all over 
and mom was right 
so  he's running back home in the rain 
he comes home all sopping wet 
and the mom has the I told you so look on her face 
and he gets the umbrella 
and leaves again for school with the umbrella 
okay  well  the father his wife dies 
and he is left in the care of his um single daughter 
and he remarries 
and he remarries um uh evil  but ee she becomes the evil stepmother to Cinderella 
and she has two spoiled mean little daughters of her own 
and they live together 
and the stepmother and the two sisters make Cinderella do all the cleaning and all the housework while they primp and preen 
and the dad is kind_of nowhere in this part of the story  laughs laughs 
and then um there's  Cinderella  let's see Cinderella makes friends with the mice by keeping the big fat mean cat away from them 
and she can look out her window and see the castle where the prince lives which is her dream 
so  then we move to the castle where the prince his father the king is telling him he must get married 
and he must have a ball to find his wife 
so  they send out invitations to  around the town 
and the stepmother gets the invitation 
and then all the girls are so excited to go the ball and try and become the wife of the prince 
so  they get ready 
Cinderella has the  the mice and the birds help make her a beautiful dress 
and she gets dressed and comes down to go the the ball with them 
but her sister's say no she can't go 
she hasta stay and clean 
and they rip her dress 
she goes back up to her room crying while her sisters and  stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball 
um then the  fair her fairy godmother appears 
and says she will create  the pumpkin coach and a dress for her to go to the ball 
but she has back by midnight or she'll turn back into her rags and the coach turns back into a pumpkin 
so  and she gets glass slippers 
so  she goes to the ball in her little glass slippers 
and the prince sees her and falls in love with her and dances with her 
and her stepmother and the sisters don't know who she is because she looks so different 
and then it gets to be midnight 
and she says 
 oh  I needta go home 
so  she runs away from the prince 
and in running away she loses one of her glass slippers on the stairs 
and she runs home 
and the  her dress turns back to rags 
and the coach turns back to the pumpkin 
but she still has her glass slipper 
then the next day the prince sends out um someone to fit the glass slipper on all the women's feet to find out who his princess that he fell in love with was 
so  they show up with the slipper at her house 
and the stepmother locks her in the room  locks Cinderella in the room 
and they try and fit the slipper on the stepsister's feet which it doesn't fit because they have big feet 
and the mice steal the key and bring it in to Cinderella so she can escape her room 
and she runs down and tries on the glass slipper 
and lo_and_behold it fits 
so  they bring her back to the prince 
and they get married 
and they live happily ever after 
um the little girl's pet cat is stuck up in the tree 
she's gotten off her tricycle and is concerned 
jumping up and down trying to get the cat to come down 
the father decides to help 
so  he gets the ladder 
climbs up the tree 
and gets stuck on the branch because the ladder falls down 
and the dog is barking at him 
and is probably going to bite him when he comes down 
um but in the meantime the fire department is coming 
they're on their way with the ladder to come save both the man and the cat
