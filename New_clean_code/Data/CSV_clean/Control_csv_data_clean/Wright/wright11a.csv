okay 
the mouse family were sitting at home over the weekend and decided to go out for a picnic 
so  they all got in the red truck to head out to the park 
all the children were in the back and the parents were in the front 
and they're going down the dirt road on their way to the park when little Suzy mouse falls out_of the back and nobody sees her 
she sees the car driving off in the distance as she's laying in the   in the dirt road wondering if they're gonna notice and come back for her 
meanwhile  the family makes it to the park and they unpack the truck 
all the kids hop out and start playing 
mom and dad set up the picnic 
the kids start playing by the water and picking flowers 
and mom and dad sit and watch the family play 
enjoying their picnic 
poor little Suzy mouse is still sitting by the road wondering when her family will realize she's missing and come back for her 
she decides to go  walk she  de she decides to go walking towards  down the path to see if she can find them 
the  w the weeds are really tall 
she's starting to feel lonely and lost 
at the park the family's been there for awhile 
it's time to eat so mom's gathering up everyone to come eat their picnic 
at the same time little Suzy mouse is getting hungry so she finds some berries 
she's in the   she's in the weeds eating the little raspberries 
mom and dad mouse at the picnic realize that one of their children are missing 
they got everyone rounded up for the picnic and they can't find little Suzy mouse 
so  everyone starts to look for her 
nobody can find her 
she's not by the lake 
she's not over by the rocks 
they're looking over by the weeds 
they can't find her anywhere 
so  they all decide to gather up and see if they can backtrack to find her on the path that they took to the picnic 
and Suzy mouse is again leaning in the weeds wondering when she'll see her family again 
as the family heads back down the dirt road that they took they're calling out her name 
looking for little Suzy mouse 
trying to hear if she'll call back 
little Suzy mouse thinks she hears something 
so  she gets up and walks back the way she came towards the dirt road 
and up in the distance coming over the hill she sees her family in the  in the red truck 
she starts jumping up and down 
 I'm over here 
 I'm over here 
the family comes up to her and they all jump out_of the red truck 
and come up and hug her 
but then she realizes she left her little pink stuffed animal behind 
she can't remember where she left it 
so  she runs in back in the weeds where she was 
and then she finds it 
and they all go back to the picnic area and they enjoy their picnic together

 look after the baby Carl 
 I'll be back shortly 
Carl the dog sees mom walk out the door and down the sidewalk 
once she has left the house he goes over to baby's crib 
and baby cr climbs over the rail and steps on Carl's back 
Carl takes baby out_of the room 
goes into mom's room 
they jump up and down on the bed 
roll around on the big comfy sheets 
then Carl takes baby over to the dresser 
as baby powders Carl's nose 
then they try on mom's jewelry and her hankie 
they laugh at themselves in the mirror 
they decide to check out the laundry chute and see what's down there 
baby falls down the laundry chute 
Carl runs down to the basement to see where he ended up 
he ended up in a pile of laundry safe and sound 
Carl picks him back up 
runs up the stairs 
runs around the living room 
papers flying everywhere 
then they're ch  checking out the fish tank 
and Carl decides to put baby in there and see if he can swim 
baby goes for a swim in the fish tank 
Carl decides now it's time to really have fun and play some music 
so  they dance around the living room 
then it seems baby's getting hungry 
so  they go to the refrigerator to see what they have 
Carl finds a  some bread and butter 
thinks that they can make him a sandwich 
then he finds some grapes 
a little chocolate milk would go good with that 
maybe a cookie for dessert 
after lunch in a nice mess they go upstairs to the bathroom and take a nice warm bath 
Carl soaps up the washcloth 
cleans baby of all the peanut butter and jelly and chocolate 
and he dries him off with a blow dryer 
gets him back in his crib 
runs downstairs 
cleans up the food mess 
licks up the  the milk 
looks out the window to see if mom's coming yet

so  he goes to make the bed 
puts the powder away 
just in time 
when he looks out the door  the window again here comes mom right up the sidewalk 
goes into the baby's room 
baby's nice safe and sound in the crib 
he lays down and in comes mom

and we s laid out a blanket so we could sit and watch the fireworks when the sun went down 
in the meantime we brought some glowsticks 
um for  glowstick bracelets to put on our wrists and to give to some of the kids 
so  we bought probably a dozen of them 
or maybe two  two each and gave the rest away to some of the kids around us 
the kids really enjoyed it 
um we watched a_lot of the kids playing around 
people with their dogs 
once the fireworks started we stayed for a little while and watched the fireworks 
we left before they ended so_that we could avoid traffic 
um once we got down to our car 
I like to take pictures so I decided to stay until the end to see if I could get any good photos of the fireworks 
and I ended up with a few good ones 
so  I got to post them on  on my website 
and that was it 
then we went home still avoiding traffic

as they laughed and walked out the door and headed to the ball without her 
Cinderella was so upset that she couldn't go to the ball any longer 
and she sat outside and cried
