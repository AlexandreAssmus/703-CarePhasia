okay  it looks like they have problems with their pets 
and I have a cat 
so  I know that cats climb anywhere 
and all_of_a_sudden it's in a high tree 
and it doesn't look like the cat is stressed 
but the kids are s or  the little girl is stressed 
so  Daddy went up into the tree to try to get the cat 
but I don't think he's able to 
so  he calls the firemen 
and the firemen look like they're going to get the cat down 
and I'm just gonna assume that they got the cat down 
and the little kid is gonna be so excited 
and they probably hafta also get the daddy down 
and they live happily ever after laughs 
okay  you take the  the loaf of bread 
and you open the bag 
and take two slices out 
you get your peanut butter jar 
you unscrew it 
and you get your knife 
and take out the peanut butter 
and put peanut butter on both sides of the bre I mean  on one side ges
so_that both ges
and then you get your favorite jelly 
and you do the same thing 
and then you put them together 
and serve it 
and eat happily ever laughs after 
well  I  clears
and when I found out I had breast cancer 
which runs very prominently in my family 
um my husband um said 
 we're gonna whip this thing 
and so I had a mastectomy 
and I was in the hospital less than twenty four hours 
and then when I had a recurrence three years later my husband said 
 we're going off to war again 
 and we're gonna beat it 
and then when I had it the third time he said the same thing 
and what I remember mostly is that I was trying to be strong for my husband 
and my husband was b trying to be strong for me 
so  we always had a positive attitude 
and we  uh we never thought negatively 
and through prayer we went through it with flying colors 
yes 
okay  well  my mother was eighty nine when she had her s breast cancer 
and she came through that fine 
but then after that  a couple of months after that she had several little ministrokes 
and so she herself said 
 I would like to go into the nursing home to rehab 
and she was living by herself at the time 
and so she
and so we decided to move her to a nursing home in  near my sister in Dallas 
and so then I went there once a month to visit her 
and after about a year she was not able to communicate very well 
she um she would start sentences 
and never be able to finish them 
and she would say 
 would you 
and then she wouldn't be able to  to finish the sentence 
so  it was very difficult for us because we wanted to do whatever she wanted  us to do 
but we didn't really know what to do 
so  the only thing my sister and I did was we just um smiled big because she was legally blind and legally deaf 
so  we talked slowly and loudly 
and we always had a big smile on our faces 
and um we just showed her that we cared 
and we would always um read her mail to her 
and we knew two favorite people of hers 
so  we would always read those uh more than once 
and we would just be very cheerful whenever we were there to see her 
okay   um clears_throat when I was working for this man he was the  um he was a member of Young_Presidents_Organization 
and it was made up of presidents from around the world 
and they had um a  not a seminar but a  um they called it a university 
and it was like a week long 
and it would always be one would be in the United_States 
and the second one of the year would be outside the United_States 
and this year it was going to be in San_Francisco 
and um it'll be twenty years ago next month 
and um my boss was in charge of the extracurricular activities in the evening 
and so he allowed me to go with him because I did a_lot of the background work 
and my sister met me there instead of Don going with me because it was going to be a working uh week 
and so Don stayed here 
and my sister from Dallas uh flew in 
and that was the week that they had the San_Francisco earthquake 
and um so we were at Fisherman's_Wharf because that was our one evening that we had free 
and um we were waiting to go uh on the trolley cart back to um Saint_Francis  the Westin_Saint_Francis 
and as we're waiting in line the earthquake hit 
and um it's really funny because we've never been in anything like that 
and so my sister  just being the big sister she always tried to calm me down 
and she said 
 that was probably a two or three 
and how she came up with that I have no idea because we never were in an earthquake so we didn't know 
but that was just her way of saying it's a minor thing 
well  the electricity was off so nothing worked 
and so we walked eighteen blocks backs to our hotel 
and um in San_Francisco you_know it's pretty hilly ges
and so um I_mean it was  it was uh quite a jog back there 
and they were not allowing anybody to go back into the hotel 
so  we sat outside this big uh park area um for a couple of hours before they allowed us to go back in 
and uh the first thing that my sister and I wanted to do was 
we were concerned about mother hearing about this earthquake and knowing that her two daughters were there 
and we wanted to also call our two husbands 
and so by the time we got back into the hotel we quickly called mother who never watches news 
she doesn't like to hear uh the bad news 
and there's hardly any good news that's told 
so  we knew that she probably wouldn't be watching and know 
but my sister said 
 mother what are you doing 
and she said 
 well  I'm watching the news because soandso told me that there was a big earthquake in San_Francisco 
so  this lady had no idea that her two girls were in San Francisco 
so  it was a_lot_of  fear at the beginning 
we were on the nineteenth floor 
so  we hadta walk up to the nineteenth floor 
and then walk down with our luggage 
so  it was just uh the fear of the unknown 
and not knowing if we're gonna be able to fly out because maybe the  the airline canceled the flight or whatever 
but both of our flights were fine 
and we made it home okay 
and our families were okay laughs 
okay 
first of all it looks like there has been um a weather change 
and so whatever the girl was doing at the beginning I would say she was 
I can't tell if it's a young girl or if it's a young lady 
so  I'm  whatever she was doing I think it's 
she was  riding her bicycle 
I'm going to say it's a young girl riding a bicycle 
and she  the weather came up quickly 
and it looks like it is flooding the roadway 
and perhaps she was um I'm just gonna say a  on a bicycle 
and so it washed her haway 
and uh  she's very frightened and concerned and scared and  all other emotions  negative emotions 
and this one 
it might be a firefighter  or whatever rescuer is coming 
uh it looks like she mighta been holding on to a tree limb 
and he is  he's got his lifejacket on 
and so he is coming to rescue the little girl 
and being that he's a professional rescuer of one way or another 
um the family and the girl are just totally relieved when she gets brought to dry land 
okay 
this young boy is practicing soccer 
and as happens most of the time or  many of the times with young kids playing in the neighborhood 
um whether it's baseball or  or golf or a soccer ball 
it goes in a way that it shouldn't have gone 
so  he's kicking this soccer ball 
and it accidently crashes through a window 
I'm going to say it's a neighbor's window 
and all_of_a_sudden it 
the neighbor is sitting in a chair 
and this ball comes through 
and knocks over a lamp 
and then he goes with the ball in his hand to the window 
and is looking outside the broken window to the young man 
and being that it's a neighbor I think that he knows that accidents do happen 
and he's not happy what happened 
but he's understandable  u understanding that it was just an accident 
and is not going to be upset with the boy 
but is just going to tell him 
 just be careful the next time 
well   little boy is  is with his mom 
and his mom is  sort_of insisting that he  ta even_though it's not raining at the moment that rain is in the forecast 
and he should take this umbrella 
head
they'd rather have the rain probably and play in the rain 
but he's insisting that he does not wanna take the umbrella 
so  as he's walking 
looks like to school because he's got a backpack on 
uh it starts raining 
it's okay at the very beginning because it's just drizzling 
but then all_of_a_sudden it is really coming down 
so he's  you can see the puddles on the ground 
so  he's trying to cover his head with his hand 
and he's turned around to go back home 
and he comes in 
and he's very sad because he's soaked 
and his mother looks at him 
and is disappointed that he didn't take the umbrella 
but now he realizes that his mother was right 
and he should've taken the umbrella 
and he goes out using the umbrella 
and though it's pouring down rain he's now keeping dry 
okay  the story of Cinderella 
I've forgotten some of it but anyway 
um it's a story of a family that has  mother that has three daughters 
two seem to be uh mean sisters to their one sister who is Cinderella 
they always have fun 
and they dress up 
they go places 
um she is left  Cinderella is left to do the chores the hard work 
feeding the animals cooking cleaning the house 
um then they get an invitation to a ball 
the prince has invited everybody to come to the ball 
and so they're all excited because they're gonna go to the ball 
well  Cinderella gets dressed 
and her sisters get dressed 
and they take some of their things that she was going to wear  for themselves 
and so now Cinderella really doesn't wanna go because she doesn't look pretty 
and so the other two sisters go to the ball 
and then all_of_a_sudden the fairy godmother comes 
and says 
 you're going to the ball 
and waves her magic wand 
and Cinderella looks beautiful 
and so she has a carriage with horses that take her to the ball 
and she has on beautiful silver slippers 
and so all_of_a_sudden she gets to the ball 
and uh the prince dances with her 
and she says  all_of_a_sudden it's midnight 
and if she doesn't get out by midnight the carriage will turn into a pumpkin 
so  she runs away from the prince 
and gets into the uh carriage 
and somehow she lost her one shoe 
the prince finds the shoe 
and they try to find the person that this shoe fits 
and he has help 
other people are helping him 
and so finally they  they try to fit the shoe on the two mean sisters 
head
but then they said 
 there was one other person here 
and Cinderella  it fit Cinderella 
and so the prince takes Cinderella 
and lives happily ever after
