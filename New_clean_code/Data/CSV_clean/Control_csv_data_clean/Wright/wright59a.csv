well  you go to the cabinet 
get the peanut butter and the jelly 
the jelly's usually in the refrigerator 
and a slice of bread 
and uh put the jelly and the peanut butter on the bread 
and fold it over 
and eat it laughs 
the cat went up the tree because it was chased by the dog 
and the dad said 
 well  
to the little girl because she was crying her cat was out in the tree 
 I will get the cat down for you 
so  the dad got up on the ladder to get up  get up the tree to get the cat 
but the ladder fell down 
and so here  the dog  the dog is uh barking at the tree to get the cat 
the dad is uh caught up in one of the limbs without a ladder to get down 
so  the police  the firemen have been called 
and they're coming in to bring another ladder  to get the dad and the cat down and keep the little girl happy 
and um there is a bird singing in the tree 
so  the bird is happy 
so  it all ends when the firemen get uh the dad and the cat down 
okay   I think one of the most serious things that happened to me was I had Guillain_Barre syndrome 
and that's a type of uh  paralyzing 
it's kind_of  g it's  I think it was called French polio because the men were f from France 
and uh I was on a vacation out over in San_Diego with friends 
and I started having numbness in my hands and my feet 
and uh I was stumbling 
I was having a hard time walking 
and I knew something was wrong 
and I just  uh I really kind_of thought it was fate 
I thought maybe I'd a brain tumor or something really pretty serious 
but my daughter was with me 
and we had planned on going to uh Universal_Studios 
and I wasn't in pain 
so  but I was just having a hard time walking 
Guillain_Barre starts at your fingers and toes 
and then works  works in 
so  I can't  I can remember this going to Universal_Studios in a wheelchair laughs 
so  by that evening by the time we all go back to th  our hotel I was really uh quite concerned 
I did sleep 
and the next morning they took me to uh Scripps_Medical_Center in the San_Diego area 
and the doctor almost immediately diagnosed it because Guillain_Barre um a affects  it's  it's a autoimmune disease 
and he asked me if I had had the flu recently 
and I had 
and so the  the antibodies that attack your flu attack your own system 
and this was what was happening 
so  they told  first they wanted to admit me to the hospital 
and I said 
 no way 
I  w laughs I was going back ta 
uh oh  and they did  cer they asked me to like shuffle a deck of cards 
I couldn't do that 
m and uh snap ges
I couldn't do that 
so  uh got back in the car with my friends 
and uh my daughter was with us 
and uh he said 
 if you have trouble breathing 
because it can go all the way in 
it's  uh you_know affects your  mus affects your muscles 
 to um find the nearest hospital 
but I got back home 
and uh it took me about oh six weeks to really feel like I was on my way to recovery 
for about six weeks I couldn't drive the car 
I couldn't  uh I could feed myself but I couldn't cut ges
I could shower but I couldn't ges
I had no strength in my hands or my feet 
I couldn't uh stand on my toes 
any of that kind of thing 
so then I started  i it  wherever it goes you_know ges
and then it stops and it's just  your body stops  starts healing again 
then it was a slow uh recovery 
I would start walking just out around the block a little bit 
but I do remember the first time I went to a grocery store with my sister 
she was living with us at the time 
and I just felt like an old lady 
and this was  over  twenty years ago 
so  I was in my forties 
and I was just holding ges
and I was just afraid of someone knocking me over 
but it  uh I recovered 
I still have a little weakness occasionally in my hands 
I  I can occasionally have a hand tremor 
but I feel like I'm ninety nine percent  better 
so  that was it laughs 
yeah 
oh yes 
well  okay 
uh my mother who I lost about a year and a half ago had Alzheimer's 
so  we went through this process 
and um uh she was oh about eighty when we first 
and it was kind_of interesting 
my daughter 
like I said my kids come just every other year for Christmas 
and my daughter from California was home 
and within two hours 
they were all at my house 
Susie came up to me and said 
 Mother something is wrong with Grandma 
and we had noticed a little bit 
but it  it just got worse and worse 
and then  then uh my mom and dad were in assisted living out in Fountain_Hills 
then we lost dad 
so  we put mom into a  n uh a nursing home uh up in Flagstaff where my sister lives 
and she was up there for four years 
and at first she could talk 
she went through all the different stations  stay uh uh stations of you_know aggression and meanness 
and she would call me or dad would actually because she couldn't really dial 
but dad would call 
and she'd grab the phone and accuse me of coming into the middle of the night and taking her clothes 
and she was much thinner than I was so 
or taking money 
dad would call and   hiding in the garage and this mother who's mak uh maybe a hundred and ten pounds at the most you_know 
he was kind_of frightened of her because she got really mean 
but then she got back into a very calm  uh state 
and uh slowly  began to really make no sense whatsoever 
but I've  I learned 
and  and Dad and I went to a Alzheimer's support group which really really helped us 
a especially dad 
and um because my mom had done everything 
I_mean she had been the one to do all the shopping send out the cards 
and I remember the first year I went over and helped him send out Christmas cards 
but uh finally there was a point where  uh when dad died that she needed full care 
so  and the last six months she  she couldn't talk or do anything 
sh and she broke her hip had a fall 
and the saddest thing was that up until the last year she was very  physically very healthy 
so  she died at age eighty seven 
 so  that's my story laughs on that 
uh
so   sighs 
I guess l a long time ago 
 xxx 
tell me the story start from the beginning  
I was in an er er earthquake  in California 
and one of the major ones 
this was in  the fifties 
and uh it was  it  it was  uh we were visiting my dad's aunt or  my dad's sister my aunt out in California 
and it happened in the middle of the night 
and it was  uh it  it's listed 
I think it was maybe a seven pointer  something 
I_mean it  the house was definitely laughs moving 
the bed was moving 
I was uh sharing a bed with my cousin 
and uh when I woke up at first I just thought she was shaking the bed around 
but it was dark 
it was early early morning 
and so there was a_lot_of flashing because the transformer's going off 
and uh ma uh my aunt and uncle had a  a doorbell chime 
the kinds that two hang ges
and ges
so  uh we were up for the rest of the morning 
this probably happened  oh five o'clock in the morning something like that 
there were a_lot_of tremors afterwards 
and uh I remember back then  in the fifties the newspapers useta do extras 
and there was an extra out that day on the earthquake 
so  it was  it was a_little frightening at the time because you just don't know what's going on 
so  it scared me 
but I haven't had too much to frighten me in my life 
yeah laughs 
well  there was a flash flood in the deserts of Arizona which happens frequently 
and people are a_little careless 
and they think they can drive their car out through this dry wash bed that all_of_a_sudden has a trickle of water 
and they get their car out there 
and the trickle becomes a flood 
and they hafta get out_of their car 
and they are standing on the roof 
and the paramedics  uh the or  the uh firemen come 
the rescue people come 
and the little girl ca falls off of the car into the raging flood waters 
and she's holding onto a branch 
and the uh firemen come out and rescue her 
she's extremely scared 
the boy is playing soccer out at his yard 
and he kicks the ball 
and it breaks one of the windows 
and it lands in the living room where the dad is sitting 
it breaks the window 
but it also breaks the lamp 
and the dad  gets up 
and holds the soccer ball 
and looks out the window 
and is yelling out to the boy 
 get in here right away 
the little boy is going off to school 
he walks to school 
and his mother says 
 well  it looks like it might rain today 
 you better take the umbrella 
and he said 
 oh  no I don't need an umbrella 
 I  d I  I don't think it's going to rain 
so  off he goes with his backpack 
and sure enough it starts raining 
and he gets soaking wet 
it's raining very very hard 
and he runs back to the house 
and  and looks at his mother 
and he is soaking wet 
and the mother is a_little disgruntled at him for not taking the umbrella 
but she gives him the umbrella 
and back out he goes to school with the umbrella keeping him dry
