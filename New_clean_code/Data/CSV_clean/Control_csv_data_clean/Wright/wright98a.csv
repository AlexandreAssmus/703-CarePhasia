and I ha have a_lot_of comedy gifts too 
so  um even if somebody doesn't speak English I  I can make them laugh even_though 
so  I've kinda been able to communicate without speaking 
so  that  that's always made me feel good that I can communicate with somebody who um doesn't  doesn't understand English
