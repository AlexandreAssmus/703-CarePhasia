she went to get her dad who climbed in the tree to rescue the cat but ended up getting stuck 
then his dog started barking at him because he wanted him to come down ges
the girl calls the firefighters who hafta come and rescue the dad and rescue the dog 
well  last summer I broke  ges I like shattered my ankle and the top of my foot playing soccer 
like we were  um ges there was really tall grass off to the side of the soccer field 
and somebody had laid 
there was like cement ges 
but they dumped ges
and the grass grew ges
and the ball like fingers
and I thought it was clear 
and I kicked it like full speed arm
and it was really super painful 
like I thought I was gonna die 
but I hadta get it like casted up for like two and a half months 
um I_mean like haunted houses and stuff 
you_know just the  the usual 
nothing life threatening 
um no  not really 
I_mean fear for my 
maybe when I was a kid  I guess 
like I  the first time I stayed home by myself it was kind_of scary 
but I just ran next door to my neighbor's house 
um shakes
it was the middle of the day 
my mom like just went to the store 
and I was just watching tv 
and I thought I heard somebody at the front door 
and like I opened it and noone was there 
and so I was just like 
 oh_man  forget this 
so  I just ran to my friend's house next door 
mhm 
uh one of my friends is deaf 
uh yeah 
well  he can read lips but he's like not  he can't speak 
like his English is like or  just communicating is like super bad 
so  he writes a_lot 
and like um you just learn a little bit of sign language or you just kind_of learn from like body movements and stuff 
like I definitely don't know sign language so it  def you_know it does make uh a problem 
like he can  I can talk to him 
and he'll know what's going on 
but it'll take like a little bit for him to communicate with me mostly like just through  through like body language really 
it's like  shakes
I just  it's not that hard 
okay  so  this kid's playing football 
and he accidentally hits  like kicks the ball too hard 
and it goes through his neighbor's window 
and the guy sees it 
and at first he's upset raises
but then he realizes he's playing football 
and he's like 
 oh  I wanna go play with him 
okay  I'm ready 
okay 
uh so  a mom is telling her son that he  it's gonna rain today so he needs to take an umbrella 
and he says he doesn't wanna take it because it doesn't look cool 
so  he starts walking to school 
and it starts to downpour 
so  he runs back to his house 
and he tells his mom  he's like 
 you were right 
 I need an umbrella 
so  she gives him one and he walks to school 
okay  so  Cinderella starts 
uh there's three sisters 
I don't know if they're all three sisters 
but I know there's three girls that live under one house 
two of them the mother f
and the other one they make her like do all the chores 
um so  they make her  I think they make her live downstairs 
and she makes friends with m
um twirls
oh s stepsisters 
they're stepsisters laughs 
and um clasps
I know like one day there's like a party 
like the prince is having a party 
and he invites everybody but doesn't invite 
or  he invites everybody but they don't tell Cinderella about this party 
and the evil stepsisters go because they wanna marry him 
and then  her fairy godmother ges pops up and says 
 you can go to this party 
 all you hafta do is be back by midnight 
um so  she gives her a pumpkin that she turns into a coach 
and she turns the mice into horses  I think 
uh and so they all go 
the prince falls in love with her at the party 
but uh she hasta leave by midnight because then she turns back into ges like her normal self 
and it turns into a pumpkin 
as she's running away she loses her glass slipper on one of the steps 
so  she goes home 
okay  and he doesn't know who she is 
and then he like puts a decree out 
he wants to find all the girls uh in the  like the area who fit this glass slipper 
so  he goes house to house 
and he's  I think the two other sisters try on the glass slipper and doesn't fit 
but then she comes out and they try it on 
and then she turns into the princess again 
and they get married 
and live happily every after 
I think that's how it goes
