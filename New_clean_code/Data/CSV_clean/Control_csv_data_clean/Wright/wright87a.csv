alright peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
um you'd start with two pieces of bread 
and you'd get out your peanut butter and jelly and a butter knife 
and you put peanut butter on one piece of bread 
and then you put jelly 
ges
then you claps put the pieces together and cut it in half 
okay  I've been pretty lucky that I have not had a whole lot of problems 
but when I was thirteen um right before uh like the end of the school year I went to a pool party 
and I got hit into the face with one of those ges
and somebody ges
and  and it landed right here points
and I hadta go to the emergency room 
and ges
luckily nothing was broken 
but I ended up going to a um plastic surgeon and having points
and I had two enormous ges
so 
absolutely 
okay  sighs this is actually  I like this story 
I_mean now I like this story 
so  my husband and I had gone to Washington_D_C and we were visiting a friend 
and we had um gone to a bar and played pool and met up with some of my friend's friends 
and he was walking his date back to her car and we were waiting at the top of the hill for him 
he got about halfway up the hill 
and two guys like ran across the street and just started beating up on him 
so  my husband and I we go running down there 
I am on the phone with nineoneone 
my husband kinda jumps in ends up getting hit 
but my husband's incredibly calm and collected 
and he stands up and a  and a minute later like a we're running up to the top of this hill 
and one of the guys is lying in the gutter 
so  we get up to the top of the hill and there happens to be a cop car 
and the cop gets out 
and there's two cops 
and uh one of them goes down with the  the guy laying in the street 
and the other guy stays with us and asks what happened 
and the friend tells the story about how he's  he got punched 
and the cop asks 
 well  what happened to that guy down there 
and my husband says 
 he got stabbed 
and the cop says 
 well  how did he get stabbed 
and my husband very calmly says 
 I stabbed him 
recoils and we just like looked at him 
we were just totally shocked 
and uh yeah my husband had a pocket knife and pulled it out and stabbed this guy 
and shrugs he was  the guy was okay 
he spent a_lot_of time in jail 
he had assault charges in several states 
and 
yeah 
but we all shrugs ended up okay besides the guys had some black eyes and a couple stitches 
so  that was  that was really scary not knowing what was going to happen 
yeah  whispering 
nods yeah I'm sure I have 
 just a second 
nods yeah go ahead 
nods absolutely okay 
um  so  I took a s uh couple years of sign language 
and um they challenged us the first semester to go out into the um deaf population and um uh go to an event 
and so I actually ended up going to The_Vagina_Monologues all done in sign language 
and it was really a f
and um they did a voiceover on it 
but uh it was  it was interesting afterwards there was a  uh like a meetandgreet 
and I went in and I was  you_know had my glass of wine and like my snacks and  was you_know trying to communicate with people with like a very limited amount of sign language 
I had been in class you_know maybe six weeks or something and just really feeling at a loss you_know only being able to say a few words 
I felt like a child nods 
okay 
on a very sunny summer afternoon three girls went out into the desert 
and they were out behind their house in the desert

one day a little boy was out in his neighborhood playing with a soccer ball 
and he kicked it really really hard 
and it went through the window of his neighbor's house

so  he gets up 
and he goes to the window and he looks out 
but he doesn't see anyone because the little boy got scared and ran away 
okay 
there was a mom and a little boy 
and they were always arguing about the little boy taking his umbrella 
and he always said 
 Mom  I don't need it 
 I'm fine
