and how do you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
um you take out uh 
if I points
uh I like uh peanut butter butter and jelly on white bread 
so  two pieces of white bread 
and then uh you put a layer of peanut butter on one slice of bread 
and you put a layer of butter on the laughs other slice 
and then you open up the jelly 
put a slice  a layer of jelly on that slice 
and then you fold or  put the two slices together 
and then if I'm really hungry I put a second layer and make it a doubledecker 
uh it's little Jonathan's seventh birthday and he's having a birthday party 
he's invited his friends and his friends' parents over um for  to open presents and have cake 
and um right before everyone is sposta arrive 
um the dog smells the delicious cake on the table 
and jumps up on the table 
starts to eat the cake 
and little th Jonathan comes in and finds the dog  um eating the cake 
and begins to cry 
and the mom gets uh really angry and grabs a broom to punish the dog 
and the dog sees the mom with the broom 
gets scared runs under the couch 
trailing icing on the carpet after him 
and for all the sc screaming and crying going on the  the birthday guests arrive at the door 
and they open the door to see what's going on 
and they come in living room 
and they see an angry mom and little Jonathan crying and cake everywhere 
and they wonder if there's still gonna be a party or not 
you'll probably laugh because uh this is kind_of a unique story 
um I  uh I once st owned uh two blacktailed prairie dogs 
and we  uh some friends of ours liked uh our prairie dogs so much that two hand
so  we had hand
and then one of them was going out_of the country and needed us to watch their  dum their prairie dogs 
and so um  we did 
and uh one of them was a male 
and he was a_little aggressive 
and he didn't like me very much 
and uh so I was trying to hand
uh hand
and uh so I was trying to pet him 
and I was rubbing his chin hand
and he was getting all hands
and I really didn't read the warning sign very much 
and he bit me 
and took out a good chunk of my shows
so  uh so  I'm actually home um alone 
and I looks
and I can see shows
it's pretty good bite 
and uh I realize well 
 I should probably not  um I should probably get somebody to drive me to the emergency room for stitches as opposed to doing it 
and I  I don't always do well with the sight of my own blood 
like I have no hands
but I got ges
and then like 
 oh_boy what do I do 
so  ironically or  hand
so  I hadta wrap hand
and interrupt points her class 
and  laughs to get her hand
and uh so I was standing there when she hand
you_know  I'm standing there 
I'm like 
 um the prairie dog bit me 
 can you drive me to the urgent care 
and she's like 
 okay 
so  she hasta ges
and then I get to urgent care for stitches 
and prairie dogs are technically illegal to own in Arizona 
um w I had bought it in Texas 
and you can also buy them in Washington state 
ah but they're  they're considered restricted wildlife here 
and so I hadta completely lie about the entire 
because they ask you how you got the bite and was it an animal and whatever 
and I hadta hand
they probably would have come and taken the prairie dogs away 
so  laughs all_of_a_sudden it became a  uh um like I think I said a  a ferret 
because you're allowed to have ferrets here 
a ferret bite laughs 
anyway shrugs laughs that's my experience 
um uh my grandmother who's almost eighty is in a nursing home 
and uh she's slowly been losing her mental points
and I'm actually gonna visit her this weekend in Alabama 
and um so every time I visit her I'm never quite sure what mental state she'll be in whether she recognizes me 
she  uh she usually  she recognizes people that see her every day but not people that see her a few times a year 
and uh those people that she doesn't hand
so  usually  i sometimes I'm me her grandson 
but other times I'm other grandsons who see her more often 
and um so  uh um so you just hafta sort_of  uh it's easier to just sorta 
and get her  you_know sort_of uh force laughs her to realize who you really are 
um so you're  so you just sort_of play along 
and you basically just ask her how she's doing 
and she kind_of um makes stuff up or doesn't make a_lot_of sense 
um although I_mean h you can under  you can  she  hand
and you can understand what she's saying 
it's just that the  it's not coherent sometimes 
and so you just kind_of hafta um  take it as it goes and stay for about ten fifteen minutes 
and then  then you leave 
and it's kind_of sad 
but I think she at_least is somewhat happy to have a visitor 
so  there's some solace in that 
um this is when uh my parents were still married 
and we were  I was a little hand
I was probably like  exhales seven 
and uh we we're all camping at a lake in  north of Dallas 
and we'd all gone to bed for the night 
and uh we're hand
and a really bad storm came 
we were camping hand
like in hand
and a really bad storm came that night 
and the winds really picked up 
and uh blew the tent  started to blow the tent hand
off its 
and uh actually started rolling all the way 
so  we were all in the tent 
and it was like rolling hands
and as it broke hands
and hands
laughs and  and my mom's screaming 
and my dad's freaking out 
and ges
um I probably would have handled it different now as an adult 
but as a kid it's really traumatic when you don't know head
and everything's hands
and  and it stopped hand
it like hand
and my dad was able hand
luckily we never got in the water 
and he was able hand
but then  um but then everything hands
but we couldn't really leave that night 
and there was some hand
so  my laughs dad sat up all night just to hands
and  and it was just a really bad camping experience 
and luckily I  we kept going and I had better experiences so I'm not afraid of camping anymore 
but it left a pretty good impression on me as a kid 
um I'm going to  assume  I'll  I'll say this is  uh this takes place in Arizona 
and unfortunately  I_mean it was in monsoon season 
and um there was a huge storm 
and caused uh what would be a normally dry wash to start raging into a torrent 
and um this poor woman decided that uh while she had gone that way home every day 
and she really needed to get home to um ges
and she was determined to get there across the wash that she crosses every day 
but this time it was flowing and drove out into the wash 
and um didn't make it but a few feet 
and the water started um surrounding her car and uh pushing it around and f flooding her car 
and um she head
she couldn't go  reverse to get back 
and started to tumble the car 
and she managed to get her window down 
and uh um get on top of the car 
and uh waved to some people that were on the bank to call nineoneone and uh 
a rescue crew came out 
and um  um  she was able to  um well she got  uh right as they got there the water got higher 
and she got swept off the top of her car 
and it was floating downstream 
and they were able to uh shimmy out on a  a limb 
and she was able to get close enough to him 
and uh they were able to grab her and uh pull her to safety 
and she was okay 
um Bobby is home from school 
and he decides to go out and play with his soccer ball 
and he's just out on the lawn 
and uh practicing his uh dribbling skills 
and he's bouncing it on his kn uh knee and foot 
and he accidentally kicks it a_little too hard 
and it goes flying right into um tongue
whadya 
one of their  uh just  um ges
and crashes in and breaks the window 
and hits a lamp and knocks it down breaks the lamp 
and dad's just sitting there inside watching the evening news 
and he's totally surprised 
and he grabs the ball 
and he runs to the window um to  uh to see what was going on and who did it 
and uh by that time his son had run 
and he doesn't see anything 
so  um so  he goes outside to  uh to uh catch the perpetrator 
okay  um little boy's getting ready to go to school 
and um the mom nags him uh 
 hey it's sposta rain today 
 you needta take this umbrella 
and he's like 
 Mom  umbrella's aren't cool 
 I don't need an umbrella 
 I'm a big boy now 
lips
 see ya 
and she's like 
 okay  you're on your own 
and he gets halfway down the street 
and first drops of rain start 
and he goes 
 uhoh  maybe mom was right 
 I'm starting to get wet 
and then it really starts coming down and puddling up in the street 
and he says 
 shoot I need an umbrella to get to school 
so  he turns around and runs back to mom 
and he comes in 
and he's soaking wet 
and mom looks down disapprovingly but uh loves him all the same and says 
 alright  well  I'll give you an umbrella 
 and you can head off to school so you'll be on time 
so  he has an umbrella 
and he's walking to school 
and he's  he  uh he stays dry 
um
who um lives in the countryside with her two daughters 
and she has um um uh a relative  a  a young girl 
whose uh for whatever reason um uh has come and live with her 
and uh she's um a beautiful little girl 
um but the  uh r the rich mother doesn't  doesn't like her very much

she was there not to visit but to um uh to grow up there 
and they never did like her very much

and never have any fun 
and wait on them hand and foot 
so  um so  she grows up 
um and hasta wash their clothes and make their food 
and  um and never really gets out_of the house 
and then uh the  uh the prince who lives uh in a castle in the distance 
um grows up and becomes of age 
and it's time for him to find a wife to be princess 
and so his father and the royal s servants declare that there is a  uh a ball 
there's going to be a royal ball for all of the eligible women to attend in town 
and so the prince can get to know them and maybe select one of them to be his wife 
and the announcement goes out

and they make a beautiful dress for her to attend the ball 
and she puts it on and is  assumes she's going to the ball with her stepsisters 
and when they see her at how good she looks they tell her that she's not welcome and can't go 
and they um lips
and she  uh she's all upset and cries and goes back to her room
