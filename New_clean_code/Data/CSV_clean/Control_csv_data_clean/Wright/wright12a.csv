a couple decides to  go for a drive one day and they  were looking at a map and they get lost 
they stop  ov stop at the side of a farmer who's going to plant a tree and ask him for directions 
he tells them where to go 
and they take off and finish their trip 
that's about it 
the couple was fighting

my last vacation 
I went to uh Disneyland in July with my boyfriend and his daughter who is eleven years old 
we were only sposta go for one day 
ended up going for three days laughs 
had a really good time 
really enjoyed it 
and then  and there we ended up going to Huntington Beach 
and  got some boogie boards 
um and we went shopping that day 
and that trip  that was  that was it 
went to Sedona to see the changing of the leaves 
and then did the breast cancer run  on Sunday morning 
and then we did breakfast at The Orange Table 
and gave my friend's dog a bath 
laughs that's what I did 
this past Christmas 
I spent it  with my boyfriend's family 
they're Japanese 
so  it was very interesting 
it was my first time spending Christmas with a Japanese family 
it was very quiet 
they're not very  they're not  not very talkative 
the food was really good 
all different types 
um after I brought a game out I got to loosen up some of the family members to actually have fun 
illness or injury 
I 
 my worst one um was I was um homeless in California 
I was nineteen 
I had walking pneumonia 
I had no idea 
there was uh four girls that I ended up staying with 
one had a purple mohawk 
she was funny 
and I can't remember their names 
but I see their faces 
 and I was out_of  I was out_of conscious 
and then uh someone knocked out the door 
and they were two Mormon missionaries 
and they went and got someone from their church to uh get me and take me to the hospital 
I remember them taking the blanket off 
and I had a temperature of a hundred and five 
and just by taking the blanket off I was screaming because it was really cold 
um just being taken care for the next three days 
tons of wires hooked to me 
and I survived walking pneumonia they told me 
laughs 
yes laughs 
oh pull my hair out laughs 
um problems 
um because you have no idea what  what's going on 
you don't know what the problem is and then they blow up at you 
um it happens with a few of my fr girlfriends 
um they just don't know how to communicate 
uh you don't what you did wrong 
uh I pretty much hafta lay it on the table 
and   and I can't 
it's not like you can speak 
um it's  it's  it's a frustrating moment 
frustrating for both parties 
because you're trying to pull eye teeth telling  asking them what the problem is 
and they can't tell you 
um that's pretty much it until  until I can figure out the problem I hafta keep asking the questions of what's going on 
same with people at work when they're upset with something that's not going right 
it's  it's like asking just  I just keep asking questions until you get it 
that's  I wanna get to the bottom line 
that's  that's about it 
I'm  sh yes laughs 
um frightened and scared 
hm alright 
clears
and at first I couldn't figure if it was  uh uh joking or not 
and then I realized it wasn't joking 
and it was a fight or flight feeling of panic 
and  and it became a brawl between two people 
but I don't think that person would have done anything like that if it  alcohol would  had not been involved 
so  yeah that was terrifying after you realize 
 oh laughs 
hm  um the girl  uh fell into rapid waters and was floating down the river 
and  was able to hold onto a branch for awhile til the rescue group came to get her 
and she was saved 
looks like she was saved 
hm laughs let's see 
the boy decided to go outside and play soccer 
was kicking the ball 
acci accidentally kicked it a_little too far to the left 
hit a window 
broke it 
went into a gentleman's living room 
broke the lamp 
the man was upset 
as he went to go to the window um found nobody to be there 
it's a mystery of who hit  threw the ball 
laughs 
the day begins with uh  uh a little boy de deciding on going to school  hasta go to school 
the mother warns him that it might rain 
 oh  mom  I don't need the umbrella 
 and she insists 
 but it's okay mom 
 I don't need the umbrella 
as the boy's walking to school it starts to rain 
and he runs back to the house sopping wet 
the mother basically says 
 I told you so

and they didn't treat her very nicely at all 
very mean 
um the king had wanted to find a wife for the prince and wanted to throw a ball 
once it was announced the sisters were all excited and Cinderella thought she could go 
but they were making her do all the chores in the house 
and then when she got all the chores done she could go 
but there was no  none of time
