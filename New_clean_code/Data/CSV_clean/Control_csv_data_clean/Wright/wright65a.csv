lip_smack I'll get two slices of bread 
preferably whole wheat 
because that's the most healthy smile 
and a jar of peanut butter 
I will  get a knife to spread the peanut butter 
and I will also get a uh knife to spread the jelly along with the jar of jelly 
I will first put the peanut butter on one slic
I will either put ges
well  it looks like the little girl's kitten got stuck up in a tree 
and dad went up to help her out and get it down 
and then he got stuck in the tree 
so  they hadta call the fire department to come and get both the daddy and the kitty down out_of the tree 
okay  um I'm going to tell you about the time that I had cancer and began my treatment 
um I was thirty seven years old 
an
had five positive lymph nodes underneath my shows
uh I had a modified radical mastectomy 
a
so  within a month I was in the hospital undergoing my first chemo 
lips_smack they worry a_lot about nausea and vomiting and becoming dehydrated and the whole thing plus other side effects of_course 
so  I hadta stay in the hospital a night or two 
I did not head
and um so after that first initial treatment um  head
um head
they told me not  to eat lightly on the days of my treatment 
clears_throat I would get home and I would be so hungry I would forget about the caution and I would eat laughs shrugs normally 
and  head
so  evidently it worked because here I sit twenty seven years later with no relapses 
lips_smack um  the person that I  that I have dealt with in the past and still hafta deal with because the condition's getting worse is my husband's mother 
lips_smack and she had a hearing loss that started in late seventies and did not have ges
so  it did affect her ability to communicate because she can't  hear what you're saying to her most of the time 
lips_smack in order for me to communicate with her I hafta get in front of her 
speak directly to her 
I think she's become very adept at reading lips and ges figuring out what you're saying without hearing it 
but I noticed if I would come up behind her my husband and I could carry on a full conversation 
head
so  that was what tipped me off that her hearing had gotten really bad 
um she now has the beginnings of uh shrugs basically uh Alzheimer's of the dementia type 
lips_smack so
and you can see her now and see her again in  thirty minutes and she won't remember that she saw you thirty minutes ago usually  as a normal rule 
she does recognize us you_know and is able to communicate hand
but basically
otherwise you're  you're having to repeat everything so many times 
you don't know if she's heard you or not 
so  that's about all you can do with that 
is just  make sure you have ges
 well  let me think laughs 
lots of them INV
but how frightened or how scared 
that's the trick 
laughs okay  um I think the most frightened I ever became was when I was a young  girl 
and clears_throat my parents um had a  liv we lived on a farm 
and my sister and I slept in the  bedroom that was farthest ges
and between the ges main part of the house ges and our bedroom was a long ges
so  at night when we would go to bed we had ges
and I would la lay there and try to go to sleep 
ges
but then I would go to sleep 
and I would dream that there were ghosts coming down the points stairs 
and since the ges
and my parents were so far away because their bedroom was ges next to the main part of the house 
and there was ges no way to get there except going by ges
lips_smack so  I  I lived several years in fear 
I head
and eventually the  we ges
and ges
and points
so  I hadta  points sleep next to the door 
and I hadta protect my laughs little sister 
so  that was probably the most frightened that I ever  was that I can remember 
 okay 
this um girl  has fallen into the river from somewhere 
I'm not sure if she's had a car accident and got out_of the car or if she just fell into the river or the  was walking  swimming in the river and it swept her away 
it looks like there's uh um a rescue person 
I don't know if it's a fireman a paramedic or what has climbed out on the  limb to try to get her out_of the water 
at this point I think he's talking to her trying to get her out_of the water 
and she has her head out_of the water 
so  I'm assuming she's  not in the process of being sucked down 
I think they're trying to figure out a way to saf safely get both of them back to shore 
 okay 
lips_smack son is out playing  soccer in the yard practicing kicking his ball 
it accidentally goes astray and breaks
his father surprised gets up picks up the ball  looks out and sees the son 
father's standing there remembering his days of youth when he accidentally hit a baseball into his parents' window 
 okay 
clears_throat mom's trying to get her son to take an umbrella to school because as sh you can see it's raining outside or  it's dark outside 
son says 
 no  Mom  don't need it 
 don't need it 
 I'll be fine 
 don't worry 
son starts walking to school 
the rain starts coming 
he's getting soaking wet 
he runs back home  stands by mom looking forlorn and says 
 okay  I'll take the umbrella 
she gives him  him the umbrella 
he gets some dry clothes on and starts back off to school in a much happier mood 
okay 
a father clears_throat lips_smack met a woman that he liked 
they got married 
and he had a daughter by previous wife 
and she had two daughters by previous d husband 
inhales the stepmother to his daughter  didn't want her in the sa
so  basically turned her into a scullery maid to do housework head
the father along the way had   after a few years had died in the meantime 
so  mom really took that to extremes and basically turned her into a servant to wait on her and the two sisters 
lips_smack um lips_smack it came about that the king and queen had a son 
a prince if you will who was celebrating his twenty first birthday 
and they decided to have a huge ball and invite all of the eligible  girls in the country to come to the ball 
so  naturally the stepmother of Cinderella who was by then given this name by her mother and sisters since  since she tended all the cinders from the fireplace um lips_smack to come to this ball 
mom decided that her daughters were going and wearing the finest clothes possible 
so  she got them their gowns and got them all set up to go 
Cinderella was very sad because she couldn't go 
and she really wanted to go 
she never got to do anything 
she happened to um stumble upon some clothes in an old chest and uh found that she actually had some friends in the  in the animal kingdom that came to her rescue and helped her make a beautiful ball gown 
lips_smack she also had a fairy godmother that she never knew about who suddenly appeared and  helped make everything right so_that Cinderella could go to the ball 
she had a beautiful gown 
she had a coach to ride in  with footmen and everything that she needed 
the only stipulation was she hadta be home by midnight because everything would go back to what it had been before 
 lips_smack so  Cinderella went to the ball  was having a wonderful time and forgot about the time until she heard the clock striking midnight 
she ran down the s stairs to try to get away and in the process lost one of her slippers which was a beautiful glass slipper 
lips_smack she did make it home on her own 
and noone ever found out 
but in the meantime the prince had become so smitten with this beautiful girl at the ball that he was determined to find out who lost their glass slipper on his staircase 
so  he went door to door in the country with his  helpers trying to find who
noone's had so far 
but when he came to the home of Cinderella her two sisters of_course hadta try it on 
head
and Cinderella happened to overhear  lips_smack a
and the prince had found his princess 
and they got married and lived happily ever after laughs
