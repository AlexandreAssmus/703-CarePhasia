this is a story about a birthday party gone awry 
here was a beautiful birthday cake with candles on it 
and the neighbors were invited over with their children for Tommy's birthday 
apparently he was four years old 
there were four candles on the cake 
but Tommy's dog saw the cake unattended and took a big hunk out_of it 
and then he ran underneath the sofa to hide from the mom who got very angry and had her broom out and was gonna beat the dog with the broom for chewing up the cake 
in the meantime all the guests were arriving 
there was a little boy guest with a  present and a little girl guest with the present and their moms 
and they were seeing the whole event unfold as they approached the room for the birthday party 
the end 
the boy was crying 
he wasn't very happy on his birthday 
in order  you take out your bread 
you lay out your two pieces of bread 
you can put your jelly on one piece and your peanut butter on the other 
flop them together 
slice them 
and voila you have your peanut butter and beh jelly sandwich 
um I had a gallbladder attack on my um twentieth wedding anniversary 
we went out for ribs and had nice rich wonderful ribs 
and by the time I got home I was in a full blown uh gallbladder attack which is very very painful 
and so I went to the hospital 
I was beginning to turn green 
and um I had the surgery done 
I was in the hospital about three days 
that's before they did it with any kind of scopes 
you_know  they did a regular open laparotomy 
so  um 
and then I came home and was off for a week or two and went back to work 
so  um I think the worst part of it was the pain you experience prior to the surgical procedure 
and then once it's over you feel a_lot better that's for sure 
okay  the problems are word finding and the ability to speak 
uh my mother's disability is apraxia aphasia 
and so she sometimes uses different words um to try to get her point across 
what I do is I offer her extra time 
sometimes extra processing time helps 
sometimes we can do a pantomime with the is it this and touch 
if it's an object maybe we can pull the object like the cellphone or whatever 
um sometimes it helps if she attempts to write it because sometimes spelling is a_little better than actually finding the word in her mind but visualizing it 
and then because we live with each other and we're together so much I can kind_of read her mind for the most part and know what it is she needs 
like today with  th I knew she needed some kind of check because I knew she was going to try to pick up the ring 
and I figured that maybe they didn't take her credit card 
so  for the most part I can kind_of guess so 
uh a little bit like Vanna_White 
is it this 
is it that 
does it begin with the letter 
sometimes beginning letters help 
so  that's how we work it out 
um my husband and I were in Washington_D_C doing some sightseeing 
and it turned  when we came off a  a boat trip it  it got a little darker 
and we were taking public transportation to and from our hotel 
and so we were walking along 
and it went  was pretty isolated street 
there wasn't a_lot_of people around that were trying to get to a busstop or a station 
and as we were walking we heard there was somebody keeping pace with us you_know maybe twenty yards back 
and it was three young kids  d uh three young black kids that looked like they were pretty tough 
and so I was very  I  I felt myself becoming very anxious and my heartbeat racing 
and my husband said if they come after us I'm gonna take laughs the  the movie camera 
and I'll hit em 
and you run like hell 
laughs so  we were picking up the pace 
as we picked up the pace they picked up the pace 
and as we turned the corner there was a bus station 
and people were waiting there 
so  we were just so grateful to see other people 
and they backed off 
and they left us alone 
so  I think it was a  could've been a robbery you_know 
and that's it 
this looks like something that could happen in Arizona where somebody goes through a wash and shouldn't 
and this lady was driving her s_u_v thinking she could get through the wash 
and then the water was so rapid it picked her up and pushed her along 
and then the fire department with their equipment came to rescue her 
and so it appears as though the  he's strapped  he's got something here strapped on that he can use to help her get to a safe spot 
he's uh holding onto a branch that's hanging into the rushing water 
and he is attempting the rescue 
no  I'm not too sure why he has a belt here and a belt here but I'm assuming that's the belt for helping her 
I don't know 
Joey was out going to go to find his friends to play a game of soccer 
so  he's kicking a soccer ball down the neighborhood street and inadvertently kicks the wrong way and hits a bi
and the soccer ball goes through the neighbor's picture window 
goes through the window 
knocks over the lamp 
scares the neighbor 
the neighbor goes to look out to see who had done it 
and he's got the  soccer ball in his hand but he can't seem to find who kicked it 
but I'll bet ya 
the end 
well  it's time for Joey to go to school 
and his mom said 
 you_know Joey I looked out the window 
 it looks like in the  looks like it might rain today 
 and the weathermen said that rain could be coming today 
 oh 
he said 
 no Ma
 I don't wanna take that umbrella 
 only sissies carry umbrellas 
 not kids like me 
 I'm not gonna take that umbrella 
 and I don't think it's gonna rain anyway 
well  there he goes out 
and what's happening but his mom was right 
it starts to rain 
first just a little drizzle and then the rain gets heavier and harder 
and the puddles are deep 
and when he comes home he is soaked to the skin 
his mother is very angry with him because sh he did not listen to her and take the umbrella 
so  the next time that this occurs and there's rain he takes the umbrella and listens to his mom and stays dry 
that was a lesson learned 
hmhm
Cinderella's mother dies and her father chooses to marry a woman with two little girls her stepmother and her stepsisters 
as time goes on the father also passes away and the stepmother is in charge of the girls 
and she is very cruel to Cinderella 
she uses her as a servant 
she has her do the cooking and the cleaning 
when the mother arrived she brought her Cheshire cat along 
and uh the cat had the rule of the house where the other animals um were not treated as well 
but Cinderella loved them all 
and she loved the horses and the dogs and the mice 
and  um and they all loved her 
as she was cleaning she looked out the window and saw the beautiful castle in the distance and had heard that the prince and king lived in that castle 
um in the castle there was a wonderful prince handsome charming prince who was approaching the age to be married 
and the prince's servants and the king said that he hadta choose himself a wife 
and so an invitation went out to the kingdom and to everybody who lived in the kingdom that there would be a ball 
and at that ball all the eligible young maidens would come dressed in their finery 
and the prince would make his choice of who he wanted to marry at that time 
well  the stepmother got the invitation 
she only considered her daughters and she didn't consider sa Cinderella at all 
so  she got the  her daughters the beautiful gowns and the jewelery 
and they were ugly stepsisters 
and Cinderella made her own dress 
and with the help of the mice and the birds and the animals she made a beautiful little dress 
and when she came out with her dress on the stepsisters ripped it to pieces and shred it and said that she is not going to go to the ball that they are gonna go to the ball but she is not 
so  she was put into  locked into a uh room 
and she was visited by the um fairy godmother 
and the fairy godmother said that she would help her go to the  the ball 
so  the fairy godmother um with her magic bitty  bippety_boppety_boo made sure that she had a very beautiful gown 
and out_of a pumpkin she made a carriage 
and out_of the mice she made horsemen  um horses to carry uh the carriage to the palace 
and she was dressed in her  the most beautiful woman in the  in the land 
but she did have a stipulation 
she said that uh she needed to come home before midnight or the whole magic would disappear 
so  she went to the ball 
and she was the bell of the ball 
and she caught the eye of the prince 
and the prince fell in love with her much to the dismay of her stepmother and stepsisters 
so  she danced the night away 
and then as she looked at the clock she heard the chiming of the twelve chimes 
and she knew that she hadta run home or the magic of the  the night would disappear at that time 
so  she ran from the prince 
and as she did one of her little glass slippers slipped off onto the steps 
and she ran and she ran 
and then eventually when she got into her carriage the whole thing started to disappear the magic of the night 
the pumpkin returned to its former self 
and  and the animals were no longer horses 
and everything returned to theirselves  to what they were 
when she returned home the um stepmother put her under lock and key because there was an edict out from the   the palace that they were looking for the maiden who had left the glass slipper at the palace 
and they would check all the maidens in the land until they came to the one whose foot fit into this glass slipper 
so  the stepsisters tried to get their little fat feet in there and it didn't work 
and they  a mouse brought her the key  Cinderella the key 
she got out_of the locked room in time for the servant to offer the glass slipper for her to try on 
she tried it on 
it was a fit 
and the prince then designated her as his princess 
and they got married and lived happily ever after 
we have a beautiful big oak tree in the front yard 
but we also have a kitty_cat who loves  to go up the tree 
and the kitty climbed the tree and got onto the limb and couldn't get down 
so  dad felt sorry for the kitty and his daughter who was very upset by it all 
it appears as though the dog created the problem by barking at the cat who got up the tree 
he then took a ladder dad did 
put it up against the tree to climb and get the cat 
but the ladder fell down 
so  after all this occurring the neighbors hadta call the police department to get the dad and the cat down from the tree 
the fire department not police department laughs 
and there's also a bird very happy at the other end of the tree 
that's it
