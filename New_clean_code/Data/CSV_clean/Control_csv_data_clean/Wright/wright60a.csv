pretty easy 
well  you get the ingredients out 
you get the  the bread that you'd wanna use 
I would first inhales take a paper plate and uh  put the two uh slices of uh bread on the plate 
and then inhales either before or after I'd go get uh uh the jelly and the peanut butter 
and if they were already open they'd probably be in the refrigerator 
inhales and then I would take two knives because I don't wanna adulterate one or the other 
inhales and I would  uh I would probably put the butter on first 
and uh  I would probably just use one side for the butter and one side for the jelly 
and inhales I would the  uh put the butter on the one side 
probably the right side just because it's  that's where it's at in my mind 
inhales and I would put it on evenly 
but I would put it on very  over the whole area 
not this area because I hate that 
an
inhales I'd probably use a_little less jelly than the  the peanut butter because I'd rather have more peanut butter 
inhales and then I would put the two  uh I would probably take the  uh in the left hand take the inhales one with the jelly and put it over the uh one with the peanut butter 
so  the two inhales uh surfaces that have stuff on it uh face each other 
and I would put them so the top of the loaf is where the  to you_know the top of the piece is where it has a w symmetrical 
inhales and then I would cut it in half probably this way hori uh horizontally 
inhales and then I would   know what I'd eat it 
I don't know if you wanna know that so c 
and at some point I'd  probably at the end I would clean up my mess so my wife  wouldn't yell at me 
looks like there is uh a kitty got up into uh uh the branch of a tree 
and uh it looks like the father uh climbed up on the tree with a ladder 
and somehow the ladder  fell down 
and the father is stuck in the tree 
inhales there's a girl up there uh reaching up for uh  probably her cat 
and there's a tricycle uh next to her 
and there's a ladder there that's inhales quite a ways from the tree 
so  I don't understand how it got that far away 
but  maybe it tipped over backwards 
inhales and then there's a dog probably their dog barking uh up the tree 
and you_know why I have no idea what dogs do 
inhales and then there's a bird in the other branch on the opposite side of the tree 
and then lips_smack evidently somebody called a fire department 
and there's a firetruck 
and there's a couple fireman inhales carrying a ladder uh towards the tree when they could use the ladder that was there 
but maybe it's not a good enough one 
and that's pretty much it 
so  evidently inhales the father uh climbed up the tree to get the cat out 
and inhales for some reason either the dog the wind or the father knocked the ladder down 
and somebody assumingly maybe the girl called the uh fire department 
and inhales they're responding 
an
looks like it's low enough he can just jump down so 
the thing was is that uh  I never had a heart attack 
and  other_than having a very little uh  chest pain 
uh it was kind_of somewhat of a surprise so 
inhales I had  uh went and had a electrocardiogram at my primary care physician 
and inhales he said that was alright 
which they don't show anything INV
so  now he suggested a stress echo 
so  I  inhales I had a stress echo 
and I went to it 
and  and I failed it 
you_know  I was kind_of shocked 
is  and I w was gonna do things afterwards 
and inhales I just called my wife 
and  and uh talked to her 
and then I went home 
and  lips_smack and then uh they did a uh cardiac catharization 
lips_smack and uh  between the first day and the second day uh they gave me nitroglycerine 
and then I just  didn't do anything because I didn't wanna have a heart attack INV
and I had a cardiac catharization 
and I didn't know it at the time but my cardiologist because he was inhales older and past his prime wouldn't have done anything if  if  if 
and he wouldn't even put it in a stent 
because  m which I wouldn't have used him if I would have known that 
inhales make a long story short I had three main
one was blocked a hundred percent 
 one was blocked ninety eight percent 
inhales and one was blocked eighty percent 
so  I was very fortunate that I didn't inhales either have a heart attack or stroke or whatever you wanna have with that INV
and I had surgery 
and I had surgery by a  uh  a cardiac surgeon that was considered by uh  the nurses and people in general one of the better ones 
I went to Scottsdale_Healthcare_Osborn 
and before I went I called and asked them how many inhales uh procedures they did the previous year 
and based on what I had understanding the more you did the better chance  you had a better success 
so  they were even better than inhales at Mayo 
th at the time Mayo was at uh  Scottsdale uh Shea 
and it was like oh three or four hours there 
I  to this day I don't know because what my wife told me inhales and w what she now says is different 
so  it d doesn't matter 
lips_smack and uh when I got done 
inhales uh it's  it's very intrusive 
you don't know what the INV
inhales and uh they said that when they saw me immediately as soon as they could afterwards I looked laughs really bad 
but I was calm 
and well   my brother just had it a couple weeks  ago 
and his wife said he didn't look that bad 
so  I don't know what that means 
well  lips_smack when I saw my mob 
but she did  ver she recovered very g rapidly 
and she's still alive 
and that's about fifteen years ago 
inhales uh lips_smack and then I just remember that it  eh uh  it took a long time to recover 
and then one day I went to the  cardiologist and he said you_know 
 go back to work 
inhales which  when I went back to work I had problems because it really was too soon 
I should have said you_know 
 well  I'm not really ready 
and uh my wife has always said that uh after that I acted like an old man 
I was  I was fifty five at the time 
that must have been ten years ago 
inhales and uh the thing that I noticed is that I had short term memory problems 
inhales and uh I would go from one room to the other to find out  to get something 
by the time I got there I forgot  that 
inhales and they said that uh that was uh go away in six months 
it never did 
inhales uh I think personally that I was on a heart lung machine too long 
and inhales at that time they didn't have a filter in there that filters out the  little particles or whatever that causes your problem 
inhales and uh I've never really been the same since then 
and uh you_know that's the  pretty much the end of the thing  
the story 
 n no  no  I had a little chest pain when I was at work when I walked from the  the place I worked into the washroom 
and inhales one day it  it was a l very very little right here 
and uh just to be on the safe side you_know the other pharmacist said you_know 
 oh  you should call your doctor 
like I got in right away 
 and the e_k_g it was like on a Friday 
an
the c cardiac INV
and inhales Thursday I have the surgery 
so  and INV
 yeah  well  well  I 
 ninety eight and eighty  ou INV
but the thing was they did five bypasses 
and they took out 
both of what they identified as a stroke 
and  and they  it was very difficult to communicate with them 
uh I had an aunt that had  uh was very old 
in the nineties and had Alzheimer's 
and  and she didn't even know  INV
she was a inhales aunt that was very near and  dear to me 
and uh  uh was always very nice 
that's probably my favorite aunt so  
and uh sometimes I have problems communicating with my wife 
b we both don't hear that well 
and  we'd t start talking and walk away 
and  and uh a_lot_of people if you pay attention they just s s speak a_lot 
like my  I've got a son that is an engineer 
and  I think he's just stressed out from work because he's overworked 
and he's  they're pushing him into management 
and  he  for a young guy that's really pretty sharp 
all my kids are pretty sharp 
he  he misspeaks INV
so 
hm
 wow  yeah  like in adulthood or child or what 
 okay  I'll  g I can INV
um I was probably
you could figure it out 
I was in  like in  in junior high 
not  yeah  junior high 
that's like seven and eighth grade 
 okay 
I don't know if that's the right term 
and it was like eighth grade 
inhales and uh we were moving from one location to another because my dad's inhales uh place of employment uh moved 
and uh  we were uh carrying some stuff on a  a big long trailer that he was pulling with his uh nineteen fifty five uh Buick 
inhales and it was a rented U_haul 
and we were driving down the  two lane highway and uh 
probably going about forty forty five 
 and all_of_a_sudden inhales something happened 
I didn't know what happened at the time 
but subsequently I found out that inhales uh one of the bolts on the cross member of the hitch inhales 
because it was put in upside down 
it came aw undone and it fell out 
and because of that inhales it  uh the trailer caused the car to go like this 
 and uh the car was going like this 
and I had a big inhales round mirror that was above the dresser 
and I had it in my  in front of me in the front seat on the passenger side 
inhales because uh  you_know so it didn't get broken 
 and the car whipped around 
an
and to make a long story short 
inhales the trailer caused the car to spin all the way around 
and the end of the trailer hit a big tree that was literally that big in diameter 
and damaged the trailer 
and the tree a little bit 
inhales and if he uh woulda 
and  and uh  then I remember getting out_of the car with my dad 
and looking at the inhales uh trailer and all that 
and that was pretty i 
and then you_know it wasn't  it didn't take a long time for all this to happen 
but that kind_of sticks in my memory 
it  you_know that  inhales uh you_know for the m grace of God 
or  or uh my dad's ability or something 
other_than having a damaged trailer 
and I don't know  inhales can't remember if he hadta pay for it or it was covered under insurance or
but uh the mirror was not broken 
and inhales I don't think m anything or much was damaged 
and it was very  but it was li big long trailer 
uh a double  tandem you_know 
tandem  
two wheels 
so  that was  that was  I don't know if that was real scary but it  it certainly left an impression on me so 
 well  looks like there's a
oh
okay 
I didn't get what this was to begin with 
okay 
uh looks like there was a young  girl 
or maybe a young woman 
I don't know 
probably in the teens or maybe oh  I can't tell  really tell the age 
inhales looks like that uh she was in a  uh an area where there was uh  rocky or stony or inhales cliff type things 
and she evidently fell in the  into the xxx 
it looks like xxx on the bot 
I can't really see that xxx 
it's not that good a picture 
and she evidently got  uh fell in 
and she ha hanged onto a  uh a dead tree's uh branch out_of the rocks 
inhales and looks like there's probably some man 
by the belt that he has on must be some sort of rescue person 
uh in a red uh lifejacket 
and he's got a belt that inhales I don't know if that's connected to a rope or not 
I can't really see that 
lips_smack you_know looks like that the 
oh  I see what it is 
he's got a belt he's gonna pu probably put around her 
okay  I didn't see that 
similar to his 
inhales and it looks like he's just got to the point where he's up by next to her and he's gonna inhales when he gets a chance put the belt around the uh girl and rescue her 
uh  probably uh paramedics or police 
and  looks like he's in well shape 
he's got a  a gigantic bicept 
inhales and the girl doesn't look really that  she looks a little  scared 
I_mean she looks a_little  shocked out too or something 
so  inhales I would assume it had a happy ending 
so  I  I don't know about that 
well there's   inhales well there's a boy playing with a  I guess that's a soccer ball 
when  there little different sections 
inhales and he's in a  probably a grassy area with some shrubs behind him 
and he's got a baseball cap on 
and he  kicks it and it  appears to go through a window 
and it breaks the window 
inhales it uh  lands inside a house 
and it knocks a lamp off a  a table 
and there's a man that was evidently sitting in there 
and inhales I think it looks like it maybe startled him or  something 
inhales and he picked up the ball 
and he's looking out the window 
and uh doesn't  you_know can't see his expression on his face 
but he inhales probably in the  either in the stages of finding out you_know who did it or whatever 
and then he's probably gonna react to it one way or the other 
 well  looks like there's a mother uh offering to a child 
maybe a girl 
I don't know 
kind_of hard to  no
it's probably a boy 
inhales unbrella 
and he goes out 
and walks with his backpack in the rain 
and he's starting to get wet 
and inhales he
so  he comes back 
and inhales he's all wet 
and his mother seems to not that be happy about it either 
and so then uh the final solution is he goes out there again and has an umbrella now 
and he's you_know using it the proper way 
that he's getting most of the rain not go on his upper  upper body 
and uh doesn't say if uh  they  he was dried out before that or not 
but he doesn't seem to be inhales wet from the picture 
so  I no 
that's just speculation
