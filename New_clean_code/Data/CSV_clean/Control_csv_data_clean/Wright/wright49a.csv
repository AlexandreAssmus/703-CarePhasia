um they took the book  the boy and his two friends and the mothers out to the amusement park for the day and were planning to come back home to celebrate later 
in order to prepare for the party the mother had baked a three layer cake and was really excited that  that the the boy would like it 
however  when they came home from the park they found a bad surprise 
the dog had nibbled on the cake and tracked the icing and the crumbs all through the house 
so  when they got home the mother was very angry and wanted to chase the dog with a broom 
um laughs you're not gonna believe me 
but anyway two weeks ago I was Saturday night  two weeks ago on a Saturday evening about six p_m I started feeling a stomach ache I thought or like a side stitch points
clears_throat ironically enough the pain started to travel down my back finger
I could feel it moving 
it wasn't a muscle I could 
I'm  I'm much a sportsman enough to know that it wasn't a muscle 
it wasn't a bone 
something was really weird and it was moving 
they were kidney stones eventually I found out 
but I remember thinking 
 I don't have yet insurance here 
and I've just moved back 
and I haven't been to a hospital here in twenty years 
this is going to be really horrible 
and  m and I was fighting it to stay at home to the point where clears_throat I had a fever of a hundred and one or something and uh just was doubled over and couldn't even  and couldn't even really stand um as this thing was making it's way down 
so  we went to the hospital 
and the first thing I walked in and s I said 
 I'm sorry t bring you a bad news 
and the woman said 
 why 
 did my husband die 
that's the receptionist 
I said 
 that's a good joke 
 but anyway I don't have insurance 
and she said 
 that's no problem 
 that's  you're gonna get a  come on in 
and I remember thinking 
 okay this is gonna be alright 
um three hours later after some medicine and vomiting at_least forty times because of the intense pain the most intense pain I've ever had in my life 
just imagine like stones going through that little opening shows
sorry laughs 
and uh whew 
suddenly  and I was having to use a little strainer thing ges and seeing them come out 
and oh 
and then for t t about a day the blood and everything else 
um but I was amazed the body and how 
and once  and once they told me what it was I read a little bit about and realized it's not such a simple thing and how often we don't realize it 
so  water shows
people drink colas and 
coffees colas bubble gas d drinks are the worst 
and then red meat is another bad one because they don't end up being digested 
so  I learned 
and I just remember thinking at that time in that hospital and I was vomiting so much and it wasn't even vomit I thought 
my  my throat's going to come out because of  the convulsions were so strong 
and I just remember thinking 
my wife and son are coming next week 
 and oh_my_god here I am in the hospital 
so  I was really  I was trying not to allow myself to go that far with it 
except  for the first time in my life ever 
not death but enough to the point where something seriously wrong here 
that  that was the point of my story 
I  I've never had that 
at forty eight years old I'm too young for this 
in nineteen ninety six I was living in Japan 
and I was contacted by a local city 
a city named Uwajima which is very near where my wife's hm traditional home town is in the mountains of a small village area 
um their local high school fishing cooperative ship kind_of like the sail USA or go around the world ges
up  the submarine came up ges
um this went on for months 
and the Japanese government demanded an apology 
the US government didn't wanna apologize nor the xxx of the US Navy 
at the end of the day they didn't know what to do 
at the local government some friends of a friend of a friend of a friend found me and said 
 we are not able to communicate with them 
 can you please explain to me what the difference is to an American of I'm sorry 
 what does excuse me mean 
I am talking about having a meeting with the secretary of the Japanese selfdefense 
so  kind_of a hm secretary of defense who I would never normally meet 
and the mayor two congress people or  parliament members 
sorry 
um and about forty very very very pissed off Japanese parents who had lost children wanting  demanding to understand what the English concept or the western concept was I'm sorry 
I hadta prepare a presentation for this 
and then I thought 
how am I going to explain what is I'm sorry 
it's like movies and songs we use this so often 
yet it  it has very very traditional deep meanings and depending on the level of the insult pesh perceived or injury perceived or not there are different ways to apologize in Japanese and all cultures 
as we  we have levels of formality 
anyway my next job was then I was to go to the US Navy representative through the US Embassy um to ask could they apologize 
laughs I'm not a diplomat and I don't pretend to be 
but I was also in the US Navy 
so  one thing led to another and I met with the people 
I was flown over to Hawaii with several of these Japanese to act as an intermediary watching these two groups try to communicate over a week period over something that was just the most absolutely dreadful topic for them 
dead school children 
clearly a mistake by one  an accident 
and how do you get beyond it 
all they would've been happy with if that captain of the US Navy had  all if the US Navy had allowed the captain to do what he wanted 
he wanted to apologize but he was n not allowed 
he was prohibited 
US government policy 
that's fine 
but because of that inability to communicate on the same point which they really understood was the saddest thing um the communication never developed 
two years after the man was fired 
the captain 
he came back to that area by himself his wife and his children and he made a personal apology to everybody which made the US government even more angry 
so  I still remember this day thinking the US wanted to keep Japan as friends the Japanese wanted to keep the US as friends but what was caught in the middle were some families and a s truly bureaucratic mess that allowed them to avoid or to solve that communication trouble 
stupid 
laughs 
uh when my wife was seven months pregnant we got news from her family that her mother inlaw was dying of intestinal cancer 
we were living away from them at the time 
we were living in Japan 
uh excuse me 
we were living in Germany but they were back home in Japan 
the  my wife's uh pediatrician did not give her permission to fly because of the late term pregnancy 
and it was her first child 
so  I hadta go back to represent her in the Japanese mind anyway for my wife and I  to see the mother inlaw 
in a period of three months I went five times balancing my lectures and this funny German schedule I told you about 
uh the biggest thing I was most afraid of was not being able to get my wife home before her mother died because I knew the mother was going to die 
I talked to the doctor 
uh but the father didn't know 
they kept that information from the father 
they didn't wanna tell him 
I've never seen people compartmentalize in a family not to tell the sister or not to tell a certain close family member that the mother was dying 
the mother didn't know she was dying 
so  I was afraid that my wife couldn't get home 
um the sense of being afraid or scared is I lost my father while living in Hungary 
and I will never be able to answer that question of what if 
so  that to me is a scared uh situation that I clearly remember 
okay 
after a series of unusually late spring uh excuse me  late winter early spring storms and a very quick warm  warming period the rivers and  and the local area overflowed 
um there were flash floods and several people were trapped or swept away 
in this case the  a young woman was trapped in the river and holding on to a tree for probably a very long time 
she looks tired and very nervous and distressed 
and it looks as though that the rescue services or hm fire technician or whomever um seemed to have arrived 
points
it's obviously very industrial 
and there is two of them points
and also the color of the vest 
and that this man risked his life in order to save this woman's uh life 
okay 
the boy is  n ah uh is on his  w has put on his backpack and is on his way out the door to school as usual 
and his  his mother is suggesting very strongly 
 please take the umbrella today 
that I watched the news and I saw that there will be rain showers later 
and the boy's saying 
 no  thank_you 
 it's not going to rain 
he then t goes out the door and turns to say goodbye to his mother but she's reminding him one more time 
 are you sure 
and he's 
 no 
 see you later 
 goodbye 
well  sure enough mother knows best 
just shortly after he left the house and down the road the rain drops started coming down at first very slow and then suddenly into a downpour 
and the boy was running back home to get his umbrella 
when he arrived at the house the mother put her hands on her hips and reminded him 
 I told you 
and he then grabbed the umbrella and went on his way to school 
nothing that any other boy probably hadn't done in their life 
uh the young boy's in the backyard kicking around a soccer ball having the time of his life when suddenly one bad kick goes errant and into the big picture glass window smashing through and landing breaking a lamp sitting next to the father who was watching television upsetting him to the point where he quickly jumped up and raced to the window to see who broke the window 
well  in the tradition of good old story books once upon a time there was a huh what  landowner well  well endowed family who adopted a little girl 
uh the little girl came into a family in which the mother and the two sisters  the two daughters pardon me  did not really appreciate having her around 
and as she grew up she became the hand maiden or slave cook clean etcetera to the mother and the daughters and hadta endure many many hours of bullying and abuse 
um but n she never gave up her dream every day of seeing out the window the big castle and thinking of a better life for herself 
uh clears_throat one day after 
uh excuse me 
the  in the  in the castle there was a prince and a king 
and the king was adamant that his son get married and k had been insisting and insisting 
and in order to help the son decide who might be a  suf uh an appropriate bride it was announced that there would be a large ball or a di dance 
invitations were sent out throughout the kingdom 
one day an invitation arrived at the house of the family that I mentioned 
and the mother and the evil sisters uh were all happy to realize and think 
 here's our chance 
 one of us  we can get married to this handsome prince 
and so they began to discuss very excitedly plans for what kind of dress and how they would k uh go to the party 
and meanwhile Cinderella had been listening and thinking 
 oh  that's too bad 
she was very sad about herself 
but  and one day when she was rummaging through her goods she found in a trunk an old magic book 
and clears_throat one thing lead to another and she conjured up a fairy tale godmother who then began to help Cinderella realize her dreams 
she tried to create a dress and give hope to Cinderella that she too could have a better life 
unfortunately at some point the evil mother and the two daughters got wind of what Cinderella had been hoping 
and they ridiculed her and embarrassed her or chastized her for that and reminded her that she would be staying home and not going go to the party because she hadta take care of the others 
so  Cinderella became very sad until the fairy godmother went all out and created a chariot from a pumpkin created a gorgeous dress from a rag and created a crown from twigs and made Cinderella wa to be a very very attractive woman 
on the eve of the  on the night of the dance Cinderella attended the ball and everyone was amazed at this beautiful person 
noone could recognize that it was Cinderella because indeed she had changed so much 
uh however the fairy godmother had reminded Cinderella that she hadta leave at the stroke of midnight in order to get back because that's when the magic spell would end and all of her goods would be  revert to their original shape or character 
so  at the stroke of midnight Cillarella 
he then set out over the days and weeks to come searching throughout the kingdom for this beautiful woman mystery woman 
he carried around the one glass slipper that he found on the stairs outside the castle and trying to put it on make it see if it would fit any woman in his kingdom 
when he came to the house of the evil mother and the family where Cinderella lived he of_course wanted to have everyone try it on 
and of_course the mother tried but it didn't fit 
and the sisters tried and the shoe didn't fit 
and Cinderella tried and it fit 
and from then on love took over 
and they lived happily ever after 
yesterday I was watching the news when I saw this crazy story 
uh turned out that this man was going to help h his cat that was stuck up in the tree 
so  he took the ladder out 
and the daughter was very happy that they were gonna be able to save the cat 
but once the man got up in the tree the ladder fell down 
and the girl started panicking 
so  she ran and called her mother 
and the mother called the fire department 
and the fire department came to help him down
