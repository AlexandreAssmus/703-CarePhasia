uh uh our kids were in the uh back of the carriage facing forward 
we were in the front of the carriage facing back 
um the carriage starting going up a hill 
the horse was balking 
um I  wi without  uh without really thinking and moving as quickly as I could I picked up the kids and uh got them off the carriage and suggested to my wife that we dive off the carriage uh which I did onto the ground 
and she uh tried to step down and got her foot caught and was dragged 
um I uh uh hit my head and dislocated uh both knees was um uh unconscious for a few minutes uh when the kids were hovering around me telling me that mommy was dead 
and um um I told them  I told the kids to go for help since the driver of the carriage was uh uh attending to the horse and not uh to the passengers 
uh the kids ran for help 
um and I uh tried to get my legs back together 
uh we all  uh my wife was flown to Roanoke uh hospital

and uh all in all it was a nightmare 
okay 
at first um I would be short and curt with people and uh not work with them to  mu to communicate 
I wouldn't be very empa empathe burps excuse me  empathetic 
but um having lived through this uh I realized the problems in communicating 
and um I noticed that a_lot  a_lot_of people who have difficulty communicating are aware of their difficulty communicating which makes them extremely anxious and uh makes the situation worse 
so  I try to put them at ease saying you_know 
 take your time 
 don't worry about it 
 uh I have problems myself 
 and um try to  uh try to relax 
 and uh you_know if you don't  if you wanna share something with me and tell me something fine 
if you don't it's okay too

okay  a um soon to be wicked stepmother is living with her daughters when somebody brings a little girl to stay with them 
uh the little girl is very polite  curtsies to the uh family and uh uh thinks that she's going to be spending time on an equal footing with the rest of the family 
however  while the mother and daughters are busy primping themselves and having a good time she's left to work with the farm animals and gets to know them and takes care of them 
um she's spends her time uh sometimes looking out_of the window at the faroff castle in the distance wondering what life would be like uh in the big castle 
uh turning to the castle uh the king is uh very upset because his son has not taken a bride 
and he brings his top advisor to  um uh to develop a strategy to uh find a wife for his son because he doesn't wanna relinq die and relinquish his crown to his son without a wife to carry on the line 
um they decide to uh uh put an announcement out to all the  uh all  all the eligible  all the families with eligible young women 
uh a bulletin which ends up at the house of the wicked stepmother and her daughters 
uh they read the notice 
Cinderella uh uh listens and finds out about it uh goes up into the bedroom and m moans and longs to put on a beautiful dress that she sees there wanting to go to the ball herself 
um the uh family uh gets ready and um apparently they buy the sisters all  all s stuff to get them up to go to the ball 
and Cinderella is left alone when all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appears and says 
 Cinderella you are in luck 
 I am your fairy godmother and I am gonna take care of everything you want 
 I know you wanna go to the ball 
 um we can do it 
she plunks her magic wand and suddenly the mice turn into horses 
um a pumpkin turns into a  uh a coach 
and um she makes up a pair of glass slippers and a dress uh for Cinderella plunks her magic wand again fixes Cinderella's hair 
Cinderella in her glass slippers gets up into the carriage and goes to the ball arriving at the ball in style with the uh carriage man who was I think  a cat 
I'm not sure 
but um in any event uh uh she forgets the fairy godmother's warning that she must be back by midnight 
uh she's having such a good time with the prince dancing 
uh the prince is obviously madly in love with her or the glass slippers 
um a I think it's the glass slippers 
anyway uh he decides that um uh this is the girl for him and she's swept off her feet when all_of_a_sudden she hears the gonging of the bell tower and realizes that it's midnight 
she rushes off um uh to get back into the carriage runs down the steps of the castle tripping losing one of her glass slippers hobbles onto the carriage 
carriage goes off 
and uh just in the nick of time the uh carriage turns back into a pumpkin the horse into mice 
and um uh Cinderella is left weeping in her shed with the animals and looking at the glass slipper uh remembering the great time she had at the ball and realizing that it's all for naught 
meanwhile  the prince has told his father he has found the woman of his dreams 
she has uh lost a glass slipper behind her 
and if he goes around  if he has his  um um um the king's advisors go around and try on  have different women try on the glass slipper he'll find h his beloved uh who must fit the slipper 
uh not realizing that uh uh eighty women in the  um in the  in the kingdom or a hundred and eighty women in the kingdom all are a size five slipper he uh is  uh uh h he acc accidently goes  uh his  um his father's advisor goes to the house of Cinderella first where they all try on  where all the girls try on the glass slipper trying to get into it 
they cannot 
and um uh they see Cinderella 
they ask her to try on the glass slipper 
sure enough it fits 
and uh she's brought back to the castle where she weds the prince 
they um uh get married lived happily ever after have three children 
um two  two boys who end up fighting over the kingdom uh thirty years later 
uh the country breaks  the kingdom breaks out into civil war 
um and is destroyed under its own weight of greed
