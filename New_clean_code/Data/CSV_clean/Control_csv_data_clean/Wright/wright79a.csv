inhales well you've got to get the bread someplace 
and then you place the bread on the table or wherever you wanna put it 
uh  you take one slice and put the peanut butter on  the bread 
then you go to the other slice of bread and you put the jelly on it 
then you fold them together and enjoy 
e a story about people or  animals in distress 
 hm the bird's up there for some reason 
I dunno what he's doing up there 
that dog must have chased him up there 
as he did th the cat 
 the girl got off her bike to try to save the cat 
 um looks like the man went up there on a ladder to save the cat 
and the ladder fell down 
I don't know how it fell down but it fell down somehow 
now the fireman's coming over 
two of them 
 in order to get the guy down from the tree 
the bird's still singing there 
exhales  um
I don't see any more to talk about 
there's a fire engine head
when I was in the army uh  like went in the  am ni when I was nineteen years old 
and after  month and a half I caught pneumonia 
I went into the hospital 
come back out after f
I spent three days in the barracks  and got double pneumonia 
went back in head
almost died 
and then I come back out_of the hospital 
and after a few days or a few weeks 
I finished my basic training 
and went out  on with life 
uh I useta work at the steel mill 
and before the steel mill closed down they constantly uh made your  they head
demoting you constantly 
until I got another job where I hadta uh cut a bail of wire in a hurry 
which I don't head
consequently I caught  I  uh I caught the tip of my finger  pulling the wire into the blades 
inadvertently my finger got stuck and I cut off the tip of my finger 
um oh what else 
oh so there's so many things 
head
 head
head
uh
my wife and I went out for breakfast head
we came home 
and she got severely head
I didn't know what it was 
she was vomiting and  moving head
I hadta call  nineoneone to get her into the hospital 
consequently she spent ten weeks in the hospital 
she had a blood clot on her lung and her leg 
almost died 
come very ver very close 
I hadta call the daughter in 
and that was about the scaredest 
she's home now and doing well 
but I didn't think she was going to head
yes head
they don't seem to let their emotions out 
and I'm 
I just  head
and I try to kid around with them to get them to come head
if that's  shrugs if that's what it is 
to help them break loose  head
 alright 
now head
this uh picture  it appears to be a fireman or somebody of a rescue nature 
um  and a girl 
in uh what appears to be a creek or a river 
um s especially fast moving water 
uh the gentleman I say gentleman because he's all muscular and looks like he's got a moustache 
is hanging from a tree branch 
which is either coming up  out_of the water 
or going into the water 
it looks as though it's coming out_of the water 
s
to keep herself from floating down the stream or river 
whatever 
uh he has a   a leather belt which he  pi I presume he's gonna put around her 
and uh maybe a helicopter or a  uh another set of rescue people  will pull her in from the precarious area she's a located at now 
looks like everything's gonna turn out  okay head
that is probably of the end of the story 
 alright 
now 
the beginning of the story is a picture of a boy  kicking a volleyball 
he seems to be having a good time 
but negligent in the fact that he doesn't know where he's kicking it 
now he's kicked it into the window  of a home 
and  by some reason he's kicked it through the window 
the ball has knocked the lamp off the table 
a f
there's  also there's stuff laying on the floor 
 uh the man now gets up 
looks out the window which  yeah he's closer so the window would it  uh the hole will look open more 
he's got the ball in his hand looking out I guess  who to blame or seeing where it came from 
hopefully the  e the story ends good where realizes he was a kid one time 
 okay 
this looks like a story between a  m uh a mother and a child 
uh
because it's raining outside 
and he'll need it 
the kid uh  as most kids are  says 
 no I don't need it 
 it's not going to rain 
 I'll be okay 
as he goes outside  it starts raining 
inhales um I don't know how far he got but it looks like he got pretty far 
because uh now there's water all over the ground where he's walking 
sighs  looks like his head's getting wet and everything else 
so  finally he hasta go in and face mother 
admit that he's wrong 
mother looks very  upset with him 
she should be 
he gets the umbrella 
goes back outside and continues on his journey wherever he was going 
looks a_lot happier 
uh okay 
m points there's a thing about that 
they  us they useta run a skit on that on  on t_v one time 
I'll tell you later 
uh  the story opens up with
and it looks to be a charge or uh whatever you call them guys 
and uh the dog is sitting beside Cinderella 
mm
through the whole story 
um the king or duke or whoever he is 
uh tells his servant uh uh make arrangements for the prince to meet with all the fairest maidens in the land 
and sends out uh notith notices that a  a party's gonna be held 
head
um meanwhile uh Cinderella gets lips_smack uh her dress out 
and all her nice clothes 
gets all dolled up 
and is getting ready to  uh to go to the ball with mother  stepmother and  uh and the s stepsisters 
enraged the stepsisters tear her dress 
and just  trash her out 
and the  stepmother seems to be enjoyed  enjoying the whole thing 
lips_smack uh after that the  Cinderella looks at the castle 
and  uh oh  sh no  that was before she j was dreaming about meeting some Prince_Charming 
 now uh she has no dress or nothing to go to the ball with 
um
and uh  turns uh a pumpkin into a coach head
a dog and a horse 
I forgot about that part of the story 
the dog and the horse into a  to the horses and the  mi uh to the   to the guys or charges whatever you wanna call them guys 
and the mice into the horses that'll pull Cinderella to the ball head
um  they all get to the ball 
and Cinderella of_course takes fanc or  uh the prince takes fancy to Cinderella over the rest of them 
 uh Cinderella was told that  uh  that everything would turn into  back the way it was at the stroke of midnight 
as the princess  uh prince head
the hour of twelve approaches 
uh Cinderella says 
 it's time to get out_of here 
in her haste and running she drops her glass slipper 
takes off with uh  the pumpkin coach and  her cohorts 
and she gets back to where she  uh she began 
and everything turns back into way it was 
um the prince despondent  that the girl ran away uh tells his servants head
 announcements were sent all over the land to try head
the girls  uh the two sisi sisters uh tried on the slipper 
uh head
they were not a match 
and eventually Cinderella tried on the slipper and uh  head
an
that's the end of the story
