I'm sorry 
okay  the woman's driving 
and she asks would they stop ask the farmer for directions 
and he tells them to  tells them the way to go 
and they didn't pay attention because now they're back around again

um you take a pot and you put like a couple of rocks in the bottom 
thick rocks 
and then you put a little bit of the new soil 
then you put your flower in 
and then you fill up the rest of it with um more soil 
and pat it down lightly 
and then you water it 
okay  um 
you take out the bread 
and um take out the peanut butter 
open it up 
um put it on the cutting board

and then I usually put jelly on the other  use the other side of the bread to put the jelly on 
put them together 
cut the crust off first 
and then cut them in half

 oh  yeah  I know Carl 
okay 
do you want me to start with the story 
okay 
okay  the mother goes out um sh  for awhile and leaves the baby home with the dog Carl 
and he waitches 
once the mom is gone the baby gets on the dog's back 
and they go out and play 
first they start in the bed 
and they  ch they jump on the bed  the mom's bed 
jump up and down 
and then they go and play with the mom's makeup 
the baby puts um makeup and jewelry on the baby  or on the dog and on itself 
and then they play down the  go down the laundry chute 
he pushes the baby down the laundry chute 
and he runs down to catch her 
and they go for a ride 
he gives her a ride on piggyback 
and then they  um they play on their rug

and they get  he goes for a little swim in the aquarium 
all things that they could never done when the mom's home 
then they do a little hiphop dancing

then they  they go and make a snack 
they go in the refrigerator and um make some  um have some bread and butter and some grapes and chocolate syrup  oh chocolate milk 
and they get into the cookie jar 
and um baby's getting kind_of tired and messy so Carl takes it up stairs 
drops in a bath 
bathes him 
gets him clean 
blow dries him off 
throws him back in the bed 
and cleans up the  goes back and cleans up the mess that they made 
straightens the bed up and the makeup 
makes sure that mom's not coming 
and just in time mom comes home and doesn't suspect a thing 
okay 
the mouse family is gonna go on a picnic 
so  they load up all their kids the back of the pickup 
and the baby one is right in the back 
and um they take off 
and the baby falls off into the um road 
and they don't notice that she's missing 
and they continue and they go about their picnic 
and are having a really good time and um swimming and dancing and playing music and um feeding the bugs and playing baseball 
and the  the baby mouse is crying feeling really sad that she missed the picnic and she's all scared and lost 
then she spots all these wild raspberries 
and so um while  meanwhile her family's back there having s cheese and milk and sandwiches and taking pictures and um sailing boats um she's getting her fill of the wild raspberries 
and so she's not so sad anymore 
and suddenly they realize that she's missing 
they lined up all their kids 
and they start freaking out and start calling for her and looking and looking everywhere 
and then some of the kids are sad that she's missing 
and so they pack up to go back  um to go look for her 
and she's laying there with a stomach ache from all the berries 
and they go back 
and she hears them coming and she says 
 hey here I am 
and they get reunited 
and they're all happy to see her 
and then they go back with the pickup just to picnic with her 
okay 
um when I was uh about  when I was like having my first child um I was not sposta get pregnant 
I  I had a big tumor a big fibroid tumor 
they told me not to get pregnant 
and uh I was gonna have surgery 
and so I was all set to have the surgery and like a week or three days before I went in for my final preop and they just hadta do a precautionary blood test 
and they found out I was pregnant 
and they were really upset with me 
and um I was thirty two years old so um I shoulda known better 
but um they told me that I would never be able to carry the baby 
I might as_well just eliminate the pregnancy 
but I just went ahead and said 
 I'll just leave it up to god 
and the whole time my doctor's like 
 don't get your hopes up 
 this baby um probably won't make it 
because I'd had like three miscarriages prior because of this tumor 
and so they told me never to go through train the  s the  um the breathing training the what's that uh Lamaze because I was gonna if I ever did have the baby it would be csection 
well  everything was fine and then she  di I just kept growing and um um nine months went by and the baby was still there 
and then I went into labor 
and at the last minute the tumor moved right to the side and she came out 
and  and so xxx uh she was never sposta have made it 
and so she was in_utero with a large fibroid  fibroid tumor 
and so uh right after  like a month after she was born I hadta have the surgery to remove it 
my wild party girl 
um well  like my sister's nanny speaks Spanish 
and so sometimes it's hard to you_know because I don't speak Spanish 
um I um will  sometimes will hafta like um act things out for her because I don't speak Spanish and her English is not that good 
and we'll like use hand signals or point to things 
and  sh and she  uh she's very nice and sweet but um somehow we end up like understanding each other 
and we just laugh about it 
you_know so 
okay  when I was  when I was a flight attendant uh at one point I flew on this really old airplane 
it was older than me 
it was built in the early fifties 
it was a Convair five eighty 
and we were landing in Aspen 
and the weather was at minimums which means we're just barely able to land 
um otherwise it got any worse we wouldn't  we'd hafta go back to Denver 
but we  I had a full airplane and we were coming into land  gpxmimics plane landing with left hand 
and um the pilots decided to go around because they couldn't see the runway 
and when they went to go around 
ges
and you can't see anything where the mountains are 
well  we were circling  coming in and they decided to go around and they didn't pull the gear up when they went around 
so  they stalled the airplane 
and what that feels like is your whole airplane is like shaking and shuttering and going like this 
and  and we could see the tops of the trees 
and somehow they put it in a nosedive to get the speed up 
and then they were able to  barely able to pull it out 
and everybody's looking at me 
and I'm the flight attendant so I hafta just smile 
and um um my crew is  normally they're allowed to make two attempts 
and they said 
 that's it we're done 
 we're going back to Denver 
 we're not even 
 we're done for the day 
and I guess the guys that work on the ramp or the one's waiting to flag us in saw  saw the airplane come in 
and they saw what happened 
and we almost crashed right over this really um s fancy area called Starwood where all the celebrities live 
Goldie Hawn and Kurt Russell and um Don Johnson they all have their homes up in Starwood 
and John Denver at the time 
 but we almost  cra they said that we  they saw us like disappear over the mountain and their hearts just went into their throats 
they were sure we were gone 
they were just waiting for the flames to come up 
but I was trying to pass out candy afterwards and  and beer 
laughs and I had this basket of candy 
and my  I was trying to act like really normal but my  the candy was popping out_of the basket you_know because my hands were like ges 
I was like  it was r really strange because it goes really in a slow motion 
it gets very slow and you think 
 okay  this is what it's like to die 
 oh  weird 
you_know  everything gets very drawn out 
that was my s laughs 
 yeah jeez 
okay  um this um picture was taken during Hurricane Ike when this girl's fa  grandmother decided they were gonna wait out the hurricane and they didn't evacuate 
and um the grandmother got swept away in the car 
and the daughter was like down the river 
and the firemen um were back doing one more uh final like check before they totally evacuated 
and they see this girl floating down the river 
and he reaches out a branch to try to save her 
and almost goes in himself but they were both safe 
and the grandmother was never found 
okay  um 
little Ricky's outside playing with a ball  soccer ball 
and he's not careful and he  he kicks it right through the window 
and um the stepdad sees the ball and knocks over  it  th it knocks over the lamp 
and he decides to punish the boy 
he will hide the ball 
and he puts it in the washing machine 
okay  um 
Ricky's gonna go to school 
and his mom says 
 you might need this umbrella 
 it  it's probably gonna rain 
 no I'll be fine 
 I don't need it 
so  he takes off walking to school 
and all a sudden it starts raining 
he covers his head and runs back getting all wet 
and his mom's unhappy with him because he's gotten wet 
she  he didn't listen to her 
so  he takes the umbrella then proceeds to school not getting any further soaked 
oh  okay 
oh  um Cinderella's father marries um the stepmother 
and um he introduces he her to hi  her daughters and the stepmother and the two stepsisters and the cat 
and um then the father goes away and the  they make Cinderella do all the chores and all the cleaning and all the dirty work 
and um um then um the  they get an invitation to a ball 
and um Cinderella wants to go 
they said 
 of_course  you can't go 
and the sisters get dressed 
and Cinderella goes into her mom's old trunk and finds um an old dress 
and puts that on and some jewelry 
and the girls  the sisters see her 
and they take it away and say 
 you can't go 
 you hafta stay here and do all our dirty work 
and so uh they go to the ball 
and then the fairy godmother shows up and dresses her up 
and gets her in the carriage and says 
 you gotta go by midnight 
and so she goes to the ball 
and everybody's like 
 who's that 
 who's that beautiful girl 
and she dances with the prince 
and  and they fall madly in love 
and then she realizes it's almost midnight so she hasta rush home 
and she rushes home and she loses her shoe on the way 
and um so uh a couple days later they're coming through the village trying to figure out whose shoe it is 
and of_course all the stepsisters try on the shoe and it doesn't fit them 
and they go 
 isn't there anybody else here 
and Cinderella comes from around the corner and they say 
 yes 
 there's one more girl 
it fits perfectly 
and then the prince shows up 
and they get married 
live happily ever after
