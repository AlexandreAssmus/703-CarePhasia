I would open the can of or  jar of peanut butter 
take a knife 
and get some peanut butter on  on the knife 
and spread it on the  ges
and then we get a spoon and  and uh take some jelly out_of the jar and spread it ges
put the other slice on the top 
that's it 
it looks like the family caught 
and the father goes up the tree to  to rescue the  the cat 
and he goes up a ladder 
and  and while he's up there somehow or other the  somehow or other the ladder fell off  fell away from the tree 
now he's  now he's stuck 
and uh the dog is barking 
he's all excited 
and a little girl uh I guess  that's his daughter is trying to coax a cat to come down 
and somebody had called the uh firemen to come out and rescue the father 
and um so they're  they're on their way to  to put up a ladder and  and get the  get the father down 
oh a good many years ago I was diagnosed with uh congestive heart failure 
and a year ago this last June 
raises
and it's always a concern of my doctors 
and  and I have diabetes 
and a year ago this last uh June I'll never forget it 
I was taking a shower on a Sunday morning getting ready to go to church 
and I've started panting 
I'd never got  got there before pants 
just over and over 
and I couldn't get it out_of that shower fast enough and get dressed 
and so I called nine  nineoneone 
and they took me into the hospital 
and um  that night I went to the bathroom 
and I  and I was vomiting throwing up 
and before I got back to my bed a nurse comes running in 
she says 
 how do you feel 
I said 
 I feel okay 
and she said 
 oh  your heart just stopped for six seconds 
and so with that that very night they put a touches
so  I've been in great shape ever since 
I exercise a_lot 
but uh I thought my time was up but got through it 
yeah 
 you_know it's a funny thing 
when  when um the nurse came in and told me that my heart had stopped I was  just went back to bed and went to sleep 
I don't have any worries about death shrugs 
um I figure that the good Lord has been really good to me for a very very long time 
so 
 I'm  I'm extremely uh fearful of heights hand
oh I'm really scared of heights 
I remember my  uh couple of my sons and my wife and I went to Holy_Lake ges
and uh we decided to take a back road back to uh where we were staying at Holy_Lake 
we'd be  gone out shopping or something 
and all_of_a_sudden there was this  this downpour like you wouldn't believe 
I_mean it was just like the whole skies had ges opened up and dropped 
and so uh we had crossed this little bridge wooden bridge 
and we couldn't get  go any further 
we noticed the water ges
I told my wife 
I says 
 hey you  you walk 
 I'm gonna back this car out very slowly 
you know what she said to me 
she says 
 if you go I wanna go with you 
I thought 
 wow laughs 
that  that bridge must've been slippery 
and I backed up very very slowly laughs 
that scared the life out_of me 
that was really scary 
 yep yep 
yes  there's a lady here 
I  uh I like to sing 
uh there's a  there's a uh operatic soprano that comes here once a month and  and leads us in group singing 
and we had a talent show 
and this uh one  one lady uh she had had a stroke at one time 
and she wanted to sing with me 
and God bless her 
I can't  I have a hard time understanding her just talking 
but we got through it 
we sang together and did something 
and  but she's a real sweet lady 
and I  I  I always have a hard time understanding her 
there is one other lady that uh is hard to understand 
but anyway shrugs they're stroke victims 
so  I guess that happens 
this little boy is uh playing out in the yard 
and he  and he kicks this 
it must be a basketball 
gives it a good kick 
and it goes right through the window of this  this house 
and uh it knocks over a lamp in this living room 
uh I don't know if it's his house or if it's a neighbor's 
but anyway the man looked like he was kind_of upset 
uh he s picks up the ball 
and he looks at the hole in the window 
and  and he's  he's probably perturbed 
that's about it  I think 
looks like this little boy is  is getting ready to go someplace 
and his mother says 
 it's  it's sposta be raining 
 it's sposta rain 
 and you better take this umbrella 
and the little boy just waves waves  waves and 
 well  nah  I don't need the umbrella 
and uh so he goes out on his  for his walk or to school or wherever 
and sure enough he gets caught in the rain and uh goes inside 
and he s looks like he's kinda down in the dumps 
and his mother is frowning at him saying 
 I told you take the umbrella 
and so uh this time he does take the umbrella and walks out in the rain 
 Cinderella I believe was kind_of a 
I believe she worked for this wealthy family if I'm not mistaken 
and she was always envious of uh  the rich the people that had a_lot more than she had 
and she wanted to go to this ball 
and um  I forget how the shoe is involved 
um  I believe she danced with this prince 
 hm  I believe she was told that if she could wear  if this shoe would fit her  she would be accepted scratches
oh_gosh 
and it did fit her 
and uh everybody was so happy 
shrugs I don't  I don't remember laughs 
flunked that part laughs
