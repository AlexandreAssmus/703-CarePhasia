well  this looks like there's going to be a little bit of a disaster 
laughs looks like Dad's up in a tree and can't get down 
it looks like he was chasing the cat up there trying to get the cat down 
dog's barking at the bottom of the tree because the cat ain't 
Dad's just sitting there going 
 oh_dear 
and then must be his daughter who's trying to catch the cat in_case he does fall down 
and there's  um yeah  evidently Dad lost his ladder 
and the firemen are coming 
and they're coming with a ladder 
and hopefully they get them laughs all down and everything is okay 
hums 
 well  this looks like they're w um out in the country  with a couple  a man and a woman in a car 
and they're driving 
you can see a farmhouse 
so  it's close to farms and in the country 
there's a farmer  by a little tree there 
and he's waving at them and saying hello 
they're waving back 
evidently they must be lost 
the man takes  took out the  um a map tongue
and then the farmer is giving them directions and pointing to where and how to get wherever they're going 
so  they take off  driving down the road 
and the farmer went back to digging the hole to plant the tree 
so  he's there alone 
laughs all_of_a_sudden in the middle of his digging there's the car again and the couple again going the same way 
and he looks very astounded and going 
 how did they get back here 
this is crazy 
he's probably thinking 
he just looks very astounded that 
 what are you doing here 
well  it's inside of a house 
and there's a couple  fighting 
it looks like she's  yelling at the man 
they're yelling back at each_other 
he's  badger he's reading a newspaper 
and she's got her coat on and her suitcase heading for the door 
evidently she's going to leave him 
and he looks all distraught  very distraught that she left 
and he's still sitting in the chair 
and then the door opens 
and there she is 
and they look at each_other 
he gets up 
she's crying 
and he opens up his arms to welcome her home 
anyway  and they're hugging at the door and everything like that 
and it looks like she crashed the car 
and he's looking towards the car going 
 wow  what happened here 
that must be why she is crying because she crashed the car 
I'm sure they'll be alright 
okay  this is bu uh about a birthday party 
and uh it looks like a young man is having a birthday party 
and people are coming in with their children 
and mom is standing there with a broom  shaking it at the dog who's hiding underneath the sofa 
and then you look over at the cake 
and guess what 
he evidently took a big chunk out_of the birthday cake 
and that's why the boy is crying and mom's gonna hit him with a broom 
but he left his pawprints going all the way underneath the couch

so  you're gonna buy a pot or those ges
so  you take it home

a whole family of them are getting into a red truck 
and uh  they're all in there 
and they're going down the road  rocky bumpy road

and he's laying there 
and he's going 
 uhoh

and uh  went and got a reasonable hotel 
and then went down on the Strip and went around for awhile 
and then we got tired 
we gambled

and then uh  got a couple hours sleep 
and then got up and then went gambling a little bit and ate some breakfast and  and stuff like that

so  we decided to take a little cruise 
and we went to the um  Bahamas

forgive me

and on the trip we saw some bunch of different  stu we had different  st a couple of different stops 
and uh got a chance to go shopping

and uh lasted about a week 
we stayed on the ship 
and shopped and ate actually 
that was about it 
so  then  then we came home 
enjoyed it

I moved but 
laughs yeah okay 
it was around Christmas time and my  uh I moved back in with my son and uh my daughter and my grandson 
and so we were kinda 
we moved into a bigger house 
and so it was kinda 
and then  uh so we had some company over 
but it was still  like the house was still a mess 
this is a true story 
and  uh so  but we enjoy 
we open presents and cooked and ate and blessed people that weren't there that have already gone on or you_know  passed on and stuff which we had a few that year 
and um just kinda 
ges
ges
said 
 we'll do this in a couple days  you_know 
so  we just did what we usually do 
it was just hectic on_account_of it was a_little scattered 
and that was it 
not really bad no 
I've just had like the flu and stuff like that and um 
oh  I brought dib nods 
okay nods 
throat
it was about seven years ago or eight years ago 
I don't even remember 
but they were playing out in the backyard 
and my grandson 
we had apartments ges
ges
okay 
but we had ges
and he was  the grandson Mike was a toddler 
and um we had just bought him one of those ges
you_know  the outside pools just to play in you_know like children 
and we all were out there 
my daughter Stacy  Jason my son  Michael my grandson  and me 
we were playing around  you_know 
and then things got a_little hectic  I'd say 
and anyway  so  we're  we were splashing each_other and everything like that and everything 
and  and somehow one of them bumped me 
and I fell in the pool 
and then my son fell on top of me 
but he had caught  what he'd done was like fell on my knee 
 so  it  it kind_of like shattered and tore the ligaments 
and  you_know  and uh fractured it actually 
and all the ligaments and everything 
and it was  j th it was so funny because we all fell like that  you_know 
we were all laughing 
and everybody's laughing 
and I'm going 
 get off me laughs 
 you_know  I'm really in pain 
 you_know  I'm really seriously in pain here 
 I'm on the bottom of this  you_know laughs 
and  um  and they thought I was just trying to get up and just kidding around 
and I go  I am started  you_know like saying 
 hey  I'm  no  seriously  something's wrong here 
you_know 
so  finally they got up 
and they  and then it just  it was like  like being a big blob in this ges
but I couldn't move my knee 
I couldn't get up 
anyway  so  they all straightened up 
and anyway  they helped me get up out_of the pool 
and then  they hadta almost carry me into the house 
then I hadta go to the emergency room because it was like you_know 
but it was just odd because you know how you're playing and laughing 
and it was such an odd accident that it was just weird 
otherwise than that just childbirth 
sure you don't wanna hear about that 
I took care um 
I have my own house cleaning business 
and I've had it for a few years which I've slowed down now 
but I useta take care of this older woman not that she was really old 
but she had a hard problem with people 
and so when I started cleaning her house because my sister worked for them 
they owned a restaurant in town 
and um she was just having a hard time communicating to anybody 
strangers coming in 
and she'd been out  she hadn't been out in a long time 
you_know  she just was getting old 
she was embarrassed 
and she didn't like people coming over 
and she couldn't get what she wanted to get done 
and she had a hard time with people 
I guess all her life 
but anyway  when I started cleaning her house 
and we really developed a very very good relationship and  with her 
with her 
yeah 
I sat and talked to her a_lot 
and I told her 
 it's okay 
you_know  I_mean I  she says she can't communicate with people 
you_know  of_course  owning restaurants for years and years and years when she was a_lot younger and her husband was alive which he had emphysema 
she was sorta like house  in the house all the time so 
but her  her daughter and son took care of the businesses 
but they overpowered her 
so  through the years she was having problems 
she didn't wanna go to the restaurant like she useta and visit the people and oversee 
I_mean  she owned them 
and I told her 
 you_know  you shouldn't be 
you_know  she was having a hard time 
I says 
 you can't be embarrassed about 
 because you can't get around as much 
 you_know  on a walker you don't want the neighbors to see ya 
 I'll roll you around in a wheelchair 
and I says 
 we can go visit your neighbors 
you_know 
that's because you got to keep communicating to   to keep your mind active  you_know 
and I says 
 you're fine with me because we developed this special friendship 
 you_know  I'm here twice a_week 
you_know  and it's easy to talk to me 
 and I'm  I'm cleaning your house 
 and  and you_know  we go  we have lunch 
 I take you to the doctor 
which she didn't like to go because she just still feels awkward 
you_know  get  getting old 
it's hard to explain 
but anyway  and I said 
 you needta  maybe we could go down to the restaurant 
you_know 
 I  you_know I got a car 
 I'll drive you 
 you get in 
we'll go visit the  you_know the girls that worked for you for like fifteen years and the people that you've known and they know you 
you_know  just trying to get her to open up and like visit or   you_know 
 it's okay if you're out in a wheelchair 
 I'll push you around 
 you need you  you've lived in this neighborhood for a long time 
people don't foresee you as crippled up old lady that  you_know is getting older 
so  we discussed those type of problems 
and settled them pretty much 
she a beautiful woman 
that would be my marriage but I ain't 
I think an accident in a car  that I was in 
my daughter was driving 
and um so we were driving down the street 
the grandson of_course is the baby 
and um we were in the car 
and um you could see this guy coming from 
we were stopped 
and then we pull up but the guy didn't stop 
so  you could see him  you_know coming towards you 
nothing you can do 
nothing 
and it's  it's  probably the s third scariest thing I think I've ever experienced because you can't do anything about it 
you cannot do anything about it 
 hello 
 hit me laughs  you_know 
anyway and the the car  ges
and I was more frightened for the  for my grandson than anything 
but that's frightening when you know you can't control 
if you cannot control  your situation like that and you know something bad is gonna hap run into you it's very difficult 
it's scary 
because you know it ges
it looks like  it looks like there's a 
I was gonna say she looks like a young child 
I don't know 
not young young but um 
she's stuck in the water 
it looks like after a flood 
she's very stressed 
scared half to death no doubt 
and um  I'd venture to guess that this would be a rescue person who's hanging on a tree limb trying to get to her 
and he's got a  he's got his life uh jacket on and stuff like that 
and they're really really struggling in this water that is just like terminal 
looks like a flash flood or something like that 
he's really trying to get a hold of her there and trying to get her going 
I couldn't tell you what the end of it is 
he ain't 
difficult time there 
well  there's a boy playing kickball   soccer outside kicking the ball around 
and he's playing and having a good time and all that and everything 
and he kicks the ball 
and it goes through a window 
and he's probably going 
 uhoh laughs 
 I'm in trouble 
and there's  in the home you can see the ball coming through 
lands  break the lamp 
a gentleman is sitting in a chair 
it's coming through there 
and he's standing up  of_course looking out the window with the ball in his hand trying to figure out who and where this ball came through 
so  I would imagine the ending would be he's gonna go out and the boy's gonna be in trouble 
it's a school morning 
and um the boy 
and he's got his backpack on 
his mom's got the umbrella in her hand because she's saying 
 it probably will rain 
 you needta take this umbrella with you 
and the boy is saying 
 no no  I'll be fine 
 it's not gonna rain 
 I'm tough 
 I'll be okay 
clears
so  as he's walking along to school or he  it starts to rain 
and he's going 
 oh_no 
then it's really starting to rain a_lot harder 
I_mean  there's even puddles 
now he's running back home 
and he went in his house 
and his mom looks like 
 well  see  I told you 
 it was gonna rain 
 you needed an umbrella 
he's standing there looking just drenched and patheticlikenadj 
 ugh 
I'm not as tough as I thought I was 
so  and then he's leaving again with the umbrella 
and he's happily walking in the rain now 
at_least he isn't getting wet 
on to school 
okay  this is the story about Cinderella who was kinda 
and she had a stepmother and two stepsisters 
that she was in this family   this family and everything 
but the stepmother treated the stepsisters very good and treated her very bad 
I_mean  she hadta clean everything 
she hadta do all the work 
and she was just treated like  no good 
and so anyway  so  that's the way it went all the time 
it was continually 
there was nothing she could do about it 
but she enjoyed the  the animals 
you_know  the dog and the cat and the mouse and 
she was just very nice  young lady 
did what she was sposta do 
and then um  there was a ball coming up that they were all invited to the whole family 
and  um but the stepmother wouldn't let her go 
she said she hadta stay home and clean the fireplace  and do chores and that she could not go 
it didn't matter 
so  while the  step the stepmother and the two stepsisters were getting all ready to go and got all new dresses and jewelry and you_know were getting all ready to go to it she got really sad 
she was very sad very very sad 
and then  um  so the stepmom and two stepsisters left to go to the ball 
and this was a prince's ball 
it was actually a king's ball but  I_mean  you_know 
and um so she went outside 
and I believe she was probably crying 
and then the um like fairy godmother came along and was sitting out in the garden and everything 
and was talking to her and says 
 you_know  do you wanna go 
 we'll make it so you can go and everything 
 I'll fix everything with my magic wand laughs 
anyway  and uh so she ges
and she had this beautiful dress that you_know appeared on her and beautiful shoes and ges
I can't think of what that thing is 
tiara and everything 
and then she  they went outside 
and they turned the mice and pumpkins into this great big beautiful carriage with horses and with like a pumpkin carriage and everything for her to go and  you_know 
so  she got in the carriage 
and  uh but the fairy godmother said 
 you hafta be back  by twelve midnight 
 you_know you really hafta be back 
 don't be late 
 you hafta be back 
she's 
 okay I won't 
 I won't 
she was all excited 
and she looked so beautiful and everything 
and she was gonna have a good time and everything 
and um they went on to the ball at the king's palace and all that 
and then she met the prince 
and they danced 
and they just really really liked each_other very very much 
you could tell 
so 
and everything 
so  she was out dancing and talking to him and the stuff like that 
and then it rang at twelve midnight 
she's 
 I gotta go 
 I gotta go 
and he's 
 don't go 
 don't go 
 I don't want you to go 
and she you_know ran down the steps to get to her you_know coach and that 
and she dropped one shoe 
they were like glass slippers 
and um so she dropped one and he picked it up 
and then she was gone  you_know 
I_mean  she hadta get home 
and everything turned back to ges
and she was just  to herself while she was doing her chores  you_know 
how you  and thinking about that and talking to her little animals the little mouses 
and came a knock at the door 
and it was the prince and the uh people from the palace 
and uh they  uh  they were looking around to see  they were going all over the town looking for whoever this shoe should belong to  you_know the glass slipper actually 
and uh they were trying it on everybody 
and of_course  they tried it on the stepsisters 
and they had all these  you_know there's no way they could cram their foot in there 
and they  it didn't fit either one of them 
and then they said 
 well then who is she  you_know 
 oh she's nothing 
 you don't hafta do it for her 
and he said 
 no we're gonna try everybody 
so  she sat down 
he tried on the slipper  the prince tried on the slipper 
and it fit 
and they were just astounded 
I mean  I think that they're all gonna have a stroke or something laughs  you_know 
but anyway 
so  he found his princess and she found her prince 
and they got married and live  lived happily ever after 
I'm not a good storyteller
