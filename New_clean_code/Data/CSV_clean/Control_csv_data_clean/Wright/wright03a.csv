when I was was  a time that I was really sick 
there would only be one instance in my life when I had surgery for malignant melanoma in the middle of my back uh fifteen  years ago or longer 
I had never seen it 
it was discovered by my skin doctor when I went in for a rash 
I was in the hospital with surgery within four days 
was in the hospital ten days 
had skin grafts 
losing a section of my skin on my back that was about the size of a small saucer 
the skin grafts were taken from my left hip 
um I don't know which was worse pain  the wound in back or the skin grafts on my hip 
but you can't hardly get comfortable in bed 
you just sleep under lights that dry up the uh skin wounds 
and then that was   I was out_of the hospital 
I was back at work within six weeks um  with still the sort_of a semi open wound over my spine in the back which they could not close for two years because your skin does not heal for two years 
in order to close the wound on the back they inserted balloons that forced my skin to grow around the scar that they were removing so that they could cut out the scar take the flaps of skin close them back over the um original scar wound 
and so I had for about six weeks a lump on my back where they were infloating 
that was done and I had ten years with an oncologist 
and now I have a clean bill of health 
that's about all I can remember  laughs 
as far as their speech is concerned I  I had a husband who had a stroke and had cognitive reasoning problems that made it difficult for him to understand what I was saying or under 
he knew who I was but he did not connect with what I was saying 
and when people came to visit him in the hospital we had the same problems 
now he could communicate reasonably well but he did not comprehend so his communication was  ta it was just difficult 
uh oh he was in therapy for uh 
and I useta watch 
uh he was given many many tests ges
ges
ges
he was to write elephant 
ges
a great deal of therapy 
and was um really doing fairly well 
six weeks after the uh stroke 
so  I had him back home by that time 
and he was doing reasonably well 
mhm 
 did you do some  when you were communicating with him 
uh no  I did not hafta do anything 
they just um gave me instructions on always ges
and he had hearing aids 
 ges
and that sort of thing just to help him 
no  because by the time he was home and an outpatient uh he was doing  he ges
and it was  it had affected his swallowing and that head
so  so  there was some speech difficult only because of the swallowing 
that was about my only experience with 
I'm sure there were many instances when I was frightened 
um hm 
but not  certainly I was afraid but not a terrified type of fright 
um maybe like boo scared but not hysteria  hysteria scared 
it's  that's a hard  that's a real hard question 
I have been afraid when I'd been dreaming because I was lost 
but that was a dream not  and I always seem to get out_of it 
let's see  what ever  where would I have been lost 
I have been lost but not afraid 
it hasta be  hasta have the fear 
hm
I certainly worked in a very large industrial plant where there were certainly dangerous situations all around with mechanics and equipment and furnaces 
but um 
it's not anything that was  uh it's not scary because you are trained to cope with that but you are working constantly around large equipment 
and I think probably many times since I was a supervisor I was probably more concerned about a young man working on one of the drill presses or on a lathe that would lose a finger or was injured by uh a grinder or something happening to one of the men uh that worked for me 
and then the furnaces in a large plant it's always a concern 
um an industrial plant is  is something to be very cautious 
not t to be fearful of but to be cautious about your people who are working for you and also that your own behavior you don't do stupid things 
um and I worked midnights which was 
I was the only female in the plant 
and that still was not a fearful situation 
but it was not a situation that you were not always cognizant of where everybody was and the machinery was working 
and we never had an accident we never had a fire we never had 
we had a blizzard 
um but uh they would have never left me alone with 
I_mean they  they picked me up at the plant took me back home 
but not  that was probably the most fearful or frightening situation that I was ever in 
but it wasn't  it was not something that would impair your ability to carry on the job 
you were just more aware of what was going on around you because there was just a_lot_of mechanical equipment and dangerous electrical and that sort of thing 
but that was about the only situation that I was ever in that was ever  might  might have been life threatening but certainly never was 
but it was an interesting experience 
no  it was when I worked in the automotive industry back East 
yeah  no  there  we don't have any really heavy equipment 
matter of fact Boeing is here but 
 oh yes 
oh we had terr 
oh Ohio ugh 
from Ohio okay 
we had  gee it was terrible 
we were  sno we hadta shut down all the furnaces in the plant 
and then of_course they  we let th all the people go 
the only people who hadta stay of_course was the management 
but then they would not even let us get in our cars 
they actually brought emergency equipment in to take us when they fin 
well  we hadta shut down all all the heat treat 
we hadta shut down the entire plant for four days 
in 
it was outside of Columbus in a town called Newark Ohio with the Wabco_International_Automotive_Operations_Plant outside of Newark Ohio 
big plant 
where 
oh Cleveland sure 
that's an industrial city 
yeah 
yeah  you have lake effect 
lots of it up there 
 yeah oh yeah oh yeah 
I had lived here for many years 
got my masters degree ges

hm 
uh then the next scene the baby is obviously in the hallway or in the bathroom is sitting on the edge of the laundry chute 
the basket of clothes is beside the laundry chute 
the dog after seeing the baby sitting on the edge of the laundry chute runs  way down the stairs down into the top of the basement stairs 
look at the baby who's sitting happily on top of the dirty laundry after having fallen all the way down the laundry chute 
goes down into the basement 
the baby gets back on his back 
and they go back upstairs 
and he starts across the floor running pellmell 
sliding on a rug which then upsets a table in the living room 
scatters  scatters uh papers all over the floor 
and then goes up to the large aquarium  that in one picture is sitting beside a window and in the next picture the window is not there anymore 
anyway 
the baby and the dog look at the aquarium 
the next thing you see he has the baby by the shirt and he's ducking 
and that baby is paddling along with his nose barely out_of the water through all the fishies in the aquarium 
the next thing the dog has the baby out_of the aquarium sitting on the rug and has turned  on the music

the dog fills it full of Hershey's chocolate syrup 
then pours the milk in on top of the syrup 
um the next baby is in a jar  a red jar with a lid that the dog takes off 
um the next the baby is sitting in the middle of the floor with the butter and the bread and the red jar and the Hershey syrup and the bottle of milk 
it is now four o'clock in the afternoon and the kitchen floor is pretty much of a mess 
and so is the baby with chocolate all over him all over the floor 
there's cookies out_of the cookie jar on the floor

same routine as in the aquarium 
puts soap on the wash rag and has a mouth full of soap 
scrubs the baby off 
the baby is sitting with the soap in his hand while the dog has the wash rag in his mouth and is getting the baby cleaned up 
then he takes a hair dryer somehow turns  plugs in and turns on the hair dryer to dry the baby 
and then gently nudges the baby back over the edge of the railing in his crib 
all that you see is the diaper and feet sticking out 
and the dog is 
I can't s tell what the dog is doing 
eating something it looks like 
picking up the trash and putting it in the green trash can in the kitchen 
licking up the milk from the floor of the kitchen 
uh rushes over to the window to look out 
putting his feet this time on a stool looking out 
nothing yet 
runs back into the bedroom 
makes the bed up very quickly 
goes back puts the powder puff back in the little powder box 
look  run and looks back out the window this time putting his paws on the window 
mother is coming back 
no purse this time just a coat and the red gloves

and the mother says 
 good dog  Carl 
this story begins with a whole family of mice coming out_of their house uh and climbing into their big red truck 
there's a  it looks as if there are either two blind mice or there are two grandparents a mother a father and several babies 
and one baby is carrying his doll which is sort_of a pink mouse 
they all get inside the big red truck 
and they start up a very very steep hill 
they go across country 
and all_of_a_sudden they hit very deep rough rocky road 
and baby mouse in the back goes bouncing out still clutching his  her  its pink doll 
and all_of_a_sudden looks up from the middle of the road laying on its back with its doll and watches the truck disappearing off into  in into the horizon where it's watching it disappear 
the mouse family arrives at a lovely big glen with lovely big shade trees and flowers and decide this is the spot for their picnic 
so  they all pile out_of the big red truck carrying the picnic basket the tables the various and sundry items that they need for the picnic 
they spread the table down 
they're beside a pretty little pond with a diving board dock 
they're dancing they're playing they have musical instruments 
the   either the grandfather or the blind mouse has a white cane 
they have a big basket of food 
they have a Thermos jug with um a beverage it must be iced tea 
the little mouse with the red cap is dancing with the little girl mouse 
and they're all having an absolutely wonderful time 
the next scene they're playing the instrument 
the mother and the father are sitting on the edge of the picnic cloth on the ground 
all  the beautiful picnic is all laid out 
the mother or the  f the grandparents are up on the side of a small hill playing music 
the kids are playing baseball 
somebody is swinging from a tree over the brook 
and then we flash back to the baby who got bounced out_of the truck who has still got his ladybug by his side and his doll his pink doll 
he looks all around 
doesn't see much 
doll is upside down but he's still hanging onto him 
all_of_a_sudden spots a whole bush full of red  berries or flowers 
I would assume maybe berries because the flowers on the page look like flowers 
back to the picnic 
everybody is having a wonderful time 
the picnic baskets have now been opened 
they're taking pictures of one another 
one of the baby mice is jumping off of the dock into the water 
they're  two or three of them are playing in the water 
somebody is sailing a boat 
the baseball glove is now laying on the ground 
mother is pouring milk 
one of the babies is in the salad 
another one is eating watermelon 
and now the mother is calling to the children out in the water that are playing um to come in and eat 
uh grandmother with glasses on is taking a picture of grandfather 
back to the baby mouse who now has spotted 
the lost baby mouse has now spotted the red berries 
and since it's getting to be meal time he begins eating the red berries 
all_of_a_sudden we're getting ready now with everybody lined up beside the picnic 
all the food is out 
we count noses and we're minus a kid 
we're minus a mouse the smallest mouse 
the red hat is there grandmother and grandfather are there mother and daddy are there  various and sundry other folk in the family are there 
the picnic is all ready to be eaten 
no baby 
um now they start looking 
they look under rocks and in the water 
and there's a frog now in the pond 
somebody else is looking in the patch of weeds 
they are crying 
they're looking under rocks 
they're looking behind the grass 
no baby 
so   the mouse family picks up the entire picnic 
and heads back for the big red truck up on the bumpy road 
meanwhile  down the road is baby mouse flat on his back full of red berries with his baby  his pink baby fuzzy animal sitting beside him 
his doll his baby his stuffed animal 
everybody is loaded back into the red truck now 
and we haul off back down the road 
and we go down the  down the country lane 
and we start back down the steep road 
and all_of_a_sudden baby mouse in the grass hears something 
and starts towards the noise 
and runs into the middle of the road 
and here comes the red truck with the entire family group shouting and hollering and telling him hello and the red hat is flying in the air and they have found the baby 
they are all hugging and kissing the baby and having such a good time 
and then all_of_a_sudden goodness gracious throws his hands up to his head and says 
 oh_my_goodness I forgot my my teddy bear or my baby stuffed animal 
takes off through the grass again 
finds his baby 
picks it up 
gives it a love 
runs back to the group that has now spread the picnic table out again and is once again getting ready to have a picnic 
this time with a found baby mouse and his toy
