girl's cat went up a tree 
her dad went up to get the cat 
the dad got stuck 
the fire department hadta come and get them both out 
get out the bread 
you put it on a plate 
inhales you
you take a knife 
you spread it onto one piece of bread 
you take out the jelly 
take the knife 
spread the jelly onto the other piece of bread 
put the pieces of bread together 
cut the sandwich in half 
like I had flu symptoms 
I started throwing up 
inhales I got a plane 
flew it crosscountry 
thought I was better 
inhales got more si
strep throat feeling 
fever 
chills went on for days 
inhales started to get better again 
developed a cough 
went to the doctor 
he said it was a respiratory inspection 
 inhales I have an uncle who's from rural Appalachia 
inhales and he has no teeth 
and he s has a thick thick accent 
inhales and chews chewing tobacco 
and when he speaks inhales  it sounds like a long slur of almost vowels when he mumbles 
inhales it's almost impossible to discern what he's saying 
you just hafta listen really intently 
I'm kind_of useta the accent 
inhales um if you're not useta the accent 
you're not familiar with it 
inhales between the lack of teeth
so  I was river rafting in West Virginia 
and there's this part when you get out_of a raft and jump into a hydro 
which is like a whirlpool that sucks you to the bottom 
inhales if you jump into the whirlpool 
even with the lifejacket on 
it'll suck you down to the bottom of the river 
inhales normally it spits you up five to ten feet after it sucks you down 
inhales if you hit if just perfectly you can ride the hydro the entire length of the hydro 
inhales and it takes you up about fifty feet 
inhales well I was about the fifth person to do it 
the first four people jumped in and popped up ten feet later 
inhales I jumped in 
hit it perfect 
and it carried me down to the bottom 
dragged me along 
inhales started to pop me up about ten feet 
and sucked me back down 
inhales an
thought I was coming back down 
I was about foot from the surface 
could see the light 
and I got sucked all the way back to the bottom for about another forty feet 
inhales I thought I was gonna drowned 
inhales had a lifejacket on 
it sucked me to the bottom 
 so  there was a girl who got caught in a river 
um  doesn't look like a flood 
looks like e she maybe fell in a river because they're not taking boats or anything 
inhales and there's what looks like either a cop or a fireman 
inhales um he's got a harness to safety equipment to safety lines 
and he's wearing a lifejacket 
inhales and he's trying to get out into the river to rescue the girl 
 lips_smack a kid was going to school 
his mother told him to take an umbrella 
he insisted he didn't wanna bring the umbrella 
he didn't need it 
inhales he went to school 
inhales it started raining 
inhales he got upset and came home and was soaking wet 
inhales his mother was upset that she  di he didn't listen to her 
inhales he changed into dry clothes took the umbrella and left 
inhales a kid was playing soccer 
he kicked his soccer ball through the window 
inhales it hit a lamp 
broke the lamp 
the guy inside the house jumped up 
grabbed the soccer ball 
and looked out to see who kicked it

there's a man who had a daughter named Cinderella 
he was a widower
