depending on the requirements of the eater you may cut off the crusts  or not 
you butter the bread in my opinion 
then you put on peanut butter 
and then you put on the jam 
and uh then you put the other buttered slice of bread on top hand
and ges cut it in any way you so desire

we have a man stranded in a tree 
because apparently he went up the tree to retrieve the cat 
because a little girl was crying because a cat was up in the tree 
and uh lips_smack after the man climbed in the tree his ladder fell down 
a dog came along and is barking up the tree 
and the firemen come with a ladder to rescue the man 
and I'm assuming everything ends up okay 
the end 
well  the most recent episode is a broken bone 
but it was  head
I uh  had been having pai
the more I walked the more it hurt 
but I really just kind_of ignored it 
I was more concerned about my right foot with the toe nail looking like it was lifting off the bed 
and I didn't quite know what to do about this 
so  I made a appointment with the foot doctor 
but my foot doctor is in Waukegan  lips_smack Illinois 
and uh let's see 
how did that work 
 sighs oh_boy 
we came  we came directly from  we had been on a  c a cruise 
and we had visited our children in  in Orlando 
and we came directly from Orlando to Waukegan  so I could see the foot doctor 
 lips_smack a
but anyway when I finally got to the foot doctor uh she just explained that the
so  she just ges
took half a ges
that was done 
and then I casually mentioned laughs that my left foot was hurting 
an
an
and that led to xrays 
which showed there was a small broken bone 
eh which led to my having to wear a boot for a month 
and then come back  for more xrays 
so
then I turned arou
more xrays 
and the stupid thing is not healed yet which is  usual for me 
because this whole scenario happened once before 
and uh she says 
 another month with the boot 
 lips_smack an
and I forgot to do it 
no  I did it yesterday 
and uh  lips_smack she also told me that when I came  ba when I would be coming back th the end of this month she would not be there because her husband was  taking a job somewhere else 
and of_course she's following him 
lips_smack and nice thing about the visit is k I really like that foot doctor as a person 
and she's pregnant 
and she's gonna have her second child 
and I thought that was real nice 
but anyway I said 
 well  since you're not gonna be here in a month I will get a foot doctor in Arizona 
so  that's where I am now 
I'm waiting for this stupid foot to heal 
the end 
oh_my 
let's see 
right 
first I hafta think frightened or scared 
lips_smack  ges
lips_smack um  we had  uh in the bathroom was a crawl not a crawl space  was a  a  ges  laughs a cubicle 
I don't know how to describe it 
ges you had your linen closet 
ges and then underneath the linen  linen closet was an open area 
eh which had a uh ges uh area inside of it to get to the plumbing i in the bathtub 
and we used that open area for uh a dirty clothes
except there head
and for a reason I don't remember  lips_smack the children  told me that there was a big animal  looking out_of this  ges area 
so
 well  hand
but nevertheless I closed the bathroom door so this animal couldn't get out 
and then we  we went outside 
and we saw
I'm not sure
with its hand
looking out at us from the uh  ges air vents I guess you call those  that are in the uh  ges foundation of the house 
lips_smack and that really scared me 
I thought 
 if that thing gets in the house eh or gets out it could bite the kids 
 and it might be rab rabid 
um so  I called the  animal shelter  I think it was 
lips_smack laughs and they told me that they  everybody was on lunch 
lips_smack and so they wouldn't be there for an hour 
which
because if someone gets bit I will sue the city 
lips_smack so
and uh the uh men uh were not happy to see this
because he really looked hand
and they ges took off the vent 
and somehow they caught him 
lips_smack and then they discovered  I believe this is   they discovered  a nest of baby opossums 
which all looked very cute 
when they're babies they're  ges all kinds of babies look cute 
so  anyway they took the opossum and babies away 
and the story ended happily ever after laughs 
okay 
well  my mother had a stroke 
and uh but thank the good lord that he
uh so  I was able  you_know we were able to communicate with no problem 
but I remember one time again uh living in my own home in  in Waukegan 
um  my neighbor who  who was going to be my husband 
but of_course hand
uh he  w he rents out a uh I call it a garage 
it was
so  anyway  he rents out the garage and there's uh uh Spanish speaking couple there 
points
lips_smack lips_smack and the lady comes over to my house  and somehow communicated to me that she had locked herself out_of her house 
lips_smack an
lips_smack so
and I don't  I c didn't have any children that would ges
and I don't even remember if the kids were home 
but then I took her head
and spoke Spanish 
lips_smack and so then we found out for sure what the problem wa
and I volunteered to take the lady to work 
and that wouldn't  wasn't feasible 
because she hadta have her i i_d 
which was ges locked in the house 
so  then we went down the street further laughs uh where I knew a ges
and laughs we got this  uh asked this child to help 
but of_course he answered the door very cautiously 
and told us that he couldn't come out_of the house 
because he's not allowed to come out_of the house when mom and dad aren't home 
 hand
 well  when mom gets home laughs come and see us 
so  wasn't too long mom came home 
he comes up the street 
he climbs in her ges
and end of story again laughs 
 hm  lips_smack well I'm ready 
uh this  uh  this looks like a  a  uh a picture of a flood 
lips_smack uh and of a  girl I would say rather than a young woman uh kind_of trapped in the  in the uh flood 
and a fireman or some kind  other kind of rescue personnel is tr going to try to rescue her 
he's hanging on for dear life to a limb 
and he's got what looks like a belt over an arm 
perhaps to put around the uh lips_smack girl to rescue her 
 and this looks like it could be an actual picture of a real happening 
lips_smack the end 
 okay 
I'm ready 
lips_smack uh we have a boy playing outside with what looks like a soccer ball 
and he kicks the soccer ball 
which goes  through a window of_course breaking the window 
knocks over a lamp 
uh which startles a man who is sitting in a chair 
and the man gets u
an
and he's looking out through the broken window 
and that's the end of this story 
oh 
laughs okay 
lips_smack we have a child  a mother holding an umbrella and a child who I would guess is going to school 
because it looks like he's got a backpack on 
and he's telling her 
 hand
 hand
 hand
and mom's not too happy about this 
but she lets him go 
and he waves hand
and he goes outside 
and of_course it starts raining 
lips_smack and uh he's running back home through the puddles 
and getting all wet points
and he's holding his head 
and he goes in the house 
and mother's not happy 
lips_smack because he's standing there dripping 
uh and then the next picture shows him back outside with an umbrella 
and he has miracasly 
the end 
lips_smack well of_course I know the Cinderella story 
um w we start out with uh Cinderella's father remarrying uh to a  woman who uh turns out to be oh a mean stepmother 
and she has two daughters who she dotes on 
and they also are mean 
and um lips_smack a father goes off on a business trip or something or other 
and he
he doesn't return 
so  Cinderella is stuck with Stepmother and two mean stepsisters 
and she waits on the stepsisters 
and no matter what she does it isn't right 
and um lips_smack she looks  Cinderella can look out her window and see the castle where the prince  and I assume the king and queen live 
and um  lips_smack  the
because he's getting up in age 
and he hasn't married 
and they're telling him head
so  they
lips_smack and uh invitations are sent to every  every house 
and uh Stepmother and Stepsisters and Cinderella are all excited about this lovely ball that they're going to go to 
and Cinderella uh gets a  a lovely dress out_of a trunk 
and the uh stepsisters get all dressed 
and uh Cinderella's helping them with everything 
at_least in this book she gets a dress out_of the trunk 
but head
but anyway she helps ths the girls  the ladies get dressed 
and um lips_smack she of_course is planning on going 
but Stepmother and Stepsister say 
 no way 
 you cannot go 
an
and Cinderella is in tears
and uh she's sitting by the fireplace and um the cinders and so forth 
and Fairy_Godmother comes along and tells us  asks Cinderella if she would like to go to the ball 
and of_course Cinderella says 
 yes 
but she hasn't got any way to go 
and  and uh she s was told to stay home 
but Fairy_Godmother does her magic ges
and um lips_smack Cinderella has another ges
and uh the fairy godmother turn
and mice into horses 
I think it's mice into horses 
and ges somebody turns into I guess whatcha would call  a coachman 
and they ges
and uh she's the belle of the ball 
lips_smack and the prince is taken with her 
and they're dancing and so forth 
and then all_of_a_sudden it's almost midnight 
which is when the fairy godmother told Cinderella she hadta be back home 
becau
and the coach would ges disappear 
and all that kind of thing 
so  she goes ges
and as she's running away she drops a glass slipper 
lips_smack and she gets home 
and then the uh  prince and his footmen are going around trying the glass slipper on everyone to see whom it fits 
and uh the wicked 
well  I'm not sure if they were wicked 
but they sure were mean 
 uh stepsisters tried to jam their foot in the glass slipper 
and of_course it didn't uh fit 
and uh s
and he tries the slipper on her 
and it fits 
and they get married 
and they ges live happily ever after
