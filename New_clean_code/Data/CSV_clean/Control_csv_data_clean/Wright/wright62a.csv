apparently a birthday uh uh celebration is planned 
and uh there is a cake with four candles on the table 
um we see on the right uh two women uh uh one already in  in the room the other entering through the doorway 
and each has a child 
the women already inside has a little boy 
and the women just entering is with a little girl 
both of  both children who are entering uh have wrapped presents presumably for the party 
um when we check the cake we can see that some creature has apparently taken a big portion of it a pretty good size portion of it 
and uh there are pieces of cake on the table 
there are also obviously pieces of cake leading to what we percieve  what we see as a dog sort_of hiding underneath the sofa 
and the hostess apparently the women who's giving the party is standing there facing the dog 
she has a broom in her hand 
she appears to be very angry 
and the  uh the birthday boy uh laughs we can't tell what he's doing 
he seems to be w 
I can't tell weather he's wiping his eyes 
his  mou hi his uh mouth is wide open apparently uh to call or do something 
and looks as though the woman  the woman looks as though she really wants to kill that dog with her broom 
oh my favorite food laughs 
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
my way or the common way 
laughs well  we hafta start out with good bread not just cheap old Wonder bread which is hardly bread at all 
but use a good bread 
sometimes it's nice to toast it first 
uh on the other hand it's not necessary 
it's whatever you feel like at the time 
well  uh having prepared the bread the next thing we do is to start spreading 
my way of making the best peanut butter sandwich there is is to spread the peanut butter first 
others do it differently but this is how I recommend it 
it works better 
spread  uh spread the 
this way you can control the amount of peanut butter that goes onto the bread 
well  after that um a little bit of butter 
not too much but some 
uh tends to help uh make the thing a little bit m more moist than usual 
and on top of that goes the jelly 
now uh having done so  what a_lot_of people fail to have ever learned is uh you_know regardless of how much uh bread and butter and jelly you already have peanut butter will tend to stick to the roof of your mouth 
well  there's an easy way around that 
most people don't know my special secret 
my special secret is lettuce 
nice uh leaves of iceberg lettuce 
just a couple is just right to do it 
and it makes the most delicious peanut butter and jelly sandwich you ever had 
I got a_lot of them but I can tell you  I'll tell you this one 
um when the Korean_War started uh I was twenty one and One_a 
and um in order to avoid being drafted and finding myself uh in a  in  ar in a stinky rice paddy uh shooting people uh I arranged or  I  I applied for the Air_force's uh Aviation Cadet program 
um and uh I was  I was appointed 
I finally got an appointment to an air  air cadet class 
this was at a civilian contract school in Moultrie Georgia 
and uh in those times 
well  I never did uh do well with alcohol but I had enough experience with it to know that it was something that I should avoid 
uh in the  I was still in the  in the  within the very first  uh I guess  it was just the first phase of  of training 
uh I had already d had some flying instruction 
and uh I awoke one Saturday morning 
uh no  actually it was a Sunday morning 
I awoke feeling hungover 
I knew the hungover feeling 
uh but I had not had  I had not had anything to drink for a very long time even then 
I was only in my twenties 
and uh I thought 
 boy_oh_boy this is terrible 
so  I kind_of stayed ar you_know just  I hung back all day 
Monday morning came and I still felt hungover 
well  I knew that I didn't feel well enough to fly 
I was not safe 
so  I put myself into sick call 
well  this was  this was a civilian contract flying school 
and they had a f infirmary but only a  you_know it wasn't  it wasn't a hospital 
so  I found myself in the infirmary 
well  I wasn't feeling too good but I wasn't feeling quite as bad as I had 
you_know  little by little it sort_of left 
and it got to the point where you_know the doctors would come in they'd looked at me and they'd say 
 well  you don't have any jaundice but your liver and your uh s uh spleen are enlarged 
 and we know there is something very very wrong going on internally 
 we don't know what it is 
well  laughs story 
uh we even  I  I  I  I felt good enough at or for  after awhile that I  you could even played a little bit of wheelchair football 
but then one of the medics came in and he said 
 okay 
he says 
 I'sd 
and I said 
 no you're not 
he said 
 yes I am 
he says 
 don't worry  sir 
he says 
 I givesd 
and I thought 
 oh  not another one 
well  he did 
didn't seem to make very much difference 
upshot of it all was that they gave up 
they didn't  they couldn't begin to imagine 
they had never seen a situation like this with an  with a  uh an uh enlarged and palpable liver palpable spleen and no jaundice 
it wasn't anything they had ever seen before 
next thing you know I was sitting in the back of a  s of a uh staff car uh being driven from there down to the uh Tyndall Air Force Base in uh Tallahassee Florida 
well  they put me in there 
they still didn't know 
you_know lots_of poking around uh but finally they just said 
 okay  you are  you are confined to just bed rest 
 don't get out_of bed 
 except to go to the bathroom 
okay 
well  it got pretty boring 
and I was feeling pretty good 
so  I'd wander around at night 
and you_know I'd have the buddies over in the next ward or something like that 
we'd have visit 
or I'd get the nurses to give me ice_cream or something like that 
well  one morning the flight surgeon came around 
didn't find me in my bed 
he was very disappointed 
and when I returned from wandering around visiting my buddies I was feeling pretty good 
he said 
 if you get ou 
he says 
 if ever I catch you out_of bed again 
he says 
 that's court marshal 
 that's the story 
well  it turned out that there was a new disease that they  nobody knew anything about 
the year would have been nineteen fifty one 
and the disease is called infectious mononucleosis 
you get it from kissing 
hm that was that girlfriend I had back in town 
back  up there in Moltrey 
that's what it was 
okay  that was the adventure 
however  end of the story 
uh one year later  a li little over a year later I found myself in Korea 
and I was  uh I  f I  fe I felt the needta go to the uh flight surgeon uh for another slight malady known as crabs 
you get them from toilet seats  over there 
this is in Korea 
lo_and_behold it was the same flight surgeon who I met the year before 
and we had a good laugh 
that's the story laughs 
yes 
I think I already have 
not at all 
I have a hearing problem 
and uh you wonderful people here in the speech clinic at ASU uh uh gave a  uh uh uh a workshop over time it was several weeks where we come over and we'd learn all about hearing loss 
well  it ended up with me being a regular patient here 
and uh what I derived from it was I learned all about my hearing loss 
well  uh even now uh I find that many people particularly young women uh they've been taught to talk through their nose real fast 
and that's what they do 
imit
and I hafta say to them 
 excuse_me I have a hearing problem 
 it's not your problem it's mine 
and uh after several times of asking them to repeat what they said I've had  I  I explain that 
 I have a hearing problem 
 I don't understand what you just said 
 now if you would be kind enough please to s speak a_little more slowly and perhaps put some space between your words then I'll not hafta  uh then I'll not hafta ask you continually to repeat yourself 
 okay 
that's how I handle that 
you bet I have 
the beginning is uh this occured in  um laughs this occurred in uh Louisiana 
I was stationed in England Air Force Base in Alexandria Louisiana 
and um uh we were then flying 
I was a fighter pilot 
we were then flying the  sw the uh swept wing version of the Fl eighty four known as the Fl eighty four Fl 
uh and we were  um we had been out or  uh on a  you_know a series of missions 
uh and we were just returning to the base 
well  uh actually I was by myself 
I was flying solo not in formation with anybody 
it was  it was just a  uh just a regular training flight to add hours to my log book and that of the airplane 
and also proficiency 
just practice 
practice this practice that 
well  uh in those times we  uh uh we had a  a flying pattern where we would approach the end of the runway at uh three hundred and forty knots air speed 
when directly over the air  when we were directly over the end of the runway we'd cut our power back ges
and uh uh that was called the downwind leg at a hundred and eighty degrees 
after that the airplane is slow enough so_that we would  uh we would have not have touched the throttle 
in other words it cut power completely 
and just bring it on around ges
well  um the  uh th um the  the legs of the  of a  f of the pattern are called the approach 
hundred and eighty degrees the downwind 
ninety degrees from that is the base 
and f f following that is the final 
so  it's just frel if  ges
well  here I am on the base leg with no power 
all the garbage is out 
we call it garbage 
the speed brakes the flaps and the landing gear 
and all_of_a_sudden I'm about I don't know  three four hundred feet off the ground 
no  m more than that maybe five six seven eight hundred feet 
something like that 
I'm not really sure 
the airplane started to shutter 
uh shuttering is the sign of a stall 
that means the air  w when an  when an airplane stalls it means it's falling out_of the sky 
and I knew immediately people do not survive these  a situation like this 
and yet I automatically didn't even  I  I almost didn't have time to think 
but I knew that it was very likely that I would end up as a fireball with a bunch of wreckage off the end of the runway 
I didn't want that to happen 
well  what did I do 
I gave it full power which did not catch in time 
I pulled in the  the landing gear 
I pulled in the speed brakes and left the flaps alone 
well  with low r_p_m there was not sufficient hydraulic pressure to pull in the speed brakes so they remained extended 
what happened then is that I brought the airplane down 
I overshot the runway 
but I wouldn't  I did manage to get it into a position where it was parallel to the runway off to one side 
and um laughs the Fl eighty four Fl has a  a yaw characteristic at full stall which mean that th the nose will turn thirty or forty degrees either to the left hand
you can't predict it but it will do that 
later it was shown that you could see where the four or five foot high grass was blown back by such power as I had in the tailpipe because its a jet 
and you could also see where the grass was carried forward ges
well  pretty soon there came the ground 
in retrospect I can remember very well that the  the horizon was jumping up and down 
and the airplane did yaw but it still kept going in the same direction ges
it yawed 
and as I say uh I remember the horizon bouncing up and down but my recollection of it was that it was so smooth I could have been painting it on 
well  eventually it did  it did uh come to rest 
it had  the  it had yawed to the right so_that at full power the engine was or  the tailpipe was pointing at the mobile unit at the end of the runway which is frequently in  pla which is always in place uh for the purpose of making sure people don't land wheels up 
well  laughs they about panicked 
well  at which I followed the proper procedures 
uh I cut all power turned everything off 
and with my parachute still strapped onto me I  th I  I think I may well have set a record for the fifty yard dash with parachute to get away from that thing 
I'm happy to report that the airplane flew again 
all they needed to do was put a balloon under it to lift it up off the ground 
they towed it back in to the hanger on its own wheels 
uh and it  d i it did fly again 
so  did I of_course 
but in this  this moment of panic was  it  i it was only a  fla you_know only a quick flash fingers
it was  the  the thought was 
 I'll do what's  I know what I needta do but people don't  don't walk away from these things 
I walked away 
it was later determined that um while I was  I was indicating the proper air speed on my initial approach of three hundred and forty knots 
one of my buddies was in back of me also alone 
and he's  he was  h uh his testimony was that he was indicating three hundred and twenty knots which is twenty knots slower than I was indicating 
but he could tell that he was overtaking me 
so  obviously it was an air speed problem 
from what I see I haven't the foggiest idea of what it  what is really going on 
I see a man who appears to be lying  possibly lying on his back 
um I see him holding onto what looks to be a tree branch 
uh he is  l over his left shoulder he is looking at a woman who herself appears to be in great anguish 
uh so  possibly she's there to help him and doesn't know what to 
you_know  I don't know if she even knows what to do 
uh I don't know any more than that 
I_mean I can tell you what I see which is uh uh uh some kind of a belt uh which he has uh around his left arm 
um he appears to be quite mucu muscular 
she appears to be uh very concerned 
that's as much as I can tell you 
laughs a boy has a soccer ball which he kicks 
it goes into the air 
it encounters the glass pane of a window and goes all the way through it 
uh a man sitting in a chair l looks like an easy chair um uh is startled when the soccer ball comes through the window and knocks over his lamp 
he then stands picks up the soccer ball looks out the window to see 
 let's see how did it get here 
that's the story 
a little boy is ready to go to school 
apparently the weather is somewhat threatening 
and his mother makes a strong suggestion to him that he take an umbrella 
well  he refuses 
he is going to be very brave 
nothing's gonna stop him 
he doesn't need an umbrella 
that's for sissies 
out he goes into the weather 
it's raining 
it's raining hard 
it's raining so hard that he's stepping in puddles 
he's getting soaked 
his hair is dripping 
he returns home much to the conversation 
well  apparently he had a change of heart and because the next thing we see is a little boy walking in the rain holding the umbrella 
well  this is a Cinderella story not Walt Disney's that's for sure 
Cinderella was a good girl 
but she had a horrendous stepmother and two gosh awful stepsisters 
and um um um th they were pampered spoiled and they were nasty 
and Cinderella was called Cinder Cinderella because her real name was Ella and she was forced to deal with cinders meaning she hadta clean up the fireplace 
she hadta take out the  uh uh take out the cinders and do things like that 
so  it was pretty dirty 
it so happened that the prince of the kingdom uh decided to throw a party a ball a very happy one 
and the two stepsisters helped by the horrible stepmother uh got an  in got invitations to go 
poor Cinderella thought she hadta stay home 
but because she had always been a good girl a fairy godmother appeared out_of nowhere and said to her 
 look  you deserve to go 
 we could arrange this but there are conditions 
 first of all um w there will be a coach for you pulled by horses 
 and um there will be a beautiful gown for you to wear and lovely glass slippers 
 and the biggest thing you must remember is that no matter what's occurring at  at the ball at the strike of twelve you must be out_of there because at that time your coach will turn into a pumpkin 
Cinderella went to the ball 
the prince f could not take his eyes of 
and she had a wonderful time 
but all_of_a_sudden she realized that the clock was beginning to strike twelve 
she knew she hadta get the heck out_of there really fast 
in so doing she dropped one of her slippers 
but it didn't make any difference 
she got out  she got back to the coach and somehow or another managed to make her way home 
well  the prince could not understand why it was that she ran away 
but that didn't matter because he wanted her 
he was  he was so struck by h what a good person she was and how beautiful she was and how nice she was 
so  he decreed that uh there would  a search would occur over the  over the kingdom until  uh until the  until Cinderella was  until the woman was found 
now why was this  why was this such a thing 
well  Cinderella had tiny feet 
and the glass slipper was so tiny that very few people  very few grownups could fit into it 
so  he  he was feeling pretty confident that if he found a woman who  who  whose foot fit that slipper she would be the one 
well  lo_and_behold uh uh in his search  his search was successful 
they did find  they did find Cinderella as the one who  whose foot fit into that tiny glass slipper 
and they were married and lived happily ever after 
we see here a tree 
I guess which a dog is on his hind legs um holding on to it sort_of so to speak an an and barking 
in a branch  in  in the  in the largest branch of the tree there sits a man who appears to be there for the purpose of uh rescuing a cat wh who is uh on one of the smaller branches 
under  directly underneath of which is a little girl uh who  uh who is reaching up to catch the cat in case the cat comes down 
uh she has a tricycle in front of her 
and we see uh uh near the little girl a ladder on the ground uh which presumably the man has use to get up to where he is 
although he is very likely too high in order to jump down without the use of the ladder which remains as I say  remains on the ground 
uh that's  um that's what we  s that's what we  ap that's what we see to the left  left side of the trunk of a tree 
on the right side is another branch uh which had a few leaves on it 
and uh one of  on one of its branches is a bird who appears to be singing 
at the same time we see in the  in the distance directly uh to the right of the truck a firetruck and two  what appear to be two firemen each  each uh carrying an end of a ladder which presumably is going to be  they will use uh to climb the tree  rescue the man laughs and uh probably the cat as_well
