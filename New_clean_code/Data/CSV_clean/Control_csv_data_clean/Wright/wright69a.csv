lips_smack  well  at our house we take the bread out_of the freezer laughs inhales 
and toast the bread 
and then um put about  a tablespoon and a half of peanut butter 
the chunky kind 
on  the peanut butter  sandwich lips_smack 
on one side 
then on the other side ges
 and smooth it clear across hand
inhales and then we smack hand
the two pieces of bread 
cut it in half 
and if our grandson is here we hafta take off all the crusts 
but if we're gonna eat it we eat it with the crust 
 that's about how to make a peanut butter sandwich 
 the dog and the cat were fighting 
 and the cat climbed up the tree 
 and the do
inhales and the little girl happened upon the scene 
and realized  that the cat was in the tree and she's f gonna need her dad 
so  she got her dad 
 and her dad got the ladder 
and they were trying to get  the cat out_of the tree 
 but the ladder fell down 
 but just in the nick of time  the firemen who were called by the neighbors  came 
 and helped th get the cat and the dad out_of the tree 
lips_smack  
inhales well  yes I remember being hospitalized 
the most recent  one was  in New_York_City 
I was hospitalized for pneumonia at Roosevelt_Hospital 
inhales and um my right lung had filled up with  fluid 
and um so they kept me 
inhales sighs  I realized how important it is to have someone with you  when you're in the hospital because the staff seemed overworked 
the towels were like sandpaper 
you were lucky to have a towel  if you were to take a bath or a shower 
 uh they didn't come 
so  I usually stood guard out in the hallway to see if I could find a towel 
inhales um I have veins that are very difficult to get blood 
so  I'd always say kiddingly to the people 
 are ya really good at this 
 and one man named Joe_L told me 
laughs head
he'd  he'd shay 
 I've head
inhales after about twenty pokes in my hand I said 
 could you find someone else  to draw blood because we're not getting it done here 
and um lips_smack  it was really all I ha could do to get better so I could get out_of the place 
because  it's too bad  that the staff is so overworked 
and probably underpaid 
and that facilities  um are having trouble today  uh getting the help that they need 
I could also tell laughs you about the lady that was my roommate for the first night 
of_course I wasn't breathing and I was hacking and doing all these things 
 and she couldn't find the bathroom 
so  laughs she just used whatever facilities she could find 
inhales and when I said something to the nurses that I'd like to be moved  they just said 
 well  you'll probably hafta go on with a cancer patient that's dying 
so   I was so unaccustomed  to hospitals 
and I'm probably unaccustomed to  the treatment  there because  I'm going back to Iowa thinking 
and um I was sort_of on my own to try to figure out  how to get help and how to get out_of there 
 so  that was my experience 
that's probably the worst experience I've ever had in a hospital 
inhales because everything else is always been won  done very well 
 it was crazy 
if you know Roosevelt Hospital 
 and it just felt  I did  I did learn though 
when I was at Roosevelt_Hospital I was watching Jeopardy on television 
and they ask 
 um who was the first Supreme_Court justice 
 and I looked out the window 
 and I saw the school at Fordham_University 
and the first Supreme_Court justice was named for  the one that is named in that school as the law school 
 lips_smack exhales 
 
 lips_smack I'm not sure if I was frightened or scared  in this situation 
but  I was frightened for my daughter 
in September of  ninet uh September two thousand six 
on the nineteenth day 
she called me and said she was locked in her bathroom 
that her husband had threatened to kill her 
 and within  twenty hours  I was in Rome_Italy 
 and  my husband and I decided that one of us should go  to help her 
and to help her  with her husband 
 and  I arrived hoping that I could do something  to get them counseling  whatever 
within  twenty four hours  he had called  the police  of Rome 
I was alone with him in the house 
and I had  exhales no help 
but I didn't know how to get ahold of my daughter 
sniffs and the police were coming to get me because he was trying to get me in jail 
sniffs and  I immediately thought 
 lips_smack wonder if I can take my pillow 
 or should I take my Sudoku game 
 because if I hafta sit in that police  with the police in jail  what am I going to do 
so   I sort_of  you_know 
inhales and then I started trying to call my daughter's friends finding out how I can get ahold of Susan 
 and I kept dialing finger
sniffs because I think when you're nervous  you dial the wrong thing 
I finally got ahold of my daughter 
 and  she  came 
and we called the carabinieris
and the carabinieris
 and I'm not sure if I was afraid 
inhales I was probably amused that somebody would have the audacity to throw me into jail 
and I was willing to fight for everything I was worth  to make it happen head
and I  since then  we were trailed 
our phone was tapped 
the computer was  sniffs oh the computer was compromised 
we  we wrote to each other  sitting on the sofa 
hand
inhales and we took care of a year and a half year old during this time 
and  I'm not sure if I was really afraid 
because I thought it was idiotic what was happening 
but that was probably  the most  resourceful that I ever hadta be  to protect my daughter and grandson 
lips_smack so   I'm not sure I share that with everyone 
but if you wanna know when I was really  drawn to action head
have you had any experience with people who have a difficult time communicating 
lips_smack head
please tell me what the problems were and what you did about it 
 inhales I think it's not so much communicating it as it is understanding 
inhales because when I was in Italy  trying to communicate with people  I used my hands 
I used any kind of framework I could think of 
 uh another language 
 lips_smack uh to communicate with anybody 
so  um I learned street Italian 
 lips_smack I um became pretty cl clever at figuring out what people were trying to tell me 
 and I learned the words that I needed to use 
but I think  communication is so vital 
 and when you don't know the language of someone else  it's  hard to communicate 
 do you want us to be creative with it 
do whatever 
inhales well this could easily have happened in Iowa 
 the Des_Moines_River  was rising  in  um  nineteen ninety three 
and also in  two thousand eight 
and people were warned not to be near the river 
but people do that 
and the water has an undertow ges
and it can  catch ges
that could have happened in this picture 
and police and fire and safety people  go to great lengths  to help those people that are in the wrong place at the wrong time 
laughs a
and maybe he was playing soccer with his friends 
 and instead of hitting the ball where he thought he was going to hit it 
it went through the window 
 and the man  was not so happy about it 
because he was sitting there 
and it knocked over his lamp 
and then  I'm not sure what he's doing in the last picture 
 but he's looking at the window 
the man is looking at the window 
and it looks like he's holding something 
but maybe he's making a telephone call 
I don't know 
laughs inhales well typically  little boys and umbrellas don't really wanna head
because the little boy would be much rather   be much happier if he doesn't head
but his mother says 
 you gotta take an umbrella 
and  at the last minute  he said 
 head
and he runs outside 
and he's in the rain 
and he's not so happy 
and he goes back home 
and he says to mom 
 I guess head
and then he takes the umbrella and leaves 
once upon a time 
inhales there was a woman with two ugly  girls 
and a father with a beautiful  daughter 
 and they got married the  the man and the woman 
so  the families were united ges
 and the wicked stepmother  with her two daughters  made the little girl 
who was the father's daughter 
do the cooking and cleaning 
and by the way her name was Cinderella 
 lips_smack and she worked and she scrubbed 
and she had so many things to do all day long 
while the other little girls got to do what they wanted to do 
but one night  there was  a special party that the prince was giving 
because you see these girls have grown up 
and they were teenagers and they were older 
and the prince was looking for a princess 
lips_smack well  the two ugly stepsisters  they were getting dresses 
and they were gonna get to go  to the party 
lips_smack but the poor little stepdasister 
so  off ges
and two mice came and said to  Cinderella 
 we're gonna make it so you can go too 
lips_smack and Cinderella  they did their magic 
and Cinderella got a beautiful dress 
and she got a carriage 
and she took off ges
and she danced with the prince all night long 
but as the  the mice had told her 
 at the stroke of midnight  you hafta be home 
so   at the stroke of midnight she realized gasps she hadta leave 
so  she ran ges
 and she ran away 
 and she left her shoe 
 and  the prince found her shoe 
 and then  she got back home 
 and they went  tha and the wicked sis stepsisters came back 
 lips_smack then the prince was looking  for the owner of the shoe 
so  he went out all across ges
and trying on the shoe 
inhales and they came to Cinderella's house 
 and at Cinderella's house  the wicked stepsisters were f ges
inhales and they tried and tried to wear the shoe 
but Cinderella wasn't given the chance until at the last they saw Cinderella 
and the shoe fit perfectly 
and Cinderella and the prince lived happily ever after
