looks like there's gonna be a birthday party 
and it's a huge beautiful cake sitting out waiting for all the kids to come 
and just as guests arrive looks like a mom and the birthday boy noticed that something's been eating the cake 
and they follow the cake mess to under the couch where it looks like the dog has taken a bite out_of the cake and is now resting 
so  the people still come to the party 
they give gifts 
they still have a good time 
they eat the part of the cake the dog didn't eat 
and then they go home 
the mom looks pretty mad 
in sixth grade I was in a accident and ruptured my  my spleen 
I was hospitalized for like a week 
um they did like uh exploratory surgery to repair the internal bleeding and my spleen 
my mom came to visit me every day 
I hadta get all my stitches out 
um head
I didn't like the hospital food 
um got lots of gifts 
very tired when I went back to school 
I couldn't take a whole day of school 
I hadta get a private tutor to catch me up from the school I missed 
must've been out for more than a week 
um that's about it 
uh I have a girlfriend that's uh German 
and we were cleaning out um a tack room 
and I have a horse blankets in the tack room 
and I asked her to get a big garbage bag so I could put the horse blanket in it for the winter 
and kind_of put it up for the winter 
and she  as I put it up on the shelf laughs she couldn't understand how the horse blanket was gonna fit on the shelf where I keep the garbage bags 
so  uh she came back with uh garbage bags 
and she had cleared off the shelf where I keep the garbage bags 
but a horse blanket is  is as big as this table 
and the shelf I keep the garbage bags on is maybe six inches high ges
so  she still brought me the garbage bags 
and she just gave me a very puzzled look like she doesn't know what I was going to do with them 
so  I said 
 hold the bag out 
 let me get the blanket for you 
and I fold up the blanket 
and I put it in the garbage bag 
and she said 
 how is this going to fit on the shelf 
and I said 
 I wasn't gonna put in on the laughs shelf 
just  just gonna to bag it up for the winter 
when I was in third grade I slept over my girlfriend's house 
her mom and dad were out for the night 
and she had two older sisters 
and Benita was the oldest sister 
I don't know what happened to Alyssa 
maybe she wasn't there 
but Jennifer and I and Benita were home alone in the house 
and we were playing hide_and_go_seek laughs 
Benita  c Benita could not have been that much older than us 
maybe she was in junior high 
we were in elementary school 
and Benita hid in the closet in the guest room 
and the closet door got stuck 
and w she couldn't get out_of the closet door 
and we started to panic 
and she started to panic 
she started to cry and bang on the door 
and we couldn't get a hold of her mom at dinner 
this is before cellphones 
for trying to  the mom didn't tell us what restaurant she went to 
she didn't have a cellphone 
think we ended up calling like the fire department or the police department 
we were really scared we weren't gonna get Benita out 
and she had no air in there 
but the fire department came 
and they hadta take ges
and she was just sobbing 
we were all scared that she wasn't getting out_of the closet 
there was a flash flood in  somewhere down south 
and a little girl got swept away 
one of the
it looks like he has some kind of bag over his shoulder 
and um pulls her into safety 
and she finds her family and everything's okay 
there's a boy outside practicing soccer 
and oops kicks the soccer ball through the front window of a neighbor's house 
brea breaks a lamp 
and the neighbor grabs the ball and looks out the window to see who did it 
but do I needta go on or is that it 
okay 
in the morning a little boy's getting ready for school 
mother says 
 take your umbrella 
 it's sposta rain today 
 I don't want the umbrella 
 the umbrella's not for cool kids 
and as he walks to school he gets stuck in the rain 
and it's coming down harder and harder 
and he asks to go back home 
and his mom's upset that he's all wet and soggy 
and she gives him the umbrella that he should have taken it in the first place 
and then he walks happily back towards school 
okay  Cinderella was an only child 
and she had a very generous dad 
and the dad remarried and had a stepmother who had two children Anastasia and Druzella 
and the dad passed away 
and when he died the stepmother turned Cinderella into kind_of a housemaid and used all the resources to give her two children fancy dresses and voice lessons and all the nicer things in life while Cinderella scrubbed the floors cleaned the fireplace 
um but Cinderella knew that someday she would break away from this type of life 
and she became friends with all the animals in the house except Lucifer 
he was a mean old cat 
that was the stepmother's cat 
but she had birds that were friends and mice that were friends 
and she lived ups
and the prince 
I think it was Prince_Philip 
Prince_Philip's father was impatient that he was not finding himself a wife 
so  he has a huge ball inviting all the eligible maidens so_that the prince could meet all the uh girls in the village 
and the invitations get sent out 
and the stepmother opens the invitation and says 
oh  it's gonna be a grand ball 
and all the eligible maidens are invited to meet the prince 
and Cinderella overhears her telling th the uh story to stepsisters 
and she says 
 oh  I wanna go 
 I'm an eligible maiden 
and stepmother says 
 of_course  you can go if you can find something to wear and if you get all your chores done 
so  she uh makes up a bunch of chores for Cinderella to do 
and she says 
 wash the floor 
and Cinderella says 
 well  I washed the floor yesterday 
she says 
 well  do it again 
and she had her do some ironing and some laundry and help her sisters get ready for the ball 
and as she's helping her sisters get ready she sees them throwing away beads and sashes and ribbons 
and when they're done she goes upstairs to the attic and finds a dress a  sui in an old trunk that useta be her mother's 
and she shows the mice her beautiful dress 
and shows them the beads and the sashes that the sisters were throwing away 
and she's very pressed for time to make herself a beautiful dress 
but the sisters call her back downstairs to help them finish getting ready 
so  while she's away the mice um help make the dress pretty 
and Jasper and Gus decide to go out and get some more pretty things to add to the dress 
and they grab a  a pearl necklace hands
and the pearls go flying on the place 
and both mice pick up all the pearls 
and Lucifer's watching them the cat 
and they manage just to get the beads stuck on Jasper's tail and slide under the door 
and they're safe 
and the birds help 
and the mice help 
and they get the dress made up real pretty 
and they sing a song 
 we can do it we can do it sings then we can 
and they get this song going 
and they get the dress made 
and Cinderella comes in the attic 
and they surprise her with this beautiful dress 
and she's so happy she can go to the ball 
so  she puts on this dress and runs down the stairs and tells the stepmother and the  her stepsisters to wait because she can go to the ball now because she has something to wear and she's finished all her chores 
and the stepsisters see how beautiful she looks and her beauti beautiful dress 
and they see that the decorations are stuff that she ges
so  they start ripping their beads and their sashes back because they want them back 
and they leave her in torn rags as they trot off to the ball 
Cinderella goes running to the garden 
and she starts crying because she wanted to go to the ball 
and this fairy godmother appears and does this bippety_boppety_boo thing whips her up a real pretty white dress 
and then she makes the pumpkin into a beautiful coach and the dog into a footsman and the mice into beautiful white horses 
and she tells Cinderella go dance with the prince but she hasta be back by midnight or the spell will wear off 
so  Cinderella goes to the ball 
and she meets the prince 
and everybody in the kingdom is wondering who this beautiful girl is that the prince is dancing with 
and she hears the clock strike midnight 
and she hasta go 
and the prince is like 
 but wait 
 but wait 
 I don't even know your name 
and she goes running down the stairs to catch her coach which was starting to be a pumpkin 
and as she's running down the stairs sh one of her shoes falls off 
and she gets in the coach 
and the coach takes her home 
and she arrives just in time for the coach to turn back into a pumpkin 
and the horses turn back into the mice 
and dog  footman turns back into a dog 
and the next day she's walking around in the house 
and she hears the  the duke come to the door and says 
 the prince has fallen in love and chosen his bride but he doesn't know who she is 
 so  he's going to all the houses in the kingdom to see which maiden can fit into the glass slipper that this Cinderella has left  this maiden's left behind 
so  he ends up going to Cinderella's house 
and she hears the Duke coming to the door 
and she goes to her room 
and the stepmother locks her in her room puts the key in her pocket and goes downstairs to welcome the Duke into the house 
the Duke is trying on this glass slipper to one of the stepsisters and her foot is too small 
and as the mother is sitting there the mice run up her leg and grab her key and run back to the room to go rescue Cinderella 
and again they run into the cat 
but they escape the cat again 
they go underneath the door 
and they hand the key to Cinderella 
and she unlocks the door 
and as she's leaving the Duke tries the shoe on the other stepsister 
and one stepsister's too small 
the other one's foot s was too big 
and as he's leaving Cinderella runs down the stairs and says 
 but wait 
 I  I wanna try this shoe on 
and the stepmother pretty much has a good idea that Cinderella's the one the prince was dancing with 
so  as the Duke is walking over with the glass slipper on a pillow um to go give it to Cinderella the stepmother trips him 
and he falls 
and the glass slipper breaks into a million pieces 
and Cinderella says 
 well  that's okay 
and she pulls the other glass slipper out_of her pocket and says 
 I have the other one 
so
uh let's see 
um let's see um Fido the dog was chasing Fluffy the kitty 
and chased Fluffy the kitty up a tree 
and Fluffy's  owner a little girl's riding her bike 
and she sees Fluffy up a tree 
and she calls to him 
but he won't come down 
so  she runs to the house and gets her dad 
dad gets a ladder 
and crawls up the tree to get Fluffy 
but the dog knocks the ladder out_of the way 
so
and they come out to save the dad and Fluffy
