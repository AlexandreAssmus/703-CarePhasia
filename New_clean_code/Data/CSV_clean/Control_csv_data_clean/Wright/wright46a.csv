today is Timmy's birthday 
a very large party has been planned 
a wonderful cake was made for Timmy 
and good friends were invited over 
well   somehow the dog got it in his mind to take a big big bite after  of the cake after climbing up onto the table 
mom sees this and is very very upset 
very frustrated 
and grabs the broom chasing the dog underneath the couch 
Timmy is crying because his cake has been ruined as his friends come in with their presents for Timmy 
to see this cake having much much less than it's sposta have laughs 
first you hands
lightly toast them 
bring the peanut butter and jelly to the table ges
apply jelly to one side ges
and peanut butter ges
and then bringing them together so_that the jelly and the peanut butter meet 
put them together hands
and eat it laughs 
in basic training as I was leaving a transport truck to go to the p_x 
unfortunately the gate of the transport truck  was kept up 
and there were many other basic trainees leaving the truck at the same time 
to keep from jostling these other trainees I kept as small a profile leaving the truck as possible 
but  this actually made me vulnerable to being nudged by others as I was leaving the truck 
and as I left  laughs by kicking my left leg up and over the gate after my right leg had already been brought around and on the lip of the back of the bed of the truck 
I was lightly tupped 
because I had only been moved about a  an inch and a half 
sighs if I had had this awareness it would've been much easier for me to push away uh from the truck and sustain less injury than I had 
as that my left leg was kicked up and about to be swung underneath my knee over the gate I was in the perfect position for one of the worst injuries I've ever u had 
I fell straight down as my leg was at its highest 
the underside of my left calf very close to my knee came in contact directly with the top of the gate 
then falling down further the back of the bed 
then the bumper 
and  in my attention anyhow almost laughs eons later sighs after I had thought that the last of the contusions were  sighs occurring the same spot sighs on the under side of my left calf hit the  uh the  gar the guard rail underneath this very large vehicle 
the bed of the  v of the vehicle itself just hand
and coming down underneath ges
well  this hit in the same spot one two three four 
and uh I had just received instructions from my drill sergeants to keep from bothering them about any inajuries 
fr at the same time during basic training I had been quite clumsy and sprained my ankle 
and their uh discretion chose to take me to the hospital 
and they're my drill sergeants so I let them do that um instead of saying it's just a sprained ankle 
and finally they got well upset with that and told me to stop 
well  t I immediately went into shock 
and being in basic training uh there is much suggestion to do as one is told 
and a myriad  f uh manner of forms laughs directly and indirectly 
so  uh my autonomic system pretty much shut down as far as my communication went for the amount of pain and uh uh damage that I had just gone through 
sighs I actually hadta walk the next morning to uh the clinic on a very very swollen calf 
so  swollen in_fact that I was unable to take the b_d_u's which are the uh battle dress uniform 
which have a very very wide cuff on the bottom of their pants uh from being able to be lifted up ges
my calf was so swollen 
uh unfortunately that was the major holiday of that um laughs uh whole fort 
combination of its anniversary and Fourth_of_July 
so  the crew at the clinic on that Saturday 
which then being a Saturday busses never ran uh so I hadta walk about two and a half miles on that condition 
did a very cursory and um less than effective look at my injury 
and described me as uh rather than having traumatic shock as just needing only soft shoe without crutches 
the next  and without  and ges
the next day uh because it was a holiday and uh through some sort of synchronicity my battery was given k_p duty 
and uh the captain of my battery decided that those that were on sick leave were the ones that needed to be the ones doing k_p because everyone else had been working 
uh and I had just gotten onto a sick leave myself 
I was in shock continually this entire time 
so  I never volunteered for any of the k_p duties 
and was therefore given the worst one which was taking out the trash for an entire battalion on a very very inflamed calf and uh sprained almost knee 
well  regardless to say as I got back on Monday the uh staff sergeant that saw the condition immediately went and got a physician's assistant 
who then immediately dismissed the staff sergeant and uh started asking me if there was very very traumatic problems in my symptoms 
and uh pretty much I got through it and went beyond through very basic physical therapies 
and it continues to cause me problems because it has created neuralistic 
yes head
actually  I
for the last uh year I've been a life coach for a developmentally disabled man where I live 
and his developmental disablement has come about because of uh a actual large set of circumstance 
um traumatic uh psychological and physiological experiences have pretty much left him with the mental state  a mental emotional state of a very high strung five year old 
and uh various communication  miscues 
and the lack of my um focus to make sure ges
and to  uh to better his activities has created a  a very large ges
and uh at this moment I have hadta disconnect from being a life coach for this individual 
in the past reiterations and nonreactive acceptance of whatever form of communication this individual has relayed 
and then full discourse a about the perspectives and the  the missing pieces of the  uh the sides of the total experiences happening 
repeatedly and calmly uh delivered to this gentleman has helped 
though current situations and my own revealing of larger circumstance has led me to necessitively 
yes heads
sighs the only  only thing that's coming up to my mind right now was a trip to Hoover_Dam when I was young 
and I had uh at that time my  sist my youngest sister 
she was about four and a half 
well there was this  uh this very  lar we went on a tour in Hoover_Dam 
and  and saw all  all the insides ges
well  when we got back up as I  as I looked out across the bridge and saw the very very deep hole ges
when the water gets too high ges
I got an immediate uh sensation of fear 
prolly 
um and I immediately saw my sister 
and I just felt horrible of  about potential of her being drug down ges
and then spit out the side 
because this thing  this thing is about a  a good hundred yards wide and very very very deep 
and it j just gave me this ominous sense of  of lack and  and grief 
 there was much much rain 
so  much more than ever before that a flood occurred 
and began sweeping away houses and people 
a young girl was trapped in this flood 
and she caught on to part of a tree 
and held on for dear life 
rescue workers came 
and one man with a lifejacket and silver harnesses was dropped  from a helicopter  into the flood reaching the girl 
 m but then helped her to put the harness on 
and be brought back away from the flood itself  to safety INV
a young boy was outside practicing soccer 
unfortunately he made a very large mistake and kicked the ball too hard 
the ball flew into the neighbor's yard 
breaking the window 
knocking over a lamp 
and very very much scaring the man sitting inside watching the television 
the man grabs the soccer ball 
goes to the window 
and looks out to see the little boy is gone laughs 
a young boy is on his way to  to school 
and his mother offers him an umbrella which he refuses 
she is clearly troubled that he has refused but lets him go 
as he walks out oh down the road  it starts to rain 
he realizes his mistake covers his head and runs back to the house 
mother sees him and tells him 
 hm
and gives him the umbrella 
which then he uses to walk to school staying  after he has been dried   dry 
young Cinderella's father meets a woman and marries her 
Cinderella's stepmother and stepchildren  step stepsisters uh after years of time eventually  after stef the  the father of Cinderella dies turn Cinderella into their servant and treat her very unfairly 
Cinderella becomes friends with the animals of the castle that she lives at 
horse mice and birds 
and protects them from the mean cat of her stepmother 
then the prince no  then Cinderella looks out across the  the kingdom 
and wishes that she could be living in a very very better place 
living in that castle happy and free from the  the torment of her stepsisters and stepmother 
the king is furious in the castle with his son the prince 
very very worried that the prince is never going to marry 
and is never going to give him heirs and grandchildren 
the king decides that the prince must marry 
and sets a ball for the prince to choose his wife amongst the women of the kingdom 
this is sent out to all of the kingdom's eligible women as a message inviting them 
Cinderella finds out from the stepmother and stepsisters who are very very conniving and greedy 
manipulatively um planning to take the prince's hand for themselves 
Cinderella finds a stash of her mother's clothing 
and through the help of her friends the mice the birds  the mice and the birds builds a beautiful dress 
for she had been told by her stepmother that she would be allowed to go to the ball if she had a dress that fit and was good enough 
unfortunately a oz 
they fly into a rage 
and destroy Cinderella's dress taking back those parts that once were theirs while the stepmother looks on 
without bothering to stop them at all 
Cinderella is distraught with grief 
and as the stepsisters and stepmother go to the ball she runs out to the garden 
and pours out her heart to the universe which calls forth her fairy godmother 
which then comes and gives her a wish 
granting that pumpkin in the garden be turned into a carriage 
that the mice be turned into horses 
and the horse be turned into a carriage man himself 
and giving her an amazing outfit 
a beautiful dress and glass slippers to wear 
she goes to the ball and m ultimately becomes the most attractive and uh magnetic woman there for the prince 
and they dance and become good friends very quickly 
there is one condition though 
she must leave the ball before midnight 
that is when the fairy godmother's magic wears off 
having a very wonderful conversation with the prince that lasts quite a long time though it feels like it happens very quickly 
she sees and hears at the same time that midnight is occurring 
and sh
and is something else than a magnificent woman of elegance 
as she runs down the stairs and is chased by the king's servant one of her glass slippers  frees itself from her foot and is left on the steps 
managing to escape just in time before being seen uh transforming back into the way that she was 
Cinderella enjoys the time with her friends 
and is glad for the experience that she had 
unable to accept any other woman besides the one that he danced with and uncovered at the ball the prince refuses anyone else's hands in marriage 
and the king laughs is very upset at this 
and sends his servant out to the entire kingdom with the glass slipper to find the woman that the prince fell in love with at the ball 
the stepmother hears of this 
and somehow discovers the  gla the other glass slipper that Cinderella has 
and locks up Cinderella in the tower to keep her from uh becoming the wife of the prince 
and thereboy 
her friends fingers
and be shown and sized for the glass slipper which does fit 
they take  ci the  the servant to the king then takes Cinderella to the castle where the prince and her are wed 
the end
