well  I'd like to say that being a European I was not brought up to enjoy peanut butter and jelly sandwiches 
but I have learned to make them for various visits that I have from my grandchildren 
uh I would get two slices of wheat bread which I uh enjoy very much 
I  first I would uh get the peanut butter jar out_of the cupboard 
not the fridge because you don't needta put peanut butter in the fridge 
and I would take a knife out_of the drawer 
I would put ges
put the jelly ges
clap it together hands
and hands
okay  the little girl's points
and points
points
an and she suddenly saw her cat in the tree 
and she called her father points
the dog points
the mother in  b in meantime had obviously called points
and  points
and he 
uh we were living in LA 
and we lost our house in an earthquake 
and uh in which time we decided to move to Arizona 
um shortly after we arrived in Arizona I was diagnosed with breast cancer 
it was a very hard time for me because I knew noone here 
I had no friends 
ah luckily I had a wonderful doctor who uh performed an operation on me 
and put me on a drug which I hadta take called Tamoxifen 
uh I live in the Lakes_in_Tempe which is a very pleasant place to live 
and over the years  over the five years that I was taking this horrible medication I got to know very many friends who were extremely good very supportive to me 
and uh I feel very grateful to my friends for the support that I got at that time 
and also grateful for the knowledge that it's been eleven years since I was diagnosed with breast cancer 
and up until now touch wood touches
I could remember when I
I was  I was an actress for many years in London and in Sydney_Australia 
and when I left with my German husband 
when I left Australia to come back to Germany my  my  laughs my German  uh m my gift to the German land which is not very large 
and um I already had one child who was born in Australia 
and I realized that Germany was going to be my future home 
and I hadta do all I could to learn the language as soon as I could which wasn't very e easy because I had a sister inlaw who was not very kind at that time 
and every time I made a mistake in Germany she useta  she useta laugh and make fun of me 
and I useta be very resentful about that 
but because I was s I guess  so ambitious at that time and because I was good at dialects 
and I  I think this has something to do with musical ability because I'm able to hear ges
I learned  t I had a good working knowledge of German in about a year I would say 
and that's  um that's all I could say about laughs language difficulties 
very much so 
um I was uh four years old eh when the second world war started 
and I was living in Cardiff that time which is the capital of Wales 
and uh we realized when the bombing started that Cardiff was going to be very badly hit 
and my parents had decided to send me to
and about two days before I was due to s uh depart points to  to live with my grandparents our house was flattened 
luckily we were in the garden at that time in what they ges
and um w we heard obviously what was going on outside 
and I  I can't remember being terribly scared at that time because I was with my parents 
however  when our house was destroyed in an earthquake in LA in two  th in
and I had a nervous breakdown at that time 
place in 
uh eh this story took place in New_Orleans at the time of Katrina 
when the whole city of New_Orleans was flooded this little girl was washed away uh by the  the  uh the water that had come through the dikes 
and this points
points
and grabbed ges
and with that he was able to help the little girl on land 
and both their lives were saved at that time 
laughs little Johnny had been warned by his father not to play with the football close to the house 
and he promises dad he wouldn't do that 
however  he got so taken away by his new football that he was kicking it 
and it threw   it flew  the ball flew through the window 
and uh made a big hole in the window 
and bounced right next to dad 
dad of_course was not pleased 
and shouted through the window 
 I told you not to do that 
it was time for little Johnny to go to school 
and because the weather was looking gray and cloudy outside his mom said 
 Johnny do take an umbrella with you 
 no  hand
he says 
so  off he walks 
and he'd only been gone a few minutes before the rain started 
eh of_course he was feeling very guilty 
and he ran back home 
and his mum said 
 Johnny I wish you'd listen to what I am telling you 
and he said 
 I will in the future mum 
so  he walked off with his umbrella 
and went back to school again 
little Cinderella was living a very happy family life with her parents until her mother was taken sick and died 
after which her father married a second time to a  a middleaged woman who he fell in love with who had two very ugly and very nasty daughters 
poor little Cinderella was made to be a slave to the mother her stepmother and the daughters 
she did all the ironing the cleaning and everything else 
and because she was such a nice person she did it willingly because she had a good heart 
uh one day the old king approached his son and said 
 it's about time you got married 
 I'm going to throw a ball 
 and you I hope will find your future wife at the ball 
the  the prince wasn't too keen on the idea but finally he agreed 
when the  the stepmother and the  u and the ugly sisters found out about this ball they  they tried their level best to make themselves look as_well_as they could 
they  they bought new clothes 
they  they did their hair 
they  they made themselves as presentable as they could 
uh Cinderella in the meantime was  looked out_of her window 
and saw the  the castle where the  where the big ball was taking place 
and wished so very much that she could also go to the ball 
uh she was helped by her little friends the mice and  and the owl 
and they all said 
 oh  Cinderella why don't you try and contact your fairy godmother 
 she might be able to help you 
well  Cinderella said 
 I don't know how to do that 
and they said 
 well  look  look in the trunk 
 there's a book in the trunk 
 if you read how to find your ga fairy godmother she might turn up and be able to help you 
and she did that 
and whan 
and said 
 Cinderella you shall go to the ball 
and she suddenly with  with her magic was able to provide Cinderella with a coach made out_of a pumpkin 
and um coachmen  eh eh she changed the mice into coachmen 
and she made Cinderella a beautiful ball dress and  with little glass slippers to go with the ball dress 
and she said 
 you go and you have a good time my child but remember one thing 
 when the clock strikes midnight you must already have returned from the ball 
so  Cinderella promised to do that 
she went to the ball 
the prince fell madly in love with her and she with him 
and they were so engrossed with dancing together and talking that she forgot to um have left by the time that the clock st shr twelve 
so  she ran down the stairs as quickly as s she could 
and in doing that left a little glass slipper on the step 
that was the only thing that the prince hadta identify her with 
uh shortly after that the prince told the king that he was so enamored with this beautiful woman 
he who  had no idea who she was 
the only thing he had left from her was one little glass slipper 
so  he sent a courtier around to all the families that had been invited to the ball with this little glass slipper 
and said 
 a anyone who can put this slipper on must be my Cinderella and I will marry her 
and of_course the courtier arrived at Cinderella's house 
and the mother and the ugly sisters tried their level best to get their feet into the slipper and of_course couldn't do that until Cinderella said 
 I would like to try 
and she did 
and of_course the slipper fit 
and the prince uh was delighted to have found her again 
and they married and lived happily ever after
