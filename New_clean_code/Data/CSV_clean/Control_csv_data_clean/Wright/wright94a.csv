and it said you shouldn't take more than five a day 
but I think I was on my tenth one 
so  I went to  s tried to go to sleep  went to sleep that night 
and the next day my stomach was hurting even more and more 
and  but it was  wasn't like a  a pain that 
like on a scale from one to ten it was like maybe uh a six 
and  but it was just it kept ges coming and going coming and going coming and going

and then they take me in the back for tests 
and um oh  they put a IV on me touches
and they were like 
 if it gets really really bad the pain tell the emergency room nurse 
 so  then we can try to push you up more 
so  it wasn't really getting that bad because I can handle pain pretty well 
but then they finally called me 
and they had me lay down 
and um they took  um the doctor came back with an xray and said I hadta have my appendix out within the next hour because they were about to burst 
so  I was in the hospital for a week because I had an infection 
and I  um they said it should've been more painful than what you said 
but I wasn't as bad as the pain w 
I was able to handle the pain 
and then that was it

I think you should take the umbrella because it's gonna rain 
and the boy's like

 I don't need the umbrella 
and all_of_a_sudden it starts raining 
and he's walking to school 
and he's all soaking wet 
and then he goes back home to his mom 
and he's all wet and gets the umbrella back and heads back out to school 
the end 
so  the young man comes home from school 
and he decides to practice his soccer skills outside in the backyard 
and he's kicking the ball 
and all_of_a_sudden it kicks into a window his  home 
and the dad's sitting down at the couch 
and the ball goes through the window and knocks a lamp down 
and the dad gets up with the ball looks out the window and is about to say something to the boy 
the end 
Cinderella is about um a king and his daughter 
and the king hasta leave the daughter with some relative of his who have 
so  when the young lady Cinderella gets there they treat her really really bad 
they treat her really mean 
they make her do all sorts of cleaning outside with the animals and taking care of the house and cooking and sewing and stuff like that 
and sighs she hasta live in this room that's really 
the whole house is beautiful except her room where it's up like in the dungeon 
and one day um they get a invitation 
the family  the step  oh it's the stepmother  the stepmother 
so  they're living with the dad and the stepmother 
they get the invitation to the ball 
I'm thinking this is right  muttering 
okay  get the invitation to go to the ball 
and um the two stepsisters are really really happy about attending the ball 
and  Cinderella really really wants to go 
and she knows she can't go 
but then there s comes uh um the fairy godmother who grants her some wishes 
and she's able to go  she's able to go 
and um but she doesn't have anything to wear 
so  the fairy godmother gives her the three wishes 
and one of them's a dress 
and one of them's a chariot to go 
and I can't remember what the other wish is 
and then um the stepsisters find out that she's able to go 
and somehow or another um you_know they break her  rip her dress or something like that 
or they um 
well  anyway they all  the stepsisters get to go 
and the  the mother of the house is still really mean to Cinderella 
and um  the night of the ball Cinderella goes in a big beautiful white gown and um a chariot with a horse 
the wish  the  the fairy godmother makes the chariot out of a pumpkin I think  and the mouse 
and then they get to the ball 
and she gets there a_little late 
but when she walks in there she makes an impression 
and she  the king want  the king's son wants to dance with her 
so  they dance 
but she hasta know that she hasta be out_of there by midnight because she's gonna turn back into the rags clothes that she had 
so  as soon as the clock  as soon as the clock uh makes that noise that it's gonna be twelve um she runs off 
but then she trips and she loses her shoe 
and she gets back home 
and um the prince never finds out where she lives who she's from 
so  he goes around the whole area and looks to see if anybody's foot fits into the shoe 
and then finally somehow or another he gets to that house and doesn't see her 
but then he gets  later on he gets to see her and can  foot fits the shoe 
and they live happily ever after laughs
