well  in about I think it was  two thousand and one I became ill with a fairly serious strain of viral something 
they couldn't really tell me 
but it was highly contagious 
I hadta stay out_of work for a week 
um kind_of isolated 
I was allowed to stay home 
I wasn't hospitalized per_se except for the initial um diagnosis in the e_r because I had spiked a hundred and four temperature and was having difficulty seeing 
um the one e_r doctor that came and saw me thought I might have meningitis 
but then his superior came and said it wasn't meningitis 
it was just a really bad viral infection 
so  I was laid up in bed 
um and what happened throughout each day and evening varied anything from spiking temperature to chills and hot flashes 
um there was some vomiting of_course 
um a_lot_of nausea 
my husband was great 
he  um he wasn't my husband at the time 
we were living together 
but he made chicken soup for me and  and did you_know the clear liquids and  and apple juice and things like that and made sure that I was eating 
it was kind_of frightening actually because I didn't know what was actually happening 
a viral infection doesn't really describe much 
but um I came through it okay 
I was really weak 
I would say that after that week had passed it took me couple months really to feel like my old self again 
um but I was okay laughs obviously 
I'm okay 
that's it 
sure laughs 
what I specifically did about it 
 oh_my_gosh  I am trying to remember a specific incident 
um  holy_moly  I can't think of anything right offhand 
I know I have been in those situations before 
of_course  I witnessed 
it's not always me that solves the problem 
let me think  let me think 
well  yeah  that has happened 
on the phone usually 
um just because_of cultural differences too 
okay  
um well  in the couple instances that I remember I hadta just keep repeating myself 
um I would try to slow down my words 
speak clearly 
try to find related words to what I was saying if they didn't understand exactly what I was saying 
and ask them leading questions to see if they understood what I was um asking of them or trying to explain to them 
um and I believe resolution came about 
from what I recall it sounds like it 
again I can't remember a specific instance with who I spoke to and what we spoke about 
but in those cases you_know the couple 
I remember you_know  some time ago laughs it worked out okay  I guess 
no 
oh  yeah laughs 
oh  hm  so many to choose from 
she says trying to remember 
um okay  frightened or scared 
um  well  there was a time I was actually afraid for someone else 
um my husband and I when we first started dating he was involved in a group um that did medieval reenactment 
and part of their um events and um group gatherings involved a  a large gathering where the people could take on personas of warriors 
and they would dress up in you_know armor and things like that 
and go out and hit each_other with sticks and stuff  you_know 
no real swords or anything like that 
that's not legal 
but um you_know i like I said it was a reenactment 
and at one point during um a battle  at this particular battle he was um basically tackled by several members which isn't usual 
and when he fell he fell hard because he was wearing metal armor 
but they decided to step over him 
and they wear fairly large boots with heavy grids 
and it wrenched ges
they hadta call the paramedics um from a nearby um emergency center 
we were out on the outskirts of town out on the  the country side of Phoenix  west Phoenix 
and so the closest place was several miles away 
and they called the ambulance 
they came out put the neck brace on 
loaded him 
he was in a_lot_of pain 
I was freaking out 
I didn't know what was going on 
I heard things like convulsions 
I heard neck broken 
I heard just  it was craziness 
so  they loaded him up on the ambulance 
I ran back f to my tent because I was out there camping with him 
grabbed my car keys and hopped in the  the car we had taken together 
and uh met him in the emergency room 
when I got there they had him in the xray taking xrays of his neck 
it turns out he did not break his neck which was a great relief 
but um he was pretty badly bruised and banged up 
he had severe ges
I was very grateful that it wasn't worse than it was 
but that time in_between you_know what happened and finding out from the doctors was 
I  yeah I was off the charts 
what do you do with that 
you have no idea 
so  it was  uh that was really frightening to go through 
hmhm

I would take the bread from the bread cabinet 
open the bag of bread 
place two slices on the counter 
grab a knife from the silverware drawer 
open the jar of peanut butter 
and spread peanut butter on one slice 
open the jar of jelly 
and spread jelly on the other slice 
place both slices together 
put the lids back on the peanut butter and jelly 
close the bag of bread 
put the bread back in the bread box 
and put the peanut butter and jelly back into the refrigerator
