uh it looks like they were having a birthday party for a little boy 
and people were arriving 
their mom's and the kids  a couple of mom's a boy and a girl 
and the birthday cake was in the room 
and nobody was paying attention 
and so the dog ate part of the birthday cake 
and tracked it across the floor 
is under the couch 
and the mom's trying to get him with the b
there's a big piece missing out_of the birthday cake 
you want me to tell you how to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
okay  
so  you hafta get two pieces of bread peanut butter and jelly and a knife 
you hafta put the two pieces of bread down on the counter or plate or something or other 
open the jar of peanut butter 
take the knife 
put it in there 
take the peanut butter out 
spread it out on the piece of bread 
um do the same thing for the jelly 
open the jar of jelly 
use the knife to take the jelly out 
spread it across the other piece of bread 
and put the two pieces of bread together with the jelly and peanut butter hands
put the lids back on the jars and knife in the sink and you're done 
hm
um what happened 
oh I went skiing and I fell laughs 
didn't think I had done anything but somehow or other I managed to break a bone in my wrist 
and so I hadta go to the hospital 
they hadta xray it twice before they figured out where it was 
it hurt like cra
head
happened in Colorado 
came back home 
hadta put a cast on it ten weeks 
atrophy 
the most painful thing I've ever had in my life 
you can't move your hands laughs afterwards 
so  I hadta go through physical therapy but now it's perfectly fine 
um well  it's interesting to try to have a conversation with somebody who um English is their second language and their first language is Spanish 
and I don't know  I know like almost zero Spanish 
and so to try to have a conversation of um any depth or anything you can really just get the basics 
so  it's very interesting to try to communicate with a s
I think I'm communicating just fine 
I think they're not laughs listening 
but  laughs do you mean like they couldn't understand what I was saying to them INV
um can I tell you how that was 
do you mean like what was I feeling 
what  how did I experience that 
oh_my_gosh  oh  I guess the only time was when I traveled to Mexico 
and um uh oh they  they stop you going down there sometimes 
and they'll pull you over 
and they'll ask you like what do you have in your trunk or things like that 
or they'll say something to me 
I have no idea what they are saying to me 
and then finally they'll find English words 
and I'll be  like head
and so it's just  it's just  it's  um it's a little scary because you don't know  w you really don't know what they're trying to say 
and you could get in trouble if you don't respond the right way 
um because of communication like that 
 or just when was I frightened or scared 
um 
you know what 
it was the strangest thing 
I  I made a right hand turn ges
and I thought that I looked but I didn't see the car 
and so when I turned once I was turning then I did see the car 
and I thought I was going to get hit but I didn't 
but it's amazing because my entire body flooded with adrenaline 
I felt like I had gotten hit 
nothing had happened but it just  it scared me like crazy because I just knew for sure they were going to hit the back of me but they didn't 
there was  hm there was a girl that was out hiking with her family 
and um all a sudden there was a storm that came up 
and uh in Arizona we get a_lot_of flash floods 
and unfortunately she got in a part where there's the flash floods 
and she got caught out in the water 
she was able to get a hold of a stick and hang onto that 
and so they called the uh rangers 
and they came out 
and they rescued her from the water 
hm there was a little boy that was outside playing uh with his soccer ball 
and he was practicing his kicks and kicked it 
and it got away from him 
and it went through the window of the neighbors house and landed in 
and the neighbor was sitting in his easy chair 
and he got up and saw the hole in the window 
and looked out and saw the little boy 
and said 
 well  I guess you're gonna hafta mow my lawn for the next fifteen years to pay off the window 
okay 
um there was a little boy who was leaving to go to school with his backpack 
and his mom told him to take the umbrella 
and he said 
 no no I don't need the umbrella 
so  he waves goodbye to his mom and he heads off to school 
and sure enough it starts raining a little bit 
and then it rains really really hard 
and he's drenched 
so  he decides he better go back home and get his umbrella so he can maybe stay a little bit dry 
okay 
so
and they were mean to her 
they made her do all the chores 
and she became friends with all the um animals  because we're in the Disney version the animals in the  uh in the uh house and outside the house 
and so uh there came the announcement that there was going to be a ball  that the prince was gonna have a ball 
and all the stepsisters wanted to go to the ball 
so  they got all ready to go 
and Cinderella couldn't go to the ball 
but her little friends decided that they would help her 
and her fairy godmother came along and wanted Cinderella to go to the ball 
so  she turned um let's see a pumpkin and mice into a carriage and horses and got her a gown and glass slippers and sent Cinderella off to the ball 
and she met Prince_Charming there 
and she danced with him 
and just had a great time 
but she hadta be back before midnight because everything would go back to pumpkins and mice and everything would disappear except for the glass slipper 
so  she runs out_of the  um she runs out and loses her glass slipper 
and so the prince decides he's gonna try find her by going through the land and taking the glass slipper around 
and um trying it on everybody 
and they lock Cinderella up in the tower because the stepmother doesn't want her to try on the slipper in case it fits 
she tries to get the  her daughters to cram their feet in it but it doesn't fit 
and their little friends get her out_of the tower 
she comes down 
tries on the slipper 
and it fits 
and then she marries Prince_Charming and lives happily ever after laughs 
um there was a cat that went up the tree and got stuck 
and the little girl wanted her father to get the cat out 
so  he got the ladder out and climbed up the tree to get the cat 
and then the ladder fell down 
so  he's stuck in the tree 
the cat's stuck in the tree 
and the dog's barking below them 
so  they hadta call the fire department who's coming with a ladder so they can get the cat and the man both out_of the tree
