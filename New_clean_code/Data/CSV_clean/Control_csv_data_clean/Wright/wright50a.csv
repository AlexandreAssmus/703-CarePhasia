uh well  it's birthday day for a little boy who seems to be four years old 
and uh maybe when the mother went to the door to let the guest in the dog climbed up on the table and took a big bite out_of cake which he obviously knew he wasn't sposta do because he's hiding under the couch 
and the boy's crying 
and the mother is waving the uh broom threateningly 
and the guests are looking a_little startled 
and that's the end of that 
make a peanut butter jelly sandwich 
get  hafta get two pieces of bread 
I always spread the peanut butter on there first and put the jelly on top 
and put them together 
well  this is fairly minor but many years ago I was  uh when I hadta do dishes by hand instead of with the dishwasher I was uh w cleaning a glass 
and when I stuck my hand in the glass I cut my hand 
and uh it  it started to bleed all over the place 
but I was also pregnant at the time 
and I don't know if that had something to do with it 
but I had this weirdest feeling 
and my husband came in and I just passed out 
it was the first and last and only time I've ever done that 
I guess the most  the time  the  ti most of the instances I've had with people that have trouble communicating it's usually more of a language barrier 
uh I do recall though a few years ago there was a young man um who had a stutter 
and he was really very nice and I really like him and I felt a little sorry for him too 
but you_know I found it so hard to  to talk to him that uh I tended to avoid him in a way 
uh so  I can't say that I really  other_than saying hi Julio how are you I never really went much beyond that 
and plus at the time I couldn't excuse me  I couldn't hear well 
so  I tended to avoid people for that reason anyway 
so 
that's about it 
one time I was just m moseying down the street in a car and uh was preparing to turn left 
and I thought I had my signal on 
but when I slowed down a motorcycle ran into the back of me which was startling enough 
but then somebody else who I don't even know where he came from I think he was walking out_of the post office or something came over and started berating me for something that I had done 
and I was really so rattled by what had happened and then by this guy coming up and accusing me of something 
laughs thank goodness that the person that actually ran into me didn't  you_know wasn't upset 
he just said 
 oh  I ran into you 
and we all just parted without any further confrontation thank goodness 
oh apparently uh this girl has fallen into some water that's  maybe there's a flood or a storm 
and a man uh is trying to rescue her 
apparently she's been holding onto a tree branch 
and he's trying to get a hold of her 
but she won't let go of the tree branch probably 
about all I can say 
well  hard as it is to believe this boy has kicked a soccer ball and it broke a window 
it's really improbable 
but the soccer ball goes into the house and knocks over a lamp 
um but uh obviously the boy has ran away because the man can't see him when he goes in at the window 
this is kind_of improbable too 
the mother wants to give the  the boy an  an umbrella 
he doesn't want it 
so  he goes off and gets wet 
um this is the improbable part 
he doesn't like getting wet 
he runs back to his mom who's mad 
and he's wet so he takes the umbrella 
now my son would love getting wet 
um laughs looking at that I can hear the music laughs from the classic Disney version of Cinderella which I have seen many times since I was probably eight years old 
um Cinderella uh is the poor sister whose father has remarried the wicked stepmother 
uh wicked and stepmother always go together 
she has two ugly  sist two ug ugly stepsisters 
I can't remember their names 
one of them is Drizella or something equally ugly 
um anyway uh Cinderella is forced  forced to work like a drudge for the  the rest of the family who are cruel to her 
um but an edict comes from the uh 
I think I'm spinning tales here 
an edict comes from the prince that they're going to have a ball 
and every maiden is uh eligible to go to the ball 
uh but Cinderella's mother  stepmother conspires to keep her from going by keeping her busy washing and cleaning and whatever she can dream up to keep her from being able to get ready 
uh and at last the girls drive away uh in their carriage and Cinderella's left behind um crying in the cinders 
um then the little mice come to her aid and start uh 
oh I forgot that they were making her a dress while she was working 
um and then I think the stepsisters tore up her dress because uh yeah they didn't want her to go 
so  then the fairy godmother enters the picture 
um this is not in sequence at all 
laughs um and of_course she spins her magic and waves her wand and a beautiful dress appears and the  the pumpkin carriage 
laughs oh yeah 
and she goes off to the ball where of_course she is the bell of the ball meets the prince 
the prince falls in love with her on sight 
but at twelve o'clock she hasta run off 
she leaves her slipper 
um I guess that story goes all the way to the end 
how the prince comes and looks for the maiden that has the  the smallest foot in the kingdom that fits this beautiful slipper 
and the two stepsisters obviously have big ungainly feet and they don't fit 
so  he find  m
here's one of the fairly typical scenes where the cat has climbed up in a tree 
and then this uh the  the father has climbed up to rescue the cat 
and now he needs to be rescued 
for some reason  the ladder is on the ground 
and nobody has put it up there 
so  here comes the fire department to rescue both the cat and the dad 
that's all
