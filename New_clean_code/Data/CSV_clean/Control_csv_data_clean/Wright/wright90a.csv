a couple days later her mom my eldest daughter got it 
and lo_and_behold the day that we had tickets for Jesus_Christ_Superstar I got this stomach virus 
and it was  y you didn't know you had it until you were ges losing things laughs from your body 
and it  it just knocked you completely for a loop 
so  I  I was already mad enough being sick but to miss that play  laughs was even worse 
so  yeah I layed in bed 
and about seven fifteen fifteen minutes after it started  huh I was feeling a whole lot better 
but yeah there was  head

and then by morning I was back to work 
so  yeah it was just a day deal 
not even quite twenty four hours 
ju ugh ges
yes my uh youngest daughter 
this was a year ago 
 she was a senior in high_school and quite an athlete 
and it was track season

and she  she kept saying head
and head
but the  ne that next day then uh after he had ges kind_of adjusted her and said that everything really truly is fine 
um she got very ill 
and she uh wound up having mono 
and uh it was the worst case a pediatricians and the chiropractor said they had seen in many many years 
she was  I've never seen head
lips_smack I  I  I don't know any children that have had cancer so I  I_mean I'm not trying to compare it with that because you do get over this 
but um I've never seen one of my kids that ill that sick as

I_mean it was  she was down

so  for that to grow back evenly and smoothly I'm not sposta talk 
well  you can imagine 
this has been going on 
it started when I was pregnant with Jenny who's almost twenty three 
sighs so
so  we actually and  uh when the girls where in high_school took sign language 
they did it as concurrent students 
so  they got points college credit as_well_as their high school two year deal

and uh  the young man looks quite strong 
he's got muscles 
he's got a lifejacket and uh some other belts 
I can't quite figure out  what he's doing 
but he's trying to I would say rescue the little girl who doesn't have on a lifejacket 
and he's hanging on to branches 
uh  head
but  li I_mean he points
but um  yeah I know I'd like to hear how this story ends shrugs laughs 
well   I'm gonna say somehow he grabs onto her 
uh she must have the branch down at the bottom 
uh it's just really hard to tell from this picture 
but you_know hopefully they all   they all get safe and get out_of there 
lips_smack a little boy is outside playing soccer 
and kicks it unfortunately with his toe rather than the side of his foot 
ball goes crashing through a lips_smack living room window 
uh knocks over a lamp in the house 
and the gentleman in there jumps 
stands up 
picks up the ball 
looks out the window 
and sees it's his favorite little neighbor kid 
so  he's not gonna be too hard on him 
goes out 
gives him the ball 
and uh has him mow the grass to work off the price of the  window 
clears_throat looks like m mom and her son are having an argument about who gets to take the umbrella 
and head
little boy is smiling though says goodbye 
he's walking to school 
and it starts to sprinkle 
and then it starts raining harder 
so  he turns around 
goes back home 
 oh 
smiles can I back up 
okay 
little boy says hand
 hand
 I'm not a sissy 
and mom's angry because she really wants him to because she can see that it is going to rain no matter what 
so  he runs back home 
shows mom he's all wet 
and says 
 okay 
 I guess I'll take that umbrella after all 
and uh then he heads back to school in the rain 
happy that he's got the umbrella 
okay 
Cinderella 
Walt Disney's Cinderella 
sighs there once was a little girl  a beautiful little girl whose mother had died 
and her father decided to remarry so he could have help raising her 
lips_smack unfortunately he picked a terrible woman to be her stepmom 
and she had two spoiled rotten little girls 
and then unfortunately he also passed away 
so  the  the mom and the stepsisters made little Cinderella do all the work 
all the cleaning 
all the cooking 
all the sewing 
and she didn't have anyone to talk to 
so  she made friends with the animals 
she'd go out and feed them 
and they'd talk together
and uh just  they were her companions 
one day the  the king decided his prince needed to marry and have a wife 
so  he sent out an invitation to all the egil eligible uh young women in the land 
and um lips_smack the evil stepmother got the invitation and read it 
and her daughters were so happy 
and they uh said 
 you_know okay sure Cinderella you can go 
 but you don't have anything to wear 
so  the little animals made her a dress 
they made it look beautiful 
they sewed it for her because the stepmom and the sisters gave her so much work to do that there was no way she'd be able to get it done and go to the ball 
lips_smack sighs so uh when it was time to leave she came down 
and the sisters were dressed up as nice as they could be 
and they said 
 oh  Cinderella that's my scarf and my  my necklace 
and they ripped the things off because they s
so  uh now she really does have nothing to wear 
and they take off 
and she's in the garden crying 
ges
who ges
and  and turns a pumpkin into a carriage 
and her little friends into horses 
and a  ges
the guy that opens ges
and uh makes her a beautiful gown prettier than what the animals made 
she goes off to the palace 
and uh the prince sees her when she comes in 
and he stops dancing with all the other fair maidens in the land 
and the stepmother and the stepsisters think they've seen this beautiful girl before 
but he dances with her the rest of the night 
and he falls in love with her 
the stroke of midnight which is when the fairlry 
uh she hears it striking 
and starts running down the steps 
she loses one of her shoes but can't go back because she doesn't want the prince to know that she's just poor little  poor little girl 
and she doesn't want him to see her in rags 
she gets home 
and her little mice ges  friends aren't horses anymore 
but she does get to keep the shoe 
well  the prince is devastated 
he's got to find her 
so  he gives his uh I don't know what you call them points right hand man the shoe ges
and has hi him try it on every fair maiden in the land 
doesn't fit the stepsisters 
but he  they see Cinderella 
and uh they have her try it on 
and she magically ges transforms back into her beautiful self 
and they get married 
and live happily ever after
