okay  the first thing you do is find a spot to make it by the sink that's clean 
second thing is you get a  a towel ges

have that there 
then you go to refrigerator

take out the butter  or Oleo whatever it may be 
take the bread and Oleo over there points
and then you take  then you go to your cupboard 
get the peanut butter 
and maybe you want jelly so you bring jelly along also 
but you didn't ask for jelly 
so  anyway  you then  you then take a piece of bread out_of the  out_of the bag 
put in on the plate or on a paper towel 
I use a paper towel 
uh you then open a butter 
uh I use  it's like butter 
it's a b bucket kind of thing 
open  open it up 
take the knife 
ges
ges
however  if you're very conscious of your kolo cholesterol and so forth you don't use butter 
but I don't care laughs 
you put it on the bread 
then you take some peanut butter 
you take the lid off the peanut butter jar 
and you then put peanut bunner 
fold it in half and eat it 
when you're done you're gonna put the lid back on the peanut butter 
you put the b lid back on the butter 
put the peanut butter away 
you put the butter away in the refrigerator 
put the bread away in the refrigerator 
and you take the  the towel or the dish whichever you  whatever you put the  you made the sandwich on 
and you dump the crumbs in the  refri in the sink 
put the dish  you wash the dish off 
you wash the knife off 
you dry them and put them back where they were 
laughs a flower in a garden 
okay  the first thing you do is go buy a flower 
in order to plant one you hafta have buy 
so  you go to Home_Depot 
you buy a flower 
but as you're buying a flower you wanna also buy some mulch so_that 
because when you put a flower in 
you're gonna put the  you dig a hole in the  s in the dirt 
and the dirt depending on where you live 
if you live in Arizona dirt is hard around here so you want the dirt to be soft and you want it to be irrigated so to speak so you wanna mix the dirt  you wanna mix mulch with the dirt 
so  you take the fl 
and you wanna make sure you have a  sh a shovel to dig a hole 
so  you take all that equipment home with you 
you find a spot where you wanna put the flower 
and you dig the hole 
you pour the mulch in 
you mix the dirt with the  with the mulch 
make sure it's mixed well 
then you  then you dig a hole  dig  take part of that out 
and you  uh you uh 
well  some people would just ta f dig  dig the hole and put the plant in there and then fill the  fill it with mulch around there 
and that'd be the other way to do it is just dig the hole and put the plant in the hole 
and fill it with mulch 
and then  uh and then uh uh put the dirt on top of that 
take a hose or take some water 
put water in there 
and then put the rest of dult 
put the rest of the dirt  dirt in there 
and then wash off the tool 
put it back  put it away 
and that's it 
okay  this is  this is a story about a  uh the fact that I'm gonna have a party for my children 
and I've  and I've uh de cleaned the house and decorated the house and  and got everything set up 
and the people start to arrive 
so  and the  as they come in uh I notice that the cake has got a piece out_of it 
and lo_and_behold the dog is there underneath 
and I'm giving the dog what  what for 
and Steven  Steven is  uh my son is  is telling me that there's guests have arrived 
but I'm so focused on the dog I could care less because he ruined my setup and ruined my cake 
you wanna hear it 
well  there's t t t ges
but the one I'll tell you is the  uh is uh 
I was at church 
uh I help at  at church giving out daily mass of Catholic 
and I am  I'm a minister plus uh I  I set up the altar and everything for the priest 
and on Ash_Wednesday about three years ago I set up and I was giving communion 
and uh I held a pat palm
and my arm just dropped drops
and somebody was there to c fortunately catch it 
and uh it turns out that I found out I had AL  ALS 
I have ALS here to here points
and I'm not able to hold anything in my arm like this holds
I have a very difficult time ges
so  that's  that's what happened 
okay 
situ what the situation was hadta do with my wife  my second wife 
she's lovely  lo absolutely lovely woman 
and we got  we ended up getting a divorce 
however  after my divorce I went to a  a thing at  w a seminar at a place called Landmark_Education 
and I learned about uh 
it was a weekend seminar started on Friday  m Friday morning and went through Sunday night 
there was about a hundred and twenty five of us there 
there was about fifteen men and a hundred some odd women 
mostly  maybe not exactly that but it was that kind of proportion 
and I was  I was  uh I'd felt very  uh very k uh kind_of down after my divorce 
and I had prayed and this was kind_of a  the Lord leading me to this session 
so  I listened 
and I listened a_lot 
and the conversation dealt with abandonment 
and it turns out that in summary I think most women  I think it's fair to say most females feel abandonment much more than males do 
and  and I learned very significant things about the abandonment and how people feel and learned that you hafta forgive an abandonment 
uh but I also learned that what you 
this was reinforced 
I'd been  I was told by a priest back in the seventies uh that uh when your wife speaks to you just listen 
and when you  what you remember is one or two things is what's important 
don't solve every problem 
well  this reinforced that 
and uh it's very imp 
women have a 
that's why if you go back to that story I might've said this 
women have a  a need more 
men do too but they don't  they don't verbalize it 
but women verbalize it a_lot more than 
when things build up after a day they have a needta come home and dump 
they do 
and they need somebody to listen 
they don't need any of the dialogue on it or not but they need somebody to listen 
so  I learned to  to just sit and listen 
and what I remembered from it is to  m then afterwards after partner's finished what you remember one or two things you  you talk about that 
and then your partner is  is pleased because then you  that shows that you've listened to them 
and that's makes more effective communication 
hope you listened 
okay  when I was I believe around seven years old maybe it was five or six I mem this  this 
what happened in this occurrence has affected my life because I ended up being claustrophobic 
and when I was  when I was six or seven I had  the doctor said I hadta have my tonsils out 
so  I went to this place 
and I forget where 
but I remember laying on the  on the table and then doctor coming in with the masks ges
and I  and I fought the whole thing 
and uh my tonsils came out 
everything worked out alright 
but I  I've  d came to realization uh that  of that when I tried to do scuba diving and I couldn't do it 
I couldn't handle it uh the mask and the underneath 
and I've had some experiences where I've had claustrophobic  on it 
this  this is a story about a rescue uh uh on a  of uh somebody that fell in a  in a lake or was in a flooded area that uh flooding happened 
and the firemen or the rescue crew was going out there to help her 
and uh she's or  wi on her face she's very anxious 
and uh the rescuer's struggling to  to figure out how to  how to 
he's got a strap on there but he's figuring out  trying to figure out how to get a hold of her and pull her out_of the  out_of the uh circumstances save her life 
this is  t this is a situation that many people have where  uh that are lived by playgrounds and play areas where either a baseball or something 
kid  people are in playing there 
in this particular situation they're playing soccer 
and the boy kicks the soccer ball 
and it obvious  sometimes the ball doesn't go where he wants it to go 
and this one f flew into a person's house into his window 
uh caught the person by surprise 
and he looked outside to find who did it 
and by definition he was gone 
this one deals with a  a little boy going off to school 
it's a cloudy day 
he's got his backpack on 
and  and uh his mother wants him to take the umbrella in case it rains 
he says 
 no 
he doesn't wanna take the umbrella 
it's not gonna rain 
he'll be alright and so forth 
and he waves goodbye to his mother 
and she's not very happy about it 
he's probably two blocks away from home 
it starts to rain 
and it starts coming down harder 
and uh he heads  turns around and heads back home 
gets home 
he's soaking wet 
and his mother is  has a scowl on his 
 and I told you 
 next time you'll listen to me 
so  he gets the umbrella and leaves and keeps dry 
okay  there's a   it starts with  it starts with uh two people meeting each other 
and they've  and their spouses  or for one reason or another they're not  they're separated from their spouse or their spouses died 
and uh they each have children 
a man  the man has one child and  uh uh and she's a girl 
and the woman has two children and they're both girls 
so  there's 
they come together the man very much in love with the woman 
they come together and they get married 
and it's a  a family situation where the  the stepchildren in this case do not  are jealous of  of the attention and  uh and they don't get along as  as a  f a total family 
so  they've  they get together 
the mother is cruel  the stepmother's cruel to the  to  to the stepgirl  the daughter who in this case we'll  for lack of names we'll  we'll give her the name Cinderella 
and she  she's very cruel to her 
and she  she gives her all the menial tasks and all the other work 
and she treats her daughters like queens 
and they don't hafta do any work in the house
