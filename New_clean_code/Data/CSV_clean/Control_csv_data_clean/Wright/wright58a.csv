a little girl has taken her  not neccesarily taken but  a little girl has arrived at a tree where there is a cat that is stranded in the tree 
and the  uh apparently a man has brought  has noticed the activity going on and brought his ladder 
and he's attempted to get the cat down 
and he himself has gotten stuck in the tree while attempting to get the cat down 
a dog may well have accompanied him 
there was a dog there 
and the uh fire department has also arrived  with their ladder 
and they are approaching the scene 
and they are certainly going to get the cat down and well  along with the man more than likely 
shrugs and everything will be just fine 
the first step is to assemble the items you need 
being bread and peanut butter and jelly and a uh knife to spread the peanut butter and jelly on the bread 
and a typical way unless you like a large sandwich you would take two slices of bread 
and you would  how I would go about doing it I was  I would put  uh spread jelly on  on one slice of bread 
I would spread peanut butter on the other slice of bread 
and I would put the two of them together 
and then shrugs m eat the sandwich 
my recollection I haven't ever been seriously injured but um one of the  uh the typical but more unusual things I've encountered would be chicken pox 
not that that's unusual but for me a seriousness 
and I don't recall my age but I was a child maybe eight nine ten eleven years old something like that 
and what I recall of it is just a very unpleasant experience 
not excruciating pain but  but quite a bit of unc discomforts 
 and the applica application of calamine lotion  to uh ease uh the sores  the itchiness  of the sores 
and I to this day have a couple of scars because I didn't obey mother's advice fully of not picking at the scabs 
so  that's my recollection of chicken pox 
the person who I've had the most difficulty communicating with was my father 
and I  in part due to he suffered from a  some type of ataxia 
and  and he was  well I was  I was born when he was in his forties so I_mean he was  by the time I was  he was quite elderly by the time  not quite elderly but up there in years  by the time I was fifteen sixteen years old so 
but he  uh  in part I  he was mildly depressed I think but in part because of his failing  his failing ability to walk adequately and uh 
but he was very   very  um  little bit short tempered I'd say 
 and just wanting  he badly wanted to do things himself 
simple things like turn a screwdriver and that kind of thing 
but he couldn't do it 
so  he'd ask for help 
and then you'd try to help 
and he would put his hands in the  in the project 
and it was just more trouble 
and wh when you tried to say you_know 
 I hafta do this myself 
he would get frustrated 
and it was just uh very difficult time trying to communicate  that we both can't do this 
so  and just  just an overall  difficulty 
occasionally it would brew into an argument 
and there would be some walking away because it's either you do this or I do this 
and we both can't do this 
and you_know I know you'd like to be able to do it but unfortunately your condition has you or but um 
it's ju you  you just try to remain calm 
and  and just explain the situation as best you can 
and  and try to resolve it 
and of_course there were good days and bad days 
you_know  days where he'd be more tolerant of  of that kind of thing 
but  but just a it was more of a communication issue  that he was unable to do certain things that he badly wanted to do 
so  even_though he was asking for assistance he was still not satisfied wi j th s in a assistance because it was more 
 I wanna be able to do this 
so 
the  uh not too long ago maybe a couple of years ago 
my girlfriend and I had taken a trip to Flagstaff to go into the lava tubes 
there was something there called the lava tubes 
it's a  uh it's  na it's near fr Flagstaff 
and it's  it's just an underground  well it was produced by volcanic activity 
and it's a very large crevice in the ground 
kind_of a  a tunnel 
and um we had gone in it then 
I believe it was a Sunday afternoon 
and it was rather late in the day 
and by the time the um 
and in the center of this  this thing 
it's basically a straight tunnel 
 but in the center there is a  um and  somewhat of a  I  re you'd call it a pole 
it's not really a pole but it's  it's 
the  um the tunnel splits off in the center  and goes around another chunk of rock 
so you have it  it splits into a wide fork 
and then it connects back up into a straight tunnel 
well  we didn't look at the map adequately 
and we got in there 
and  th h and the  the flashlight started to dim 
and we were  tur we had gone all the way to the end 
and we turned around 
and we were unaware of this thing in the middle 
and happened to be turning around it in circles 
and the flashlights were going dim 
and by that time the other people who had visited had left 
so  we were in there alone 
and at that point going in circles in the dark or  the dim lights 
you're kind_of like you_know how do you get out_of this place 
and it became quite  quite fearful 
not  I wouldn't say terror but the  the uh belief that maybe we'll be spending the night in here 
and obviously it's you_know you don't think you're gonna get eaten by a bear in the lava tubes 
but its certainly you don't have food you don't have 
so 
I cannot be certain of what happened 
this is a photograph 
but clearly a little girl has fallen into a torrent of water 
it may be a creek a stream a river shrugs or just an extreme  extreme area flood 
but uh that's really irrelevant 
she is in trouble 
and someone has either noticed a passerby or has um 
or she alerted somebody that  um of her  s her situation 
and the authorities were alerted because it appears that a  a professional is attempting to rescue her 
he has on rescue equipment 
and I really cannot give an end to the story because I don't know what the outcome of the situation was 
I assume she was saved 
but there's no shrugs telling based on this photograph 
there is a boy and  a young boy 
he's outside 
and he's kicking about a soccer ball 
and we see the soccer ball go through a window of a house 
shatters a window 
lands inside 
and knocks a lamp off of a table that is next to a chair with a man sitting in it 
he is quite startled 
we then see him with the ball in his hand 
he's looking out the broken window 
uh he  I can't tell that he's glaring at the boy but that would be my assumption 
and he's certainly not happy 
I'm not certain but it appears that a little boy had an umbrella and his mother  removed it from his hand 
 and he is still asking for it 
and she is reluctant to give it to him 
he's then outside with 
well  he has a backpack on so I assume he's headed off to school  but not necessarily 
and uh he's outside 
and he's walking 
and he sees raindrops falling 
and the rain picks up 
and he is getting soaked 
and h it uh appears he's turned around 
and he's returned home 
his mother is looking at his  his drenched body 
and then he uh was apparently given the umbrella because we then see him walking back along where he was going before with umbrella in hand protected from the rain 
okay the story of Cinderella 
well Cinderella is  uh  she's one of three sisters 
and two of them are  rather in modern terms stuck up 
and  and well they're high on themselves 
and they  um their mother is somewhat the same way 
and she  uh as the story progresses there is a  one of the wealthy gentleman 
the uh uppity ups in  in the area 
he b is trying to I believe marry off his son 
and uh there is a ball being held 
and Cinderella is not invited because she  she has been rather outcast by the family as just the  the servant girl 
and  and she's to wait on everybody else 
so  she's rather lower class in the family 
and uh it turns out that her fairy godmother appears and grants her the  uh  the ability to go to the ball I suppose you'd say 
and she goes there in this fancy  fancy uh vehicle 
and she's  she's wearing glass slippers 
and when she arrives she happens to get a dance with the uh son of the  the wealthy gentleman who is trying to marry off his son 
so  she's  she's dancing with the son and it  f it turns out that the son is  is rather enamored by her 
so  but uh the fairy godmother had told her that she hadta be back to her buggie by uh I believe it was midnight something shrugs 
or else she turns into shrugs a pumpkin laughs something like that 
I'm not exactly sure what the  the gist of it was 
but regardless she  um it gets close to midnight 
she realizes this 
and she darts off 
and leaves the  uh the prince shrugs or the son shrugs of the wealthy landowner whoever he was uh kind_of depressed that she hadta leave early 
and um she happens to leave and forgets one of her glass slippers 
and these glass slippers are magical 
and um then she  uh the uh prince finally finds her because they track down the glass slipper that only fits her  her foot 
so  and then he's again  you_know they're together again 
and he's happy to have found her 
and the  the other sisters are  who had planned on one of them getting the  uh the guy they're kind_of left in the dark 
and  and everyone kind_of gets their  their comeuppance 
and Cinderella and the prince live happily ever after
