okay 
first you get some bread out_of the pantry 
and then you go to the refrigerator 
and you get a jar of jelly 
uh and then you hafta ges
and you ges
you open up twists
you open up twists
and then you open up the bag of bread 
you take two slices of the bread out 
and you get a butter knife from the drawer 
and you take out ges
and you smear it ges
and then you take that same knife and use it to ges
and spread that ges
and then you claps
hadta think about that 
I was like 
 wow how 
so  little Sally was playing with her cat out in the front yard of the house 
she was riding circles around her cat when all of a sudden a dog came up and started barking at them 
the little kitty got scared and ran up into the tree 
and little Sally was worried about points
so  she went and found a ladder 
she was gonna put the ladder up by the tree when a young man walked by and said 
 oh_no  no  don't worry about it 
 points
at which point the dog came back and scared the man 
and he ran up into the tree 
little Sally was worried because now the man and the cat were up in the tree 
so  she hadta call the  pfoli the firemen so_that they could come and rescue everybody 
I will tell you about having my tonsils out laughs at the  at uh uh points
uh I had had strep throat five times in one year 
and my doctor said that enough was enough and that my tonsils were going to hafta come out 
which most people thought really was weird because I'm an adult 
and I still had them at all 
so  uh my sister came into town to uh stay with me traces
and I hadta go to Scottsdale 
um I think I went to Scottsdale_Samaritan to have it done 
but it  they did it like on a day surgery 
um but what I remember about it most is al it hurt 
but my surgery was scheduled at like eleven thirty in the morning 
but I couldn't have anything to eat or drink after midnight 
so  by the time I got in there I was like a little bit dehydrated 
so  they couldn't find a vein touches
and they hadta stick me like six times in_order_to touches
and that was very very unpleasant laughs 
um they  they finally got it in ges
they had The_Wall on for the music 
and I was like 
 oh  that's gonna be great 
 you're gonna gimme drugs 
 and I'm listening to Pink_Floyd 
 so  this is gonna be a good day 
uh so  did that um laid down on the gurney 
they gave me ges
and then the next thing I remember I was waking up in recovery 
uh ges
it was painful 
I felt I wanted to cry 
in_fact  I did cry just because it was so unpleasant 
and it hurt so bad 
um they were trying to give me like some water to help kind_of ges
and I couldn't swallow it 
so  it was coming back out_of my nose 
it was just  it was a mess 
it was horrible 
um but the whole thing probably took like fifteen minutes for them to go in there and take it out 
but it was like arms
um and that was the Friday before Christmas that they came out 
so  I spent the next probably four days just laying around in bed just trying to  to feel better 
the only thing I could eat were popsicles 
um you_know  people were like 
 oh  you always get ice cream 
 you get ice cream 
but I'm lactose intolerant so I can't have ice cream 
so  that made it that much worse 
um I couldn't eat anything really hot because it was hurt  it was burning my throat 
um and it was probably  it was probably three weeks before I felt really good again after that 
um and I've had people ask me you_know 
 if you hadta do it all over again 
I was like 
 scoffs I'd have just  I'd just continue to have strep throat 
that's what I would continue to do 
I would not have had them out at my age points
so  laughs 
mhm 
yes 
uh
and they were  actually I spent a_lot_of time in Iraq and Afghanistan 
and things were constantly blowing up and exploding around you 
so  it's  it's collectively a scary situation all the time because you're in a country and kind_of a situation where not everybody likes you 
and they all kinda wanna kill you because they just don't want you there 
so  when we would hafta go ges
um any time you're on the road you're essentially a target for possible insurgency attacks 
so  you're constantly having to watch and look around points
um one of the big things that they always brief you though is that you don't stop on the road 
you just  you always keep going ges
ges
you always keep going keep going keep going 
and  we were part of a convoy 
it was like a ges
but I guess points
or he didn't get the memo that you don't stop because it makes you a target 
and he decided to stop for some cows ges
so  he decided to stop 
and we all lost our xxx ges
I_mean we were like 
 what are you doing 
but you don't wanna get out because that also makes you a target 
so  everybody's ges
 get back in the vehicles 
 get back in the vehicles 
and you're having to yell it 
so  it was a little bit of a  of a crazy situation 
um the whole thing probably lasted  maybe two minutes 
maybe two minutes 
but I think that it felt like the longest period of time in my life to be sitting out there and just feel that exposed to  to everything 
so  yeah that was a little bit of a scary situation 
yes 
um  th this person  they have dɪfɪkəlpɪu 
I_mean they have the ability to talk 
they are  um  don't have the skill base in talking with adults though 
um it's a friend of mine who teaches at a ges
so  she spends a_lot_of time around ges
so  when it comes time to ges
um  more it's being a little bit probably emotionally stunted in terms of having invested so much more time ges
um I think there's probably some selfesteem issues that go with that 
so  she's not out 
she's not socializing 
and then when she does go it's like puffs
it's like ges
or if there's something that's bothering her trying to get her to talk about it and then without feeling like you_know 
 do you wanna talk 
 do you wanna talk 
 do you wanna talk 
and you don't ever say anything 
so  um  eventually in that case you just kinda come to accept it as that's just part of that person's behavior 
um and that's how they're  they're choosing not to communicate by ges
 okay 
so  little Billy was out in the front yard playing soccer 
he had asked his dad earlier if he would come out and play with him 
but his dad said 
 no I'm very busy 
 I hafta watch tv 
so  little Billy was kicking the ball around by himself 
and then the ball went too far 
and it went points
and it smashed points
little Billy's dad picked up the ball walked over and looked at the window and said 
 guess I should have gone out there and played with him 
and now I have dysfunctional family stories 
so  laughs 
 okay 
one morning little Billy was getting ready to go to school 
his mom said 
 little Billy before you leave make sure you take an umbrella 
and little Billy said 
 Mom  I live in Arizona 
 it never rains here 
 I certainly won't need an umbrella 
and mom said 
 okay  suit yourself 
so  little Billy started walking to school 
he got about halfway to school when it started to  he started to feel raindrops on his head 
and he said 
 hm
but the longer it went on the harder it rained 
so  he ran all the way home 
and he said 
 you know what  Mom 
 you were right 
 I should have taken an umbrella 
so  she gave him the umbrella 
and little Billy continued to walk in  s walk to school 
and he thought to himself 
 boy Arizona weather  changes from minute to minute  kinda 
so  laughs 
okay 
so  Cinderella was living with her father 
her mother had died a long time ago 
and her father had decided 
 it's time that you had a mother 
 and you need some brothers and sisters 
so  he went out ges
and he found a woman who he thought he could like 
and he married her and brought her and her two s daughters ges
 here you go 
 here's your family 
 uh you now have a new mother 
 and you have new sisters to go along with it 
well  what the father didn't know was that these were not the nicest people on the planet 
and they treated Cinderella horribly 
they made her do all the cooking 
they made her do all the cleaning while he was off ges
that's why he wasn't around 
that's why he didn't know what was going on 
so  uh  the 
Cinderella i is having to do all the housework 
and she's taking care of everything 
and the evil sis stepsisters are just you_know bossing her around and making her do all the chores and telling her everything to do 
so  Cinderella's only friends were like the animals that were uh there ges
and she would talk to them 
and they would talk to her because they had that special communication 
um then one day from where Cinderella was at she  when she would talking with the animals she could see like arms
and off in the distance ges
and she always thought 
 wow it would be so neat if I could live in a castle 
 that would just be amazing 
 but I'm Cinderella and that won't ever happen because I hafta make sure that I ges
meanwhile  ges
and people in the town are ges
so  he's a little bit worried about it 
so  he says 
 okay here's what we'll do 
 we will put this whole proclamation thing out 
 and we will get ges
 and we'll let the prince pick one 
 you_know  with all the women spreads
 so  we'll bring them all here 
so  they send out a message to ges
they say 
 okay  we're having this big birthday party for the prince 
 bring your single daughters ges
 and because he is going to be picking a wife 
and the evil stepmother gets this message 
and she says 
 well  this is great 
 I'm going to put my daughters because then we can get out_of this hovel and move back in ges
and we'll be all rich and famous 
and Cinderella thinks 
 wow that would be kinda cool 
 um maybe I could get into this because I'm pretty good at you_know sewing and everything 
 and I've actually made a dress 
 so  you_know  I should be able to go too because it says all the single daughters 
so  she puts her dress on and she walks out into the living room 
and the ges
 wow she looks a_lot points better than we do 
 so  we can't let that happen 
so  they rip up ges
and then they take her 
and they like ges
and then they take off ges
and Cinderella is really sad 
and she's like 
 oh_no  this is really a bummer 
and while she's upset she finds this book ges
and while flipping through the book she sees a reference to a fairy godmother 
so  she reads the reference and all_of_a_sudden poofo opens
and she says 
 well  Cinderella I'm here to help you out uh because you've been a very hard worker and you do good things 
 I'm gonna grant you some wishes 
 and we're gonna get you to ges
and so Cinderella says 
 okay  well  what are  how do we make this happen 
she said 
 well  first we need the  a way to get you there 
so  she takes Cinderella's little animal friends 
and she turns them into all the things that she needs to get her ges
she turns the mice into coachmen 
and she turns the horse into a whole bunch of horses and a pumpkin into uh a big carriage ges
so  she does all of this 
and then she says 
 bingo ges
 the catch is  is that you gotta be back by midnight 
and Cinderella says 
 midnight shrugs that's cool 
 I can live with that 
so  she goes over to uh the coach 
and they get in there and they take her up 
and she's escorted into the big ball party 
and everybody is looking going 
 wow who's that amazing looking girl over there 
 we've never seen her before 
 but she must be new 
so  she comes in 
and the stepsisters see her 
and they're like 
 she looks familiar but we can't quite place her 
 but something's just not right 
so  the prince sees her and says 
 wow you're a pretty good looking girl 
 let's go dance 
 let's talk 
so  they're dancing 
and they're talking 
they're having a great time 
and he's like 
 wow this is amazing 
 I think I found the woman of my dreams 
when she happens to look at the clock and says 
 oh  I got to go and imit
and while she's running off to get back into uh the coach she loses a shoe 
so  she drops ges
but she ges
and at midnight bingo opens
and everything goes back to normal 
but she still has the other glass slipper 
so  she says 
 oh  this is a nice souvenir 
so  she holds on to that 
and then uh the next day the prince is like 
 well  I gotta find this girl because this is the woman of my dreams 
 so  I have this shoe 
 it'll fit whoever was wearing it 
 so  I'll just go around to all ges
 and I will try and put this shoe on them 
 and whoever fits is gonna be  is the one  is the woman I'm looking for 
so  he goes from house to house to house 
and some people's feet are too big 
and some people's feet are too small 
and some people just they don't have feet at all so they don't even get to wear it 
and he finally comes to the evil stepsisters' and the stepmother's house 
and he's trying to ges
and they're like ges
so  they just don't fit 
in the meantime Cinderella has been trapped back laughs 
 she's st laughs  she's stuck in a room because laughs the stepmother doesn't want her to be seen by the prince 
not because she thinks it's her or anything 
ges
so  laughs  so the mice realize 
 hey we got to get Cinderella out because this is her really chance to  to excel and shine 
so  they smuggle the key in 
and she unlocks the door 
and she comes out 
and she's like 
 hey  I think you found my shoe 
and he went 
 well  let me see your foot 
so  he puts it on ges
and lo_and_behold the shoe fits 
and he's like 
 this is the woman of my dreams 
and the evil stepmother's like 
 you  no no no waves finger
and he's like 
 closes
and says 
 nope 
 taking her off 
 and I'm ges
 and pushes

and they were happily ɛvəlu
