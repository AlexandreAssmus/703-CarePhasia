okay 
um little boy was having a birthday 
he's either four or five 
uh and uh the mom was  left the cake for the birthday party out on the table 
and the dog came and ate a piece of it 
right as the guests were showing up for the party 
the mom was very angry at herself for leaving the cake out 
but she was gonna take it out on the dog by hitting him with the broom 
and the boy was sad because his cake got eaten and his mom was beating the dog 
um first you get the bread out_of the cupboard the peanut butter out_of the cupboard the jelly out_of the refrigerator 
uh you open the bag get the bread out 
two slices 
probably because you're holding them in your hand you now have get a plate to put the bread on 
put the bread down 
you open the jar of peanut butter 
get a knife out_of the drawer 
scoop the peanut butter 
spread the peanut butter on the bread 
um open the jar of jam jelly 
lick off the knife 
scoop the jelly from the jar 
put it on the bread 
fold it together 
eat 
really 
um I don't get sick very often 
never broke a bone and never been hospitalized really 
um the most recent tragic sickness I had 
I went to um the freshman camp for engineering students as a staff member 
and the cabin that we were in had fleas or bedbugs or something 
and I got bit all over and broke out into big rash hives 
and uh it was  that was quite traumatic 
uh I took three days off of work to stay at home because I didn't actually know that they were bug bites 
I thought I had chickenpox 
so  I went to a dermatologist and found out that no they were bug bites and very 
uh anyway so it was still traumatic 
when I did get back to work I found out that everybody who stayed in that cabin had similar experiences but probably not as bad as mine 
I just got eaten up 
and so it was awful 
yeah 
um times when I've hadta communicate with people from another country 
I went to a seminar once where there was a bunch of Brazilians who didn't speak English very well 
so  like all other ignorant Americans I talked louder and slower so that would help 
but they just didn't understand the words 
so  we usually hadta find someone to intermediate uh because of the language barrier 
um or I guess try different words that I guess  I thought they might understand better than the ones that I was using 
tell me the story 
um well  I was out  we lived uh uh 
I was a teenager late teenager 
probably  I think actually I was about nineteen eighteen 
had already graduated high school 
was out with a friend 
her father was the uh sheriff's deputy where we lived 
and he came to find me because he knew I was with his daughter 
and I found out that day that my brother had shot himself 
so  that was a little bit uh scary 
it was a_little unnerving 
um it's hard for me to remember how I felt back then because he ended up living in our  our li 
and he is  just has some problems now 
but he didn't die 
so  the resolve hel helps me not remember as much as when I was as scared or as intense 
but I'm sure at that moment that it was very unnerving 
it was scary for what might happen 
would he die or not 
we lived not close to a city and so he hadta be helicopter air evacked 
my parents were out_of town 
and my youngest brother was the one who found him after it had been quite awhile 
so  there was a_lot_of blood loss 
I'm sure I was scared 
I'm sure it was a tense moment anyway 
um in this story it looks like uh 
okay 
there was a big rainstorm 
lasted for many days 
there was a_lot_of flooding 
family was trying to get out_of their house a  or trying to get to safety 
one of the daughters got swept away in the river 
and grabbed onto a tree limb where the water was rushing and very violent 
it was a scary situation 
a nice paramedic or helicopter man as they were out searching for people um found where she was located or was notified where she was located 
and so he hadta be lowered below and drag himself across the water so_that he could rescue her 
okay 
a uh boy is out on a nice day playing soccer kicking a ball around 
and uh kicked one a little bit too hard hit a window broke it 
man was inside of his house 
when the ball hit the window it smashed into a lamp 
and picked up the ball and started to head out the door find out who kicked the ball through his window 
and uh  filed a home owner's insurance claim to get his window fixed 
told the boy to be more careful 
a boy like any other was ready to head out the door on his way to school 
and his mom said 
 hey why don't you take this umbrella with you 
and he said 
 no  Mom  I'm too cool for an umbrella 
 I'm just gonna go 
but as he headed out the door the rain started to fall just like his mom said it would 
he started to get wet 
so  he ran back home 
his mom was upset that he didn't listen to her 
but boys needta learn and to listen to their moms 
so  he changed his clothes and took the umbrella and headed back outside and was okay and dry 
uh once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella 
and she had happy life with her mother and her father 
and her mother died which was sad 
she grew up 
father decided to get remarried 
and he married a woman that had two other daughters as_well Cinderella's stepsisters 
and he was a busy man so he was always off politicking leaving Cinderella at home with her stepmother and stepsisters 
and her stepmother wasn't very nice 
and as she got older more and more of the burden of daily house chores and less and less the burden being a rich daughter fell upon her 
and her spoiled stepsisters and mother dumped on her to do all of the work and wait on them 
it wasn't a happy life 
one day a prince in the land came of age and needed to get married 
and so the king said 
 Prince we're gonna have a ball so_that you can meet some uh ladies to be married 
an invitation came to Cinderella that there was going to be a ball 
and she was happy 
and so she was went to get ready for the ball 
and Cinderella's mother intercepted the invitation and told her other daughters that there would be a ball as_well but that Cinderella couldn't go unless she had everything done that she needed to get done 
which was kind_of disheartening because she wouldn't have time to make a dress or find something nice to wear 
so  the mice made her a dress with all sorts of things that they found around the house including things that belonged to other people 
and she slaved away the day 
and so eventually it was time to go to the ball 
and Cinderella felt like she hadn't had time to get ready 
and the stepsisters and the mother were happy 
but then the mice showed her her dress that they had made 
and she was excited because then she could go to the ball 
so  she ran down the stairs to leave 
and the sisters seeing that her dress was made of things that belonged to them tore her dress apart 
so  she wasn't able to go in shambles 
and  while the stepmother stat 
and so the stepmother and the two daughters left on their trip to head to the ball while Cinderella cried that she would never have an opportunity to meet the prince 
and uh as she was crying her fairy godmother appeared introduced herself and said uh that she could go to the ball and that she would help her out 
so  they turned mice into horses and a horse into a coach driver and a dog into a footman and a pumpkin into a coach and a big beautiful dress 
and she was all ready to go to the ball 
and uh so she headed off 
and the prince danced with a few people but saw Cinderella come through the door and then danced the night away with her and noone else really 
he was very infatuated 
the fairy godmother told Cinderella that at the stroke of midnight everything would go back to normal 
and so Cinder Cinderella lost track of time 
and it was about to strike midnight 
she realized what would happen and so she ran 
and as she was running she lost one of her slippers 
and the prince was chasing after her trying to find out who she was 
she was just more interested in getting away before he saw all the magic disappear 
so  she escaped and the magic disappeared as the prince was chasing her and he was left with only a glass slipper 
so  he was distraught 
the king and he uh hatched a plot to go throughout the whole land finding the person that the glass slipper fit 
they worked long and hard uh the prince long and hard to find the person 
and when they arrived at Cinderella's house the stepmother locked Cinderella in a room so_that she couldn't try on the slipper because she suspected that Cinderella was the girl that was at the ball that they had seen 
and the stepsisters tried to try on the glass slipper 
and it wouldn't fit 
and the mice snuck the key past Dragon the cat to open the door to let Cinderella out so she could run down the stairs and say 
 but wait I can try it on 
and luckily for the stepsisters they were able to break the slipper before she had a chance to try it on 
but Cinderella produced the other slipper and said 
 well  here's the matching pair 
 I was the girl and it does fit 
so  they were very happy 
and Cinderella married the prince and they lived happily ever after 
uh in this picture  it's a  uh cat climbed a tree to try and catch a bird 
and the daughter knows that her cat was stuck in the tree so she went and got her dad 
the dad got stuck in the tree as_well 
and they hadta call the fireman to come and rescue  both probably from the tree
