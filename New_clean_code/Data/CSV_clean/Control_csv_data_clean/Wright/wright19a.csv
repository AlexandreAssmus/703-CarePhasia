okay  peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
first you pick out the bread 
white is always the tastiest but wheat is better for you 
and take the bread 
and you first put some butter on one side of one piece 
and then you spread some peanut butter over that 
and then you pick a good jam maybe strawberry 
and put that over the peanut butter 
and then slap one more piece of bread on top of that 
and you've got a peanut butter jelly sandwich 
okay 
well  uh I remember when I was young 
I think it was probably in the the fall because we were playing football down in the next block on the corner house the Larsons 
they had three kids 
Christine was the oldest 
and she was their natural daughter 
and then Joanne a year older than us was a their adopted daughter 
and Bruce Larson was my buddy 
and we were playing a little game of football in his front yard 
and we had some older kids with us who joined in our games 
my brother was three years older but he didn't play a_lot in the neighborhood games 
but one of them was uh a jock 
his parents were phy 
and he tackled me right at  at the  at the goal line or the 
and uh I got hurt 
I had the football in my hand 
it was a little fake football 
and he landed here points
I had a sweatshirt on 
and I just got up 
and I was kind_of crying a little bit 
I felt kind_of sick to my stomach 
and I just said 
 well  I can't  I gotta go home 
 I don't feel good 
so  when I went home I pulled off my or  my mom helped me out of my sweatshirt because my arm was hurting a_lot 
and the  the wrist points
I_mean you_know you could tell it was broken you_know 
we're taking you to the hospital 
so  I went down to the Vista hospital the hospital I was born at and uh got checked in 
and the next thing I remember I'm on the operating table 
and they're telling me to to count back from a hundred 
seems like I made it maybe to ninety seven or so 
and next thing I know I'm waking up in my hospital room with I think my dad was there 
and I have a points
and I had that for the next six weeks or so in school 
and I remember I would still play uh tetherball 
because I was big into tetherball 
but that's  that's that illness 
um a little bit with my dad 
but it was over the phone 
and um he had a stroke around the end 
okay 
um just he slurred his speech and just had a little difficulty saying his words and stuff 
and just by being patient 
it wasn't that bad 
so  I just listened and tried to be patient with him 
and it  it wa wasn't terribly difficult 
and he recovered quite well from his stroke 
so  shrugs 
hm
I guess in uh the army in my airborne training 
um one of the first things we hadta do was it was called the thirty four foot tower where we were connected to harnesses 
but you hadta go  ges
but just that jumping out into nothing was scary 
but I was excited and I did it 
but we looked back and there were some guys that couldn't  couldn't get past that leap to  to do the jump 
and they'd wash out_of the program at that point 
uh one day the uh paramedics or  the rescue team was called out to um a popular rafting area  river rafting area where young Sally a thirteen year old who was out with her family rafting had fallen out_of the raft and was caught in the river 
and uh Joe the fire rescue man climbed out on a branch and rescued Sally 
and everybody lived happily every after 
alright 
Billy was playing soccer with his friend Joe outside their house 
and he kicked it 
and the ball apparently flew out into his next door neighbor mister Smith's window crashing though the window and breaking the lamp 
mister Smith was startled 
but he had kids of his own and wasn't too upset 
he knew the window could be fixed and luckily he hadn't got hurt by the broken glass 
the end 
okay 
Joey was ready to go off to his friend's house with his backpack all packed for an overnight trip 
his mother said 
 it looks like rain out there  Joey 
 you better take this umbrella 
Joey said 
 no  no  it's not gonna rain  Mom 
 I don't need it 
so  Joey hopped out into the  to walk over to his friend's house 
sure enough it started raining 
he ran home all wet and said 
 Mom  you were right 
 give me the umbrella 
and then off goes Joey 
I'm singing in the rain 
I'm singing in the rain
