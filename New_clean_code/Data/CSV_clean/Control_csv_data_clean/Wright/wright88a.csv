I'm sorry laughs 
I know that's not a good one 
inhales um but that was probably about as critical head

uh  me too head
I'm fine head
lips_smack yes head
 head
 head
lips_smack inhales my mother had a stroke five years ago 
inhales and with her stroke she
and so her communication is very very um different laughs than it ever was before 
inhales um and so  she will say 
inhales most of the time we can fill in the blanks for her head
inhales and figure out what she's saying head
but there are many many times where she will start talking head
inhales and we have no idea what she's saying head
inhales and it's very frustrating for us head
which leads me to believe head
inhales um but we've tried really hard to inhales figure out what she's trying to say head
I don't know if we have it right half the time head
shrugs but she's fairly agreeable laughs  to what we say so 
 lips_smack inhales okay  this looks like two young people that decided to go on some kind of a raft trip 
inhales and um they were equipped with  life preservers 
although I don't see one on the girl 
inhales um and it has overturned in rapids 
and the young man was able to catch a tree inhales and hold on 
but it looks like the young woman  has not been able to grab on to anything 
other_than him hopefully 
inhales and it is a very scary situation 
 um inhales the ending is 
inhales she grabbed his leg 
lips_smack inhales and he held on to her   she held on to him head
and help was called 
and they were saved 
 lips_smack inhales okay a young boy is outside playing soccer 
kicking the ball around 
practicing for making  hi uh for his tryouts for his team 
inhales um unfortunately the ball gets kicked through a window 
where a man is sitting 
it knocks over a lamp head
inhales and  completely surprises this man head
and scares him 
inhales he jumps up with the ball 
inhales h his first instinct is to look out the window to see who kicked the ball 
inhales um he
the young boy apologizes 
inhales the man takes him back to his home 
and they make a resolution for the young boy to pay for the window that needs to be fixed 
and the lamp probably 
 lips_smack inhales well little Danny is going off to school 
an
 I think you're going to need your
inhales so  she offers him the umbrella 
and Danny says 
 Mom  lips_smack I don't need this umbrella head
 it's a beautiful day outside 
inhales so  he starts out on his way to school with his backpack on 
and  it starts to drip drop 
inhales um fairly s
the sky opens up 
and it is pouring 
at which point little Danny turns around 
and goes home 
inhales he walks back in the door totally dripping wet 
inhales mom is looking at him saying 
 see I told you so 
inhales and Danny picks up the umbrella 
goes back out the door 
and goes to school 
lips_smack okay 
inhales there was a nice young man who
um was very sad 
had a little girl that was just as precious as can be head
inhales and he kne
so
lips_smack um with two daughters 
and they decided to marry head
inhales so  now little Cinderella his daughter head
inhales they grow up in the house together 
but they are very very different children head
the two stepsisters are very vain 
inhales um very selfish 
inhales a
instead of them helping out head
inhales and the stepmother is very much a part of that in that she allows this to happen head
inhales so  Cinderella because she works so hard has no friends head
and  except for all the little mice and the animals that live around her house 
inhales and they befriend her 
inhales she sees the
and ha often dreams of what it might be like to live in a castle 
inhales as a princess 
inhales clears_throat meanwhile in that castle there's a prince 
and the prince's father is very frustrated 
because his so
inhales and the king is definitely ready for his son to get married 
inhales so  he decides to host a ball 
inhales an
inhales and so he sends out invitations 
and when Cinderella's stepmom gets the invitations 
inhales the girls are very very excited 
because now they can see themselves married to
 lips_smack inhales and Cinderella also shares in this dream 
inhales however   Cinderella's stepmother says 
 oh  no  head
 because you have head
inhales and forces Cinderella to do even more chores 
inhales because she knows in her heart inhales that Cinderella is much more beautiful than her own two stepdaughters head
and does not want that competition for her daughters 
lips_smack inhales so
and Cinderella goes through all her chores 
but all the little animals really want her to go to the ball also 
inhales so  they help her with the chores 
inhales but then she realizes that she cannot head
inhales and so  in head
inhales her
 I will help you  Cinderella 
so  she  um lips_smack makes a beautiful dress appear 
inhales with a beautiful coach to take her to the ball head
inhales that is made out_of a pumpkin 
inhales and the mice she maves 
and makes into fine horses head
inhales that will take the carriage to the castle for the ball 
inhales so  in the meantime 
just before Cinderella takes off for the ball though she says 
 remember 
 head
 and after midnight head
 inhales and your little  fr the horses will turn back into your little friends again head
 so  make sure you're out_of there by midnight 
inhales so  Cinderella goes to the ball 
and nobody recognizes her head
because she's dressed beautifully 
she's clean 
she smells good 
inhales and the prince is so taken with her 
he cannot believe his luck 
that he has found this beautiful young woman 
inhales and falls in love with her instantly 
love at first sight 
inhales um but  as they're tak taking one of their last dances 
inhales she hears the gong from the clock tower 
inhales and knows that it is midnight 
and she knows head
inhales but he doesn't want her to leave 
and he holds her back 
and she says 
 no  I must go 
inhales and she runs out_of his arms 
runs down the stairs 
inhales trips just a little bit before she gets into her coach 
inhales as she trips she leaves behind one of the glass slippers 
that the fairy godmother had k put on her feet 
inhales but she has no head
so  she continues 
and  just as the fairy godmother promised 
at midnight the coach turned back head
and the horses were her little mouse friends again 
inhales and her gown is gone 
and she's back into the rags 
that she usually is in 
lips_smack inhales well the prince is heartbroken 
he cannot believe head
and he's lost her 
inhales he doesn't even really know her name 
lips_smack inhales so  he decides  that um he's got to find her 
he runs after her 
inhales and lo_and_behold he finds the glass slipper 
inhales so  he decides to go door to door to find out who's foot will fit into the glass slipper 
inhales and when he finds her he'll know that that's the woman that he was dancing with 
and the woman of his dreams 
lips_smack inhales so  they go from place to place  place to place 
he's very tired 
he knocks on the stepmother's door 
inhales and she pushes her step dau or  her daughters into the forefront 
inhales and both of these girls try to cram their huge gigantic feet into this tiny delicate slipper 
inhales they will not fit  at all 
and he says to her 
 do you have any other daughters 
 is there anyone else that this might fit 
and of_course she says 
 no 
inhales but um Cinderella comes from shrugs somewhere appears and says 
 could I try on the slipper 
inhales her foot slides very easily into the slipper 
the prince has found his princess 
inhales and they marry 
and live happily ever after
