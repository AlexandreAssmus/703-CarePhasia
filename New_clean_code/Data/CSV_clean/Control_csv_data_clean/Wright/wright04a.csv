it's a beautiful day in the country 
and the mouse family 
looks like they have about nine children 
 are all going into the forest to look for a place to have a picnic 
they all pile into  a red truck 
we think it's dad's but it could be Grandpa's 
and up they go up a hill 
and then they go across another fairy area 
and oh it's green and it's beautiful 
but all_of_a_sudden the truck hits a boulder in the road 
and the little mouse falls off the back of the truck which has no tailgate 
and in the little mouse's arms are his  his little pet mouse 
well  there he is flat on his back in the trail all alone with his little toy 
and all he sees the re truck and the rest of his family disappearing into the distance 
and he doesn't know what to make of this 
now we follow the family in their red truck 
they found a beautiful spot 
so  they all get out_of the truck carrying their picnic things and their toys their baseball bats and  all sorts of toys cameras everything they have with him 
now we have them in a perfectly beautiful glen by a small lake that actually has a pier 
some of them are swimming 
one is on the pier getting ready to  thinking about diving not  not too sure 
two other of the children are dancing in the grass 
another one is picking flowers 
another one is carrying the thermos 
and bigger ones are carrying the picnic basket 
and mom is shaking up the tablecloth 
and dad has his banjo 
and grandpa's getting ready to take a walk 
everybody's getting ready for a wonderful time 
beautiful beautiful lake in the beautiful forest 
next we see them playing baseball 
the older folks relaxed playing the banjo and just sitting and watching the younger ones play 
and one little one has  laughs a rubber tire 
he doesn't know quite what to do with that 
and then we go back and we see the little one all by himself in the middle of the road 
little tears running down his cheeks clutching his pet 
xxx pet mouse 
he gets up 
he looks around 
he doesn't know what to do 
he's all alone and everything around him is very tall 
the grasses and the bushes 
oh there are berries on the bushes 
maybe he could eat some of the berries 
now we go back to the rest of the family 
they're photographing each other 
they're frisking about in the lake 
they're sailing a boat 
they have a beautiful picnic spread out with watermelon and salad and sandwiches and cheese 
well  they are mice you_know 
then we go back to the little guy 
he reaches up and he finds that he can reach the berries 
so  he pulls them down 
sets his little  his little friend down on the ground 
and he starts eating the berries 
suddenly we go back to the picnic and there seems to be something amiss 
there are only eight  little mice when there should be nine 
and mom is kind_of rubbing her hands together 
and dad is shading his eyes looking off into the distance 
and Grandma and Grandpa are looking every which way 
noone knows what to do 
and they're not eating their picnic 
they're just all sitting  the little children are all sitting with their hands folded looking very worried 
where is their little brother hm
well  one of them is  one of the m brothers the bigger ones sits on the edge of the pier and is calling and calling his little brother 
the little mouse who was sailing the boat brings the boat in and starts to cry 
the other little mouse is crying 
a bush with flowers on 
ev all the children seem to be  they're all looking but they can't find 
they're looking behind rocks 
they're looking among the tall grass 
they can't find him 
but they know he's missing finally 
so  they pack up everything 
the baseball bat the banjo the picnic basket 
and they all load up in the little red truck 
now we go back and we see the little missing  little missing boy mouse laying on his back with his hands on his tummy 
maybe he ate too many berries 
we don't know though 
so  the truck comes back and everybody is looking 
they're looking out the windows 
they're looking over the back of the truck 
they're looking every which way 
they are looking for their little brother 
little brother stands up 
he thinks he hears something 
he looks and looks but he's in  he's in the tall grass and he can't see anything 
gasps suddenly he finds his way back to the road 
and he sees his family 
and they are all cheering 
and there's a hat thrown in the air 
and all of his little brothers and sisters are s screaming with happiness 
and mom and dad are just big eyed 
they can't believe they found their little one 
then they all get together in the middle of the road and everybody hugs little brother 
he is so happy 
and then he looks around 
something's missing 
he looks he goes back in the grass 
he looks and he looks and he finds his little pet little pink mouse 
gives him a hug 
and the family is united 
everybody is back together 
so  they have a picnic right there 
they don't go back to the lake 
they're just too happy 
they just stay where they are 
and all nine mice children and the little pet have a wonderful wonderful picnic 
this is a story about a little baby and an amazing dog named Carl 
the first picture shows us with mom 
and she's getting ready to go shopping 
the little baby is in the crib covered up 
and Carl is on the floor guarding 
and mother says 
 now you look  be sure you look after the baby Carl 
so  when mom leaves Carl immediately goes to the window and looks out to see if there's anything out there that could be a problem 
and also to make sure she's gone 
then Carl goes over to the crib and stands up right next to it so the little boy can climb over the crib and right onto Carl's back 
now we're having some fun 
the little boy rides C Carl 
and they go into mom's and daddy's bedroom 
and they both 
well  really it's Carl who jumps up on the bed but baby goes with him 
and so Carl stands watch while the baby bounces up and down on the bed 
then we see the baby on mommy's dressing table 
and the baby has a powder puff 
and the baby gets powder in Carl's nose 
in the next picture we see  laughs the  laughs the baby with a fancy hat 
it's  um it's a handkerchief with a powder puff on top 
but Carl is wearing beads around his head between his eyes 
and he also  actually he has one ear sticking up 
and he has the powder box lid on his head 
they're very proud of themselves 
they both look gorgeous 
gasps the next picture shows the little boy 
he has found his way to the laundry chute 
now he is up on the second floor and the laundry chute is down on the basement so Carl's a little bit nervous 
Carl is looking over the door to the laundry chute 
he's not sure what's gonna happen 
the little boy disappears 
Carl races down two flights of stairs 
he's into the basement and there's our little boy safe and sound sitting on the soft pile of clothes waiting to be laundered 
now we see the little boy on Carl's back up  back up stairs 
and we go into the living room 
oh_my_goodness 
he sits down and there are papers  flying all over the place 
he's gotten into the newspaper 
not the little boy Carl 
now we have Carl getting up with the little boy on his back going to look at the fish in the fish tank 
I don't hafta tell you what happens next 
next thing we see the little boy is in the fish tank 
and Carl with his paws up on the side leans over and grabs the little boy by his shirt the back of his shirt and pulls him out 
well  safe again 
now we have him all dried off 
and Carl goes into the room with the stereo 
and he starts playing 
turns it on chooses some music and he starts dancing 
so  Carl is dancing in the middle of the room with his hind legs 
and the little boy is just thrilled 
he sees this and he just giggles and laughs 
and he can't quite dance yet but he really loves to watch the dog dance 
uhoh we've gone to the kitchen 
Carl has managed to open the refrigerator door 
and the little boy is really interested 
next picture we see a loaf of bread on the floor and yes Carl has opened it 
we see an empty butter 
and the little boy has a stick of butter that he is squeezing with great joy 
then Carl comes up with a bunch of grapes which he holds up so the little boy can take them and eat them one at a time 
then we have Carl 
he gets the Hershey syrup which has two holes already punched in the top so you can pour it 
holds the can in his mouth and pours the syrup into a little cup 
then Carl goes and gets the milk 
opens the milk container 
pours it with  in on top of the Hershey syrup 
and now we have chocolate milk 
now we go to the cookie jar and Carl takes the lid off 
the little boy knows exactly what to do 
that little right hand goes in that cookie jar so fast 
and out it comes 
now we have a real pile in the middle of the kitchen floor 
we have a Hershey's syrup can we have an open cookie jar we have um milk or with  what looks like cream not milk 
open on the floor we have pieces of bread tha we have a stick of butter and we have something that looks like it might be jam in a big puddle in the middle of the floor 
of_course  the little baby has chocolate all over him 
and he has strawberry jam on his knees 
and he's just a picture 
so  the next picture he's back up 
dirty little boy 
back up on Carl's back 
they're going upstairs 
they go into the bathroom 
Carl turns on the water in the tub 
takes the baby by the back of his shirt 
puts him in the tub 
gets a soap and a washcloth 
lathers it up 
washes baby 
laughs he gets some soap in his mouth Carl does 
and he starts blowing bubbles 
oh the little baby thinks that's just  that's just really funny 
so  then Carl gets the blow dryer out 
he dries the baby who thinks this is fun 
he just looks at that he just loves it 
and then the next picture we have the baby being boosted over the side of the crib by Carl 
now baby's back in his crib 
Carl starts to clean up 
okay  he picks up the sandwich bread and the pieces of bread in the sandwich wrapper 
he licks up the milk that's spilled on the floor 
and he goes to the window to see if anybody's coming back yet 
no he's still got time 
he goes into mom and dad's bedroom 
he straightens up the bed 
he puts the powder puff back in the powder box 
and he's looking out the front door 
here comes mom 
oh  mom comes in and there's her boy back in his crib all covered up 
and there's Carl guarding the little boy on the floor where he was when Momma left 
and so  mommy says 
 good dog  Carl 
and Carl cuddles up and puts his big head in Momma's lap 
and she pets him and gives him love 
and that's the story of Carl and the little boy and mommy 
first we go to Lowes 
and we decide what kind of flower we're gonna buy 
so  we decide to get pansies 
and we want a six pack because they're already started and easy to plant 
each one has its own little square of soil 
so  we go home and we say 
 where are we gonna put them 
so  we're gonna put them around the birdbath 
so  we dig little holes around the birdbath evenly ges
and when we have ges
and ges
ges
then after we ges
or the  beneath the pansy he her roots and her root ball I'll call it 
ges
ges
now pat ges
pat it down so_that the pansy stands up 
I'm talking like that book  laughs ges
stands up big and tall laughs 
and ges
and after that's done we water gently 
and then they're planted 
and happy 
well  first you need bread 
and you need peanut butter 
and you need jelly 
and you need a knife 
so  I would take two slices of bread 
and I'd put them on the bread board 
and on one side I would spread peanut butter ges
and on the side I would spread jelly ges
because if you try to put it on the peanut butter it slides all over the place 
so  then ges
ges
ges
ges
and I serve her 
I'm going back to my kids 
my daughter's fifty three 
and her sister  her younger sister's already retired 
well  I am seventy four almost seventy five 
what we gonna do now 
yeah  I can  I can tell you what I did 
I went into the hospital the day after Christmas to have major surgery  laughs 
but getting ready for that is  is uh much more of a story 
because uh uh my daughter and her husband came from Florida um two days before Christmas 
and we had a family Christmas with my cousin from France who came with his wife 
and their son came from Mississippi and their daughter came from Japan 
and there were seven of us for Christmas 
we had wonderful Christmas but they wouldn't let me drink wine because  but I snuck some in 
then five o'clock the day after Christmas um we went to the hospital 
and the rest wasn't that much fun 
um the rest of it 
the  the reason my daughter was there was to take me  look  aft look after me because she's a registered nurse 
and so she was there for about a total of seven days 
and then the cousins stayed on 
but that's what I did over the Christmas holiday laughs 
and I don't plan to do that ever again 
no 
it was a new experience however 
last weekend 
oh  last weekend I cleaned the house because my daughter and her husband are coming from Florida 
and they're arriving tomorrow evening 
so  I moved the car out_of the garage 
and I got my ges
and I ges
and I took my chamois and some pail of water and I scrubbed down the things that needed scrubbing 
I did three loads of wash on a Saturday 
Sunday I vacuumed the living room 
moved all the furniture 
put ges
I've found if you ges
so  I did that to ges
then having  sss laughs having vacuumed forwards ges
because you_know if I don't have everything looking just right they'll think 
 mm things are getting ahead of her 
 time to put her in the home 
you_know  ges
so  then I discovered the spots in the rug 
so  now I go out and I do the spot rug thing 
upstairs made sure everything was ready in the  in the uh guest room 
generally I didn't have a whole lot of fun 
laughs you_know 
oh and I  I worked on my computer for about six hours preparing uh the first three quarters of expenses for this year and tried to estimate for next year with property taxes and things that are going up in preparation for the meeting with the broker the financial advisor on Thursday which is the reason they're coming 
so  all in all I worked the entire weekend 
and I'm tired laughs 
oh_my_gosh what  when did I have my last vacation 
it was probably in 
well  you_know when you're retired it's hard to tell when you're on a vacation  laughs 
but I did go to Florida 
I think it was in June 
it was a sad time because 
yeah 
and you_know it's a sad time but I did have fun 
the reason it's sad is because I had two Siamese cats for sixteen years 
they were litter mates 
and one became very ill and hadta be put down 
and um I think it was  well February or March 
and then the night before I was to leave to visit my children in Florida the other one was put down 
so  those were  those were not fun 
those were not fun 
but had  I did have fun in  in Florida 
because we always do 
we go on the boat ride up and down in the xxx 
and we go out to dinner 
and we have wonderful gourmet meals 
we just kind_of play family 
because we don't see each other that often 
but we do things 
we  we go to the Everglades 
we take an airboat ride 
and uh  and that kind of stuff 
and they have  they once had two dogs and three cats 
they're down to two dogs and one cat now 
so  that  laughs that keeps me happy 
but pretty much that's it 
okay 
we'll  we'll set the scene first 
we're in a lovely little rural location here 
um the banks of a very tranquil lake 
and we have a sailboat in the lake 
and we have  actually it looks like we have a flag here and a kite 
a boy  little boy playing with a kite 
so  it's  it's windy 
it's windy enough to keep the flag fluffering 
now we have a cozy little house on the shore 
and it has a very pretty big tree in the front for shade 
and the car is parked in front of the garage 
and across their little driveway is a lovely expanse of lawn and just above the beach 
now the beach is very very narrow 
but it's wide enough that the little girl out there can play and sh she's making a sandcastle 
and it also has a pier 
that's where the sailboat comes when it's tired 
and looks like dad's on the edge of the pier 
or maybe it's Grandpa 
we can't tell from here 
but he's fishing and he's caught a fish 
now the boy who's flying the kite is being followed closely by his dog 
while mom and dad are sitting on a blanket on the grass 
shoes beside them radio playing dad reading a book 
and mom pouring what looks very much like a lovely glass of wine 
and then they have a picnic basket between them 
so  all in all I would say that this is a very happy family spending what is probably a beautiful Saturday together at home 
now here we have a rural scene 
we have just a two lane highway 
and in the distance on the left is a barn with a silo and a couple trees 
and in the foreground we have what looks to be a convertible with a man and a woman seated in the front 
and the man has a map in his hand 
and the car has stopped alongside a farmer who is busily digging a hole to plant a tree 
well  it's clear 
the man pulls out the map and he starts pointing to the places that he wants to go and where he thinks he is 
the farmer has his foot on his shovel while he listens to this story 
and then he begins pointing in the direction that the car's headed 
off they go 
we see them receding into the distance 
the farmer picks up his shovel and starts digging the hole 
and suddenly there's the car back in front of the farmer 
it looks like they just went around in a circle 
who knew 
we have here a setting in a living room which is clearly a little boy's birthday party 
and the little boy looks to be about six 
and uh what we see first is a beautiful birthday cake on the table 
we have the front door open 
and the little boy and the little girl are coming in 
obviously they're guests 
and they're carrying presents 
each one accompanied by the mother 
and they all stop and they look at the cake 
well  there's a big chunk taken out_of the cake 
and one of the candles 
looks like the little boy's fifth birthday according to the candle count 
then when you look across the table you see what look like paw prints 
the paw prints go across the table onto the rug 
and you follow the paw prints under the sofa 
and there's a puppy dog looking very guilty peeking out from under the sofa 
now facing this little puppy dog is a very angry momma who is brandishing a broom 
clearly threatening the puppy thinking that he was the cause of this 
the little boy is crying 
doesn't look like we had much fun at this birthday party because it leaves it right there 
but there she is 
everybody's unhappy 
but I'm gonna say that eventually mom puts the broom down 
and she takes a knife and she cuts the part of the cake out that was  that the dog chewed on 
and the little boy stopped crying 
and everybody came in and they had a wonderful party 
don't you wish real life was like that 
I counted the candles 
I cheated 
laughs well I have dogs and kids 
we have a little household setting here 
we're in the living room 
and husband and wife 
husband's sitting in the chair trying to read his newspaper clearly angry mouth wide open 
and what we assume is his wife is standing in front of him pointing at him in a very menacing way 
in the next picture we see husband with paper up  ges
and the wife heading for the door with her coat on and a suitcase 
she has had it 
looks as though as soon as she goes out the door the door closes husband was sad 
possibly remorseful 
thinking of the things he should have said 
thinking of the things he should not have said 
and all that kind of stuff 
what's he going to do 
he doesn't know 
it shouldn't have gone this far 
door opens 
he looks over his shoulder 
it's his wife 
she's back 
he can't believe it 
she forgave him for whatever it was he did which he doesn't really know it was 
so  they embrace 
and they're both very happy 
and in the middle of the embrace the husband looks out the open door 
and he sees the family car throat
okay 
set the scene here 
here we have what  what appears to be an emergency 
and how do we know this 
because we have a fire truck on the street and  f that goes by this large tree 
and two firemen racing toward the tree carrying a long ladder 
hm 
so  we look at the tree 
and we have a dog barking up the tree 
barko barko barko what's he  what is he barking at 
well  there's a little bird up there but I don't  th he's not barking at the bird 
gasps we see a grown man sitting on a branch of the tree 
well  what 
wait a second 
what is he doing up there 
so  we look a_little further and we see a kitty_cat on another branch which is clearly too small to hold a grown man 
and beneath the kitty_cat is a little girl who is crying and holding up her arms and saying 
 go kitty jump 
 come kitty come down 
and next to the little girl is her tricycle and a very short ladder 
now this  this tells us that there is a little girl whose kitty cat climbed a tree 
can't get down 
dad went up after the kitty_cat 
got stuck up there 
the dog is yelping 
he's barking 
and someone called the firemen 
and then they're coming to rescue first the father and then the kitty_cat 
and it's a happy ending because the little girl gets her kitty cat back 
I better pay attention 
that is an easy one because it's fairly recent 
the the  s the thing that I remember most about this surgery was the way it affected my thought processes 
I remember being in the recovery room and having very short periods of cognitive recognition 
and I remember hearing a woman's voice saying 
 oo she's a bleeder 
and then I went head
and that's the only thing I remember from the recovery room 
I reme 
is this what you want 
memories 
okay  and then I remember being ges
and uh I remember having a  ges
I can't remember what it was exactly because I never knew 
but I just knew they put it in my hand and there was a button on it 
and they said 
 you could push this button whenever you have a_lot_of pain 
 uh you can't push it  any less than six minutes apart 
 if you try it won't do anything 
 so  you're alright 
 don't worry about it 
so  whenever I fel felt that I couldn't stand it I would push that button 
then I remember seeing my daughter's face 
I remember seeing her and her husband 
and I head
I remember bits and pieces of uh nurses coming and catheters being inserted and 
but again hands
I never saw ges
just bits of it 
and I remember getting out_of bed the first day and being hands
and I remember the second day ges
w I'd had a hip replacement 
around the  the ges
and uh ges
and uh  each day I remember seeing my daughter and her husband at some time 
but not communicating with them or anything 
and when I left my daughter asked me several s questions 
sh being a nurse 
and I said 
 do you know I remember one day you came twice 
she said 
 we came twice every day 
see 
so  that's  that shows how much I was out 
I remember another thing 
sitting  sitting up straight in the hospital watching ges
and uh fingers
and the nurse came in later and she  s 
I could hear her ges
she was saying 
 boy she fell asleep sitting up 
and I thought 
 I'm not asleep 
 I'm just imit
laughs you_know 
and that  that's pretty much it 
and I  I remember the  the uh therapy afterwards and  and you_know pain and the  and the medication of the Vicodin 
and I remember saying things that didn't make sense 
and having a conversation on the telephone with a dispatcher who was sending someone out to hand
and um I remember asking him 
I had just taken Vicodin 
and I remember asking him 
 now who are you 
and I knew very well who he was 
and he would answer very slowly 
and I thought 
 oh  he's  ha he's he's   he's trying to you_know ges
and I'd say 
 why am I asking these stupid questions laughs 
and I was  wri and I said 
 ges
I could hear myself saying 
 now let me write this down 
and so in due course about three hours later these men showed up 
and I was back fingers
and I said 
 hi 
and they  they had come in 
and we  s we talked a bit 
and I had a my ges
I was walking around 
and finally I said to him 
 did your dispatcher say anything to you about the telephone conversation he had with me before he sent you out this morning 
you_know  he said  he said 
 yeah 
laughs I said 
 what'd he say 
he said 
 well  I don't know what you're gonna find when you get to eighteen sixty East Crystal Way 
laughs so  I told him I said 
 when you get back please tell him I was on drugs 
 tell him I was thoroughly drugged 
 I had just taken a pain pill 
 and it was three hours ago 
 and this is the difference between me right after it kicks in 
so  that's what I remember from  from that 
is that any help 
okay 
the first uh problem I noticed that was serious was when I landed in Japan and did not speak Japanese and everybody there spoke Japanese 
so  um it was frustrating 
uh I hadta put children in school 
I hadta take them shopping to get their uniforms 
I hadta take a taxi and tell him where I wanted to go and how to get home and 
so  how did I deal with it 
I studied Japanese 
uh every morning five days a week until I got so I could do it 
happened again when I went to Korea 
it happened again when I went to Guatemala 
so  and and  and Brazil 
where they did not speak English 
uh spoke English in Jamaica and they spoke in English in Malaysia at that time 
but uh the only time that I've really had what ges
and I hafta communicate immediately and then study at the same time 
and I find I do it by reading body language reading facial expressions 
um and a_lot of this moving hands and  to describe what I want 
and then as  as the language picks up on ges
that's pretty much my experience with that 
okay 
I was on a boat  a ship I should say 
and the USS President line it was President Wilson 
and we were sailing from I think it was  Los Angeles to Tokyo 
and I had my  my husband and my two youngsters were there 
uh they were probably third and fourth grade 
and we came in  we were about midway in the Pacific Ocean when a typhoon came up 
so  uh the captain you_know notified us 
 there's a  m m ges
well  what happened was ges
and the ges
and our little ship was in the vortex 
I was frightened 
I was  uh my children one of them was thrown out_of uh her bunk and you_know ges
and  and I  we strapped them in something 
I can't remember exactly because I was miserable 
I was s seasick 
and I was on the uh promenade deck 
and they had ges
so  because the promenade you're sposta be able to see but they had these ges
and I was strapped in a deck chair that was ges
and I was sitting in this chair sick as I could be watching the waves come up over me  gpxraises arms above head 
and then I would hear crashing ges
and one wave would go up real high 
the ship would creak 
it would go imit
I was probably the most terrified of any time I had ever been in my life 
they had um ropes uh for people you_know if you hadta go to the bathroom or something you couldn't walk so you would do this to try and find your way 
they had bed spreads ges
so  that was it 
and you_know we survived 
the boat didn't go down but it  uh I don't think it ever sailed again because it was already thirty years old and it was ready to be 
which wasn't very helpful laughs being  being on it 
but we survived 
but I've never been as frightened before or after 
also I had two little kids there with me 
so  that was scary 
bet that's a new one for you laughs 
this one is puzzling to me 
it's clearly a rescue operation 
and it clearly is in water because the man who appears to be rescuing the young lady is wearing a buoyancy vest 
what I can't make out is whether  she 
ahhah 
it looks like she  she got caught in a flood possibly 
and she has grabbed a branch that has stuck out into the raging waters 
that's what it is I bet you 
and she's clinging to this branch for dear life 
and he is trying to get her and bring her to shore 
did I make it up good laughs 
boy that was tough though 
I couldn't figure out what was going on there for a minute 
okay  we have a series of four drawings here 
the first one shows a youngster about eight or nine having a wonderful time kicking what looks to be a volleyball 
his aim is good 
goes right through the neighbor's window 
we don't know whether it's his window or whether it's a neighbor's window 
but as luck would have it it breaks the window goes through knocks a lamp over probably breaks the lamp 
yes it does 
and uh there's a gentleman sitting in the chair right next to the lamp 
now we don't know whether this is this boy's father or whether it's a neighbor 
but the gentleman stands up 
and he picks up the volleyball 
and stands looking out through the hole in his window 
and we are looking  we are left trying to decide whether he is going to throw the ball back at the little boy or whether he's going t 
he's not sure exactly what he's gonna do yet 
but he's gonna do something 
but we don't really know 
the title of this little scenario is Mother Knows Best 
in the first picture we have little boy setting  setting off for school 
he's ready to go and mom pulls out an umbrella 
 nah I don't want an umbrella 
 I don't need an umbrella 
okay 
she says 
 alright 
so  she keeps the umbrella and he heads off 
 it's not raining 
he says goodbye xxx 
okay 
he starts off to school 
and little drip drip drip starts 
just a little bit of rain 
and then it's more than a drip drip 
we have a little downpour 
so  hm
so  puts his hands over his head turns around races back home 
there he is with his mom 
she's looking down with that I told you so look that mothers have 
and he's standing there soaking wet 
next picture he's smiling going back to school and he has his umbrella 
once upon a time a long time ago there was a clears_throat beautiful little girl whose mother died 
so  her father married giving her a stepmother 
and the new stepmother had two daughters 
well  the two daughters were not anywhere near as fair as Cinderella 
and the stepmom did not treat Cinderella very well 
she did not treat her like she did her own daughters 
she made her do all the laundry 
she made them do all the housework 
she made  she made her wait on her stepsisters with her xxx 
and it looks to me like she slept out in the barn with the horses 
but she liked horses and she liked the dogs and she liked all the animals 
so  they liked her so she didn't care 
well  one day she was looking out the window at the castle 
she could see ges
and word came that the king was very angry with his son prince because he was not in any hurry to get married  to take a queen 
so  the king says 
 alright enough of your fooling around 
he sent out an 
well  it wasn't an edict it was more of a letter 
 to everyone in the kingdom saying that there would be a ball 
and his son would meet all of the eligible young ladies in the kingdom 
and there would be a way that one would be chosen from this ball 
gasps Cinderella thought 
 wouldn't that be wonderful 
 wouldn't that be wonderful 
so  she ges
and she made a beautiful  well very beautiful dress 
wasn't fancy really but she was such a  such a pretty girl it looked beautiful on her 
so  she thought she could go to the ball because she was certainly one of the members of the of the kingdom 
two stepsisters came in 
 no way are you going bitch 
so  they ripped off her gold necklace ges
 go back into the scullery 
so  she went back into the scullery 
and there sitting on a big trunk was someone who looked very much like a fairy godmother 
she had a ges
she took the story and she says 
 yes you shall go to the ball 
 you shall be beautiful 
 you shall have footmen 
 see these little points mice 
 they're gonna be your footmen 
 see that points pumpkin 
 it's gonna be your carriage 
 you  b see this dress 
boomo ges
beautiful slippers 
she was just beautiful 
she couldn't believe this was happening 
she didn't really know it was but she was all ready to go 
and she got into the carriage 
and she had gorgeous horses 
and the mice were now footmen 
and they ges
when they helped her down ges
the prince took one look at her and he thought 
 who are points these dogs 
he didn't say that 
he  he thought it 
so  he's dancing with her ges
and they're dancing around the ballroom 
and then comes time for her pumpkin to  her pumpkin and her mice to reappear 
it's midnight 
and she was told finger
 you've got til midnight 
she sees the clock 
she races out_of the ballroom 
and the prince says 
 where are you going 
he starts following her 
and she races down the stairs and jumps in the  into her coach and they race home 
and then there she is in her regular clothes sitting on a pumpkin ges
but as she was running down the stairs she lost one of her glass slippers 
gasps the prince saw it 
and he said 
 this is the slipper from the most beautiful woman in the kingdom and I am going to find her 
and so that began  the search 
they went to every house in the kingdom 
every young woman in the kingdom 
and noone could fit their big fat foot into that pretty little glass slipper 
went to Cinderella's home where Cinderella was nowhere to be seen 
two ugly stepsisters they tried to push it and they shove it 
they could head
and so the question was 
 isn't there another young lady 
 no  no  no  no  no 
well  finally head
no ges
he was gonna put it on 
so  ges
and it fit like a slipper 
he was so happy he'd found the girl of his dreams 
and if you can see what happened 
the next few pictures show us them ges
no more pumpkins 
and as they say they lived happily ever after
