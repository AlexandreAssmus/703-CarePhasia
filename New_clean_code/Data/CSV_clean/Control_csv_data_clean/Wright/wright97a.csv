laughs oh you'll need pats
you'll need a jar of pats
you'll need a jar of jelly pats
I prefer seedless raspberry 
you need a knife  pats
you will open the package of bread 
you will take out two slices of bread ges 
you will lay them face up onto the counter 
ges
you will take the knife and ges
ges
ges
ges
ges
you will ges
ges
you will spread it down ges
either is fine 
you will then fold the two pieces together ges
ges
you may choose to slice it into triangles 
so  little Amina went outside to play with her cat 
and her cat  got excited and scared because the dog started to chase it 
which is what the neighbor's dog always does 
his very annoying dog 
and the neighbors just don't keep it in his yard like they're sposta 
and so the cat ran up the tree 
but it got stuck because it went ges
and Amina's father came and said 
 no problem 
 I'll go up 
 I'll rescue the cat 
and he climbed up 
but then the ladder fell over 
and he got stuck 
so  then the neighbors even_though they're very bad with their dog they were also very kind neighbors 
and they noticed he was stuck in the tree 
and they called the fire department which is kind_of an overreaction because they could've just fixed the ladder themselves 
and the  c and the bird was singing very contentedly over this entire scene 
the end 
um
I did um trail riding recreational trail riding on horses in Northern_California in college and most weekends 
and I went out um with the other riders 
and I actually fell off the horse and got a concussion 
and in the midst of that um got back up onto the horse 
fell 
I_mean very tall horse actually 
Quasar was like sixteen hands or something 
and fell right ges
I lost consciousness for a few minutes 
and then when I came back to the college campus I went to the health clinic 
and they sent me to the hospital to get a cat 
and they kept me overnight 
um I remember  I remember one of the girls at the end of the hall 
I think it was like Thanksgiving weekend or something 
it was some holiday weekend 
there weren't a_lot_of people around 
and so Katie of all people happened to be around 
not a close friend but someone I knew 
and she was so nice 
she took me  to the hospital 
and it was the emergency room 
and it was just like crowded 
and I think it was maybe even a Saturday night 
and there were police bringing in like people with  ges cocaine in their stomachs 
I_mean it was an interesting 
it was like one of those like tv movie situations where there are all these things going on ges 
I think there was like some ges gunshot wound  you_know 
and here I am just sitting here with like points
and they needed to keep me overnight 
they did the cat 
um they kept me overnight 
I remember I just really really wanted to go home and take a shower 
and the person I was sharing a room with I think  was having some sort of family difficulty 
or she was very unhappy and possibly very sick or in pain or something 
and so she was having a hard time and 
I remember that my friends came the next day to pick me up 
and uh they forgot to bring clothes with them 
so  I was wearing a hospital gown with a  a ges
um basically um that's the time I was in the hospital laughs 
uh certainly 
I'm going to recall  yeah 
frightened or scared  whispering 
oh slaps
um last spring right before summer vacation I was laughs in my house  small apartment uh complex  small apartment just doing some schoolwork or something 
and I suddenly started hearing this imit
um and I
and I went into the kitchen 
and I notice there's a bee in my  inside my house which I don't understand how 
covers
because it's absolutely closed all the time 
screens on the window 
there's no way 
so  I thought that was odd  you_know trying to get out the window 
and I captured it 
and I put it outside 
and I noticed there were some bees flying around outside 
ges
I go into the bathroom 
and my bathroom  my shower stall has been invaded by about fifty bees 
I'm telling you it was like a horror movie 
it was the sound of ges imit
yes points
and I'm not overly phobic of bees 
I like them in their place 
I'm not like someone who runs away from them 
but a_lot_of them in my house in my bathroom 
and that feeling of going in 
and it was like a horror movie like imit
so  ges
ges
ges and they're all trying to get out the window which was good 
they were focused on the window 
so  yeah I  I freaked 
um I
I actually got a dirty towel and like ges
because you know how purposeful bees can be sometimes 
and uh gave a very panicked phone call to my landlady saying 
 um you needta get here now 
 we needta figure this out 
 what's going on 
and it turned out they had been coming in through a tiny hole ges
they were looking for a new um place to start a hive 
and so basically for a couple of hours it was very interesting 
we hadta get someone um 
you_know  were they going in everywhere 
how were they getting in 
they hadta call a bee expert 
so then  but yeah that was a freaky moment 
and I was very creeped out 
I remember going into my closet and like ges
and I_mean ges they were very focused on the windows 
but it was a_little creepy to think that like it might be ges
points
ges
that was creepy uh for sure 
you_know  and the bathroom is the last place you need anything 
yeah  you're vulnerable enough 
let's be honest 
like you just don't need anything coming at you with a stinger 
so  yes that was  that was  that was scary 
certainly 
sighs I'm trying to think of specific examples in the moment  whispering 
it's interesting  whispering 
um  um I'm trying to think of
certainly while teaching um sometimes having students  particular students who really are struggling 
and you feel like there's not clear communication 
it's not uh a coherent reason for why it's not working and a resolution kind of thing 
and you're struggling to understand 
um certainly sending emails to find out 
taking a moment saying 
 I wanna talk with you 
 I'm feeling you_know this  this is  this is  these are my concerns 
 um how can I better support you
 is there anything going on that you wish to share with me 
like those  ges trying to be open but also respectful of their privacy um and whatever they'd be interested in 
asking them 
you_know  I think it really helps to just start with you_know 
 these are my concerns 
i_e missing work or behavior in class or something like that 
and then giving them a chance and seeing what their response is is extremely helpful because that gives you a sense of ges where to go next um with that 
I'm trying to think 
I've had  I've had some really difficult situations with students of you_know basically just really disagreeing over the  the approach of the class or the expectations and philosophical differences 
and um oh I'm trying to think specifically 
I_mean involving other people too is very helpful sometimes because  then it's not just ges you and the other person 
um ges
is it just in this situation 
or is it a broader picture ges uh problem in their ability to communicate with their teachers or to get along with their peers 
and shrugs those are things I can think of 
mhm 
hm 
one day after schoo
and he did an amazing kick that kicked so well that the ball went all the way through  the window of his house and right into his dad's lap 
his dad was very surprised and went to the window and looked out to see where the ball had come from 
the end 
mhm 
 one morning this little boy was going to school 
and his mother was saying 
 you should really take your umbrella 
and he was saying 
 no no no waves
 I don't want it 
 I don't believe in umbrellas 
so  he left 
he said 
 goodbye  Mom 
and he started walking out the door 
and then lo_and_behold it started to rain a few drops 
he put his hands out hand
and all_of_a_sudden a_lot came down 
he was covering his  head excuse me  and running back to the house 
he was all wet 
he went into the house and he was soaking wet 
his mother was very displeased because she 
and this was something they were working on 
his ability to listen to her and accept her direction 
long term goal 
and then he took the umbrella and started walking back to school 
and it was okay because the umbrella kept him from getting rained on 
the end 
okay 
so  slaps
and she loved her father very much 
but her mother died 
so  her father went out to find a new wife and a mother for the little girl 
her name was Cinderella 
this woman came with two daughters 
but they were unpleasant 
and they were ugly 
we hafta be honest 
they were very ugly 
so  there's a great deal of stress after Cinderella's father
she was just left with the stepmother and these two sisters 
and they useta make her clean fingers
and they useta make her cook fingers
and they were very mean to her
and they made her live in the attic fingers
and they made her wear ug old ugly clothes fingers
but she was very very kind and very sweet and very smart and creative 
and she befriended all the animals in the house the mice and the birds 
and when she looked out the window every day she useta see this beautiful castle where the prince lived with his mother and father the king and queen of Fantasialand 
and laughs so she useta dream about going to the castle and going to a fancy dress  a fancy ball there and wearing a beautiful gown 
but she never thought that would happen because everyone was mean to her and she didn't have any nice clothes to wear 
and they always said to her 
 you'll never go to the ball 
 you'll never go the palace 
so  one day the invitation came that they were going to have a very big  a very big dance because the king was slaps
seriously 
all the pressure that goes on for women just as much for men 
and it was time for the prince to get married because one day he's going to be the king 
and he needed to have children 
and he needed to have a wife 
so  they were gonna have a big ball 
so  they were having a ball 
and Cinderella's ugly mean stupid stepsisters were getting ready to go 
and they were fixing their dresses and their jewelry and their hair and their fancy shoes 
and Cinderella really really wanted to go 
she was very sad because she thought there was no way that she could ever go 
but the mice and the birds that Cinderella was friends with were actually magic mice and birds 
and they knew how to sew 
and they knew how to accessorize 
and they knew how to design dresses apparently 
so  they made this beautiful pink ball gown for Cinderella 
and she was so surprised and so excited 
I wonder what was next  whispering 
then she
and at the ball she met the prince 
and it was just love at first sight 
the way it should be 
he loved her and she loved him 
and they had a wonderful time dancing 
and  then her sisters saw her and were very very upset that she was there 
and they were pulling her dress 
and they were tearing her scarves 
and they chased her away and made her go home 
but then it turned out that the prince was looking for her because he decided that she was the one that he wanted to marry 
and so he sent out a message to ges
and he was looking for her because he knew that the foot that went in with the slipper belonged to the girl he wanted to marry 
but the evil stepmother and the stepsisters locked her away and wouldn't let her come out and be part of the search for the foot that goes in the magic slipper 
so  the mice stole the key and snuck under the door and let her out 
and then the prince did find her 
and then they got married 
and then the king was happy 
and we don't really care what happened to the stepmother and stepsisters 
the end
