okay  there's a home um with a little boy and a very upset mother 
it looks like the little boy was going to have a birthday party 
and  the mother had placed the birthday cake on a table 
and the family dog had come in 
and gotten into the cake 
eaten part of it 
and retreated under the couch because the mother caught him in the act and was chasing him with a broom 
so  he's under the couch 
the mother's very upset 
the little boy is crying 
and the guest are starting to arrive 
um there's um another woman with probably her son bearing a gift 
and then another mother coming with a daughter with a gift 
and they're just standing in the doorway um watching what is going on 
I take two pieces of bread from the loaf of bread 
put it on a plate 
I open the peanut butter 
and get a knife 
and spread the peanut butter on the bread 
I would put the two pieces of bread together 
and cut them in two 
and I have a peanut butter sandwich 
okay  the most recent thing I can remember was about ten years ago 
I had vertigo 
extreme vertigo 
and I was working at the time 
um I couldn't walk without bumping into things 
um I was afraid to drive 
and I went through all this testing 
I was never hospitalized 
but I hadta take six weeks off from work 
I never miss work 
and I've never had anything last so long or take such a toll on me 
um I did cat 
and they could never find any reason for it 
um all the blood work was fine 
um it's very frustrating because they don't know how to treat it or what to do 
you just hafta wait it out 
so  I um stayed at home 
uh went through all the testing 
went to the doctor's 
um finally decided to go to a chiropractor 
and my doctor agreed that was fine 
so  I went for massage therapy and uh muscle and nerve stimulant 
and that helped 
and they found out I have compressed discs in my neck 
and my theory is that it cuts off the blood supply and you lose your equilibrium 
now that's not proven 
my regular doctor of_course doesn't go along with it  laughs 
my chiropractor thinks that's the answer  laughs 
but it was just a terrible ordeal 
and um I've not had it return 
um just a little bit once in awhile 
but I find that when my back is out_of alignment and my discs are compressed that it kind_of slows down your  your functioning 
so  anyway that was the worse thing I've probably experienced 
um somewhat yes 
well  my husband um has been treated for lung cancer 
and he had extreme um hard core treatment 
he had chemotherapy and radiation 
and he had brain radiation 
uh they do that to uh ward off maybe the cancer coming back to your brain 
but in the process of doing this my husband's been on a_lot_of medications 
and he's a very bright man and very articulate 
during this time when he is on all the medications and going through this his speech was very slow 
his thought process was very unlike him 
he just didn't process well at all 
so  you hafta be very patient 
hafta listen 
hafta try not to lose your temper 
try not to be argumentative 
um tried my patience as much as it's ever been tried 
um just kind_of wait  wait it out 
and finally when he was finished with the treatment a year later he started to come back to his old self 
and um you work back into it from there 
um he still is not as quick as he was prior to all the treatment 
but it  his
and uh the communication is that they hafta blame somebody so the first person in line would be me laughs 
um it's just a matter of speaking distinctly 
I hadta repeat my  myself 
I hadta make decisions for him 
and I hadta get him to buy into that it was okay and not be angry about it 
so  we did work through that 
actually  it went pretty well 
and he was a much better patient then I thought he would be 
and head
head
I do not wanna be a care giver  laughs 
but you work through it 
you do what you hafta do laughs 
 oh yes 
hm let's see 
um I guess the most frightening time would be um I lived in Colorado 
and I worked for the telephone company 
and I lived in northern Colorado small town Greeley 
and all the small offices in the telephone company were being closed down 
centralizing into Denver and Phoenix and the big cities 
I commuted from Greeley to Cheyenne 
that  once they closed my office I commuted first to Fort Collins 
we closed that office 
Boulder we closed that office 
and then I went to Cheyenne 
and that's about um just under a seventy mile trip 
and it's on il twenty five 
it was winter time 
the roads between northern Colorado and Wyoming are horrible 
um I was on the road and a storm came up 
I slid off the road 
ditched my car 
and I hadta call for help to come and get me 
and luckily I did have a mobile phone with me that did pick up um transmission 
so  I was able to get a hold of my son back in Greeley 
and he came with a tow truck and got me out 
but the wait was like four hours for him to get out there 
and it's very frightening because you're not really sure what's going to happen laughs 
but he did get me 
we got back to town 
they got my car back 
and um I was very careful from then on when I commuted between Greeley and Cheyenne 
if it looked like it was going to storm or if there was any warning I stayed over laughs 
okay  I'm not real sure 
is that ice 
it looks to me like there's water with ice on it 
and a young girl has fallen through the ice 
and she's unable to get out 
and there's a rescue person probably a firemen um that is holding onto um a stick or an overhang of some kind 
and he has on a life jacket 
and he is going out to rescue her 
and it looks like he is very close to getting her 
um and it looks to me like he's within reach of  of grabbing her out_of the water 
very scary 
there's a young boy playing with a soccer ball 
and he kicks it 
it goes through a window 
breaks the window 
goes inside a house 
knocks a lamp over 
and there's a man sitting in a chair by the lamp 
he gets out_of the chair 
retrieves the ball 
goes to look out the broken window 
but I don't think he finds the young man who kicked the ball 
he's just standing there looking out the window wondering where the ball came from 
there's a mother with an umbrella 
and her son with his backpack going to school 
um he is trying to leave 
and his mother's trying to give him the umbrella to take 
but he doesn't want it 
so  he waves goodbye 
goes off without the umbrella 
gets outside and it starts to rain 
and it starts to rain really hard 
it's coming down 
and he's getting quite wet 
so  he turns back 
goes home 
and he appears to be quite soaked 
his mother is scolding him 
he then evidently leaves with the umbrella 
and walks to school in the rain with the umbrella 
mother does know best 
okay  um Cinderella lives with her father 
and her mother had died 
and her father decides to remarry 
so  his wife and her two daughters come to the house to live with them 
and the mother  the stepmother of Cinderella is very mean to Cinderella 
and the stepsisters are very mean to her also 
and the father is away 
he really doesn't know this is going on 
but Cinderella hasta clean the house and feed the animals 
and she becomes more of a chambermaid than a daughter while the stepsisters are pampered and get lots of nice clothes 
um Cinderella makes friends with all the animals in the yard 
and she longs to be part of the family and to be happy again 
she's looking out the window one day 
and there's the castle where the  the beautiful  the handsome prince lives 
and she daydreams about being pretty and meeting the prince someday 
well  the prince is in the castle 
and his father says it's time for him to marry 
he needs to take a wife 
and in order to find a nice young wife for him they're going to have a ball and invite all the  the eligible ladies from the kingdom to come to the ball 
so  they send out invitations 
and an invitation goes to Cinderella's house 
but the wicked stepmother gets it 
and she reads it 
and the daughters of_course are going to go 
and Cinderella thinks she should get to go also 
so  the stepsisters get all the  get these beautiful gowns and get prepared to go to the dance 
and Cinderella goes to the chest where her mother had her things 
and she gets herself a dress ready to go 
and is going to go to the ball along with the stepsisters 
well  they get ready to go 
and the stepsisters tear her gown 
and they're very mean to her 
and they tell her she can not go 
so  she hasta stay home and clean the house 
and the mother  the stepmother takes off with her daughters to the ball 
well  Cinderella is crying 
and her fairy godmother appears and wants to know what's wrong 
so  Cinderella tells her she wants to go to the ball 
and the fairy godmother says 
 I will grant your wish 
and she gives Cinderella this beautiful gown with some beautiful slippers 
and turns a pumpkin into a coach 
and the mice into beautiful horses 
and she sends Cinderella to the ball 
but she cautions 
 you must be home before midnight because if you aren't the magic will go away 
 and the coach will become a pumpkin 
 and the horses will become mice again 
 don't forget to be home by midnight 
so  Cinderella goes to the ball 
and she is the most beautiful girl at the ball 
and she dances all night with the the prince 
and he is very taken with her 
and they are dancing 
and all_of_a_sudden she sees that it's going to be midnight 
and she runs away from the prince down the stairway 
and she loses one of her glass slippers 
she gets to the coach 
and they barely get back home before the magic goes away 
and she returns to her life cleaning the house 
and the wicked stepsisters and the mother come home 
and they're very distraught about this beautiful girl that was at the  the ball but she disappeared 
well  a notice goes out to the kingdom that they have a slipper that they wanna fit to the beautiful girl who left the ball 
and the prince visits all of these women and tries the slipper on all of these women 
nobody can fit into this beautiful glass slipper 
he comes to the house of Cinderella 
well  the stepsisters of_course wanna try on the slipper 
well  it wont fit either one of them 
and the prince asks if there is anyone else in the house 
and they don't want Cinderella to come out forth 
but she does 
and she tries on the slipper 
and it fits 
and she turns into this beautiful princess again 
and the prince marries her 
and they go away and live happily ever after
