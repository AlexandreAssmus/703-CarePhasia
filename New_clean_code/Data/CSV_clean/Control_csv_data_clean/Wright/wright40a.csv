okay  well  I had appendicitis 
I felt really crappy the whole day 
just thought it was stress 
and left work early 
it was a long drive home 
by the time I got home I was in so much pain that I  I just  I couldn't handle it 
my husband hadta go to work 
fortunately for me I had a sixteen year old daughter who could drive laughs 
and she took me to urgent care 
at urgent care they decided  I had appendicitis 
and admitted me to the hospital 
they gave me something for the pain 
gave me a little cup for the  n just in case for the nauseousness 
and when  and uh let's see they took some blood work 
the next day they took more blood work 
they decided 
 yep it was appendicitis 
they're taking my appendix out 
they knocked me out cold  thank goodness 
took my appendix 
and went home the next day 
and I recouped for two weeks 
and it is so good ta 
 yes 
um when I was a child uh a friend of the family was deaf 
um now as a kid you don't know too much 
but we always made sure that  we looked at him when we spoke to him because he read lips 
and h uh he had   for school he had uh a big um hearing aid thing ges
back then they were very big 
uh subsequently after I moved down here I found out that um he was able to have an operation 
and get his hearing back 
heard he laughs went on to medical school 
yeah shrugs 
yes 
yes 
um at the beginning 
it was a regular night 
we lived in a house that had an Arizona room 
uh we got  an had the children in bed 
and it was time for us to go to bed 
through miscommunication  I thought my husband locked the back door 
from the Arizona room to the outdoors 
he thought I had 
we'd gone to bed 
and I woke up 
I heard my husband whispering 
I thought maybe he was talking in his sleep 
but he grabbed my leg 
and then I heard him say 
 yes he's in the house now 
I heard that 
and I got really scared 
then he squeezed my leg even harder 
um this is while we lived in Tempe 
um right by the il ten over in the Peterson neighborhood 
um the Tempe police department were very prompt 
not only did they have people in our ges
they had both sides ges
in a matter of minutes they also had a canine unit 
and this man after having robbed us on a  he was on a bicycle 
um the  uh the canine took a bite out_of crime laughs 
head
so  they caught him 
this was his third ges
and uh so we were good 
it was  you_know everything was  most of the stuff was recovered 
I hadta wait for some of it 
um  but after that  I think  was when I was more scared because he went through our house 
he looked in our children's bedrooms 
that was  what if my kids would have woke up 
you_know  that was the scary part 
what if they'd have woken up 
what would he have done 
but he wasn't a very smart laughs 
like I said on a bicycle 
and then a couple of days later after talking to my neighbors um he was going through the neighborhood ges
s you_know ges
so  from that day forward every  ho every door in the house  even after we've moved 
head
and this has been a good  sighs nineteen years 
yeah  we're still checking doors 
head
um  there is a man and a woman 
um it looks as if the man is hanging on to a branch  um to rescue this young lady  that is caught in the snow 
 possibly from an avalanche 
the end shrugs 
alright  sighs uh there is a little boy playing soccer 
he's practicing 
he practices his kicks 
and the ball goes right into a window 
breaks through the window 
knocks over a lamp  that's sitting on a table next to a man sitting in a chair 
the man stands up holding the soccer ball and looks out the broken window 
the end 
 a little boy is leaving the house with his backpack 
and his mother is g going to give him an umbrella 
but he declines the umbrella 
tells his mother 
 bye waves 
starts to rain 
doesn't have an umbrella 
now it's really raining 
he's all wet 
he comes home 
and mother is looking very cross at th her very wet son 
and he gets the umbrella 
and now he's drier 
the end shrugs 
story of Cinderella 
Cinderella  um lived with her father and her dog 
one day he brings home a new wife and her two daughters 
now the father hasta go away and leave the stepmother in charge 
her daughters the stepsisters are evil and mean 
and the stepmother makes her do all the cleaning and the laundry 
they get a notice  because the prince hasta get married 
and the king is just beside himself 
he must find a wife 
so  they're going to have a ball so_that he can pick out a wife 
 and Cinderella says 
 oh  may I go too 
 well  if you get all of your chores done 
and then help your sisters get ready 
 then if you have any time you can go with us 
so  they give her all kinds of work to do 
in meantime her little friends the mice help with getting her dress ready 
now the evil stepsisters have thrown things away that they don't want 
they're no good 
so  they take them and make her dress 
she has this pretty little dress 
and she's ready on time 
the evil stepsisters take the  the necklace and the ribbon and they just rip it right off of her dress 
and off they go to the ball 
Cinderella is very very sad 
sitting outside crying to her mice friends and her dog 
when her fairy godmother comes 
and says 
 well  you get to go to ball 
and she puts her in this very pretty dress by magic 
and turns the dog and the horse and the mice into a carriage and a footman and pretty horses 
and takes her over to the ball 
she looks very nice 
she dances with Prince_Charming 
they have a wonderful time 
but she hasta be at  back by midnight 
so  when the clock strikes twelve 
she runs down the stairs but she loses a slipper 
one of her glass slippers 
she gets home just in time 
but she hasta walk because the pumpkin  the  the carriage turned back into a pumpkin 
the  m the horses turned back into mice 
and the dog  tur uh the footman turned back into a dog 
so  then um the  um I guess the  um the duke at the castle is looking for the maiden who will fit in this shoe 
and asking all the maidens throughout the village 
so  they get to Cinderella's house 
and the evil stepmother locks her in her bedroom so_that she can't try it on ju
and the oldest stepdaughter  stepsister tries on the shoe and it's too small 
so  they put it on the other stepsister and it's too small 
it's like 
 this is the last house 
 we don't know what we're gonna 
in the meantime the mice get uh the key from the stepmother 
and unlock the door 
and Cinderella comes downstairs 
and says 
 may I try 
so  she tries on the slipper 
and of_course it fits 
and she marries tri Prince_Charming 
and they live happily ever after
