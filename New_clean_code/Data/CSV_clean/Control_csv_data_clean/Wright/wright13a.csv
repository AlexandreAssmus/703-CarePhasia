okay  when I was seventeen years old after I'd gra graduated from high school 
I went to Anaheim for a week long conference 
and while I was there I developed meningitis 
and uh I couldn't lay my head down on the pillow 
it  it  it was excruciating 
you_know  the  my scalp is very sensitive so I couldn't lay my head down on anything 
I really didn't know what was wrong with me 
I just thought I had a bad headache 
so  I went out to the kitchen and uh just sat there for about an hour or two 
it was the middle of the night and uh didn't really know what to do because I couldn't lay my head down 
but I was exhausted 
and uh so I ended up um going 
and uh there was someone staying in the room with me 
I  I told them that I couldn't sleep 
something was wrong with my head 
and uh he was actually a neurologist 
uh but uh he ended up giving me some pretty strong uh um pills to help the pain go away 
and it helped through the morning 
but then the next day it continued to hurt 
so  uh I ended up going to the hospital that evening 
I was actually staying with three doctors 
so  they took me to the the hospital 
and uh they checked me in 
they did a  um first did a elec 
let's see what was it 
a cat 
think it was a cat 
uh um and if I had a tumor or anything near the spinal column that could paralyze me 
uh so  that was fine so they ended up performing the lumbar puncture 
a  it was a  it was a resident it was a teaching uh hospital it was U_C_Irvine 
and uh he didn't do a very good job at it 
so  the the doctor was watching him took over 
it was painful 
but they had given me morphine by this point 
so  I felt much better 
uh I felt great actually really warm and fuzzy inside 
and uh I was still in the emergency room at that point 
and eventually the next morning got me into my own room 
and uh I felt fine by the next day 
um but they didn't think I was doing well because I wasn't eating that much 
but when I was seventeen I was only eating uh one meal a day 
but they said I they would let me go home if I didn't eat more 
so  I hadta eat three meals a day 
and they wanted to monitor me 
and but I felt great 
and I thought it was ridiculous that they kept me there 
and they kept me two more days 
and uh they performed another lumbar puncture before they would let me go 
and to check my white blood cell count 
and it was pretty much the same as it was before 
so  it didn't show much of an improvement 
but I felt great 
so  they let me go home 
hm
let's see  is it 
my niece and my  one of my nieces one of my nephews had a speech delay 
it was  it was mainly with phonation 
just problems with  uh mainly with uh 
let's see  what was it 
I think it was the sl hl sound 
and um I think both of them had that same problem and a couple of others you_know problems with uh liquids 
but that's not a big problem 
you_know  you develop later 
um I  I actually did work with one of my nieces in regards to that 
she was very responsive 
um but uh it  it wasn't that big of a difficulty 
you_know  we could just  I could still understand her for the most part 
wasn't a big problem 
is there anything else I should tell you about 
okay 
yes 
I was going to go visit my great uncle my mom's uncle in Iowa 
and I was with my sister 
we were taking the Greyhound um from Nebraska up to Iowa 
and we were there at one of the Greyhound stations 
and my sister wanted to go to grab a bite to eat while it was  uh it was a rest stop there and uh she wanted to go grab a bite to eat 
the bus driver said to hurry 
and he ended up leaving without us 
and we were stuck in some place 
I had no clue where we were 
I was only nine 
and uh I was very scared 
and uh we tried to chase after the bus 
and it wouldn't stop 
and uh my sister was kind_of panicking 
she was like fourteen or fifteen and I was nine 
but uh then my uh my my great aunt pulled up like right then 
she was worried 
she hadn't seen us yet 
so  and it was only like ten minutes later 
so  I was fine 
okay 
okay 
one day a girl decided to go on hike through a riverbed which was very dry at that time as it was Arizona 
then there happened to be a flash flood 
and as she walked  she was walking this flood roared down through the riverbed and caught her 
and she incapable of you_know swimming to the shore or anything 
and she was uh panicking and was very frightened and didn't know what to do 
eventually she  the  the  the  um the  the water brought her to a tree limb where she was able to grab on 
and uh she was screaming for help 
and uh some people nearby heard her and called nineoneone for a rescue team to come and fetch her out_of the water 
and uh a little while later they arrived 
and um the man was wearing a vest 
and he was tied on to the tree limb 
and he had uh a belt attached to her 
and he climbed down the tree limb attached her to the belt and pulled her out to safety 
and she knew not to walk in riverbeds before flash floods 
okay 
one day Tommy decided to go play soccer out in the field uh behind his house 
and um he tried to kick the ball as hard as he could 
and the ball flew very far right through his living room window where his dad was sitting watching television 
the ball went through the window and also broke the lamp 
the father picked up the ball looked out the window and saw his son 
the father called the boy in and grounded him for a week 
one day Tommy was preparing to go to school 
the mother said it was going to rain that day and insisted that he take an umbrella 
Tommy said 
 no umbrellas are for sissies 
and uh he left 
the mother was not happy 
but he left anyways 
on his way to school it began to pour down so much that he hadta run home to get that umbrella 
when he arrived at home he was sopping wet 
and his mother scolded him for not taking her advice in the first place 
then Tommy took the umbrella and walked back to school 
Cinderella was a little girl 
her mother had passed away 
and her father uh ended up remarrying a woman who had two daughters 
uh the  this woman and her two daughters 
well  eventually Cinderella's father also passed away 
and she was left with her stepsisters and stepmother 
her stepmother and stepsisters were very cruel to her and made her um their servant basically 
and uh everyone  they were very cruel to her 
and she lived a very um meager life 
and um but she was f friends with all the animals 
uh the animals were the people she got along with people she could talk to or  the  the creatures that she could talk to 
and uh then one day the there was a prince in that um country 
and uh they were gonna hold a ball for him to find his wife 
and  uh as it was time for him to marry 
and all  and Cinderella and their  her stepsisters were very excited to go 
uh however Cinderella uh could not go unless she had finished all her chores 
her stepmother gave her tons and tons of chores to accomplish 
and she said Cinderella could only go if she finished all her chores first 
um so  um by the time uh it came to go um Cinderella had just finished her chores and had no time to um make a dress or prepare herself to go 
but uh unbeknownst to her her animals friends had prepared a dress for her while she was doing her chores using fragments of her stepsisters' clothes and such that uh they had cast away because they didn't want it 
um so  Cinderella was very happy um that they had the dress for her 
and sh while the  the stepmother and the stepsisters did not expect her to be able to make it um Cinderella came rushing down the stairs wearing her new dress very happy to go 
then the stepsisters began to realize that her dress was composed of things they had cast away 
and um they started tearing all the pieces of the dress that belonged to them until Cinderella was left in nothing but tatters 
and she went out to the yard and was crying 
and then uh a fairy godmother appeared and put a spell on her that would last until midnight 
she made her very beautiful and uh all that 
but she warned her 
it would only last til midnight 
and you_know she turned you_know uh a pumpkin into a carriage and you_know transformed all these elements uh to make her look very beautiful 
and so Cinderella raced off to the ball where she met the prince 
and uh I guess it was love at first sight 
and they were dancing together 
and you_know he he very much enjoyed his time with her 
and uh they were dancing outside 
and she saw the clock 
and she knows it's almost midnight so she went racing down the stairs uh leaving one of her glass slippers behind um 
and she went racing off in the carriage 
and um she actually didn't make it quite home in the when it struck midnight 
and everything turned back to what it was pumpkin 
the carriage turned back into a pumpkin 
and everything went back to the way it was except for one of her glass slippers 
and so this prince um after this happened he uh was very interested in finding her 
you_know  he was  wo he wondered why she had ran away 
and so he um set out to search for her using the glass slipper 
you_know  whoever's foot it fit would be that girl 
he sent out his  um I don't know it was the duke or something uh to find the girl whose foot the slipper would fit 
it was very small 
um and eventually that duke got to Cinderella's house 
and uh Cinderella got excited 
but the stepmother knew why she was there and locked Cinderella up in the room as somehow she figured out it was Cinderella 
I don't remember how 
and um locked Cinderella up there 
and  um while her stepsisters tried on the glass slipper 
their feet were way too large 
they went flying you_know every time 
and uh the animals ended up helping Cinderella by fetching the key from the  the stepmother to open the door that she was locked behind 
and she came downstairs to try on the glass slipper 
the stepmother was very angry at this 
and the duke began to walk over towards Cinderella with the glass slipper 
and uh the stepmother tripped him 
and the glass slipper went flying into the air and fell on the ground and crushed into a million pieces 
and you_know the duke thought that everything was over 
and everything was ruined 
and they'd never find her 
but just at that moment she Cinderella produced the other glass slipper and revealed her identity 
and she ended up marrying the prince 
and they lived happily ever after 
one day a girl was walking home from school when she noticed that her cat Patches was in the tree stuck and was crying 
she ran home quickly to get her dad to help him  to help the cat out 
ah the dad brought a ladder just in case 
and as they were leaving the door the dog rushed through and started barking at the cat at the base of the tree 
the father then climbed up the tree 
well  that's kind_of wrong but laughs 
and uh the dog happened to knock over the ladder uh after the du dad  ha the dog knocked over the ladder after the dad already climbed into the tree 
now the father was also stuck 
uh meanwhile the neighbor called ah nineoneone 
and then  an  uh a  uh the firemen came to help him down from the tree
