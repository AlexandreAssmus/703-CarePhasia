was out riding her tricycle along with her cat when a dog came racing up to them and scared the cat 
the cat ran up in the tree and the little girl couldn't get him down 
so  she called for her dad 
he came rushing out to see what the excitement was about and realized that his daughter's cat was up in a tree 
so  he got his ladder and went over to the tree climbed up the ladder and got on to the first branch 
then the dog got excited and ran over and knocked the ladder down 
so  now her father was stuck up in the tree with the cat 
luckily a neighbor had seen what was going on and had called the fire department 
so  two firemen came rushing to the rescue with their own ladder 
they set the ladder up against the tree and got both the father and the cat down 
and everybody was happy

okay 
um this was about two years ago 
and I was having uh pain in my left hip 
points
and I'd had a car accident earlier that year 
so  I thought maybe it was related to that 
uh but since it had been several months since the car accident my doctor decided to do an xray 
and they found out that um the bone  the joint was actually dying because I had what was called uh avascular necrosis or osteoporosis where the blood supply didn't join for whatever reason dies or gets cut off 
so
so  um we set up the appointment 
um or the  the specialist set up the appointment uh you_know with the hospital for the date of surgery 
and I went into the hospital 
and um shrugs shakes
I've never really been sick or anything in my life 
so  um they put me under 
and I actually kind_of woke up before they were completely finished 
but they had what they call nerve blockers so I couldn't feel anything from the waist down 
but they were finishing up 
and I was like looking around 
and the doctor was kinda surprised 
he was like 
 oh  just be calm 
 we're almost done 
um and uh so then after that they wheeled me into the r recovery room where you_know I kinda came more out_of the anesthetic 
and then I spent two days in the hospital uh before they were  uh before they were happy enough with my progress to let me go home 
um and then really the whole thing took about six weeks before I was fully recuperated enough to be able to go back to work 
um and then it was ges a year before they said I was completely healed 
but um yeah that was the  the only time I've ever really been in the hospital 
no  it was really kind_of strange because I  you_know I trusted the doctors 
and I thought I w would be afraid you_know especially when they were putting me under 
um but I really wasn't frightened or  or scared 
oh yeah definitely 
sure laughs 
alright this was uh gosh back when I lived in Alaska when I was a teenager 
and uh my family uh we lived in Anchorage and we'd always  every weekend we would go down to the Kenai_Peninsula to either the Kenai_River or the Russian_River to go salmon fishing because the salmon would run 
and so um I had a whole bunch of fish that I had caught 
and I was gonna take them back to our campsite 
and I was wearing ges
everybody wears waders 
so  anyway I was ges
and I'm walking along 
and I hear something ges
and I look over to my right 
and I see a little baby moose ges 
and I'm like 
 oh  how cute a baby moose 
well  I hear something ges
and I look over and it's the mother moose 
and it freaked me out 
and I was scared to death because if the mother smelled me or saw me or heard me she would probably come charging at me and try to trample me to protect the baby 
and I had this huge thing of fish ges
and I was like   s I  I didn't wanna drop the fish because I thought that would make noise 
so  I was trying to like tiptoe as fast as I could through that area 
and I was able to get past that 
I don't know how I was able to get through there 
I don't know how the  m the mother moose didn't hear me because they have good hearing 
they don't see very well 
but apparently ges
I don't know 
but yeah  I was like scared for laughs my life there for a little bit until I got past that area and back to camp 
they're huge 
and they look so goofy and 
but they can be really dangerous 
yeah  actually my grandmother uh on my dad's side um you_know as she got older um 
she'd had uh a couple of strokes and a couple of heart attacks um in her life 
but as she got older her memory started to go 
and it was  uh I think she 
I don't know if it was Alzheimer's that she had or dementia or what 
but we would go to see her you_know from time to time 
and you_know sometimes she would be really th you_know with it 
she could remember lots of things 
and other times you would kind_of hafta tell her who you  who you were and talk really slowly 
and you_know she would keep repeating twirls
and she'd be asking me about Kathleen which is actually my mother 
and so 
 no 
you hafta say 
 no Grandma it's Rich 
and she's 
 oh  Richie 
and so then you_know she would remember who I was for awhile 
and then she'd kinda fade out again 
so  it was difficult to communicate 
it was kind_of hard emotionally too you_know because I remember her from when she was younger 
and she was like my favorite grandmother 
and she was really a_lot_of fun 
and then to see her in that situation where she's just kind_of a shadow of her former self was  was upsetting 
so 
um well  I would hold her hand you_know and just be  you_know modulate my tone of voice 
um you_know  just repeat it if  if she couldn't understand 
um you_know  just be there for her really 
sometimes she couldn't understand 
she would be happy and she would smile even if she didn't 
you_know  you would talk to her and she may not understand 
but I think just the tone of my voice and the fact that I was holding her hand or stroking her arm ges
okay 
Joey had just joined the soccer team and he was very excited 
so  he was on his way home uh with the soccer ball kicking it around as he went trying to make sure that he would be ready for the big soccer match next weekend 
unfortunately he got a_little too enthusiastic with his kicks 
and the soccer ball went through a window in his neighborhood 
Mister_Moss was sitting calmly in his chair watching tv when all of a sudden the soccer ball came crashing through his window in the living room and hit a lamp and knocked it over 
he jumped out_of the chair grabbed the soccer ball and looked out the window 
but he couldn't see anybody because Joey had hidden in the bushes 
and he was perplexed as to who had done this and what he was going to do about it 
the end  whispering laughs 
okay 
one day a little boy was getting ready to go to school 
and his mother said that he had better take a rain  shakes
the little boy said 
 it never rains when they say it's going to rain so I don't need the umbrella 
 I'm just gonna go without it 
 it's something I don't needta carry along with my backpack 
well  he'd barely gotten out_of the  out_of the house and down the street when all_of_a_sudden it didn't just start raining 
it started pouring 
so  he ran back to the house as fast as he could totally annoyed at himself for not taking the umbrella 
he got inside the house where his mother was also not very happy with him because he was soaking wet 
and she was afraid he was gonna catch a cold 
he  fi he took the umbrella this time and then walked  o and went back outside and headed on to school where he made it safely and dry 
the end  whispering 
okay 
um once upon a time there was a little girl named Cinderella 
and unfortunately her father passed away 
and she was sent to live with um her stepmother and stepsisters um who were very jealous of her because she was so beautiful 
and they made her do all the chores while they got to have all of the fun 
as she got older her only friends were the farm animals and the mice that lived around the house and the farm 
um one day the king decided that he was going to have a big celebration for his son to try to find a wife for his son 
because he was getting older and he wanted to make sure that uh somebody was  would be uh able to succeed him when he was ready to retire as king 
so  couriers went across the land and delivered the uh message or delivered invitations to all the eligible uh bachelorettes or unmarried women in the kingdom 
and the  t the stepsisters were very excited 
and Cinderella was excited too 
but then they laughed at her saying 
 you can't go to the ball 
 you don't have a dress 
 you're just a scrub girl 
and Cinderella was very sad about that 
but her friends the animals um made a dress for her so  so she could go to the ball 
um unfortunately her stepsisters were very jealous of her 
and they thought that she would be too pretty and outshine them at the ball 
so  they ripped the dress up 
and Cinderella was sent down to the  to the cellar 
um and she cried 
and then all_of_a_sudden a fairy godmother appeared to her and asked her why she was crying 
and she told her story to the fairy godmother 
and the fairy godmother waved her wand 
and Cinderella had a beautiful dress with  with glass slippers 
and then she took a pumpkin and waved the wand over the pumpkin 
and it turned into a beautiful carriage 
and she waved her wand over the mice 
and the mice turned into horses 
so  Cinderella arrived at the  at the uh royal ball in a beautiful carriage pulled by very elegant horses in her wonderful dress 
uh she met the prince 
and they danced the night away 
but the  Cin but the uh fairy godmother had warned Cinderella that she could only stay out until midnight because the spell would be broken at midnight 
so  Cinderella realized it was getting close to midnight and she ran away 
and the prince tried to catch her um because he was so enchanted with her 
but uh he couldn't catch up with her 
she  Cinderella stumbled on the stairs on the way down to the carriage and left one of her golden slip or  one of her glass slippers on the stairs 
uh she made it to the carriage and got home just in time 
and the carriage turned back into a pumpkin 
and the mice turned or  the horses turned back into mice 
the prince was very upset and was bound and determined to find out who the beautiful woman was at his party because he was  his heart belonged to her now 
so  he sent couriers across the land again with the  g the glass slipper to see whose foot would fit the slipper 
and then he would know who  who was the beautiful woman at the ball 
so  when the courier got to uh Cinderella's house the stepmother had the stepsisters waiting uh to try the slippers on 
but unfortunately they  the slippers didn't fit either one of them 
and Cinderella came out_of the cellar and sat down 
and the courier put the slipper on her foot and realized that he had found the enchanting woman that was at  at the royal ball and so brought her back to the castle 
and she and the prince lived happily ever after
