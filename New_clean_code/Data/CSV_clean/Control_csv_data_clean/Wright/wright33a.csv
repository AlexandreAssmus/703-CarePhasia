today was little Timmy's birthday 
he was five years old 
his mother had baked him a large chocolaty cake with beautiful drippy icing and five wonderful candles 
but as the guests were arriving the dog took the opportunity to take a large bite of the beautiful chocolaty cake 
and a
but the dog hid underneath the sofa 
tracking chocolaty footprints all the way 
the little boy was crying 
but his party guests two of them were standing there with their presents 
and the mother angrily  continued angrily to threaten  continued to angrily threaten the dog with the broom 
however  the mother counted to ten 
put the broom away 
put the dog out 
cleaned out the mess  cleaned up the mess 
cut the cake in half 
and everybody got a huge slice of the untainted side of the birthday cake 
and little Timmy had a wonderful fifth birthday with his little friend John and his little friend Greta 
the end 
sings no 
one day I was out to lunch with my friend Bill 
it was a work day 
and we were at Mimi's cafe 
and my stomach started hurting 
and I thought shrugs that it might just be stre
so  I ignored it 
but by seven o'clock that night I was throwing up constantly 
it never  the pain never let up 
and I was just throwing up throwing up throwing up 
at five o'clock in the morning I decided well I had decided before but  at five o'clock in the morning I felt comfortable calling my exhusband's father my ex father inlaw to come get the two older kids 
who were shrugs  ten and nine at the time 
and I didn't have my third one 
so  my two kids 
um and take them to his wife 
and drive me to the hospital 
which he did 
and I spent from
uh they did a_lot_of tests on me 
they found out that I have one kidney 
I was thirty one years old 
and I had no idea I only had one kidney 
but they looked for kidney stones 
and they only saw one kidney which was huge 
and they thought 
 what's going on 
they looked for the other one 
they never found it because I don't have another one 
so  I found out I didn't have another kidney 
and I also found out I didn't have kidney stones 
but a wonderful scan found out that I did have appendicitis 
and it was about to kill me 
so  Doctor Geiger came 
he was the anesthesiologist 
he introduced himself 
he asked me if he could put aroma therapy on my wrists 
I said 
 yes 
I was in a_lot_of pain 
because the pain medication they had given me um 
I couldn't have any more 
either for health reasons or for HMO reasons 
so  I was in a_lot_of pain 
I was very glad they were going to cut me open and do all sorts of pulling out of evil things 
and so Doctor Geiger put me under 
and when I woke up my throat hurt horribly 
apparently they had told me they were going to shove a ges
what are those things called 
a ventilation tube down my throat 
um and that hurt more than anything else when I woke up 
and they gave me some medication 
and sent me home 
and two weeks later I got pregnant woo ges
and now I have a third baby 
the end 
okay  one time I was at 
oh was it Sea_World 
it was Sea_World in San_Diego 
with three children 
uh one of which was in a stroller 
and I was walking 
and I stopped to look at something that the oldest of the children had said 
 look 
so  I was looking 
and then there was a man off to the right of the  of the boy who was showing me something who was looking at me angrily 
and I looked up at him and there was  he was indicating to me something 
and I looked to my right 
and there's a woman there with a stroller 
and she's fuming at me 
and she's telling her husband six feet away to tell me that I'm in her way 
and I look over at the woman 
and she looks at me like she wants to  hit me 
and she's points yelling at her husband to tell me points
um so  I looked at her husband 
and I looked at her 
and I said 
 she can talk to me 
 and the words excuse me work very well 
um and so I looked at her 
and she continued to fume at me 
didn't say a single thing to me um until after her husband had told me to move 
um then she cussed at me and called me a name 
and um so I basically let her live her miserable life 
and um that's all I really did about it 
when my oldest child was about eighteen months old she had a hundred and six degree temperature 
so  I took her to the emergency room 
and um she wouldn't take anything orally 
she jus
um and they indicated to me that the fact that she was fighting so hard even_though her temperature was a hundred and six was a good sign 
so  they gave her um um 
um what's the nice way to say this 
a rectal fever reducer 
and she eventually got better 
we got her on antibiotics 
um but I was extremely afraid because it was my first child 
and even if it had been my third I would have been extremely afraid because a hundred and six degrees is a pretty hefty temperature 
so  I took her to the hospital 
and she eventually got better 
okay  once upon a ti
it was raining very hard 
but she hadta get home 
and so she crossed the bridge 
but the bridge wasn't very sturdy for the water rushing underneath it was ges decaying the under girders 
made that up 
and so the bridge gave way 
and the girl fell off of the bridge 
for she was really riding a bike 
and it was a rumbly bridge 
and she fell into the water 
she found a branch to hold onto and screamed for help 
eventually someone heard her cries for help 
and put on all the rescue  necessary rescue gear 
and climbed down to her with his big muscles and saved her 
and she was very grateful 
and she asked the man if there was anything she could do for him 
and he said 
 don't ride a bike on a wobbly bridge in the pouring rain 
 and be safe 
the end 
one day a bo
and he decided to go outside and play with the soccer ball 
and he kicked it into the air 
and it crashed through a neighbor's window 
and the neighbor was surprised as the soccer ball came crashing through his window 
and he picked up the ball and looked out the window 
but the boy ran away 
and the man walked outside looking for the boy 
and when the boy came back later hoping to find his soccer ball 
the man scolded him 
and made him promise to mow his lawn for the next two years free of charge 
and then the man replaced the window at a hefty price and felt like he was even 
the end 
one day as a boy was heading to school his mother told him that it was sposta rain 
and told him to take an umbrella 
the boy said 
 no I'll be fine mom 
and the mother was hesitant 
but thought that the boy might actually learn that mother knows best if she let him have the experience of walking without an umbrella 
then the boy was walking to school 
and it started to rain 
and the boy was disappointed that maybe he didn't have control over everything like he thought he did 
and so he
and wetly came in the door saying nothing 
but showing his mother that she was indeed right 
the mother was annoyed but knew that giving the boy the umbrella was really the best thing for his health and well being 
so  she gave it to him 
and he walked in the rain with the umbrella and his mother's love 
the end 
once upon a time there was a girl named Cinderella 
I would guess 
there was a little girl 
and her father was widowed 
and so he remarried 
and the new stepmother had two daughters the w girl's age 
and the stepmother was not very nice 
and as the dad got out_of the picture by an unfortunate series of events um the stepmother made the daughter into her personal slave 
and turned her into basically a scullery maid 
and made her clean out the fireplace 
which is why she is actually called Cinderella so I don't know what her name was before 
and the  one da
and said that there was a ball so the prince could find a wife 
and Cinderella was excited and raced upstairs to make a dress out of her mother's old dress 
and the 
let's just call her the wicked stepmother 
the wicked stepmother um was not interested in letting Cinderella go 
so  when Cinderella came downstairs she
and did I mention that mice and birds made her dress 
actually  not Cinderella 
she didn't do that at all 
and um they had taken things from the sisters 
so  the sisters ripped their belongings off of Cinderella's dress 
Cinderella was very sad 
but the two daughters and the wicked stepmother went to the castle 
and a
her rather plump fairy godmother came 
and gave her a beautiful blue ball gown 
turned the mice into coachmen and  horses 
and turned a pumpkin into a coach 
and Cinderella went to the castle 
the prince fell madly and instantly in love with her 
what are the chances 
and um as the fairy godmother had indicated to her at midnight the magic would wear off 
and so when the crock 
leaving one of her beautiful glass slipper
uh however
so
even_though the prince had spent couple hours with her 
and went looking for her using the glass slipper 
and when the people came to the door of Cinderella's abode 
um the stepmother locked her in  had locked her in because s they didn't want her to find  she didn't want him to find  she didn't want them to find her 
and so they
she raced downstairs 
the shoe fit perfectly
they found Cinderella
and Cinderella went to the palace 
married the prince 
rode off in a coach 
and they lived happily ever after 
the end 
one day a girl was out playing 
and she had her do
and no she had a cat 
and she and the cat were playing 
and the  do a dog came by and chased the cat up the tree 
the little girl couldn't reach the cat 
so  she called her dad 
her dad came with a ladder 
and climbed up the tree 
but the ladder fell 
the dog continued to bark 
the dad was stuck 
the cat contentedly sat at the end of the branch 
and the little girl still couldn't reach the cat 
so   she called the fireman to come save the dad and the cat 
and they brought their ladder 
and saved them all 
and sent the doggie home 
and had a talk with the doggie's owner about a leash law 
the end 
um well  I guess I can back up and say that the girl rode her bike to the place where she played with her cat 
but that was a long time ago 
and there was a bird singing happily in all the cacophony 
the end
