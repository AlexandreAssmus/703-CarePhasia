when I was in sixth grade and I was eleven years old I was rollerskating in my parent's  um in our garage 
and um I was going around the garage really fast laughs in these little rickety skates 
and I fell 
and I was  um I put my arm  my hand back so_that I wouldn't hurt my head 
and I broke my wrist 
and I had a cast on for  on my right wrist 
and I had a cast on for six weeks 
and that was it 
um yes 
um well I have a way of making people feel comfortable I feel 
and there are some people that just really bottle up their emotions 
and then don't wanna you_know express how they really feel 
or they'll give quick short answers 
um you_know that they're really emotionally distraught 
but they don't wanna cry because for some reason they've been  you_know that's just the way they were brought up or something where they can't you_know bring out their emotions and cry 
or they go the opposite and they just you_know really cry laughs 
um so  I just have  you_know  I can be sympathetic with somebody and kinda 
and it brings out  you_know it  o pe it makes people open up 
um yes 
okay 
I was  it was nineteen eighty one laughs and I went to Mazatlan 
and I went parasailing 
and um I don't know if you know about what parasailing is but you're up you_know being pulled by a boat 
and I was not strapped in completely 
and so I'm just sort_of hanging on with some weak stomach muscles and yelling to a boat that's you_know how many xl amount of feet below me that they can't hear me  you_know 
they're just having a good time 
and I'm hanging on for dear life 
you_know  just with really weak stomach muscles and arms 
and so somehow 
yes  that was frightening 
I saw my life flash in front of my eyes  laughs 
so  okay 
I lived laughs 
okay 
there is um a girl 
I'm not sure exactly her age 
maybe fourteen 
and she is um  drowning in a uh fast moving river 
and there is a fireman that is trying to 
well  I'm not sure if it is  who it is 
but he's got a vest on 
and he is hanging on by a tree 
and he's trying to save her 
and he's got a belt that he's trying to give her 
a safety belt 
and he's in dis  they're both in distress 
and I'm not sure what is gonna hap happen with this  um  this uh rescue 
okay 
there is um a boy that's playing outside kicking a uh soccer ball 
he goes to kick the ball really hard and it smashes through a window of 
I'm not sure if it's his father's house because there is a man sitting in a chair with a lamp 
but the ball comes crashing through the window and knocks down the lamp 
and puts a big hole through the uh glass window 
the father stands up 
is holding the ball and looking out the window 
okay 
a mother and a son are in the house 
and the mother is trying to reason with the son and give him an umbrella because she knows it's probably going to rain 
so  he's holding up his hand like 
 no thanks 
 I don't need the umbrella 
he starts walking outside 
he's feeling the raindrops on his head 
and so he starts running through puddles and running home 
he's dripping wet 
and his mom is like looking at him like

and the next  the end is he's walking happily through the rain with the umbrella
