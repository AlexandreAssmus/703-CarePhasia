inhales but he didn't take the ladder 
he just climbed up the tree because he saw a heavy branch points

 I can't come up there 
inhales another bird is taking this all in

inhales but lo_and_behold we ha see two firemen points
inhales running toward the man because they're gonna get the points
and certainly the cat off the branch 
inhales so  they're parked 
and they're going in the back 
inhales but the thing is 
the man points

inhales not the  what he tried to do by himself 
inhales and the girl will get her cat back head
because the firemen are gonna get  the cat down head
and gonna get the man down head
inhales and the little bird 
lips_smack he'll just stay there 
because he's not gonna be bothered 
birds are that way 
they  they stick to a place if they like it 
inhales and the little dog will stop barking and go home with the girl points

so  I p whoosh whoosh that around my uh  butter spoon ges
and I spread it very easily  on both pieces ges
and then I have some jelly on the side

I'll say raspberry 
inhales and then I just put it ges
inhales and then I ges
and I cut ges

and we were ri driving along very nicely head
lips_smack and he passes the medium

I  he hit me first points
inhales and then there was another driver points behind me and in front of me points
sniffs and the one behind ges me also got hit 
inhales and uh exhales then I remember they took me away 
inhales just out_of the car somehow 
because his car was smashed 
they hadta open ges
inhales and they took my daughter 
and said

and then they looked at me and they said 
 hm we hafta bring her to a further 
because my foot was torn 
inhales and my daughter even saw a piece of it in the car she remembers ges 
but she was just shooken 
but she had uh on her face points
and they took her to the hospital points
so  I thought she was going with me 
but I must have passed out ges
because the next thing ges
and they said 
 how did you like the plane ride 
I says 
 I was in a plane 
I didn't know anything about it head
but that's what they did head
they put me in a plane ges

 inhales lips_smack but we hadta take you because this was an emergency 
sniffs  and they happen to tell my daughter head
that it was that serious 
but this is what points
sniffs and I says 
 well   okay  uh what happens now 
they says

and then they ges put something around my neck ges
inhales and then my leg was
and they patched it up somehow 
and they hadta  hadta give me an operation head
there points I stayed for awhile  inhales until they uh ges did the operation 
and uh exhales  then finally head
I got a phone head
at that time you could ges
it's not like ges the cellphones they have today 
inhales but uh I   I got the phone head
and I called her 
inhales and asked how she was 
she says she's  she's alright head
she's home head
inhales so  that's where I had called points her head
and I was hoping she was home 
but that's where she was head
inhales and they just  head
and then they released her 
so  some of my friends came to visit her head
and one of them had a car and said 
 you_know we'll take you head
inhales clears_throat I was a mess ges to look at first of all 
but uh  she did come  with the  with the friend 
and lips_smack found out how serious it was and so for 
but ges I would make it head
but it would take time head
inhales so  that's
but I'm slowly trying  ges see I forget the date 
 because I know it's you_know head
I wanna say in the nineties shrugs or something like that 
I  I'm taking a guess head
but uh you could never forget that 
and I could never bend ges
the right foot is always gonna be stiff 
that's why I gotta wear special shoes looks
and uh  the left foot is alright points
but uh the scar on my right foot points
they took something off my stomach points
and you_know grafted  it ges
and uh exhales tried to put it  inhales they saved the foot  okay 
inhales the  he  the doctor told me later on if it was six weeks sooner they would've hadta amputate it head
but because they have discovered ges something head
inhales but I wouldn't be able to use that foot head
but you'd ha
so  that's what they used head
and uh to this day I can't head
I hafta wear special shoes 
inhales you_know I go to a special sh uh shoe place 
and I try to get shoes that match ges you_know head
 but uh they're little bigger head
you_know  the right foot points
sniffs and uh shrugs I've been able to hits_walker live with a walker head
and that's the way shrugs I'll be living 
and uh that's something I could never forget 
 but I'm thankful that my daughter exhales  came through head
but she remembers the accident points 
I remember nothing ges
lips_smack and she told me about it 
what she found points and wh you_know all this stuff 
and uh  so I could never forget that really totally 
but uh you_know I'm thankful 
I'm thankful to be alive 
I never thought I would make it head
when I saw  when they told me what was wrong with me I said 
 uh  shrugs what am I living for head
you_know  sniffs  I mean 
 how are they gonna keep me alive 
but uh that's  head
then they had pins ges
inhales and I couldn't walk up the steps ges
so  I hadta stay in the  bottom floor ges
inhales that's where I stayed 
and my daughter fixed up the room and inhales uh brought things for me to eat 
but I couldn't head
and uh  there was a bathroom there points  fortunately 
inhales but uh at that time I  I was using  oh I points
I had a cane 
lips_smack so  I hadta use a cane very carefully when I did walk ges
but it was very painful head
but I couldn't walk up steps ges
inhales and I hadta just take it ges remove bandages and things like that head
inhales but uh came through it alright 
and here I am 
 thank_you 
 yes head
inhales now 
oh alright when my father came after me 
when I was a young girl 
 he was fixing a  a lamp ges
and he says 
 whatever finger
and I says 
 what could happen shrugs if I pull the switch down 
 looks
and I pull ges
well  he came down ges
and th I ran under  ges we had beds 
it was a small rooms ges head
and I went under ges
I knew he couldn't head
so  I stayed there 
he says 
 I'll wait for you finger
 I'll get you head
and he took off his strap touches
you_know  and ges
ges one of these things 
you_know  you hear it 
inhales you_know what's head
I  I says 
 I didn't mean to do it 
you_know  and then finally  he   ges he ges was a smoker 
so  he went outside ges
and he took a cigarette 
while he went outside  I came out ges from under the bed 
ca ran ges outside somewhere head
I was walking up and down the street ges 
inhales and then I saw him head
and he forgot head
 don't you ever finger
but he never head
just scolded head
so  I was frightened that I'd get hit  head
and the way he yelled 
he usually didn't yell ges
when he yelled at me 
sniffs and then hearing that imit
that was enough  to scare head
and it sure scared head
inhales to this day I don't like to hear ges
because I think 
 who's gonna get hit looks laughs 
so  that was one   head
 yes head
inhales I had a problem with a  a person that couldn't speak English 
so  at that time I could speak Ukranian head
but uh this lady was from that Scandanavian country 
and uh uh she was  she wanted something head
and I didn't know head
and she was no good with her hands ges because that was going all over the place laughs 
but uh she tried to talk 
inhales and uh she garbled so much ges with her voice 
she didn't head
inhales so  I'm trying to help her to get her what she wants 
and she was in ges
she had visited my mother 
and my mother could understand her ges 
but I couldn't head
I was still very young head
inhales lips_smack and uh finally  I asked her in Ukranian 
do you want water head
 and she looked at me as if she didn't ges know what water is  head
but she was thirsty head
so  I waited for her response 
and I looked at her face 
and I went to the sink ges
and I put it you_know in ges
and I brought it to her ges
I says 
 worst she can do is throw it at me 
inhales laughs  so I give her the glass of water and she drank it ges
and she thanked me head
that ges I could understand 
 but there I had a difficult head
inhales but trying to help ges somebody 
and even if I knew the language ges it didn't head
inhales you_know except that I put it together ges very simply ges 
 and she head
she was alright head
 it looks like a   a tree 
 is that water all around 
 no clue 
but he's got a_lot_of gear on points
 okay  shrugs I'll start 
they were on a boat 
I'm taking this as water head
 although I didn't know how leva ges 
alright they were on  in a boat 
and it capsized 
they were near to the ges
they were near to land 
where there was branches ges
and this man was all ges prepared for any emer 
he has muscles ges
inhales so  he's strong 
sniffs and he's holding on to this limb that's over ges
but they're still ges in the water 
the water is ges still circling around them 
inhales and there's a woman next to him 
inhales girlfriend wife shrugs could be anyone 
and inhales he is holding on 
you can see his muscles ges are uh  points
inhales and points
but  the lady  doesn't look like she has any points
and there's some kind of  points
as if he's going to give her that to put on 
to help her to get out_of the water 
 and then she's trying to see where she can hold on to him 
and he says 
 head
and that's how they're uh securing themselves 
sniffs and then he pulls her slowly points
and because he was so strong and points
inhales he was able to get out and pull her out 
so  the beginning is uh watch the waters 
and if you see it bad head
inhales and be sure that you're dressed points
and if you capsize don't panic 
 do you know what that is points_picture that picture 
is it water 
is it a man that's 
 yeah head
because of the equipment points_picture there 
but how would it be in the middle of the ocean there or lake 
 y that's why I ges
okay 
sighs  okay clears_throat 
 alright here's a boy 
he's playing out in a points
and he's kicking it looks like a  points
you_know  one ges
he's kicking it 
uhoh but what happens is sniffs he goes through a window 
inhales the soccer points
and breaks it 
and the man inside could head
and he gets scared head
and the  the window breaking 
sniffs and uh he gets up very carefully because there's points
and he picks up the soccer ball 
and he looks outside the g points
inhales and he sees his son  sniffs had kicked it in there sniffs 
now he hasta determine what is he going to do 
first of all he knows he knows he's gonna see if the boy is alright 
and the boy head
inhales uh and he's gotta find points
inhales and then he's gonna tell the boy not to kick the ball near points
to be kicking it points
he's teaching him a lesson 
but he didn't get excited because accidents like that can happen 
inhales so  he just teaches the boy 
 next time don't do it 
 and I'm glad points
 inhales the glass ges ca 
 inhales and uh we'll clean ges up here 
 and get that all straightened out 
lips_smack so the thing is  lips_smack  there's  there was a   a telephone  um you_know I worked for ges the New_York_Telephone_Company 
 and there was one thing inhales that I still remember to this day 
it was their motto 
there is no job  that is so important  that it cannot be performed safely  at a
and this is what this man points
because he remembered he useta work for the telephone company 
and he says 
 now I'm gonna 
 always think safety 
 and then go ahead points and play 
 laughs that's a mother and son 
clears_throat and apparently it's raining outside 
so  the mother says

lips_smack and the boy says 
 oh  Mom  hand
 you  you  you  you keep hand
 it's not gonna rain 
 but it looks points
inhales but he goes out points
he no ges sooner goes out than big drops ges
and he's getting all excited now 
he's covered with rain 
inhales and he's in the puddles inhales 
he comes back to his mother dripping ges wet inhales 
and his mother looks at him very sternly 
 now have you learned your lesson 
 you listen head
sniffs and he says 
 alright  let me have the umbrella 
inhales so  he takes the umbrella 
and he's going back to where he was going from 
I guess he was going to school 
inhales but now he knows  he should listen to his mother 
that's the lesson that he head
and he says 
 rain or shine I'm gonna head
clears_throat  well  once upon a time there was  this woman that had two of her daughters 
and a third one  that was like a maid 
she did all the work for them 
but the other two were spoiled brats 
because they didn't have anything to do with her
