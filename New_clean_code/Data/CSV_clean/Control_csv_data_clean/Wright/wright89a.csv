 okay 
so  to make a peanut butter and s uh jelly sandwich you would get the loaf of bread out a peanut butter jar and uh your choice of  jam or jelly  and a knife ges 
and then you would get two pieces of hand
and then you would pour  you would spread the ges
and then you can put the points jam on either um piece of the  bread that has the peanut butter on it 
and then you put the two slices hand
and the reason why you put peanut butter hand
and um it will ges stay nice and firm 
okay 
well  sighs this a story of um lips_smack a cat that climbed the tree 
and apparently didn't wanna get down  or couldn't get down 
and so the little girl asked the dad to climb up the tree to get the cat 
and  um and I   when he got up the tree
because the dog is  cl is barking 
and he is  like he's wanting to climb the tree 
so  they're stuck 
you've got the father in the tree 
lips_smack he's stuck in the tree now because there's no ladder for him to get down 
and the cat seems to be content up in the tree 
does not wanna get down 
and so somehow I don't know who called shrugs but s uh the fire department is here 
and they're here to rescue the dad and the ca 
we'll I've  th I've had very good health 
and I have not um had any major
which put me about fifty three 
so  I've been really healthy 
bu
I ha
it was the sl one 
and um lips_smack the pain was so severe that I was on around the clock um lips_smack medication 
Oxycontin 
um lips_smack uh m um lips_smack Morphine_sulfate did not relieve my pain at all 
um I either hadta get Dilaudid 
um or get a shot 
or  um lips_smack or be on my Oxycontin 
because um I could not walk 
it was the most severe pain I've ever had in my whole life 
an
lips_smack and I had two options 
I h could either um lips_smack ges try some kind of um therappeutic 
and I opted for surgery 
and so a week later I went in to have a discectomy on  i on my sl one 
it's between my ll five and my sl one 
and uh it's been about two and a half years now 
and the pain has gone away 
but I still have um side effects that probably will stay with me 
however  I would rather have those side effects than the severe pain and not be able to function 
so  there 
okay 
on
and so my daughter took him in 
and we found out through uh several tests m_r_is  c_t scans that  um that he had a tumor 
and this w tumor had wrapped around the kidney and had pushed out the liver 
and that's how we found out that he had  uh uh he had a tumor 
lips_smack so  we went to
and it was diagnosed that he had a rare form of kidney cancer which is called clear cell sarcoma 
which only one in about twenty children a year uh get 
and um it was  um it was diagnosed as stage three cancer 
which means that it had  um an well lips_smack it had metastasized to
however  it was in  c contained to the lymph nodes hopefully 
um and so that was a scary situation in my family 
um you_know  not knowing exactly what the outcome was 
and having to  with my daughter uh uh you_know i it was  i it was a very hard i um situation  to know that your daughter is in this with her little boy 
and you can't say 
 yes 
 everything will be uh  fine 
a hundred percent sure 
and so uh i it was scary becau
and number two it was such a  s a little  little child that you didn't know what the results or the aftereffects of finger
and so that was a  scary time in our family 
okay 
um I am a  a school nurse 
and I have a program in my school 
and it's called SMD which is severely mentally uh disabled children 
and these uh children have uh traumanic 
or they're severely disabled where they're  uh they barely can function 
they're usually in  they are in wheelchairs 
um all their ADLs are done for them 
they are  they don't communicate at all  ges verbally 
and so basically the only way that you can f communicate with them a_lot is
um by the way maybe points
or if they're
um the way that you touch them 
um lips_smack uh maybe just communicating 
um some of them  um well lips_smack I have several classes 
there's another class that's MOMD which is a_little  more ges
and so in that class we communicate by sign language 
like this ges
or you_know something like ges
so  sometimes we do sign language with those kids 
and we com communicate with them that way 
okay 
the beginning of the story it looks like there is this little gir
and somehow  I don't know how she got into a raging  river 
but it looks really cold 
um lips_smack  uh and  the uh fireman or paramedic is coming to rescue her 
and he has all his equipment on 
and basically he hasta go out into this raging river
um and he's grabbing on to some kind of head
and then he's got some kind of a belt or something to
but he's also out there um in  in danger in his life too 
lips_smack okay 
there's this little boy probably ten twelve years ol
and he's out playing soccer just having a really fun time 
and um the ball goes through  shrugs possibly maybe the neighbor's uh window 
or maybe it's his own front window 
and um lips_smack the ball lan er knocks over a lamp 
so  actually it breaks the finger
and the man was sitting in a chair 
and then he picks up the ball 
and he looks out the window 
and that's all in those pictures 
so  I don't know what the end of the story is 
I don't know what the little boy does  d 
okay 
points I love this one because this is typical typical of kids and mothers okay 
so  the little boy is getting ready to go to school 
he has a backpack o
and his mom says 
 I think it's gonna rain today 
 will you take the umbrethar 
lips_smack and the little boy goes 
 no 
 I'm not gonna take it 
 it's not gonna rain 
 trust me 
 okay 
kids think they're smarter than the parents 
but they're not 
and the mom says 
 you need the umbrella 
but head
so  what happens 
he goes outside 
and it starts to rain 
hahaha 
laughs and so the little boy ges
laughs and he's  um he's soaking wet 
and he comes back in 
and his mother is a_little upset with him 
because in her mind point
 point
 points
and ges he's sopping wet 
and so he takes the umbrella 
and he goes to school 
and I hope he learned a lesson to always listen to your mom 
once upon a time lips_smack there was a little girl named Cinderella 
and she lived with her dad 
her mom had died years ago 
so  it was just her  herself and her dad 
and then one day her dad remarried 
and brought the new mom with two
lips_smack a
well   lips_smack Cinderella and her dad really loved each other 
and  they were a family again with a new mom and  and two stepsisters 
but then Cinderella's dad died 
and the stepmom lips_smack was not a very nice mom 
and the stepsisters were not very nice to Cinderella 
and so they made Cinderella do all the chores 
they made her do the dishes 
and scrub the floor 
and make the beds 
and make the food 
and they would not let Cinderella be part of the family 
and they made Cinderella lips_smack sleep upstairs in the addict 
and so all her  fr all  the friends she had were all the little mice and all of the little house creatures that lived there 
and she would look out her window 
and she could see far beyond the city  the castle 
and she would sit and watch and wonder 
oh what a beautiful place that she maybe some day would wanna go and see 
lips_smack well meanwhile there was the prince 
and the prince wasn't married yet 
and the prince's father wanted him to get married 
because he was going to someday inherit the kingdom 
lips_smack and so they decided to make a  uh do a ball 
which is a ges
and they were gonna make this beautiful dance 
and invite all the single girls in the town  come to the ball 
and so the prince could pick one of the sisters or  one of the
and so they sent out invitations 
and every home got an invitation for this big dance 
and everybody was invited 
and so the stepmother and the two stepsisters they were so excited to go to this dance 
and they were gonna dress up in their most beautiful dresses and go 
and so Cinderella said 
 well  can I go 
 I'm part of the family too 
and the stepmother said 
 Cinderella nobody wants you 
 you're shabby 
 and  you don't have any clothes to wear 
 and the stepmother said 
 if you do all your chores you can go 
lips_smack and oh Cinderella was so excited that she was able to go to the ball 
and so she went up and told all her little mouse friends and all of the house creatures that she could go to the ball 
and so they made her a dress 
and it  oh it looked so pretty 
so  the night of the ball lips_smack  Cinderella's stepmother and stepsisters got dressed to go to the ball 
and they were dressed in their finest dresses with their beautiful jewelry and their hair done 
and here comes Cinderella 
and she comes down the stairs 
and she goes 
 oh  wait for me 
 I can go too 
lips_smack and the stepsisters and the stepmom looked at her 
and they were appalled 
they could not believe that she  was able to find something so pretty to wear 
and they were very jealous 
and so they ripped the clothes off of her 
and they go 
 Cinderella you can't go 
 look at you 
 you look like  lips_smack uh you look like a little merchant 
 and no prince would w ever wanna look at you 
and so they said you  they were off to the ball 
and s
and she began to cry 
lips_smack and then her fairy godmother appeared to her and said 
 Cinderella you can go to the dance 
 I'm your fairy gra godmother 
 and I'm gonna grant you this wish 
lips_smack and so she
and Cinderella had the most beau
and her hair was made just like lips_smack a beautiful princess 
and Cinderella was so happy 
she goes 
 oh  this looks so beautiful 
 but how am I gonna get to the ball 
and so the fairy godmother w w  ges wished her wand 
lips_smack and  out_of a pumpkin became a coach 
and out_of some pumpkin mice was  the coach and the driver 
and then she made some horses appear 
lips_smack and then she gave Cinderella some beautiful glass slippers 
and she goes 
 Cinderella I wanchu 
 and I want you to have the most beautiful time 
 but you ges to hafta be home by midnight 
 because at midnight everything turns back 
 you'll be  lips_smack you'll have your ol
 and the pumpkin coach will be back into a pumpkin 
 and the mice  coachmen will be back to mice 
 so  at the stroke of midnight you hafta leave 
and Cinderella thanked her gramother 
 oh  thank_you so much  godmother 
 I will have the best time 
and off to the ball she went 
and when she went to the lips_smack castle and she came down the stairs ev
because she was the most beau
and everybody there whispered and said 
 who is that girl 
 I don't know her 
nobody knew her 
but she was so beautiful 
lips_smack and the prince caught eye  on her 
and fell in love with her 
and that's the only girl that he danced with  with for the rest of the night 
and she had the most beautiful time dancing 
and everybody there was kind_of jealous 
because the prince would not pay any attention to Cinderella on I mean  to lips_smack them only to Cinderella 
and then all_of_a_sudden  the clock turned twelve and Cinderella s or  was striking twelve 
and Cinderella said 
 I must go 
 I must go 
but the prince said 
 wait 
 wait 
 I don't even have your name 
and she goes 
 I needta go 
 I needta go 
and so she ran down the stairs 
and one of her slippers lips_smack fell off 
and she ran back to get it 
but it struck midnight 
and she goes 
 oh_no 
 I'm gonna turn back to my old self in my old torn dress xxx 
so  she ran off without it 
lips_smack and at the stroke of midnight she turned back to her ol
and her pumpkin coach turned back to just a pumpkin 
and all of the coachmen and the horses turned back to little mice 
but she kept one thing from the dance 
and that was that one s
lips_smack well the next day the prince said 
 I've got to find this beautiful girl 
 and I don't know who it is 
 I am gonna go through the whole village or  the whole countryside 
 and I'm gonna find out which girl lips_smack that shoe  fits 
 and whatever  and whatever shoe fits on that foot that is my  s that is my dream princess 
 and I will marry her 
and so he went all through the countryside and could not find a girl that would fit 
either it was too big or it was too small 
and it didn't fit 
and so he came to the last house 
and that was Cinderella's house 
well  Cinderella w lips_smack was up in her bedroom 
her mom had  had uh locked her in 
and they tri
and one was too big 
and one was too small 
and it didn't fit 
and Cinderella knew  she knew that  that the prince was there looking for her 
and so she ran downstairs 
and she goes 
 gasps let me try it 
 let me try it 
lips_smack well the  s  the evil stepmother  knew lips_smack that  she did not want Cinderella to try it on 
and so she stuck her foot out 
and the man holding the shoe walked and tripped and fell and broke the glass slipper 
oh no 
so  now the glass slipper was broken 
and the prince would never  never find his true love 
but Cinderella had the other shoe in her pocket 
and so she pulled the shoe out 
and she said 
 I ges
and Prince_Charming was so happy he found his true love 
and of_course the  s  the stepmother and the stepsisters were appalled 
they were so mad that they weren't um gonna be part of the prince's family 
so  Cinderella went with the prince 
and they went to the castle 
and they got married 
and they lived happily ever after 
the end
