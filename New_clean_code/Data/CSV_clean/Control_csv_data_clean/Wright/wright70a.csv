to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich the first thing you hafta do is go to the freezer and get the bread out_of the freezer 
and you keep the bread in the freezer because that way it doesn't dry out 
and if there's only two of you in the house you don't go through a loaf of bread a day so it's important to keep it fresh 
so  you keep the bread in the freezer 
so  ya go to the freezer 
grab  the loaf of bread 
lips_smack take it out 
ges
take out two slices of bread 
ges
ges
ges
uh g grab a plate out_of the uh cupboard 
and get a knife out_of the
lips_smack now go over to the cabinet and get the peanut butter 
lips_smack uh bring the peanut butter over and put it on the counter 
go to the refrigerator and grab the jar of jelly 
lips_smack put the jar of jelly on the counter 
uh
and take a knife 
uh  grab some peanut butter on the knife 
spread it on the bread 
um put the  put the uh peanut butter o
lips_smack then put the lid back on the peanut butter 
open up the jar of jelly 
lips_smack uh take the knife and take the oth
you never put the jelly on top of the peanut butter  because it just slides around and it's really difficult to work with 
so  put the  p put the jelly on the other slice of bread 
and you'll find that because the bread is frozen  it's easier to spread both the peanut butter and the jelly 
lips_smack after you've spread the peanut uh butter and the jelly  lips_smack hand
hand
hand
you can cut on the diagonal 
you can cut cross wise 
you can cut vertical 
you can cut them into as many pieces as you want 
if you have a five year ol
after you've um cut it  well you gotta put the uh peanut butter back in the cupboard 
put the jelly back in the refrigerator 
and put the knife in the dishwasher 
and now go get a glass 
pour yourself a glass of milk 
take the
sit down at the table 
and have a nice lunch 
lips_smack we have a crisis on our hands folks 
if this was the evening news it would be reported by
we have a lu cat that's up in the tree  and the cat belongs to a little girl 
and dad who's gone up in the tree to try to get the cat down climbed up on the ladder 
something happened 
the ladder fell down 
now we've got the cat and the dad up in the tree 
the dog is helping by standing at the bottom of the  of the tree  barking a_lot 
noise always helps 
somher 
and they've got a ladder 
and they're gonna come over 
and set the ladder up 
get dad out_of the tree 
and they'll probably get the cat out_of the tree too 
and then dad will be happy 
the cat will be happy 
the little girl will be especially happy 
and the dog will stop barking 
lips_smack  okay  um  lips_smack what I'm gonna describe is an acoustic neuroma and a craniotomy for acoustic neuroma 
um  lips_smack I discovered this
hand
it was a fairly long phone call 
I get a stiff neck 
lips_smack ges
I hand
so  I figured there's something wrong with the ear 
my left ear is not hearing the way it should 
anyway went to uh the ENT specialist 
and he diagnosed it as an acoustic neuroma lips_smack which is a little tumor that grows on the nerves that run through your skull 
uh we did some research 
uh found a surgeon who specialized in that type of surgery 
uh went out had the surgery performed 
for the surgery itself  lips_smack uh first thing they do is shave ges
um I had  I got a haircut before I went out so it would be  short so it wouldn't look like I had points
uh I remember the prep 
I remember the shaving
lips_smack uh then you're under 
you're totally out_of it 
 uh I didn't wake up and have consciousness until
uh they keep you out because they don't want you moving around 
uh the surgery involves point
uh  get the tumor taken off of it 
afterwards it was a recovery
uh it took um lips_smack oh
lips_smack I had a nice points
um  and they put uh Steritape on it  uh to kind_of hide it 
keep it sterile 
the nice part about heading back was
and I'd sit in the chair 
uh and I'd  I'd sit so_that that side of my f  h h head was ges
and my wife would go over to the ticket counter and she'd say 
 my husband's had some brain surgery and he's not feeling very w good 
 and is there any possibility that we could move up to first class 
and everybody would take a look at me ges
point
we got moved up to first class on every flight 
kind_of neat 
but my wife is clever and she does things like that 
lips_smack  sighs probably but I don't 
tongue_click nothing comes to mind 
I don't remember any specific incident 
oh yeah okay 
uh I was listening to
I ate Wheaties for years 
uh  Jack Armstrong was some place 
I have no idea where he was 
I don't remember that  episode that well 
lips_smack but the neat thing about radio was  that it allowed you to use your imagination 
television takes away your imagination because you have both th the video and the audio 
but back in the heydays of radio only you had was the audio 
and you could create ges
and Jack Armstrong was someplace 
 mighta been like in uh South_America or Central_America 
and he was in a cave or a tunnel 
and it was very frightening 
and it just scared the beejeebers 
and that's the last episode that I ever listened to 
how old was I 
 I don't know 
six seven someplace along in there maybe 
 that's  1 that's the one incident I can think of that was a frightening 2  incident 
I was scared 
 lips_smack sighs  frequently 
 no  I just  I just know that people in general seem to  ha  suh a_lot_of people have trouble communicating   what they really mean 
uh ah  
 a_lot_of times it's clear that they know what they're talking about but they can't find the right word to
lips_smack try to ask questions to get it clarified 
um sometimes people get a_little short tempered because they want  ye yuh 
if I say to you you_know uh 
 well  points it's right there 
  well where is there 
 well  right there 
 ya  uh okay
 how far away 
uh ya you hafta try to draw people out through  to ask them some questions so_that they can identify  wh  what it is they're talking about 
mkay 
Arizona has this thing they call  sighs what is the uh 
the dumb driver law 
anyway the law basically says if you drive into a gully or a wash  after it's rained and your car becomes stranded you gotta pay  to have somebody come and pull you out 
that's what this picture's about 
we have a situation here where  lips_smack a girl has
there's a_lot_of water 
it's a flood situation 
there's a_lot_of water moving 
it's moving rapidly 
she's been washed downstream 
uh she's gotten uh to a branch that's sticking up out_of the water 
she's managed to uh hang on there for a minute 
and one of the guys uh paramedics or firemen  threw on lifejacket 
and he's jumped in 
and he's gotten to where she is 
he's gonna get a hold of her 
and they're gonna get her out okay 
and hopefully she wasn't a dumb driver 
probably since it's a young girl  it was probably an accident that she fell in 
and we're lucky that she got to the point where she could  grab a hold of something 
and somebody would know where she is and get the paramedics called 
and they could get there and rescue her 
so  yeah I predict they're gonna rescue her 
and  they're both gonna be on the evening news 
and he's gonna get an award 
lips_smack  uh here's a nice young boy who's out playing soccer 
he's practicing uh because he wants to get ready for the soccer game coughs 
um and he uh kicks the ball uh in the wrong direction as sometimes happens 
and  smacks through the window and gets into the living room where
uh the soccer ball comes crashing through the window 
scares this guy 
just startles the heck out_of him 
knocks over his lamp 
breaks the lamp when it hits the floor 
the guy picks up the soccer ball goes over looks out the window and says 
 Kid you ain't getting this back 
 I'm teaching you a lesson 
 you'll never do this again to somebody else 
 what a guy 
must be the Grinch Who Scole 
lips_smack uh little Tommy's getting ready to head off for school 
and mom says 
 it might rain today Tommy 
 you better take an umbrella 
Tommy says 
 hand
 don't give me an umbrella 
 I don't want one 
and 
 hand
 I'm leaving 
 goodby
 I don't need an umbrella 
Tommy gets part way to school and guess what happens 
of_course  it starts sprinkling 
now any normal kid would just go ahead and walk to school 
not Tommy 
Tommy turns around and comes running back to the house 
comes in the house 
mom's mad 
Tommy's a_little crestfallen about this  business 
see kids  smarter they just go on to school 
and then they dry out 
and it stops raining by the time it gets time to come home 
but Tommy went back 
so  now mom's angry with him 
and she's in this I told you so mood 
so  she gives him the umbrella 
and Tommy puts up the umbrella 
and walks off to school  happy as a clam
