it is a lovely day 
the family is out for a picnic 
mom and dad are on the blanket 
da uh mom's pouring  a beverage probably for dad who is sitting there reading 
sonny boy is out flying a kite 
got  apparently got it up by himself 
the dog's along for  uh enjoying the run 
the daughter is down on the beach building a very nice sandcastle 
people are out on the lake enjoying a sail while someone else is enjoying fishing 
it is a day to be enjoyed and remembered 
laughs a_lot longer probably than you expected  laughs 
excitement excitement 
the kitty went up in the tree and will not come down 
dad tried to rescue the kitty because their daughter  is missing her kitten 
and she's very upset 
firemen to the rescue 
the dog is enjoying joining in also 
will the firemen  rescue both of them safely 
of_course 
firemen always do 
married life is never always nice and smooth 
people argue  and even at times walk out in a huff leaving the other spouse in this case the husband 
 what did I do wrong 
shortly later the door opens 
a very sheepish wife comes walking in 
he welcomes her with open arms 
will this last 
maybe maybe not 
as she  bum as she  banged into a tree really destroying the car 
what a happy occasion 
here come the kids for a uh birthday party 
well  one of the best things about a birthday party is the ice cream and cake 
and it looks like somebody is in a doghouse 
actually  a dog  i the dog is under the uh couch because he already  decided to taste the cake 
mom is mad to say the least 
the birthday boy is crying 
and the other guests well at this point they're being polite 
can mom salvage this 
sure  that's what moms do 
a carefree day along the highway 
except  neither the driver nor the passenger know exactly where they needta go 
so  they stop 
see a  farmer or  farmer uh  digging a hole to plant a tree 
ask him directions 
he's giving very specific ones 
and off they go 
whoops 
back again 
directions uh apparently didn't um stay put in the minds where they were sposta be 
so  let's try over again 
going on the assumption you've already bought the flowers 
we'll go out 
take a uh trowel or some ges
dig a hole approximately  couple inches in circumference bigger than the pot that you're going to take the flower out_of to put into the hole 
put in  some fertilizer 
put the  take the flower out_of the pot 
ges
gently pat  ges
ges
 uh actually my first answer would have been 
 tell my husband 
 let him do it 
 it's his department laughs 
 so is the coffee making 
go ahead laughs 
okay 
take out two slices of bread from the uh package that's sitting on the counter 
take the jelly out_of the fridge 
take the uh peanut butter out_of the cabinet 
get yourself a knife out_of the drawer 
take the knife and dig into the jelly 
slobber it very generously on one slice of bread 
take the knife 
dig it into the uh peanut butter 
slobber it generously on the other slice of bread 
and then put the two together peanut butter and jelly facing each other 
put them on a plate and indulge 
and don't forget the milk laughs 
no  that one's usually mine laughs 
so  we are going to step off with this family of mice who are packing for a day in the woods for having a picnic 
and I don't do well upsidedown laughs 
off they go 
all squeezed into the truck bouncing along having a merry old time 
at  spe at one very rocky point on the road  a  ba the little mouse falls off clutching tightly to his  to uh his mouse doll 
the rest of the family bounces along not realizing that the baby has fallen off 
and the little one sits there on the road watching his family go off 
family gets to the picnic grounds 
everybody gets out 
starts running around having a great old time 
they go swimming in the  swimming hole 
mommy mouse and daddy mouse start to set up the picnic 
others are picking flowers just running around dancing around having lots_of fun playing baseball playing music 
mommy and daddy are watching the children have fun 
meanwhile poor baby  sitting all alone way back where he fell off the truck crying 
looking  looks around 
anything to help him 
no 
and meanwhile everybody's having a good time 
they're getting ready to eat 
in_fact  one already dug into dessert eating watermelon 
the baby found something 
he's eating at the  some of the flowers 
uhoh 
where's baby 
they look under the flowers behind the rock 
baby is missing 
 okay  everybody back into the truck 
 we gotta go find baby who meanwhile is lying down just waiting but very unhappy 
everybody's looking as they drive along 
in the trees on the rocks up down 
baby's  looks like baby hears something 
uhoh there comes the truck and there's baby waiting for his family 
oh  what a joyous happy reunion 
baby tells 
 uhoh my baby  my doll is missing 
 gotta find it 
so  off baby runs 
finds his baby doll 
and they all go back and have a picnic 
and everybody is happy 
okay  looks like mommy's going out shopping for a few minutes 
and leaves their dog  Carl in charge of the baby who's sound asleep in his crib 
as Carl looks out the window watching mommy go away the baby gets up Carl moves over to the crib and baby climbs out on his back 
oh  what fun we're going to have today 
first they go into mommy and daddy's room and go bouncy bouncy bouncy does baby as Carl the dog keeps a lookout

it's a laundry chute 
I bet that's fun 
and down baby goes 
and Carl runs down the steps 
gets to the bottom and finds baby waiting at the bottom with all the dirty laundry 
baby climbs up on Carl's back 
and off they go again to some more adventures 
oh what fun it is sliding on the uh carpet in the living room 
and then look at the bowl where the fish are 
oh  that's gotta be fun 
and in goes baby into the  aquarium to swim with the fish 
okay  enough of that 
time to get out

Carl's sitting right by the crib 
and a good time was had b 
 oh  Carl you're such a good baby  such a good dog 
baby is nice and safe 
me being uh 
oh laughs 
I didn't know if I was sposta remember what you had said there 
or if I'm sposta tell you what I did last weekend 
last weekend we did  uh my husband and I did our usual Saturday lunch at Sue's 
he decided he did not wanna share a  a dish with me so we each had our own meal 
after that we ended up  since we didn't share we each ended up with leftovers to be finished the following day or days 
after lunch we decided to meander a little through one of the antique stores down in Chandler 
nothing to buy 
we have a house full of stuff that we really don't need anyhow 
but it was fun meandering with my husband 
went on home 
I grabbed a book 
he put on noise also known as television 
and we spent the rest of the day together very comfortably 
Sunday was again a lazy day 
read the paper 
had lunch 
finished reading the paper 
other than that it was a nice comfortable day for the two of us laughs 
in how many words 
laughs okay  I'm telling you the truth 
this  the last vacation uh was in the early part of  middle part of September 
uh we flew to Copenhagen 
we spent an extra day 
had a wonderful time and feel we must go back 
if we can ever figure out how and when 
uh picked up our cruise boat um on a Sunday from 
got to meet people 
um met most of our dinner companions 
very very nice very compatible 
as we were traveling with friends we decided we better set up our side trips 
our first trip was London uh where we had been before but our friends hadn't been 
uh did a wonderful trip of seeing the highlights  high points of there 
and then they dropped us off at Covent_Garden uh for a couple of hours 
we grabbed a bite and meandered 
um prices being what they are we d really didn't buy much but enjoyed ourselves 
uh the trip both for Paris and London 
the ports are two hours by bus from each of them so we enjoyed country sightseeing 
following day was Paris 
took a  f a tour of the city and a three hour boat ride on the Seine 
again it was our first trip and their first trip to Paris 
again a city that needs to be visited for a longer period of time 
uh from there we had a day at sea 
enjoyed lazing around 
um  the ship itself I would not particularly recommend but enjoyed being with the people we were with 
from there we spent a few hours in Vigo Spain 
haven't figured out yet why they stopped there 
from there Lisbon a  s again a city we had been to before 
our friends had not 
enjoyed a tour of the city 
spent some time uh meandering in the square and of_course have  finding some pastry my husband's favorite 
um  from there we went to  Cadiz then Malaga 
a very nice city very friendly people interesting architecture 
back to Genoa  and then on to Genoa where we spent a night and then flew home 
uh we'll leave the airplane trip back  in the realm of nightmares at_least from Charlotte to Phoenix on U_S_Air 
and don't ever ask me to fly U_S_Air again laughs 
and how was that for a vacation laughs 
you caught me at a good time in terms of  something worth talking about 
I'm sorry  what 
past Christmas 
like last year 
um I'm going to hafta say 
I'm trying to remember 
I don't even remember if we went up to Vegas 
you'll hafta understand Christmas is not a holiday for me 
 laughs so  so  it is not something that  other than 
 we went some 
the last holiday would be Passover 
and we go with  f to a friend's house for the Seder 
the meal beforehand 
and joined with  as we have done for the last fifteen years or so 
the friends we are with we have known for many time 
our hostess is a friend from high_school for my husband and me 
and we had our usual family ges
 laughs to the  but to the extent that especially now ten months later nine and a half months later 
uh frequently we would go to Vegas because at_least restaurants are open laughs 
but I  for some reason I don't think we went at Christmas time 
I think we went at a different time so 
 laughs so  I'm trying to be truthful laughs 
 right 
xxx 
never broke any bones 
uh are you sure you wanna get into female surgery 
laughs other than hospitalized I have two children 
laughs and that is the extent  laughs 
um that's not quite true 
I had my tonsils out when I was in the eighth grade 
where do you want me to go from there laughs 
now eighth grade is going to be quite a few years ago 
 injuries 
 illness 
a cold laughs 
I can't remember rea 
I_mean  I can go back 
okay  I'll make something dramatic 
and I'm going back 
let's see  nineteen sixty eight nineteen sixty nine 
married two young children 
not living in Phoenix at the time 
it was a bad year for our whole family 
not for  my  my side my grandparents three sons inlaw all died in nineteen sixty eight 
it was a bad year 
my aunt  who was  her husband was one of them came and lived with us for about nine month  ten months until she could get herself together 
I was sick 
I had a cold 
I couldn't lift my head up 
I mommy I've got two small children 
but my aunt was there 
and she took over 
she'd bake meals 
she took care of the kids 
of_course they adored her 
everybody should have an aunt like my kids had an aunt 
and I  it was my aunt too 
and I could be miserable 
and sleep 
and wallow in my misery 
unfortunately I got better in a day or two 
but I did enjoy being sick that day laughs 
that's the best I  the sickest I could be  laughs 
it was  laughs 
 right 
I went back a few years 
the greatest example or the most recent example I can think of is a cousin of my husband's who had Parkinson's 
he lived with it for some twenty plus years 
one of the problems with Parkinson's is as it progresses you lose the use of your vocal cords and your voice gets softer and softer and softer 
I have a hearing problem 
I understood how frustrated he was 
he was in a wheelchair by that time 
and basically I tried to get him to raise his voice a little 
and blame me ges
and since my husband has Parkinson's I am using all those lessons laughs 
the closest I can think of is being scared in retrospect 
I probably  was  maybe five  at the most 
and my parents my aunt and uncle 
the same aunt laughs from a previous story 
and I can't remember if my grandparents were there or not 
we were at a lake not too far from the house 
walking distance if one walked 
we didn't 
we drove 
um  anyhow I was in the lake 
apparently nobody was paying too much  overly amount of attention to me 
and I stepped ges
and the next thing I know my uncle has grabbed me and pulled me out_of the water 
 huh  that was nice 
 I like playing games in the water with him 
however I realized afterwards I had disappeared from their sight and they were scared 
so  of_course  if they were scared I guess I was scared too laughs 
can I keep looking at it 
oh okay 
a whirlpool or eddy s  turns and twirls and sucks whatever is in its path into its vortex 
a woman  for some reason  fell 
what she was doing in the lake or the  ri in the river  does not show 
however  she is being sucked into this whirlpool 
and the rescue squad  has gone in to rescue her 
as you can see  he does have his life vest on 
and is holding on to a branch that hopefully will hold both of them 
since he is well trained in his profession  he will grab her and get her out_of  her  uh get her out_of the uh  river  safe but more than a little wet 
ah  the care 
oh 
ah  the carefree days of youth 
kicking a ball around 
playing no school to worry about 
whoops 
right through the window 
looks like s the lamp is broken the window is broken 
and  the man has my ball 
what is going to happen now 
 okay  young man 
 time to get going to school 
 looks like it's going to rain 
 take the umbrella 
 oh mom it's nice 
 I don't need an umbrella 
oh dear 
oh dear 
it's raining 
it's raining ba heavily 
 mom  mom  I need my umbrella 
 okay  I told you you needed to take the umbrella 
 here you are 
 now get to school before you're late 
once upon a time long long ago in the land of makebelieve there was a man that lost his wife but had a young daughter 
a sweet young wo gal  sweet young girl by the name of Cinderella 
he decided it was time that he got  took a wife for himself and got a mother for Cinderella because she needed a woman as she was growing up 
she needed a mother 
and so he married a widow 
a lady who did not have a husband but had two young daughters 
s the woman who was Cinderella's stepmother came into the household and decided that Cinderella was just not going to cut the ice with her 
and she banished her to the kitchen to do lots_of chores lots_of jobs 
and her  tol her own two little girls who were really nasty little brats  got to sit around get lots_of new clothes and do nothing all day long while Cinderella worked and worked and cleaned and cooked 
but she had her little cat who she loved 
and the cat kept her hompany 
and this went on 
daddy was completely unaware 
he did not know what was going on 
and so he blithely went along his way enjoying his wife his two stepchildren and every once in awhile seeing his daughter who was so sweet and didn't complain to daddy 
meanwhile  in this kingdom that they lived so long ago and far away the king and queen decided that their oldest son needed to get married 
it was time 
and so they planned a great ball 
which is a big big party with lots_of dancing and music and people 
and they sent out a herald that is a messenger who tol told everyone throughout the land that all the single girls were to come 
all the single young women because they hadta be old enough to get married 
to come to this big fancy party in their prettiest dresses 
and so the k stepmother heard about this 
and was very very excited because maybe one of her girls could marry the prince 
and she plotted and planned and got the girls the most gorgeous dresses she could get 
meanwhile poor Cinderella didn't get  wasn't going to get to go 
her stepmother said 
 no 
 you hafta help me get the girls ready and dressed 
 and then you have work to do 
 you hafta keep this house clean 
 you hafta make sure that it is spick_and_span when the prince comes to claim his bride 
poor Cinderella 
after the  girls and their stepmother left for the ball she sat and sat and cried 
she wanted to go to this fancy party also 
all_of_a_sudden  a light started shining 
and a balloon came down 
and it got bigger and bigger and brighter 
and  she heard a giggle 
and she looked 
and there in front of her was this sweet little bouncy bubbly lady 
 why are you crying Cinderella 
asked this sweet bouncy bubbly lady 
 because I wanna go to the ball  to this fancy party where the prince is going to be and dance with everybody 
 well  we'll hafta see about that 
 and by the way just so you know I am your fairy godmother 
 and I am going to help you see  get to the ball 
 now let's see 
 we gotta get you a coach

 and we need you  to get you some clothes 
 well  we'll worry about that eventually 
 okay 
 now  outside we go 
 come_on come_on come_on come_on come_on 
went outside  and she took her wand said some funny little words and lo_and_behold there was this great big orange coach 
 hm

 okay  okay  okay  okay  okay 
said a few more magic words and lo_and_behold there was Cinderella in a gorgeous gown 
her hair  beautifully combed 
lovely  outfit 
sweet beautiful princess looking 
 okay now you hafta understand 
says the fairy godmother 
 my magic only works a little bit  or for a little bit of time 
 so go along 
 have a good time 
 dance with the prince 
 but remember when it start  when the clock strikes twelve everything goes back to the way it was 
 okay  I'll remember 
and off she goes 
makes her grand entrance because she's late 
the prince sees her and dances with her 
dance after dance after dance 
everybody is wondering 
 who is this beautiful young lady 
the stepsisters don't recognize her 
the stepmother doesn't recognize her 
they have never seen her so nice and pretty and clean and all dressed up 
Cinderella is having a wonderful time 
but all_of_a_sudden the clock starts to strike twelve 
oh  she remembers 
 gotta go  gotta go 
she tells the prince 
and s  scoots off 
and runs and run 
but the prince is so startled  he doesn't coughs realize what's happening 
and she gets all the way out from the palace  before the clock finished striking 
and the coach disappears 
the beautiful dress disappears 
everything 
but as she had been running she lost her shoe 
now for some reason it does not change back 
before you ask me why that doesn't happen 
I had kids who uh  asked questions 
so she keeps running 
eventually she gets home 
back to her hearth 
the pumpkin s is squashed 
the prince has only the shoe 
but he has fallen in love with Cinderella 
a proclamation goes out the next day 
he wishes to see every woman  every young woman in the  kingdom 
and whoever's foot that glass slipper fits will be his bride 
and so he goes around to all the 
and so his messenger goes all around the country  trying it on 
some's 
gets to the house with Cinderella 
older stepsister tries it on 
s can't squeeze her foot in 
her ges
the other sister says  tries 
they push and they squeeze and they push and they squeeze 
and they still can't get her foot in there 
messenger says 
 is there anybody else around 
 I have tried everybody in the kingdom 
 no 
says the stepmother 
 there's nobody else in here 
at that point Cinderella peeks around the corner and the messenger sees her 
 oh  here's a young lady 
 let us  let me try 
 we've gotta try her 
 the prince says everybody 
even_though the stepmother is saying 
 nah  she's nothing she's nothing nothing ges
so Cinderella comes in the room 
slips her foot in easily into the glass slipper 
it's not too big ges
it's not too small ges
not too wide ges
not too narrow ges
and the messenger says 
 proclaim 
 I have found the prince's princess 
the prince comes to claim Cinderella 
and they get married and live happily ever after 
and yes the stepsisters  mended their ways and really became nice little girl  nice girls instead of the mean spiteful ones they had been
