 I wonder how I would get to the ball 
so  she opened up a chest and there she saw a beautiful pink gown that all the little mice that lived with her in the house decided that they were gonna help sew uh the dress back together and make it a beautiful dress for her to wear to the palace 
soon the stepsisters found out that Cinderella was secretly trying to go meet the prince as_well 
and they came up to her when she was getting dressed for the ball and undid the entire pink dress 
 oh_no 
Cinderella thought 
 now what shall I do 
 how will I ever get to meet the prince and get away from my evil stepsisters 
then out_of nowhere a w beautiful good witch showed up 
and she granted Cinderella a wish 
the wish was that she would give her the most beautiful gown in the entire city 
that nothing would ever compare 
she would also  grant her a  a beautiful carriage and beautiful white stallion horses that would take her to the palace to meet the prince 
the only exception was that she would hafta be back by midnight or else the carriage would turn into a pumpkin 
 oh  this is so wonderful 
Cinderella said

 it is my chance to possibly be one of the princesses at the ball 
 then I shall grant you your wish 
said the good witch 
and there she was standing sparkling in the most beautiful white gown you could ever imagine 
crystals and diamonds everywhere and the beautiful horse carriage 
and off she went to the palace 
there everyone stood in line to meet the prince

and there she was

she said 
 it's almost twelve 
 I can not finish my dance with the prince 
so  she hurrily 
and as she ran down the stairs one of her glass slippers fell off 
the prince picked up the glass slipper and wondered who was that special girl in that beautiful white gown 
minutes later Cinderella turned back to her maid outfit in her rags and no riches anymore were on her 
she went back to scrubbing the floors mopping wondering about her wish to become a princess one day 
then soon there was a knock at the door 
it was the prince 
and he was wondering where  which person the slipper belonged to of all the stepsisters 
the stepsisters lined up and tried to squeeze their foot into the shoe but to their dismize 
finally Cinderella noticed that they were all trying to figure out where  which foot would fit in the glass slipper 
and then she put her foot in 
and there it was 
the prince knew that this was the wonderful girl that she had met all along  that he had met all along 
he decided to make her the princess 
and they lived happily ever after
