to make a tp peanut butter and jelly sandwich you need first to make sure that you have all of the ingredients 
inhales that would include two slices of bread 
lips_smack or one slice that you'd fold in half 
inhales peanut butter and jelly 
with butter or margarine being optional 
depending upon the individual's taste 
inhales let's assume that you have two slices of bread 
lips_smack inhales you then hafta make a decision as to whether or not you're going to
or just skip that option and move right to the peanut butter or to the jelly 
inhales some people prefer tha to put the peanut butter on the bread first inhales because they don't like the peanut butter on top as it sticks to the top of the roof of their mouth 
inhales so   trying to satisfy as many people as possible inhales we're going to take a knife 
and we'll spread the peanut butter on the bread 
one slice or two 
depending upon how much you wanna fill the bread 
inhales and then we'll put the jelly on top of the peanut butter 
put the two pieces of bread together 
and you are finished 
after putting it on a plate and finding a napkin 
jea j little Jeanie came crying to her father 
who inch was ec terribly upset 
she said 
 Minnie is up in the tree and won't come down 
 and I'm afraid that she'll never come down 
 and she can't come down 
 come please help me 
inhales so  daddy being the big  g k the big hero type went and got his ladder 
and he climbed up the tree 
a
now both Minnie the cat and dad were up the tree 
Fido the dog was barking 
inhales and they didn't know what to do 
but  the little girl remembered what she had learned at kindergarten 
 if there's a big big problem all you needta do is to push nineoneone on the telephone 
so  she ran in the house 
inhales and pushed nineoneone 
inhales and told the people that 
 inhales my daddy is up on top of the tree and he can't come down along with Minnie my  inhales Minnie my cat 
inhales and the  uh the nineoneone operator said 
 inhales don't worry little girl 
 just go out and talk to your daddy 
 inhales and to your cat 
 and someone'll be there to help right away 
well  she was just out there talking for just a minute when she heard the siren 
inhales and a l fire  big fire truck pulled up in front of her house 
inhales and those wonderful firemen who not only put out fires 
inhales but they help kids and dads and cats and everyone 
inhales came running with a different ladder 
and they put the ladder up against the tree 
inhales and Daddy was able to get the Minnie the cat 
inhales and come down the ladder
and everyone was safe 
and everyone was happy again 
lips_smack I have  been fortunate to have had excellent health 
um I have not been hospitalized since having my tonsils out when I was in fourth grade 
um I do remember that 
and uh know most people remember the great difficulty of swallowing 
what I remember was the inhales aftertaste of the ether that was used for anesthetic in those days 
and the um nightmares that were prompted because of the anesthetic 
with inhales recurring dreams about giant pythons and jungle creatures 
but lips_smack inhales other_than that uh  my life has been pretty free of uh physical difficulties 
 um exhales head
nothing prolonged 
inhales um exhales probably the first thing that I  came to mind was inhales um maybe seeing our son when he was maybe four or five years old inhales go down a f
inhales and uh hitting a cement floor on the  uh on  on  on the bottom 
that kind_of stopped our hearts momentarily 
but uh inhales both of us were  um trained in rescue procedures 
and so therefore we didn't particularly panic 
we just uh inhales dealt with him by the prescribed manna manner fr we learned from our emergency medical services training 
and it all turned out well 
but it was quite frightening at the moment 
lips_smack inhales my experience has been very very limited with that 
being that uh inhales we've not had people in our family who have been physically challenged 
and in our acquaintance  uh group most of them are been very very healthy 
inhales I do have one rather  humorous incident of uh inhales a good friend of mine who had uh a slight stroke 
and uh  lips_smack complained about it that his uh inhales his mind was going a thousand miles an hour as usual but his mouth only went about twenty five 
and he was very frustrated about that 
inhales um this story lips_smack takes place in Arizona 
uh during the monsoon season 
in which um inhales one of Arizona's drivers um did not heed the warning signs about 
 do not enter inhales uh when flooded 
and drove her car down into a low area 
inhales and found that her car was quickly filling up with water 
that the motor had conked out 
and that um the  um the car was actually being pushed off the road 
inhales she was uh eventually req forced to crawl out the window and crawl up to the top of the car 
and try to  uh to wait there until some help would be arrive 
uh she did have her cellphone with her 
was able to call nineoneone 
inhales and the sheriff's department dispatched uh both their helicopter and the inhales paramedics and rescue s squad crew 
uh the  the car eventually from the force  great force of the water inhales was tipped over onto its side 
and  and the lady in distress was washed down the uh fast flowing stream 
inhales where she caught on to uh a branch 
and eventually uh h hung and clung on to the branch until such time as a helicopter 
which was hovering overhead 
inhales was able to lower inhales one of the um lips_smack paramedic technicians inhales by rope uh down uh to be able to uh rescue her 
inhales and to retrieve her back to safety 
inhales um her life was saved 
even_though she put the paramedics into great danger 
uh the car was lost 
and she paid her ten thousand dollar fine for dispatching the f helicopter 
inhales um exhales Billy liked his new soccer ball 
which he had just gotten for his birthday 
inhales and he was practicing kicking it 
inhales when the ball slipped off the side of his foot and went right through the picture window of his neighbor's house 
inhales and landed in the lap of his neighbor 
lips_smack knocking over the lamp shade 
inhales and breaking the window 
lips_smack inhales his neighbor 
who was the soccer coach 
inhales would probably have been more angry 
but he knew about the skill and he knew that accidents happen 
inhales so
 inhales you_know I think what we needta do is to be able to fix your directional kicking 
inhales and so they went to the playground 
inhales and to the ball field 
inhales and the c coach soccer gave some direction to the ball player 
and it all turned out well 
how's that for a positive spin 
sighs a mother was reminding her son that it was uh 
 inhales the weather forecast looked like it was going to be rain today 
and she handed her son an umbrella 
lips_smack um lips_smack and he said 
 no no no 
 it won't rain today 
 and I don't wanna 
 that's really twinkie 
 and  inhales and I don't wanna have my friends laughing at me for carrying an umbrella 
so  off he went to school with his backpack on 
inhales and he got halfway there almost inhales when it started to pour rain 
and he didn't wanna go to school 
inhales and he didn't wanna face his mom 
so  he hadta choose between two bad choices 
lips_smack and he returned home 
inhales where he changed clothes 
inhales mom handed him his umbrella 
and off he went to school 
on his second trip that day 
but was late 
tell me as much of the Cinderella story as you can 
lips_smack inhales um exhales there was a  exhales lips_smack  man and a woman got married 
and uh the woman had two little girls  young girls inhales by her first marriage 
and the man had inhales a little girl by his first marriage 
and so they combined their families 
inhales and um  the two stepsisters I think  were uh not very  nice to the new stepsister 
um and they were a_little older 
and they ordered her around 
and  inhales and they were really really mean to her 
so  she took refuge in her friends being the family pets and animals more so than her inhales new stepsisters or siblings 
inhales um in the land that they lived there was a  and they  gr and the girls grew up and  to become young ladies 
and  with Cinderella virtually becoming the  uh the personal servant of her two stepsisters 
inhales uh in the land that they lived there was a  inhales a king 
who  who had a son 
who would take his place 
but the king was concerned that his son uh inhales was unmarried 
and they needed to socialize 
and decided that they would uh inhales have a ball 
in which they would invite all the young  eligible young ladies in the inhales kingdom to come and to enjoy a  inhales a marvelous ball at the royal palace 
inhales and the invitation came in the mail 
and uh the two seps stepsisters were very very excited for an opportunity to uh inhales um go to the ball and dance and maybe find the  the young prince to be of interest 
inhales but they um planned and schemed that Cinderella inhales would not be allowed to attend and  and uh  was excluded 
and uh when it came time to leave for the ball Cinderella was left behind 
but was um  visited by a   a  a fairy prince 
inhales who uh knowing the inherent goodness in Cinderella 
inhales said that she was going to make a very special evening for Cinderella 
and inhales turned her into this beautiful young lady 
and inhales provided her with a carriage made for a pumpkin 
inhales um  and told her that she wud 
which she did but that she hadta leave 
inhales and be home by midnight 
at which time  she would be re restored to her   her normal self 
inhales so  Cinderella went to the ball 
and inhales much to the chagrin of the stepsisters and the other young ladies in attendance 
inhales was immediately noticed by the prince 
who was captivated by her 
and inhales the prince and Cinderella danced and danced 
inhales until almost the stroke of twelve when Cinderella remembered inhales that she hadta back into th her pumpkin coach 
and inhales ran ah out_of the palace 
and jumped into her pumpkin coach to return to her home 
but inhales in her haste one of her  slippers that I think  was made of glass or something would  had fallen off 
and uh she returned home 
well  inhales the prince who was in hot pursuit 
inhales was not able to catch up with Cinderella and her pumpkin 
lips_smack drawn by these horses 
inhales but did find the slipper 
and um commanded his  uh  his helpers to search throughout the realm for inhales um a young lady that's foot would fit in that uh slipper 
and so the h
and eventually came to the house where Cinderella lived with her two stepsisters 
inhales and try as they may the stepsisters inhales could not  put their large uh feet into the glass s
but the  lips_smack uh the attendant tried the glass slipper on Cinderella 
inhales and Cinderella's foot fit perfectly 
inhales and so the attendant knew that Cinderella was the inhales the correct and was that mysterious visitor to the ball 
inhales and took her with him back to the  inhales back to the royal palace 
uh where she and the inhales prince were united 
and became a couple 
and were married 
and lived happily ever after shrugs 
or something like that
