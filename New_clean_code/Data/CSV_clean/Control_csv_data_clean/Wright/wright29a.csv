one afternoon the little girl's cat crawled up the tree and went out on a branch 
and she was crying profusely trying to get the cat to come down 
and her father  being the silly man that he is  decided to go up and take care of the cat 
try to ca get the cat 
so  as he goes up the tree he gets up to the branch 
and the ladder falls off of the tree 
at which time the dog begins to bark at the bottom of the tree and  which scares the cat all the more 
and the cat is not gonna come to the father 
but the father can't get out_of the tree anyway 
so  they hafta call the fire department 
who comes and rescues the man out_of the tree 
and rescues the cat 
the end 
there are several different ways to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
uh one of them is to get out the bread that's already cut 
and  uh and put peanut butter on it 
uh actually get the peanut butter and jelly mixture at the store 
and so all you hafta do is just use one 
and it comes with jelly and peanut already mixed into this  into the jar 
and you can put it right on the bread 
and make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
very lazy 
very easy 
the good way to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich is to get a piece of French bread 
cut it in six inch long pieces 
slice it longways so_that it's open 
it's nice and crunchy on top 
it's very soft on the interior 
you take your peanut butter 
crunchy and   so and regular 
you mix those together 
you put it on the peanut   you put on the peanut butter on the sandwich 
you take the jelly 
uh I wouldn't use grape jelly 
but uh you can use other kinds of jelly 
and I  I like strawberry 
sometimes I mix the strawberry and the grape together 
I put it on there 
and then I take that a sandwich 
and I put it in the microwave 
and I heat it so_that the peanut butter the jelly and the bread all soak in together 
I still have crunchy on the top 
but it's nice and soft on the inside and warm 
and then I eat that 
uh four years ago I uh uh had my knees replaced 
uh I had them both done at the same time 
it was uh scheduled for July the fifth 
uh however they uh fouled up on the scheduling so it wasn't done until the next week which is I think  July the eleventh or twelfth 
uh we  I went into the hospital uh at uh seven in the morning  six thirty or seven in the morning 
uh they prepped me 
and I went into the operating room about eight 
and uh woke up about eleven eleven fifteen uh with two new knees 
uh they told me to go ahead and use the  uh the uh morphine drip for pain 
and so that's what I did 
I used the morphine drip for pain 
and uh uh unbeknownst to me and unbeknownst to them I have a sensitivity to morphine 
and I  uh as I'm using this little button that you push every ten minutes 
I  uh I begin to see rats coming out_of of the wall 
uh I got real oozy 
uh and I passed out 
and uh the next thing I remember was the doctor standing over me saying 
 Bill Bill Bill 
 wake up wake up wake up 
and I woke up for about five or ten minutes and then went out again 
and uh they took me to the emergency room 
and I  hadta stay in the emergency room for a little while or wherever they take you 
uh laughs you_know it was not in the recovery 
they run me down the hallway 
uh uh they uh were very apprehensive about giving me morphine after that laughs sighs 
so  uh uh the next day I woke up 
and I was fine 
and uh they got me walking around 
and I was walking on the next day on both of my new knees 
I did have some pain pills but it wasn't morphine 
and uh uh my knees  uh oh
ten days after I  I had my knees replaced I could walk 
do whatever I wanted to do 
uh I drove two weeks afterwards 
and uh I've had very very little problem with my knees since then 
except they don't have a_lot_of strength 
uh in getting up out_of this low chair that I'm sitting in right now I'm gonna have a hassle 
but uh uh it's  uh uh my knee replacement wa was very successful 
I would suggest ta 
that's it 
in October of nineteen ninety four my wife had a stroke 
and uh uh she was uh rushed to the hospital 
uh and uh then oh ambulanced 
uh I went  I followed her down and  s because I needed my car down there to go home 
and uh when we got there she was unable to move her right side and unable ta 
uh all she could say was 
 Bill 
 Bill Bill Bill 
 Bill Bill 
uh I found out later that she thought she was carrying on a regular conversation with me 
and uh she thought she was saying all the words that she should have said 
but all  cu all she could say was 
 Bill 
uh after about a week of that I told her that we were gonna hafta change the word that she knew 
so  uh we sit down 
and I says 
 okay  don't say Bill anymore 
 say bye 
so  Elaine began to say 
 bye 
then she'd say 
 bye bye  bye bye  bye bye  bye bye 
and uh that's what she still kind_of says sometimes when she gets uh flustrated 
but normally that's gone now 
she doesn't use that anymore 
she still has aphasia 
she still goes to the speech therapy 
she still cannot speak 
uh this is in two thousand and nine 
so  we've lived with this for uh fifteen years now 
and uh uh we get along 
uh I kind_of know what she's gonna say 
you_know  after you've been together long enough well  you kind_of figure out what the other one's wanting to talk about 
and she's very good at using alternate communication skills 
uh spelling words 
uh uh inflections on the few words that she can say 
and uh doing things that uh allow you to figure out what she's trying to say 
uh she still has trouble  just saying the most simple words 
this morning when we got up why uh we were in the bathroom 
and she was trying to tell me I always put a rubberband around the bottom of the toothpaste 
and we had a new coo toothpaste  thing 
and it needed a rubberband at the bottom of it 
because it had  we hadn't started rolling it up yet 
and it took her  two minutes 
when I get the newspaper in the morning I take a rubberband and put it on the handle of my chair 
and so it took her two minutes to tell me to go in and get a rubberband off my chair and put it on the toothpaste 
I had a rough time figuring out what she was trying to tell me  this morning to get 
you_know  she'd started spelling chair 
 chak 
and then she'd say 
 cheese 
and then she'd  you_know everything that had chq in it was the words that she used 
she'd never use chair 
and once she did get out chair I didn't know what the heck she was talking about 
and so uh then we finally understood I  s then she picked up the  the toothpaste 
and uh bent it over 
and says 
 chair 
and then I knew that she wanted me to go get a rubberband off the chair 
and put it on the toothpaste 
so  we still have trouble 
uh but uh normally we get along pretty good 
clears_throat I did tell her not ta 
we're not a depressed family 
so  uh we don't get depressed 
uh one of the things  she was starting to get depressed saying she was gonna die 
and I says 
 listen 
 you don't know when you're gonna die 
 I don't know when I'm gonna die 
 so  as long as we're here we just  we'll take  make the best of it 
and we've pretty much done that since then 
coughs excuse me coughs 
huh 
nope that's it 
cin Cinderella's uh mother died when she was a young girl 
and her father remarried to a lady that had two other daughters 
oh
so  uh they treated Cinderella very badly 
they made her clean up the house 
they made her do the cooking 
they made her do the mopping of the floor and everything 
Cinderella uh didn't   didn't have a great life compared to the other daughters 
but she got along with it 
she was fine with it 
oh
she knew them 
and  and some of the other animals 
th some of the birds 
she was a happy girl 
some of the  the blue birds and the people like that 
they really enjoyed her 
uh and she enjoyed them 
um there was uh an edict from the  uh there was a king and a prince and a  king queen and a prince that was the head of the land 
and uh the prince was a_little gay 
he didn't uh he  he wasn't uh uh into girls all that much 
and so uh uh the king says 
 you gotta get married  Prince 
and he says 
 I
 I don't like any of these girls 
and he says  the king says 
 I'm having a ball 
 you will get married 
so  uh the prince says 
 uh
so  uh uh they send out an edict and an invite to all the young girls all over the  all over the  the land 
and uh the th those  godmother and the two stepdaughters uh they got the edict 
and they're gonna go 
and one of them is gonna be  they're sure one of them is gonna be the new  the new uh princess 
so  the uh prince comes along 
and oh uh Cinderella wants to go 
and they says 
 you can't go 
 you got uh all this work around the house you gotta do 
so  uh she gets her work done 
and she says 
 oh  I got all my work done now I wanna go 
and they say 
 you can't go 
 it's impossible for you to go 
 you're too ugly 
 you don't have any nice clothes 
 uh forget about it 
 you're not going 
so  uh the princess was or  uh Cinderella was very sad at the time 
and she was uh feeling pretty low 
she was around the house 
and uh poofo out comes her fairy godmother 
and not knowing that she even had a fairy godmother 
uh she says to the fairy godmother 
 what in the world are you doing here 
and the fairy godmother says 
 well 
she says 
 I think I can get you to the   to the uh ball tonight 
and Cinderella says 
 no 
she says 
 I'm not gonna be able to to that 
she says 
 I don't have a dress 
 I don't have any way to get there 
she says 
 it's just gonna be a big drag 
and uh the fairy godmother says 
 well  I think I can make that happen 
so  she takes her magic wand 
and she poofso 
and Cinderella is in a new dress 
and uh Cinderella looks at her 
and say 
 hey that's pretty good but my hair is a mess 
so  the godmother goes poofo 
and Cinderella has a great bouffant hairdo laughs 
and so uh ci Cinderella says 
 well  this is pretty darn good 
 I  I think I  yeah  this is gonna be pretty nice 
 however  I have no way to get there 
well  there was a few little mice sitting over in the corner 
and laughs they were watching all of this 
and uh the fairy godmother goes over to them 
and goes poofo 
and turns them into six white horses 
and there's still no carriage 
uh Cinderella still didn't wanna ride on the back of the horses in this new white dress 
so  the godmother says 
 well  I can fix that too 
so  she goes over to a pumpkin 
and she goes poofo and turns a pumpkin into a carriage 
Cinderella being the  uh uh the person that uh uh knows a good thing when she sees it jumps into the  carriage 
and the godmother says 
 now listen Cinderella 
 you're gonna have a great time tonight 
 there's no problem 
 you'll  you'll do really good 
 but you gotta be home by midnight 
and Cinderella says 
 that's kind_of an early curfew I  uh especially on a main party like this tonight 
and the godmother says 
 I know I know but this  everything changes at midnight 
 and I'll hafta start all over again 
 you're gonna turn into a  coughs a scrub lady again at midnight if you don't get out_of there 
 and then we'd hafta start all over again 
 and  and you don't wanna be sitting in the middle of this ball looking like a scrubber lady 
so  the princess says 
 oh  oh  I understand 
I  I know what's going on now 
so  she gets to the ball 
and uh the prince uh who is not taken by any girls 
he simply doesn't like girls 
uh they're all there 
and uh he's looking around 
and  whammo 
Cinderella comes in 
and she changes his whole train of thought on girls 
laughs so  uh uh she  because she's  she is  she's quite striking 
and uh so uh he says 
 well  maybe I can take this one out for a night 
and so he begins to dance with her 
and all the other girls are kind_of sitting over there by themselves 
and the king he's pretty happy with himself because he thinks he's finally found a girl that the prince may be able to like 
so  uh the king he's happy 
the queen's happy 
the prince is pretty happy too 
and Cinderella is ecstatic 
but bef before they know it it's eleven fifty nine and forty five seconds 
and they're still dancing 
and she says 
 oh  I gotta get out_of here or I'm gonna turn into a chore woman right in front of the prince 
and so uh she says 
 Prince I gotta leave and I gotta leave now 
and he says 
 do you needta go to the bathroom or you needta xxx 
 no 
she says 
 I just gotta leave 
 I gotta get out_of of here 
and so uh he says 
 well  b wait just a minute let me get your name 
and she says 
 no  it's Cinderella 
that's all you need 
that's all I can tell ya 
and she runs down the stairs 
and as she's running down the stairs she loses her  her slipper 
which happens to be glass by the way 
oh
now she's wobbling down the stairs 
and she jumps into her magic uh carriage 
and begins to ride home 
and through sheer luck she makes it out_of the eyes of the prince before the  the uh final gong of twelve 
and the  the  the pumpkin does turn back or  the carriage turns back into the pumpkin 
the mice turn back into or  the horses turn back into mice 
uh Cinderella is back into her char w or  chore woman's dress 
her bouffant hairdo is all straggly again 
and she walks home about half the way because she did get out_of the sight of the prince 
and she walks home 
and she gets home 
and says 
 well  that was a pretty good night 
 uh probably won't hear from that guy again because I can kind_of tell maybe he was not all there either 
so  uh uh so  the prince he gets up the next morning 
he says 
 hey 
says 
 I think I could go for that gal 
so  ye and all he has is a glass slipper  slipper 
so  he tells all of his people 
he says 
 listen we gotta find that girl 
and so uh they go out 
and they begin to look 
and they check all around 
and they come up to Cinderella's house 
and the two  the two stepdaughters are there 
and the two stepdaughters uh they come out and they look 
and they say 
 oh  I know I can get that shoe on 
 and if I can get that shoe on bammo I'm gonna be the princess 
so  the prince is standing around 
and uh he says 
 well 
he says 
 you don't really look like the one I was dancing with last night or  last week but uh here try on the shoe 
let's see what it  if it works 
and the first one tries it on and it's too big 
her foot won't fit into a size ten army shoe 
and uh uh the second one comes over 
and she tries it 
she can't get in it either 
and the prince says 
 hey is there any other girls around you_know  around the house here 
and they say 
 nope there isn't anybody 
and Cinderella on the other hand is looking from the kitchen where she's scrubbing the floors 
and she hears this 
and uh the prince says 
 wait a minute I just saw somebody in the kitchen 
and they said 
 oh  that's  that's our stepdaughters 
 she doesn't  she  you don't even wanna see her 
 she's too ugly 
and so he goes in 
and she is  she's pretty straggled 
her hair's all  all a flutter 
she's in a charwoman's dress 
and uh he says 
 well  I don't know 
 she looks a_little familiar 
 you_know if she had a good bouffant hairdo and a white dress I'd probably recognize her 
so  he tries on  the  slipper on the Cinderella 
and it fits fits like a glove 
and he says 
 did you  were you there the other night 
and she says 
 yes it was me 
 I was  a I was dancing with you 
he says 
 really 
he says 
 okay  well  how_come you're not in a nice outfit 
and she says 
 well  my two step  stepsisters and my stepmother they keep me tied up here in the kitchen 
and he says 
 what 
she says 
 yeah they keep me tied up in the kitchen 
 I can't get out 
 I don't get to do anything 
and he says 
 well  we'll take care of them 
and so uh he says 
 come_on let's go 
 let's get out_of this hellhole 
and so they get  he  he picks her up 
he takes her over to his carriage 
and they go back to the castle 
the king is ecstatic because he's found  she  he  he knows that the prince likes the girl 
probably friends but that's alright 
and  uh and the prince uh and the girl they get married 
it's a storybook wedding 
and they live happily ever after 
the end

and she uh was uh uh rushed down the river or  down the  down the area where the flood was 
and she cli she reached out and grabbed the tree branch 
and the tree branch  she held onto that tree branch until a rescuer came 
and the rescuer he  he came acrosst 
and he got to the tree branch 
and he has a big belt that he's putting around her waist  and her arm and her head so_that he can keep her with him while they swim out_of the flooded area that they're in uh in the  in the rushing water 
a little boy uh was playing uh soccer
