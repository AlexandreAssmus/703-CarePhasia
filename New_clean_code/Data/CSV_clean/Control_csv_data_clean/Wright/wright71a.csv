for one person get two slices of bread 
inhales put peanut butter on one slic
a jam or jelly of your choosing on top of the peanut butter 
then add the bread slice 
cut in half and eat 
emma you often hear about 
a cat gets stuck up in the tree 
and the little girl has tried to get the cat to come down 
and he won't 
and the dog inhales barking at the base of the tree isn't helping anything 
and then the father got involved 
and he said 
 I can climb up and get the cat for you 
inhales but he got up in the tree 
and the branch started to wiggle and wobble 
and he got scared 
inhales so  the mother looking out_of a window in the house probably called the fire truck inhales to come and get the cat 
lips_smack well  I've never been really sick 
I've never broken a bone 
haven't been hospitalized 
but inhales I did have breast head
that was  I hafta remember 
 uh was first diagnosed in exhales January 
I think that was in ninety four 
inhales  and the doctor did a lumpectomy 
 lips_smack outpatient head
and then they put me on  they tested to see what all the  sighs shrugs what kind of cancer it is 
inhales so  they put me on uh radiation 
 and  first it was chemo 
 and then  they gave me followup tests for different things 
but nothing head
so  inhales they followed me as far as exhales exams went 
and three years later I went to the radiologist 
and inhales in his examination he said 
 my goodness I feel a lump 
 it's just where the other one was 
inhales so  he was in the same building as the surgeon 
so  I  inhales  ca they called up 
and the surgeon could see me 
so  he looked at and he said 
 oh_my_goodness 
so  I guess within three or four days I had a  mastectomy head
and that was outpatient 
inhales and what they decided to do after that was put me on lips_smack oh it's a drug they don't use any  Tamoxifen head
so  I was on Tamoxifen for five years 
and  inhales I was glad head
and since then I have had no signs head
and for awhile they thought it was in my lungs 
and they inhales  did a_lot_of testing 
but it wasn't 
and then they thought 
 oh  it's in my thyroid 
and they had some complicated tests 
but it wasn't 
 inhales and I haven't head
 
lips_smack  well  I guess I was most frightened once as a young mother when inhales our three children   all of the family were out in the yard doing things 
and I looked up 
and I said 
 where's Jenny 
 and Jenny head
and so of_course I got really worried 
but we found her in a short time in a neighbor's yard 
 lips_smack  I don't think so 
I_mean just exhales last week I played bridge with a man who'd  has no social graces and can't seem to talk 
but um lips_smack that wasn't head
and  I've seen people like that 
but I don't head
well  when we traveled head
head
 lips_smack well exhales just move on laughs to find  somebody that can speak our language laughs 
 lips_smack I would say it's a picture of a  inhales  young lady being rescued from a flood waters 
 inhales  well exhales it's hard to tell if she  shrugs well  I could make it up  I guess 
she inhales was in her car 
and it was swep 
but she was fortunate t enough to escape 
inhales and a um exhales lips_smack fireman or a policeman had been inhales aware of the situations 
and either was called or was lucky to be there with a vest on 
inhales and he used an overhanging limb to reach out to her 
and um exhales lips_smack inhales his hands aren't around her 
but she's hanging tight to his muscled arm 
and I think he will bring her ashore 
 laughs  lips_smack the boy is out practicing his soccer kicks 
but he doesn't have very good aim 
or is it good aim 
he might have exhales laughs wanted to do it 
inhales kicks the soccer ball right at the window 
it breaks 
it goes into the house 
knocks over the lamp 
inhales  and the man that is in the room where the ball comes in stands up 
holds the ball 
and looks out the window 
 oh_boy  that kid better run fast 
 laughs lips_smack inhales  looks like a child is going off to school 
and the mother says 
 it's going to rain 
 you need an umbrella 
 oh  bye Mom  I don't need an umbrella 
well  he doesn't get very far before it starts 
inhales he's getting wet 
doesn't like that 
turns around and goes home 
and he's unhappy 
and the mother's unhappy 
but inhales she dries him off
gives him the umbrella 
and off he goes happy and content 
 alright 
in this kingdom exhales there was inhales a family who a mother died 
and they had one child called Cinderella 
 uh father remarried and the stepmother had two daughters 
inhales maybe three 
and uh Cinderella inhales came to live with them 
to make one family out_of two when the husband remarried 
well  it wasn't working too well 
the stepdaughters and stepmother inhales  did not like Cinderella 
and they treated her like a maid 
she hadta do all the work 
inhales  and exhales one day a letter came in the mail inhales announcing that there was going to be a ball for all the young ladies in the kingdom lips_smack so_that the prince could find a suitable wife 
well  you can imagine how inhales much excitement this called 
and the stepdaughters started thinking about 
 what will I wear 
and preparing their clothes for this occasion 
and Cinderella inhales went up and found an dress in a  lips_smack chest that held her belongings 
inhales and she came down 
and was starting to work on making this dress
inhales and the step daughters looked at her and they said 
 well  you're not going 
 you're not the kind of person that could go to this ball and be the king's   the prince's head
and they even tore the scarf off of her dress  the waistband 
and inhales lips_smack it was bad 
and it made the  dau Cinderella very head
and she  lips_smack inhales didn't know what to do 
but uh lips_smack she did have  a  f she went outside and was crying 
and the  a fairy appeared to her 
it turned out to be her fairy godmother that she hadn't known anything about 
inhales and the godmother s f said 
 well  don't worry 
 I'll arrange for you to get to the ball 
inhales so  the day of the ball came 
and the stepmother and stepdaughters went off in their fancy clothes in a fancy inhales lips_smack um exhales horse and carriage 
inhales and the godmother exhales  did her magic 
she turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage 
she turned um mice into horses 
inhales and she used her magic powers and her wand to dress Cinderella in a beautiful ball ground 
and s see  saw that Cinderella got into the carriage 
and went off to  the head
inhales her only admonition was 
 you must be home by midnight head
inhales lips_smack Cinderella entered the ballroom 
and everyone turned to look at her because of her beauty and her graciousness head
inhales the prince noticed her 
danced head
fell head
inhales and Cinderella was having such a good time she didn't head
inhales she heard the clock start to strike midnight 
and was panicked 
and ran away as fast head
inhales she did get out_of the palace and the palace grounds before the clocks had its last stroke 
inhales but  her clothes were gone 
and she was there in her old tattered clothes 
and made her way home 
and  the magic was gone 
she was back to being just a  poor little stepdaughter 
inhales but the prince exhales found a silver slipper that he knew had been on inhales his uh  loved one's feet 
and so he thought 
 well  I'll make a match 
 I'll go around the kingdom and I can certainly find the person whose foot fits in this head
so  he did that 
lips_smack inhales and when he got to Cinderella's house inhales the stepdaughters tried to cram their feet into the shoe 
but it didn't head
and Cinderella was peeking around the corner 
and wanted to try on the shoe 
and inhales uh stepmother and daughters didn't acknowledge her 
but the prince saw her and said 
 oh  would you try on this shoe 
and lo_and_behold it was a perfect fit 
 and Cinderella had loved the prince too 
so  they got married and lived happily ever after
