one sunny day in June a family of rats decided to get all the family together and go for a picnic 
they packed the truck with all their toys 
and they gathered all the rats 
they climbed  some climbed in the front of the cab 
some of the younger rats climbed in the back 
off they went down the road up a great big hill with flowers and bushes 
it was a very bumpy road with lots_of rocks 
when they hit one particularly large rock a little girl rat with her baby   with her stuffed animal flew right out_of the back of the truck 
the truck full of rats proceeded on to their picnic not realizing that they had lost one of their little girls 
she lay alongside the road watching the truck drive off in the distance 
the rat family got to the lake where they were going to have their picnic 
and they all climbed out_of the truck carrying baskets and a tablecloth and all of their toys 
some of the children ran down to the lake to play alongside the water 
some of them played in the grass or helped set up the picnic or picked flowers 
it was a beautiful lake 
and everybody was looking forward to having a nice time 
grandpa rat played the fiddle while grandma sat next to her 
and mother and father rat watched their children play 
everybody was having so much fun except for the little rat who had fallen out_of the truck 
she sat alongside the trail hugging her stuffed animal  to her and crying 
she was so scared and lonely 
the woods seemed so big and scary 
she looked every which way 
and didn't know what to do 
the flowers were pretty 
and she looked at the red flowers around her 
and the yellow flowers 
meanwhile back at the lake father called all the little rats to come and have lunch 
back in the woods the little rat  the littlest rat with her little stuffed animal was experimenting in tasting the flowers and the berries that she found around her 
she found that they were very very yummy 
and she filled up on juicy red raspberries 
meanwhile back at the lake the family started to realize that something was wrong 
they were missing the little girl rat 
the children sat and waited while the parents searched and called 
but she was nowhere to be seen 
they looked in the water and along the edges 
they looked under rocks and in the grass 
they were sad 
some of the young rats were even crying 
they did not know what had happened to their little sister 
they decided that they needed to pack up and head back the way that they had come 
nobody was going to be able to eat or have fun until they were all together again 
the little rat back along the trail had filled up on berries and was laying down in the grass just looking up at the sky wondering what to do next 
the rats in the truck searched and searched as they drove back along the trail the way they had come 
the little rat thought she heard something 
she thought she heard the rumbling of a truck and her brothers and sisters and mother and father and grandma and grandpa calling her name 
she rushed through the grass back towards the road 
she ran out into the road just in time to see her father's truck cresting the hill 
and they spotted her 
and they all waved and were so happy to find her again 
but  and they hugged joyfully  did cartwheels and jumped and cried 
but the little girl realized that something was wrong 
she had lost the stuffed animal that had given her such comfort when she was lost in the woods 
she ran back through the woods 
and in the grass there she found her bunny laying down her stuffed animal 
she hugged her stuffed animal to her 
and she was so happy 
they all climbed back into the truck again 
actually they all decided to set up and have a picnic right there where they had found their little sister 
so  they started to spread out the blankets and get the food out once again 
but this time they were most certain to have a happy picnic because they were all together 
 the same thing 
good dog Carl 
Carl lived in a family  lived in a house with a family that had a little baby 
Carl was a big Rottweiller 
and he was  when  when the mother went out shopping she said to Carl 
 look after the baby Carl 
 I'll be back shortly 
Carl was being left to babysit for a baby 
and he was just a big happy dog 
they waited as they watched the mother get into her car and drive away 
Carl looked out the window and waited until she was gone 
the baby also waited expectantly 
when Carl was sure it was s safe he walked over to the crib and stood there patiently while the baby climbed out_of the crib and onto Carl's back 
Carl carried the baby on his back just like someone would ride a horse 
they were going to have such a good time together 
they walked down the hall into mother's bedroom 
it looked so soft 
they jumped up onto the bed 
and the baby rolled around in the blankets while Carl stood watch 
afterwards they got off the bed and they went over to mom's vanity 
there the baby got into mom's powder  perfumed powder 
and he dusted Carl's nose 
it tickled Carl's nose 
but he liked the smell of the powder 
and he was having so much fun with baby 
they played dressup 
Carl looked so cute with mother's beads strung over his head and the lid to the powder can  on top of him just like a little purple hat 
baby had a hat too 
baby had a handkerchief and the powder puff 
they looked at themselves to  in the mirror and they smiled 
this was so much fun 
next Carl took the baby to the laundry chute 
uhoh 
what do you think is going to happen here 
the baby slides down the laundry chute all the way down 
and at the same time Carl races down the steps to get to the basement at the same time as the baby 
he gets there in time to see that the baby has already landed in the soft clothes underneath that are waiting to be washed in the laundry 
Carl jumps down the stairs gets the baby on his back again and climbs back up th  runs back up the stairs with baby hanging tightly to the fur around his neck 
Carl skids to a stop on a rug in the living room scattering the newspaper every which way 
they walked over to the aquarium where mother kept all of her tropical fish 
the baby decided that he wanted to go swimming 
and so Carl took him gently by the back of his shirt and lowered him over the edge of the tank and into the water 
the baby splashed and chased the fish 
afterwards Carl decided that he wanted to dance 
amazingly Carl knew how to turn on the stereo 
and he found a radio station that was playing fun dancing music 
and Carl danced and danced for the baby 
and the baby laughed and clapped his hands 
afterwards Carl and the baby were both very hungry 
so  they wandered into the kitchen 
they got into the refrigerator 
and what did they find but bread and butter 
Carl got a package of whole wheat bread 
and he ripped it open 
and ate all the bread 
meanwhile  the baby was playing with butter and squishing it between his fingers and tasting the salty buttery taste 
they found grapes 
and Carl held the grapes for the baby while the baby picked them off and plucked them in his mouth 
they made chocolate milk with syrup 
what a mess 
you can imagine there was syrup and milk all over the floor 
and what's in the red jar 
oh_my 
there was food everywhere 
and the baby was a mess 
the baby climbed onto Carl's back 
and they climbed back up the stairs leaving the mess behind 
Carl smart dog that he was started a warm bath for the baby and dropped baby inside 
he got a washcloth a bright green washcloth and a pink bar of soap 
and he scrubbed the baby 
Carl's mouth was full of soap 
and he made bubbles when he breathed which made the baby laugh 
afterwards Carl took a blow dryer and blew the baby dry 
he brought him back to the crib and pushed his little bottom up over the edge of the crib and safely back inside 
then Carl had work to do 
he went back down to the kitchen 
finished off the bread 
put the wrapper in the trash 
licked up the milk 
he looked out the window 
mom wasn't back yet 
he still had time to straighten up the bed and put the makeup puff away 
after he had cleaned the whole house and all the evidence of their romping around and fun time he looked out the window and saw mother coming home 
the baby was laying in his crib quietly 
and Carl laid down next to the baby and waited 
mother walked in to see them just as she had left them 
she was happy that Carl was such a good babysitter 
 good dog  Carl 
she said 
and rubbed his head while he put his head on her lap

okay 
to plant a flower in the garden the first thing that you needta do is dig a hole twice as big as the root or  uh twice as big as the pot 
and then you needta mix some compost in with the soil that you just dug out 
put the plant back into the hole 
and fill around it with the mixture of the dirt and the compost 
and then you make a mound in the middle 
making sure that the root ball is just  just covered 
and then you can make a little moat  make  make a little moat around the uh dirt ball 
then you water it 
and as the dirt settles down you add more dirt if necessary 
and then saturate the soil to make sure that it has gotten all the way through to the water  to the roots and that the soil is settled 
to make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich first you get out all the ingredients 
two slices of bread a jar of peanut butter a jar of jelly and a knife 
you open the two pieces of bread 
lay them out next to each_other 
you open the jelly first 
and you scoop out however much jelly you want 
and spread it with a knife onto one slice of bread 
and then you take your knife and you clean it on the other slice of bread  gpxmoves right hand back and forth before you dip it into the peanut butter jar 
you open the peanut butter jar 
dip ges
get a nice big glob of peanut butter 
and then spread that onto the other slice of bread 
then you close your two pieces of bread together with the peanut butter side facing the jelly side 
lay it down flat 
cut it in two or four pieces 
and then enjoy 
on my last vacation we joined my best friend and her family in their r_v going to the Grand_Canyon 
there were seven of us 
four in my family and three in her family 
we loaded into the r_v on a very stormy night here in Phoenix 
as we head north towards the Grand_Canyon the rain stopped but that wasn't  but we weren't in the clear 
a trucker passing us waved at us indicating that something was wrong 
and so we pulled over alongside the road 
and found that the vehicle we were towing behind the motorhome had blown a tire and ripped up the whole front side of the truck we were towing 
while the children slept in the motorhome the adults got out 
and changed the tire 
and did the things that we needed to do 
and we proceeded on to Flagstaff 
we stayed in the Walmart parking lot that night so_that the very next morning we could wake up and get the tire fixed 
and proceed with our vacation 
the next morning after the tire was fixed we drove up to the Grand_Canyon 
and had a wonderful time even_though we were a day late getting there because_of our problems 
we had a wonderful time 
and we hiked into the Grand_Canyon and out again 
we went to dinner and watched an Imax movie 
and everybody had a wonderful time 
and it turned out to be a really good vacation despite the rough start 
last Christmas 
we had Christmas at my house 
so  I hadta put together a big dinner for everybody 
but my mother inlaw did a prime rib roast  prime rib roast 
and my husband fried a turkey outside 
all the family about fifteen people came to our house 
and after dinner which we had outside on the patio we went back inside and gathered around the Christmas tree that we had cut in the forest a couple weeks earlier 
everybody said it was the funniest looking but most beautiful Christmas tree they had ever seen 
we had a white elephant gift exchange with a forty dollar maximum 
and we all selected a gift 
and we traded gifts 
and we took each_other gifts 
and everybody laughed 
all the gifts were very nice and 
in the end everybody got what they wanted 
and we had a nice time 
we had a nice dinner 
and after dinner and the gift exchange we all went to the movies 
and that's how we spent Christmas Day 
yes it is 
ah 
last weekend we went into the Tonto_National_Forest in Payson  outside of Paysin to cut firewood 
I had gone to the ranger station in Mesa and bought a firewood cutting permit 
and so we packed up without any motorhome 
just tents and sleeping bags and trailers  uh trailer and a chainsaw and axes 
and lots_of food and cooking supplies for my mother inlaw 
and early Saturday morning we drove up to Payson 
we  we followed along a dirt road that the ranger had recommended 
and we found a nice place to camp with lots_of dead trees around us 
after we set up camp we unloaded our a_t_v 
and we started dragging huge logs back up the hill to our camp 
we cut the logs  we cut the  the long tree stumps into logs and laid them next to the camper where we would load them the next day 
but mother inlaw was gonna be sleeping in the camper or the t not the camper but  the trailer so we couldn't load until the next day 
my husband and I stayed in a tent on a air mattress 
and it was so nice 
it rained as we were going to sleep 
but we could still hear the crickets 
and uh the  the popping of the fire just outside the tent 
and some  and so that's  that's how I went to sleep 
it was beautiful 
sometime during the night I woke up  we woke up because there was a coyote howling close_by 
so  we got up 
and we opened up the tent 
the rain had passed 
the sky was clear 
the  there's a million stars 
and we sat and listened to the coyote 
and um I was actually  it was  it was so dark out there besides the stars 
there was nobody else around us 
and I was able to get out_of my sleeping bag and wander around in just my underwear and sneakers 
and it just felt so good because nobody could see me 
nobody cared 
and um 
seems like I stayed up half the night looking at the stars and listening to the coyotes 
um got up in the morning 
and  and grandma cooked pancakes and sausage over a propane grill 
and we loaded up the firewood and went on home 
it was one of the best weekends I've had 
a beginning middle and end 
okay 
the family had gone to spend a week at their summer cottage at the lake 
one afternoon they went to the lake

mom and dad enjoyed each_other's company on the blanket 
they finished the first bottle of wine 
and then they got another one 
in the meantime the children were having so much fun 
they weren't even thinking about eating or having lunch 
by the time mom and dad had finished their second bottle of wine they didn't care about making lunch 
then they went back to the cabin to take a nap 
when the children finished playing and realized that mom and dad were gone they went back to the picnic basket 
and they happily ate every single thing in it while mom and dad slept in the cabin

she looked up into the tree and there she saw her cat Muffy sitting way out on a branch 
Muffy looked happy enough 
Muffy didn't look concerned 
but the little girl thought that Muffy was gonna ca fall 
and so she called to her father 
and her father came running out and climbed up the tree with a ladder 
he climbed out on the branch 
but then he got scared because he was afraid of heights 
and he couldn't go any further 
he was immobilized 
the dog barking at the base of the tree accidentally knocked the ladder down

Suzie didn't know what to do 
mother looking out the window saw what was happening 
and she called the fire department 
the fire department came racing in on their fire  with their fire engine 
and they unloaded their own ladder

Mister and Missus Jones got in a really big fight 
he was yelling at her 
she was yelling at him and pointing her finger in his face 
she decided she was gonna leave 
she packed a suitcase and went out the door 
Mister Jones didn't know what to do 
he sat in the chair holding his head 
not knowing whether he should go after her or let her go 
a moment later he heard a big crash 
as he started to rise from his chair Missus Jones opened the door and looked back inside 
she was scared and crying 
and he reached out to her 
and he took her in his arms  to reassure her 
he looked out the door and saw that she had crashed their car into a tree

a man and a woman went for a drive in the country 
they were going to see the woman's sister who lived on a farm 
they had brought a map with them but at some point realized that they were lost 
they saw a farmer standing alongside the road getting ready to plant a tree 
they stopped to talk to the farmer 
the man showed him his map 
the farmer looked at the map and knew exactly where they were trying to go 
he told them to go up the road two miles take a left and then another right 
and they would find the woman's sister's farm 
they smiled and  and thanked him and drove away 
the farmer went on planting his tree 
before he had even finished digging the hole he looked up 
and there was the same man and woman stopping alongside the road again 
he had given them directions that led them around in a circle 
and here they were back where they started 
maybe the farmer didn't know where  where they  how to give them directions after all 
okay laughs 
I was riding a quad 
I was thirty years old 
and we were at Little_Sahara sand dunes in northern Oklahoma 
it was nineteen ninety four 
right before  Thanks right before Halloween 
and my husband and I were out riding 
he was on a performance quad that had big shock absorbers 
and we were  and I was on a utility quad like a hunting quad that's more made as a workhorse and not for racing 
we went over a hill 
and sped down the other side of the hill 
and at the bottom there were bumps 
and my husband's bike just went right over the bumps 
but mine hit the bumps and 
as my body was coming off of a bump my bike had hit another bump and came back up 
and I heard a loud and felt a really loud pop 
and  I stopped the bike or the bike stopped itself 
and  I realized I was in a_lot_of pain 
couldn't move 
so  my husband came back 
and he took me off the bike 
and laid me on the ground 
and I remember making sounds 
I remember I was embarrassed at the same time that I was in pain because I was making sounds like an animal 
it was embarrassing 
and uh I told my husband I could not get back on the bike 
that I couldn't do it 
I couldn't move 
and I was in too much pain 
and he was annoyed 
and he said 
 if you don't get back on that bike we're gonna hafta get a ambulance crew out here for you 
 do you want that 
and I said 
 no 
 I don't 
so  he lifted me back on the bike 
and he put both of my hands on the steering wheel or  the um handlebars 
and he put my feet on the pedals 
and  he drove  he drove ahead of me 
and he  he went as quickly as he could back to the car 
meanwhile  it took me about an hour to get three miles 
and I made it back to the car 
and he hadta lift me off 
and put me in the seat 
it took three hours for us to get home or  to the hospital 
and xrays and everything 
broken back 
um and when my husband called me that night from home and I was in the hospital not having any idea when  you_know what our  what our future was going to be like he told me he was very sad 
laughs very sad and very sorry 
oh yeah laughs 
yes 
my next door neighbor was born in Malaysia 
and when she was a teenager she moved to Australia 
so  her first language is Mandarin Chinese 
and then her second language is English 
and  I have trouble communicating with her because I feel like she just nods instead_of really understanding things 
and it's taken me years to figure out when I hafta repeat things to her even_though she insists she understands 
you_know  and the the very next day she'll not have a clue what I had told her 
and so I have just learned to um uh watch for cues that she's not listening or just nodding her head or really not understanding 
and I've hadta learn to be very direct and repeat and question and rephrase in_order_to make sure that she understands 
I was in the military 
I'd just come to Phoenix from Korea 
and I didn't know anybody yet 
and so I got a parttime job on the weekends working at a construction site as a security guard 
and I worked middle of the night shift all night shift 
and it was a fifty acre construction site out in the middle of nowhere before anything was developed 
and they had security at the site for insurance purposes 
however the security guards were not allowed to carry any weapons 
we weren't allowed to carry even a Maglite because a Maglite is considered a weapon 
there's actually classes that teach you how to use a Maglite for selfdefense or as a weapon 
so  on this fifty acre site there was one light pole 
and the security guard was required to sit under that light pole unless they were making their rounds 
so  all around you it's pitch black 
and you're just under this light pole 
and you can't see beyond the darkness or  beyond the light 
and so I would sit there at night 
and uh  one night in the middle of the summer the construction crew came to work 
or they had been coming to work very very early in the morning 
and this time it was around three in the morning 
and I didn't realize that they were going to be coming that early 
and I was s sitting where I shouldn't have been sitting 
I was just outside the light so_that I could see 
because it's creepy 
very creepy all night long 
and so you_know by three o'clock in the morning I was already on edge 
and all_of_a_sudden 
and I hadn't seen anybody approaching 
but all_of_a_sudden a man jumped out from behind a close_by Port_a_Potty 
he yelled 
and he had a rope in his hand 
and he was stretching the rope in_between his hands like this 
and he yelled 
and I screamed 
and he laughed 
and then he tied the rope around his waist where he was using it to hold his pants up 
and he continued to laugh 
and I cried because it had scared me so badly laughs 
laughs as it turns out he was just one of the construction workers that showed up early and maybe got dropped off along the road 
yeah laughs 
it was 
it was monsoon season in Phoenix Arizona 
and it had been raining for days and days 
and the creeks were flooding 
and the  there were roads that were impassable 
there were roadblocks up everywhere 
but every year there are people who try to cross the flooded roads 
they don't realize sometimes that the roads may have been washed away underneath the water 
and that it's much deeper than they realized 
one father had gone across the or  had attempted to cross the road 
he thought because he had a pickup truck then he would be just fine 
then as they entered the water very quickly the hand
and pushed his truck right off the road 
he and his daughter were the only ones in the truck 
daughter was in her seatbelt 
he was able to get out_of his seatbelt 
then he climbed to the top of the truck 
and over the other side where he reached in and got his daughter 
the water swept them off the top of the truck 
and as they  as they were swept downstream they caught a tree 
and the girl hung on to the tree alone because her father had been swept further down 
and he hadta grab another tree down the way 
someone watching who had seen everything had called nineoneone 
the fire department got there 
and they saw the little girl clinging to the tree 
one particularly strong handsome young fire fighter  put on his life vest 
jumped out into the water 
grabbed the tree 
put his arms around the little girl 
and she clung to him  knowing that her life depended on it 
he held her very tightly while he put another belt around her 
it was a belt similar to the one he was wearing 
and they  they tied themselves together with the belt 
and his friends back on shore the other fire fighters pulled him back to the shore with the girl 
and when she was safe a different fire fighter went in after the father 
and got him safely out 
and they gave him a ticket for breaking the stupid motorist law 
laughs and he got a bill for fifteen hundred dollars for the rescue of him and his daughter 
Bobby was out in the yard playing soccer 
he was having a great time kicking the ball around practicing all his soccer moves 
thinking about how cool he was gonna be in the upcoming soccer tournament 
and how he was gonna be the star 
he was excited thinking about all the glory that he was going to receive 
he gave that soccer ball the biggest kick he could 
and there it went  straight for his living room window 
smash 
broke the living room window 
flew into the  and flew into his father's or  knocked over a lap  a lamp  and flew into his father's lap who was sitting just inside taking a nap in his favorite chair 
shocked the father stood up 
and looked outside the window to see what had happened 
nobody was out there 
there was no little boy 
but he knew 
and he waited until the boy came home 
the boy had been scared 
and hid for hours in the bushes 
and when he did come home the father scolded him 
and gave him a list of jobs he would hafta do to earn the money to pay for the broken window 
sighs it was Monday morning and time for Billy to go to school 
the weathermen had said it was going to rain that day 
so  mom asked Billy to take an umbrella 
Billy said 
 no 
 I don't wanna take an umbrella 
 umbrellas are for girls 
so  mom said 
 okay 
 if you're sure you don't hafta take the umbrella 
Billy smiled and said goodbye to his mom and started walking to school 
a little ways away from his house the rain started to fall 
within seconds it was coming down like cats and dogs 
he turned around and ran as fast as he could through the growing puddles back to his house 
when he got to his house he was soaking sopping wet 
and his mother just looked at him and shook his head  shook her head 
at this point Billy was happy to take the umbrella 
and he changed his clothes 
got on something dry 
and went back to school proudly holding his umbrella 
and arriving dry and ready for class 
okay

Cinderella was so sad 
and she went in her room and cried 
and her animal friends gathered around her 
she was friends with all the animals because she was so nice 
the animals loved her 
the animals helped her do her chores 
and they all worked very hard 
and they put together a dress for her because she had nothing to wear to the ball 
when it was time to go to the ball she went downstairs 
and when the sisters and the stepmother saw how beautiful she looked in the beautiful dress they just went crazy with rage 
and they tore the dress off of her the pins out_of her hair

because at midnight her clothes and her carriage and everything were gonna disappear and go back to normal 
so  she took some mice and with a wave of her wand she turned them into horses 
and turned a pumpkin into a beautiful carriage 
and Cinderella climbed in in her beautiful gown and went to the ball 
everyone was amazed and stunned at this beautiful woman who entered the ballroom 
and the prince fell in love immediately 
they danced all night 
she was having such a good time Cinderella was she didn't realize how late it was 
and as the clock struck the first bell for twelve o'clock she looked up and realized how late it was and what was gonna happen 
with a gasp she ran out_of the ballroom leaving the prince shocked not knowing what was going on 
she ran out_of the ballroom and down the stairs 
she hadta get out_of there before the last bong 
before the twelfth bong  bell 
on the way down the steps she tripped and lost a slipper 
a beautiful little glass slipper 
she made it home 
and all the beautiful dresses and pumpkin coach and horses turned back into what they had been before the fairy godmother visited 
so  she had made it home safely without anybody quite figuring out who she was 
and she went  she went to her room and went to sleep dreaming about the prince 
the prince wasn't happy because he didn't know who she was where she lived 
and he didn't know when he was gonna see her again 
so  he took the glass slipper and had his  his servant go to every house in the city 
and all the girls hadta try on the slipper 
he knew that whoever the slipper fit was gonna be the girl who he had fallen in love with at the dance or  at the ball 
the two girls  the two stepsisters tried to fit their feet into the slipper but their feet were too big 
and the servant said 
 isn't there anyone else 
 I've searched all the houses 
 there has gotta be somebody else 
and just then Cinderella appeared in her work dress 
and he says 
 ah 
 here's another girl 
 she needs to try on the slipper too 
so  Cinderella placed her foot into the slipper 
and it slid in very easily 
and she smiled 
and the servant smiled and said 
 oh 
 at last I found you 
and he brought Cinderella back to the castle 
while the sisters stared after her with anger in their eyes 
the prince was very happy that his servant had found Cinderella 
when they got married Cinderella invited her stepmother and stepsisters to come and live in the castle with them 
and she was kind to them 
and they all lived  and they were sorry for how mean they had been to her 
and they all lived happily ever after
