and we're ready to eat 
it's a day 
and the kids are outside playing 
and all_of_a_sudden a cat crawls up in the tree 
the little girl's all scared 
so  daddy cr crawls up on a branch to try to get the cat 
and he's stuck

the little girl's still s screaming 
and here comes the firemen running to save  save them all 
and after they're safe 
and they  it's all done 
and everybody's happy 
I was having a real hard time for a few nights uh sleeping and breathing 
and I would sit up a_lot 
and in the morning when I got up my wife Angela said that she had called the doctor and made an appointment because I had been saying no no  there's nothing wrong 
it's just my allergies 
and she was tired of hearing me up all night 
so  not very happily I left and went to the doctor and  actually the doctor practitioner 
and she checked me out 
and she said she's leaving for a minute and came back with another doctor 
and they said well you have congestive heart failure 
we needta put you in the hospital 
so  I spent the next three days in the hospital being treated 
that was it 
I'll go back to when our youngest was probably thirteen fourteen years old 
and it was winter time 
and she had gone to the school dance with one of her friends 
and the two girls had left the house and headed for the dance 
and we were just relaxing at home 
and the phone rang and said uh this is the Valley Medical Center emergency room 
we have your daughter here 
and she was found in a snowbank 
and um she's in hypothermia 
we're trying to warm her up 
and at that moment I just went totally faint 
and I couldn't think of anything 
and we went down 
and the doctor came out 
and he says well we've got her stable 
and she's warming up fine 
but her and her girlfriend or her girlfriend when she came had a coke can full of her father's um vodka 
and the two girls drank it 
and they didn't fare too well 
that's it 
times hard times communicating 
what come back to try to figure out just one I can't think of a specific 
mm
I'm sure in travels we've been looking at things and wanna buy them and asking questions they can't 
so  you just hand and foot and motioning 
and you get things across 
I don't know that's hard 
there's a young lady she's out on a nice afternoon walk 
it's a_little stormy and rainy 
but sh she's having a nice time 
and she sees something 
she goes down by the river and uh accidentally falls in 
and she's going down the river 
she gets ahold of a branch 
and the aid people are called out 
and a fireman r rescuer goes out on a harness and gets her 
and they pull her in 
and everything's fine after they check her out 
little Johnny looks like he's getting ready to go to school 
mom's telling him uh here's the umbrella 
he says no no I don't need an umbrella 
it's just fine 
so  he Johnny heads for school 
and he gets partway 
and it starts raining 
pretty soon it's pouring 
and he goes in the house 
and he's all soaked 
and mom's sitting there giving him a stare 
and he gets changed and dried up 
and he takes his umbrella and heads for school just happy as can be 
now Johnny's  it's must be after school 
he's out kicking his soccer ball playing having a good time 
all_of_a_sudden he really gets his foot into it 
and it goes through their picture window and falls on the floor knocks over a lamp on its way and scares dad 
and dad picks the ball up looks out the window and just staring out there through a broken pane 
and all ends well 
they get the picture window fixed 
and everybody's happy 
this is a story about Cinderella 
um her father gets married and shows her stepmother and stepsisters 
well  it's not so happy for Cinderella because the stepsisters are like old princesses 
her stepmother is a wicked old lady 
and Cinderella hasta be a servant to them all 
and  but she's very happy out with the animals in the barnyard 
and she stands in the  her room looking out the window at the castle and dreaming

and the king in the castle he wants the prince to find a wife 
and so they send out an announcement of a upcoming ball that they might introduce all the young ladies to the prince 
and he might pick out a wife

and she dresses up real nice 
and she's gonna show them 
and she's gonna go 
and they scoff at her and make fun of her and tear her  her necklace off 
and they leave for the party 
well  fairy godmother comes 
and she waves her wand 
and a pumpkin in the garden turns into a pumpkin carriage

and the mice become uh foot men for the carriage

and she's just the highlight of the party 
everybody notices her 
and she's having a good time 
the prince is dancing with her 
and she noticed the time 
and she had been told that this spell goes away at midnight 
and so she runs off out_of the dance 
while running she drops one of the glass slippers 
and the next thing she's sitting on the pumpkin 
the old nag is there 
and the four mice they're just sitting 
well  the king wants to know who this girl was 
and nobody comes forward nobody 
so  he's gonna go through the countryside with the slipper and see who it fits 
and they lock Cinderella in her room so she can't try the slipper on 
and the mice they get the key to the door 
and they slide it under  br under the door bring it to her

and she goes to try on the slipper 
and the stepmother tries everything to keep her from it
