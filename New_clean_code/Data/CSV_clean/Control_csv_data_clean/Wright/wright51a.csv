yeah  well  get your slice of bread whether wheat or white 
uh what I like to do is spread the peanut butter first 
get a knife 
take it out_of   uh open up the jar 
uh put the knife into the peanut butter 
uh take out a  sc take out a scoops 
spread it over the bread 
uh and then I open up a
and I usually use a spoon for that 
uh put that on the other slice of bread 
take the same knife that I use for peanut butter 
spread it over the bread 
and put the two slices together 
a little girl was uh  riding through the neighborhood on her bike 
and noticed that her cat was caught up in a tree 
uh  uh her father came along 
and said 
 what is it dear 
she says 
 Dad  my cat's in the tree 
 well  I can get the cat out 
 let me go get my ladder 
father sniffles went and got the ladder 
climbed up the tree 
and then a neighborhood dog came by 
and noticed a man up in a tree 
and started barking at the man up the tree 
and accidentally knocked down the ladder 
so  the man was stuck in the ladder along laughs with the cat 
and the fire department hadta be called to uh rescue them both 
uh it was about I guess  about seven years ago I really hurt my back 
there's this family that I go and visit that has a little child 
and from the time that child was born as a little boy uh I always picked him up and swung him around 
uh but as this boy was getting older  as I was getting older I  I guess  I can't do some of the things that  that uh I n normally do 
uh this particular uh time I picked the boy up 
and I was swinging him around 
m b swinging  picking him up by the arms 
and I spread my legs wide open 
and I was swinging him uh backwards and forwards 
and I felt something snap in my back 
uh I was in excruciating pain 
I almost dropped the kid laughs 
uh I found out later that I had torn something in my back which required me to be on steroids 
but this was pain like I have never felt before 
because even just to walk or  or roll over in the bed to move a leg or even to move your arms it's all tied into the back 
it would be like a knife was twisting so 
that's  that's the injury 
and it put me out_of commission for a couple of weeks 
uh and uh the thing that comes to the  to the top of my mind when it comes to me having difficulty communicating with someone else 
uh it's the family that I described earlier with a child 
they're Hispanic 
and their English is not very good 
the kids speak English very well because they learned that in grade school 
uh but whenever uh oh I wanna do something with the kids or try and find out what they want 
I help them with their homework 
my wife she speaks Spanish 
so  it's alright when she goes over there 
but when it comes to me trying to convey my thoughts 
uh and uh trying to convey my wants and desires 
and also me trying to listen to theirs 
I don't always understand what they're talking about 
or  and then  and they don't understand what I'm talking about 
yeah  in high school a friend of mine  myself and a friend of mine we ditched uh class so_that we could climb Camelback_Mountain 
neither one of us had ever climbed Camelback_Mountain 
so  we didn't realize exactly you_know where to go or where to start 
uh we just picked a spot on the uh northern side of the mountain 
you_know  walked in between some of those uh very expensive homes 
and started climbing 
little did we know uh we really had gotten ourselves in  in a_lot_of trouble doing that 
uh there were times where we were actually ch hanging onto cliffs or trying to climb up cliffs you_know uh uh just to  just to get from one point to another 
uh about halfway up uh we're sitting on this rock after we helped each other up this difficult spot 
and uh I said to him I says 
 man there's no way we can go back the same way we came 
and he says 
 I know 
and I said 
 I'm serious 
he goes 
 so am I 
and so we knew the only way  the only thing  we  we figured what we hadta do is uh make it to the top 
and hopefully there would be an easier way we could come back on the other side 
but then we would still hafta hike all laughs the way back around the mountain to get to our car 
uh  to make a long story short 
uh you_know  we were all scuffed  k scuffed up 
we were tired scratched up chlor clothes torn 
uh but uh we could finally see we were kind_of getting to the top 
as we were approaching the top we saw more people uh up there 
and uh older people younger people 
a we couldn't believe it that you_know these people  all these people had made it to the top when we had such a difficult time 
so  when we got to the point where we could actually talk to these people we  sa we asked them 
 how'd you get up here 
they said 
 oh  we took this trail you_know down here on the other side 
a and laughs we couldn't believe that there was a trail 
laughs so  uh uh after that experience uh you_know I thank God for helping us through it 
uh because it  uh it really  it really made me understand why people hadta be rescued from Camelback_Mountain 
and I understand how people can get stuck 
why helicopters hafta come in and rescue people off of ledges 
but prior to that experience uh I  I  I couldn't understand how could people n get to a certain place and not get back down the same way 
uh a couple decided they would go uh white water rafting 
uh  and so  uh they were white water rafting 
the man told his girlfriend to put on her vest 
and she said 
 I can swim 
 I don't needta put on a vest 
and he goes 
 well  I'm gonna put mine on because I think that's just a safe thing to do 
so  as they're white water rafting the further down they got the rougher the water uh became 
and uh as  uh as they continued to go down uh the water got so rough that her life vest  uh uh her life vest fell out_of the boat 
and seconds later the boat tipped over 
so  both of them are  are  are  uh are in the water with the rapids  in the  in the rapids hitting rocks uh with the heavy flow of the stream going  going by them 
fortunately the man since he had floated he was able to  to stay afloat uh a and last long enough to  to float to the edge and grab a branch 
his uh girlfriend was coming quickly behind him 
and as he's hanging onto the branch he's reaching for her 
uh early one morning uh s it's time for little Johnny to go to school 
little Johnny's about to walk out the door 
but mom stops him 
and says 
 Johnny uh you better take this umbrella with you because I heard the forecast 
 and I think it's gonna rain 
Johnny says 
 oh  Mom 
 I don't need an umbrella 
 umbrellas are for sissies 
 and besides a little bit of rain isn't going to hurt me 
she says 
 I think you should take it 
 no I don't need it 
 I'll see you later  Mom 
so  as Johnny is walking to school it starts to rain 
at first a little bit and then harder and harder 
and as Johnny is walking he's putting his hands over his head trying to stop all the wetness from falling uh on his face 
and he's hating himself for not having to  n for not having uh to get that umbrella 
so  he races back home uh you_know  he races back home 
and when his mom opens the door he's soaking wet 
and his mom looks at him disappointedly 
and said 
 see you're all wet because you didn't take the umbrella 
 maybe next time you'll listen to me 
so  Johnny took the umbrella 
and went outside while it was still raining 
and this time he used it 
and he figured 
 hey  I guess umbrellas aren't for sissies after all 
Bobby loves to play soccer 
he loves playing soccer so much he can even play by himself 
he was outside in his front yard one day just practicing kicking the ball 
uh he kicked it so hard boomo 
it went right through his neighbor's window 
and when it went through the window it went right into the neighbors living room 
knocked over a lamp close to where a man was sitting 
it startled the man 
the man picked up the ball 
and looked out the broken window to see where the ball had come from 
okay 
there was once a girl called Cinderella 
she didn't have any parents 
and she lived in an orphanage 
uh so  but there was a  she lived in an orphanage 
and uh the orphanage was looking for a family to take her 
uh so  they put out a notice 
a mother that had  that had two daughters showed up at the orphanage to see Cinderella to take her in 
they saw Cinderella 
uh the orphanage director introduced cell Cinderella 
she  Cinderella did a curtsy 
said 
 pleasure to meet you 
and they took Cinderella away 
once they got Cinderella home she fou found out  Cinderella found out that the stepmother was really mean and so were the stepsisters 
all they made her do was chores all day long 
nothing but work work work 
 Cinderella do this 
 Cinderella do that 
 Cinderella get my food 
 Cinderella do the laundry 
 Cinderella feed the animals the cats the dog the horses 
all Cinderella could do was just work work work all the time 
uh all  in the  later  uh later that evening a invitation came to the house uh from the uh king inviting all the girls  all the unmarried ladies to the uh prince's ball so_that perhaps the prince could find somebody to marry 
uh and so everybody was excited that they were going to go to the ball 
uh and  e and so was Cinderella 
she thought she would be going too 
Cinderella went into a bed  whi while she was cleaning she went into a bedroom and saw a beautiful dress 
and so she went ahead and tried the dress on 
however  when the stepmothers and stepsisters came in and saw her with the  with the dress and also the jewelry she was wearing she says 
 what are you doing 
 what are you doing 
Cinderella says 
 well  I'm going we've all been invited to the ball 
Cinderel and the evil stepsisters and the stepmother said 
 you're not going 
 you're ugly 
 you're staying here 
 nobody's gonna wanna marry you 
and they snatched the jewelry off of her 
and they snatched the dress off of her 
and says 
 you're not going anywhere 
 we're going to the ball 
 and one of us will marry the prince 
 uh but you've got to stay home because nobody wants to marry you anyway 
and so off to the ball they went 
uh Cinderella stayed at home 
and she was crying 
uh and before you knew it she was crying so hard all_of_a_sudden uh she started hearing uh bells 
and there's twinkling all around 
and a fairy godmother appeared 
and Cinderella says 
 who are you 
 I'm your fairy godmother 
 and I'm here to  gr to grant your wish to go to the ball 
and uh Cinderella says 
 well  I can't go because I don't have a dress 
 and I don't have a way to get there 
so  fairy mother 
and  and created a dress for her 
she says 
 oh the dress is beautiful 
 but I don't have any shoes 
she may  waved her magic wand again and ha and there was some glass slippers for her 
uh so  she put on the glass slippers 
so  now she was truly a beautiful  a beautiful beautiful young lady 
uh so  they walked outside 
and Cinderella said that 
 I don't have a way to get there 
and the fairy godmother says 
 well  ga get that pumpkin and those mice 
 they're your friends 
 tell them to come over here 
 and the dog seems to like you too 
so  fairy godmother waved her magic wand 
and the pumpkin turned into a carriage 
and the mice turned into uh horses 
and the dog turned into a chauffeur 
so they all pi or  so  so  uh Cinderella now was able to go to the ball 
she got into the carriage 
and off to the ball they went 
when Cinderella arrived everybody was stunned at her beauty 
they couldn't believe how incredible she looked 
ah but s w she tried to remember  as much fun as Cinderella was having she tried to remember one thing that her fairy godmother had told her 
she says she needed to be back by midnight 
she says if she wasn't back by midnight the pumpkin was gonna turn back in or  the carriage was gonna turn back into a pumpkin 
and that the horses were gonna turn back into mice 
and that the uh chauffeur  chauffeur was gonna turn back into the dog 
so  Cinderella figured she can enjoy herself until then 
she was having so much fun she lost track the time 
and when she looked up at the clock she noticed that it was almost twelve o'clock 
and while she was dancing with the prince she quickly broke away from him and says 
 I gotta go I gotta go 
and she  s and the prince says 
 no  you can't go 
 I think I found my true love 
Cinderella continued to run 
 I got to go 
 I must go 
and as Cinderella was running out she left a shoe behind 
she hesitated for a second to get it but realized she didn't have enough time 
so  she quickly hopped into the carriage 
the carriage drove  drove off 
and uh got her home just in time 
the clothes turned to rags 
the carriage turned into a pumpkin 
the horse turned into  mice 
and the chauffeur turned into the dog 
uh back at the palace the prince uh while he was chasing Cinderella noticed that there was a glass slipper that was still there 
so  he picked up the glass slipper and said 
 I must find this woman 
 whosever foot can  whosever woman's foot can fit into this shoe that's the person that I'm going to marry 
sighs laughs so  so  the prince went from house to house looking for females to fit that shoe 
how  one house after another 
uh none of the female's foot would fit into the glass slipper 
uh and so finally he came to Cinderella's house 
as uh the prince arrived the mother and the evil stepsisters they locked Cinderella into the closet 
uh where she couldn't get out 
uh and so the prince came in 
and uh the two daughters tried on the shoes with all of their might  the shoe with all their might 
and they could not put their feet into it 
uh however her friends the little mice noticed that uh that the prince was there 
and so they found a key to the room 
and they gave it to Cinderella so_that she could open the door 
and the prince could see that there was another woman in the house 
so  uh the prince asked her to try on the shoe 
and she did 
and magically you_know she transformed back into the lady that he saw laughs that night 
and  hi and the prince realized belches 
scuse 
the prince realized that he had found the love of his life 
so  uh they got together 
they  uh they drove back to the palace 
got married 
and live happily ever after
