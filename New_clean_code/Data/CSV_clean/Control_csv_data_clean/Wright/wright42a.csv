mom had planned a birthday party 
it was gonna be the fourth birthday party for her  s her youngest boy 
she had set out a  m the most beautiful cake 
well  the family dog decided that he was gonna eat that cake 
so  he got himself a big mouthful 
and got his paws into it too 
and ran and hid underneath the sofa so_that the mom couldn't get at him with the broom 
the little boy was devastated because the cake was ruined 
and his mom was trying to hit his dog 
um in the meantime the guest started showing up at the door  uh carrying presents and looking astounded at what was going on 
you make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich by taking uh two pieces of bread 
you  on one side you spread the peanut butter 
and on the other side you spread the jelly 
and then you put the two together 
oh_my sighs uh in about nineteen eighty four  eighty five 
it's been a long time 
um I had my four points
um I had  as a precaution I was taking a really large dose of penicillin so_that I wouldn't get an infection 
um because when I was seven years old I had rheumatic fever 
you_know  and they always told me 
 well  your immune system isn't gonna be near as strong so make sure you take this extra precaution if you have any kind of surgery  including oral surgery 
so  I did that 
and tha that evening I  early evening my throat swelled up 
uh don't know if it was from the penicillin or what but um I ended up back at the dentist's office 
and they ended up having to take uh some epinephrine 
they gave me shots of epinephrine 
I think two of them 
and they also took s a syringe points
uh shortly after that I was diagnosed with something called ang uh 
they called it then angioneurotic edema uh but it's since been rediagnosed or reclassified as now called uh hereditary angioedema 
um the difference between ges
hereditary angioedema cannot 
it hasta be  the only thing that  i until recently the only thing that was known that could counteract that uh during an episode was the epinephrine 
uh during that time shortly after I was diagnosed my throat again swelled up 
just out_of the clear blue 
uh I went to urgent care 
um in urgent care they started an i_v on me 
and the doctor 
I don't know if she was a doctor or a p_a 
um anyway she ended up giving me a shot of adrenaline ges
an and anybody that's head
it goes intermuscular 
um because it takes  within just a few seconds it takes your heart rate from normal seventy two up to like a hundred and fifty or a hundred and eighty beats a minute 
uh in my case I think I went over two hundred 
um and I remember my  th it felt like points
you_know  at the base of my skull 
um j just from so much pressure 
and I'd head
I've been knocked out once you_know playing football but I never passed out 
um and I knew I was gonna pass out 
and I told the doctor that 
and she said 
 okay lay back 
so  I  s I looked at her and said 
 I can't I can't 
 I don't dare 
so  she put her hands behind me ges
and at that point I don't know what was going on externally but internally I was  fishing with my grandfather 
and he was  it was at a favorite fishing place that I  that I had uh when I was growing up 
and he was walking up the  r the stream bank wanting ta 
and I was trying my darnedest to catch up to him 
and I said 
 I wanna go 
 I wanna go 
 h no it's not your time to go fishing with me 
 go home 
so  I woke up and later was told that um 
I  I can recall actually  I don't  I don't know if this is something you want on tape or not but 
I  I actually remember having an out of body experience where I was like looking at myself and looking at the doctor and you_know watching what they were doing 
and it was like 
 jeez  what are you doing to me 
and then it hit me that 
 oh  yeah  they're doing it to me laughs 
uh  my wife hasta fill in the details you_know of other stuff that happened 
but apparently they brought in the crash cart 
and I guess you_know zapped me at_least once 
uh I did come back 
uh overall I was out for seven minutes 
uh not breathing for seven minutes 
and to this day have had little if any uh effects you_know  aftereffects from that 
you_know  they  they say seven minutes your brain is dead 
well  I have no idea why but it didn't affect me 
not  I'm sure sometimes it effects me you_know in some of my memory but that could be aging too laughs so 
that is very vivid to me 
the  sighs probably the most vivid recollection I have of a communication issue with someone was an employee uh who was actually hired for me 
he came in as  uh I was the resident engineer at a project field office in Tempe uh and needed an assistant 
the assistant was brought in 
and  when he talked to me and to anyone else around us we all kind_of looked at each other and said 
 what did he just say 
uh he's Filipino 
uh he's  he was I believe born in the US but is raised Filipino so he talks the Galog 
um I don't know why but I was able to just understand him just by listening to him more intently 
uh there's a_lot_of people that wouldn't give him the chance 
and you_know I actually was doing some interpreting for him beca you_know at one time or another because I understood what he was saying 
uh and  that was  to me it was probably the most difficult uh one that I hadta deal with 
uh not because I didn't understand him but because I understood him and wanted other people to understand him 
um but I also spent some time in Mexico 
and there's people down there that speak no English 
so  I've you_know hadta adapt 
and I've learned to speak a little bit of Spanish 
enough to get by 
uh things like uh uh uh 
 gustans
uh or uh 
 dondes
you_know  the important stuff you_know laughs 
uh the beginning was we were planning a trip to Cancun Mexico 
and we were  at the time we'd been discussing this 
and we were just standing in line at the movie theater 
and it just happened the couple in front of us was talking with another couple about going to Mexico 
and they started talking about Cozumel and Cancun and mainly Cozumel which we had planned to go see 
you_know  to go to the  the island of Cozumel and you_know travel around there a little bit 
because there's some ruins there and it's a really nice place 
well  the guy in the group that was telling about their experience down there uh apparently was an ex marine or something 
he was just perfectly built 
um and he had  they had an occasion down there where apparently they got into a cab they'd gotten near the port 
I think they were doing uh one of the Princess_Cruises or something 
so  they'd come into port and had been  spent the day there 
and then they hadta get back to the ship 
so  they hired a cab 
well  the cab starts going the other direction 
and he kept telling him 
 no  no  no  no you're going the wrong way 
 the port's over here 
you_know 
 you needta go back this way 
and he wouldn't stop 
and he kept saying 
 not to worry 
 I know short cut 
 it's okay 
and he said he finally ended up uh convincing the guy that he better stop 
um and he and his wife just jumped out_of the vehicle as it was moving 
and people in the neighborhood that they were  that they had jumped out_of into uh started screaming about  you_know at  yelling for the federaless
uh so  here we are 
maybe a month away  not even a month away from our trip and thinking about this 
we get there to Cozumel 
and soon as you get off the ferry uh there's all these cab drivers there 
and  wanting to you_know take you around the city  or around the island 
so  this one kin you_know kind_of  I don't know  it was kind_of like hey pick me raise
and  and so we went over to him 
and he says that oh yeah he'd be glad to take us 
and he says 
 uh I'll even give you a tour of the whole island 
you_know 
 you can spend however long you want with me today 
says uh you_know and he told us how much 
and I can't even remember the amount 
we get in the vehicle and 
you_know  we made the contract 
we got in the vehicle 
and right off the bat he takes off into the middle of town 
 don't worry 
 it's okay 
 I just hafta stop and let the owner of the cab know where we're going 
so  here I am with my wife and my sister inlaw 
the three of us 
and we're sitting there 
the sister inlaw is just in La_la_land like 
 hey  this is just great 
 you_know  this is fantastic 
 we paid this much money which was nothing for a cab for all day 
 and we're gonna go see this you_know  this island 
and this guy goes in  into it's basically a bar 
and my wife and I are going 
 oh_my_god 
this is it 
 we're gonna   we're either gonna be abducted or we're gonna be killed right here 
well  come to find out the guy was just going in to tell the cab  the owner of the cab because apparently they owned it  uh it was coownership 
so  he went in to tell the other guy that 
 hey don't worry about using the cab because I'm using it for the day 
and he was a very good tour guide 
very good to us all day 
uh but it was  i like I said it  w it was scary there for quite awhile 
well  it was the great flood of uh nineteen eighty 
and people were doing such foolish things 
but in the meantime we had heroes that were out rescuing people 
putting their lives on the line 
we have a firefighter that jumped in the water n to save a little girl who was about to drown 
and he held onto her until other help could get there to help get her out_ofthe  the water  the swirling water 
surely she would have died if he hadn't been there to help her out 
well  Danny was out playing soccer in the front yard 
and he'd been learning how to kick the soccer ball really well 
um so  he gave it a boot one time 
and he actually kicked it a little bit too much and shanked it 
and it went over an and uh hit the window of the  the house nearby 
and broke the window 
and fell in the lap of the father who was sitting in his chair 
the father of the house 
when they  when he approached  when it fell on his lap he was startled 
and got up and looked out the window to see where the ball had come from 
but of_course the little boy had run away 
well  it was a cloudy day 
and mother had watched  the uh or  heard the news  the weather forecast that it was going to be rainy sometime during the day that day 
so  when I was getting ready to leave the house she handed me an umbrella 
and I said 
 oh  mom  it's not gonna rain today 
 I have my backpack 
 if anything happens I can hold it over my head 
 and I won't get as wet 
 so  I'm not gonna take the umbrella 
 I'll be fine 
I no sooner got down the road then wouldn't you know lo_and_behold it started to rain 
the rain turned into a torrent 
and I was actually getting very soak  soaked  from head to toe 
my backpack was wet 
my shoes were even wet 
I got back to my  to the house 
and my mom looked at me and didn't say a word 
but she knew 
after changing my clothes and putting back on my backpack I headed out again on my way to school 
this time with the umbrella to protect me from the rain 
the story of Cinderella 
once upon a time in a land far far away 
there was a young girl whose parents had died 
she had an aunt but her aunt was a very bitter person 
so  she and the children  her children  her daughters were living in the house 
but Cinderella was basically treated as the housemaid 
she hadta keep the house cleaned up no matter what 
as she grew older she grew more and more beautiful 
but even as beautiful as she was she was still just the housemaid 
the other girls grew up 
they weren't near as beautiful as she was 
in the meantime the king in the land had decided that it was time for his son to get married 
and to do that he wanted ta 
he sent out invitations to all the  w the influential people within the land that they would  could attend the ball 
Cinderella's mother 
and had decided to send her two daughters 
Cinderella said 
 well  can I also go 
and they  and her mother said 
 no you can't 
 you're to stay here and keep this place clean 
so  while she was doing that she was  became a little bit disconcerted 
and her  a all at once she started to wonder what it would be like to go to the ball 
because she had worked so hard and had prayed so hard all at once her fairy godmother came to see her 
and she asked what she really wanted 
and she told her that she wanted to be able to go to the ball 
so  her fairy godmother waved her wand 
a and gave her s a the most beautiful dress and a tiara and glass slippers to wear 
to take her off to the ball she hadta have a coach 
so  she went into the garden and there was a pumpkin 
she turned the pumpkin into the coach 
and the mice who were friends of and playmates of Cinderella were there to draw the coach 
and the cat was there to  to guide the coach 
they get to the ball 
and Cinderella meets the prince 
she has a dance with the prince 
and the prince doesn't wanna see anyone else 
he is enjoying himself so much 
but remembering that the fairy godmother had told her that by the strike of midnight you will become the same Cinderella that you were before 
no matter where you are you needta be  you needta come home 
so  as this clock was striking mid the midnight she ran from the ball and ran from the prince 
on her way out she lost her slipper  one of her glass slippers 
she got to her coach 
and it immediately turned back into a pumpkin 
and turned  and the animals turned back into the mice and the cat 
she made her way home wondering if she would ever see the prince again 
as it turned 
the prince was so excited about this pretty young women that he wanted to meet her 
he had kept the  the glass slipper 
and knew that he hadta see her again 
so  he sent out a decree to look for the young woman whose  who had the matching slipper or could fit her foot in that slipper 
that that would be the only way that he would know that it was her 
all of their  all of the women  the young women decided to go and try the slipper but none of them could make it fit 
including her sisters 
so  eventually she was able to go and see the prince 
and try on the slipper 
and the prince announced that he  this was the woman that he would marry 
and they all lived happily ever after 
well  at the very beginning there was uh a bird that was hopping around in the yard 
and  little girl's cat started chasing after the bird 
well  somewhere along the line a little  the commotion was recognized by the neighbor's dog 
and the neighbor's dog chased the cat up the tree 
the bird was in the tree 
the cat was in the tree 
the little girl called for her father 
and he came over with a ladder 
and got up in the tree to try and get the cat down 
well  the ladder fell so now he was trapped in the tree 
and the little girl was hoping the cat would come down 
the neighbor seeing all this had called the fire department and  who showed up with another ladder to try and help the man and the cat down off the tree 
and they all lived happily ever after
