I was hospitalized when I was thirty years old uh for a heart issue 
I had open heart surgery 
um I remember uh waking up with a breathing tube down my throat 
and I wasn't able to see because I wear contacts 
and I didn't have my contacts in and everything was very blurry 
and people were moving around a_lot 
and I remember being thirsty but nobody would give me anything to drink 
um I was in the i_c_u for several hours waiting for them to take the breathing tube out_of my throat 
once they did I was moved to regular room 
and I was in pain for a very long time 
yes  I have 
say that again 
I'm sorry 
um my grandfather had a stroke and um now he can't talk 
I don't live here in town so I don't see him very often 
um when I come to visit it's very hard for me to communicate with him because I can't understand what he's saying 
he really tries hard to make sounds and point to things and make hand motions but it's  uh it's difficult to understand 
so  I watch him very closely and I try to hand motion back uh trying to match what he's doing to maybe think about what he may be trying to say 
I watch his lip movements but um sometimes that's not so successful 
oh 
um the last time I was really scared uh it was the middle of the night 
and uh I listened to the baby on the uh monitor 
and all_of_a_sudden I heard that she was having trouble breathing 
so  I jumped up out_of bed and ran in there and picked her up 
and she was crying 
and I held her for a few minutes and tried to get her calmed down 
and then I gave her a bottle 
and uh we called the doctor immediately
