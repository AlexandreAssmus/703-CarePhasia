first I get the bread out_of the refrigerator 
then I get the peanut butter out_of the cupboard 
then I get the jelly out_of the refrigerator 
and then I put the bread on a plate 
and I spread the bread with peanut butter after getting out a knife 
and then I use the knife to spread jelly over the peanut butter 
and then I put the other piece of bread on top of the peanut butter and jelly spread over the bread laughs 
um  well  Joshua the cat  was stuck in a tree 
and Mary w was panicking laughs 
Mary  this is Mary's cat 
oh  so  Mary's dad climbed up a  got a ladder climbed up the tree to get the cat uh er for Mary 
and in the meantime the ladder fell 
and the dad was stuck in the tree with the cat 
but they weren't close enough to  laughs to rescue each_other 
in the meantime the firemen were coming to rescue both of them 
and  v Mary was ready to catch the cat 
and so there was a happy ending to this because the firemen were going to take care of the whole thing and rescue everybody 
and life would be back to normal 
my sister had a stroke if you wouldn't mind 
I sprained my back which took um a couple of years to heal 
and all I did was uh bend over to get something out_of a drawer 
and I felt like the left side of my body just rip 
and um I went to the doctor who told me it would only take a couple weeks to ha heal 
this is sports medicine doctor 
and uh s immediately stretched  started stretching my legs which was ɪnskɹuʃieθɪŋu 
um  but in actuality  so I went back to work actually after about four or five days thinking 
and I had a pretty physical job doing visual merchandising at the time display for stores 
thinking that I would be fine 
and um i i the experience pulled me  after like about four hours of standing pulled me down to the ground 
I couldn't  I couldn't  I would pass out if I n continued to stand 
so  um I hadta like lie flat on my back until I could get up and leave 
laughs and then go home and like lie flat on my back for  um you_know until I could get up 
so  it was  it was a  a really i incredible experience 
i it  it  w it had me  it s xxx 
so  there  the doctor really didn't do much 
I ended up going to physical therapy uh which made it worse before it got better 
and  um but that was just because they hadta massage the muscles 
they say that sometimes a sprain is worse than uh a break 
so  that whole f experience took about a year and a half 
and  um  and then my back finally healed 
I  an an i and the depression that set in 
not knowing quite what to do about it 
I went to different people 
m different doctors and didn't know  didn't  n didn't see any way out_of i the pain 
so  um it finally ended and 
 laughs I'm all better 
 laughs 
 in speech or in actuality 
 well  yes  I have a hearing loss 
 well I still have a  hear yeah  I did not know I had hearing loss 
laughs I thought I  I'm a swimmer 
so  I thought my ears were just temporarily plugged from water 
this wen went on for years 
s h called denial laughs 
and finally  ya people started to tell me that the doorbell was ringing and I couldn't  at work an because I er 
and i um I worked in a  a photographer's studio at that point in time 
and people useta ring the doorbell when they come in 
and then I couldn't hear the doorbell 
and e people started pointing out that I was not hearing things 
so  um  then  then I thought um that if  it was everybody else's problem because laughs their uh speech was not distinct 
you_know  when they were talking to me I  I couldn't  I could hear uh like tone and volume but I could not hear the distinction 
so  I  you_know  I kept thinking 
 well  why don't these people talk a little bit clearer 
what's r laughs 
so  um that was the beginning of you_know finding out that I had a hearing loss 
and uh now I have hearing aids 
and it's still a little difficult to a actually get alo the distinction sometime 
you_know 
laughs yes 
alright 
laughs I'll tell you the  my  s my prison story 
I'm terrified laughs 
um I found a little  e I went out on my patio one day and found a little like cone shape uh structure attached to my wɑŋu 
and um so I was talking to my boyfriend about it 
I said you_know 
 what is that 
he said 
 oh  that's just like a little wasp's nest 
and laughs he happens to be a Native American um person that is like not into killing anything 
like um into Native American culture  I should say 
so  um so  he said 
 they  they won't hurtcha 
 those are just  that's just a little wasp's nest 
 swa they don't have stingers 
so  then one morning I started watching th this wasp 
and it kept uh coming every morning like for three days in a row 
like to a s particular point on my doorway 
so  I finally checked out my doorway 
and I realize that there was another wasp's nest 
but this one was a lil 
laughs so  then I noticed that I had like two more wasps' nests in my patio all in the same area around my doors 
so  so  fear took over 
and I  I went  I  ta I called an exterminator 
I said you_know 
 can I do this 
 or do I need you 
and he said 
 you can do this 
 just go buy some wasp and hornet spray and break up the nests 
well  I've  s I've been spraying the nests for like f four days now 
but I'm terrified of breaking up the nest 
because I'm  af I'm afraid that I'll get stung 
that they'll be  you_know all these little bees will come out and attack me 
so  um  I'm still at that point uh 
me I wake up in the middle of the night thinking about breaking up these wasps' nests 
laughs in total terror laughs 
laughs that's it 
here I don't quite get it 
it  it looks like um there are two people that were  uh rafting and fell out_of the boat 
 and  c e caught up in a whirlpool 
one of  one of the  r the girl th caught up in a whirlpool 
and the guy was hanging onto  a branch 
 and lips
he  he looks uh more fearful than she does 
she looks like she's more concerned than  he is 
 so the story is that  one of them is trying to rescue the other one laughs 
 I'm just not sure who's trying to rescue who here 
lips
she looks more concerned about him 
and he looks a little bit petrified 
but he's got the lifejacket on so he's probably the one that can't swim 
laughs 
mhm  Joey was out playing ball  in his front yard 
and he kicked the ball so hard that it went through the window smashed the window and landed in his dad's  den where Dad was watching tv
