 um we'll see if grumbles the kitty is going to be saved 
and thank the fire department for what they have done 
it happened ov there  l las
I was sitting in the house 
the exact same things happened both times 
I was taking a nap 
and I got up about  near five o'clock 
and all_of_a_sudden I went to the bathroom to urinate 
and I was urinating blood 
and it was the scariest moment in my life 
and I  just got over there 
an
 please come over 
I didn't tell him what what was 
and he  he lives about a block away 
and he came over 
and he saw me bleeding 
and I thought he was gonna drop dead 
I wrapped myself in a towel 
and I said 
 drive me to the hospital 
and I went the
and I went to the emergency room 
and it stopped bleeding 
it was   I strained m uh uh my bladder or something 
and  I had internal bleedings 
and I was so happy that all it was was an internal bleeding 
they just gave me some antibiotics 
and they kept me in the hospital  overnight 
and all the tests were negative 
and it just was internal bleeding 
and they say I strained myself moving my bowels 
and I was happy at the result ges
but I wasn't happy when I saw the blood coming out 
it happened in two ol eight and exactly one year later 
the exact head
and I just said 
 oh 
I just ges was cursing myself 
 what is happening over there 
and I was talking to the doctors 
and I was explaining 
and I say 
 why  i this is going to happen to me for the rest of my life 
and I was real  mad 
but they s couldn't do  i they said 
I hadta take more roughage 
that I  sc I
uh they eh eh roughage 
I was just over there stretching over there  and forcing myself over there 
so  since that day on  I've been taking a_lot_of roughage and Metamucil 
but those  that was the scariest two days of my life 
bye 
this was the scariest I ever was on over there head
 because the only time I was in the hospital was like ten fifteen years before that 
I had a gall bladder taken out 
uh that was the only two times I was scared  I  i in my life 
I was scared uh uh  during the time I was in the service in xxx uh and guess it was over there in  uh the lady inva invasion over there when the planes were shooting at our ship 
and I was outside running to my battle station 
uh uh uh my good friend was shot right in front of me 
and when I saw him it was the sc first scariest day of my life 
but I never would tell anybody over there 
but that's what happened at that time 
I was scared 
 I uh don't know 
communicating 
head
I've know over there of  uh who has a stroke I  I 
eh different language 
I'm  never too familiar with them over there 
but the only person I ever met that had a stroke was I met here in Arizona was uh uh Mitch and Debbie's  Debbie's father 
he had a stroke 
and when I saw him  I sawr 
we went out 
we were together at certain times 
and the time I sawr 
and he couldn't communicate 
and he had to write everything down 
I felt head
that was the only person I ever met that had a stroke 
I  I don't know if  uh I haven't seen anybody else that had a stroke in my life 
I met your  grandfather 
and they said he had a stroke 
I hadn't seen him after 
I sawr 
so  I don't know what happened to him after 
those are the only two people that  shrugs at eighty five years that I know that had a stroke 
I don't know hum if I'm ges happy or not shrugs 
but that's the only two I ever met 
 uh  uh  I don't know 
xxx you got the camera 
 if this is a tragedy or not 
I see  two people in the rapids in the water uh trying to save their lives or so 
uh th m  the boy over there and  the man over there  he has the  a limb over there of a tree 
but the girl I don't know if he's gonna save her or not 
she's looking surprised because if it was me I would be holding with one hand and the other hand trying to save the girl 
I really don't know 
I'm looking at their faces to see 
she's in pain 
and he's just looking 
I would just tell him to take one hand down and rescue the girl 
I don't know 
that's all I could see 
 sighs  the troubles of youth 
my  xxx my son is out there playing wid 
he kicks the ball into the neighbor's window 
oh
and all_of_a_sudden the ball lands in his lap 
and he's cursing and cursing at the kid 
 I tell him a million times not to play ball in  near my yard 
 to play in the lot and  or play in the playground 
and he picks up the ball 
and he's looking at the kid 
 now what do I do 
 do I send the ball back in a package go to his parents and complain and ask for the money for the window 
 or forgive the kid for doing what he did 
 uh I'll leave it up to you to make his mind 
but it must be  he's wearing the vest so he must be uptight 
 groans I could see m eh m m my son over there  out there going to school 
mother is saying goodbye to him and saying 
 it'll  I think it's going to rain 
that's what the weather man said on the channel the night before 
 take an umbrella 
but no five year olds kid is going to take an umbrella 
they say 
 nah nah nah  Mom 
 I don't need the umbrella 
 I'd be an idiot to walk to school with an umbrella 
and he says 
 goodbye  Mom 
 I'm going out 
he walks twenty steps 
and all_of_a_sudden it starts to rain 
 oh  look at this 
 I'm getting soaking wet 
 why don't I listen to my mother 
 mothers are always right 
and then he walks back over there to the house 
and Momma gives him a good lecture 
and she says 
 now will you take the umbrella 
and I took the umbreller 
and I am smiling going to school 
at_least I can get to get to school dry 
 well  the motto is always listen your parents  even_though they give us bad advice

and the mother ih ih was very wicked and t t very mean to her 
and she was like that until  for ten years until she grew up 
and she  they were still mean to her and  doing everything bad to her
