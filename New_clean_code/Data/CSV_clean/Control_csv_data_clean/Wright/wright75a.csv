the cat's stuck in the tree 
the dad tried to get the cat out_of the tree 
but he  h doesn't look like he was successful 
and his ladder fell down 
and the little girl's standing under the cat crying 
and the dog's barking at the man up the tree 
and the firemen are coming carrying a longer ladder 
um and there's also a bird in the tree 
well  you take two slices of bread 
and you put peanut butter on one slice and jelly on the other one 
and you put them together 
and that makes a peanut butter and jelly sandwich 
well  not on camera but I've already told you that five years ago I had cancer 
I had surgery 
I had radiation 
I had chemotherapy which lasted well into three months 
uh all my hair fell out 
it grew back in 
my eyelashes didn't 
but head
uh w actually my eyelashes came back 
shows
uh  I lost thirty pounds 
and that was not from being sick 
uh because I was head
I never had one day where I was sick during my chemo 
I  I lost it because something in the chemotherapy  gave ges me a very bad taste in my mouth 
it tasted like I was chewing on pennies 
you ges ever p when you were a kid put a penny in your mouth and felt that ges taste 
that's what everything tasted like to me no matter what it was 
and so food just didn't really have much of an appeal 
but I'm diabetic so I hadta eat 
but I ate just enough to keep the diabetes in check 
so  I lost thirty pounds which was not b a bad thing 
I wish I coulda kept it off 
unfortunately as I  once we got the  the radiation and the chemotherapy done and the results of the radiation 
uh it took about two and a half years 
but I gained all the weight back 
and uh I go in  two weeks back to my oncologist for my five year checkup 
and at that time if all sims 
so  that's  that's head
uh yes head
um well  let's see 
um when it came to  m to me probably the most frightening thing I ever had was when somebody w uh somebody p a Peeping_Tom was standing at my window 
and I just happened to look up and stared him right in the eye 
scared me to death 
but on a even deeper level the thing that scared me the most I think 
I lived in Japan 
and my daughters were one and two 
and I had them  my husband was in the field and I had them both in high chairs 
and I was making hot chocolate for them 
and it was the kind where you put ges
and then you pour the hot water 
 y and my oldest girl was not in a high chair 
she was at the table 
and uh I had the powder in both k in the cups 
and I went ges
and as I did she was so anxious she decided to get up at the table as ges
and her fingers hit the  cu ges
and flipped the cup ges
and scared me to death 
what scared me was she didn't cry 
uh she  fortun it was winter and she had ges
and uh I hurried up and got that off of her 
and  got in my car 
and you couldn't call nineoneone then 
it's  this is fifty years ago 
uh so  I got in my car to take her to the dispensary which was a good ways away 
and uh I had my neighbor  I gave the baby hands
and ges
and started points to the  dis the dispensary 
and uh as I went through the hand
and honked the horn like crazy 
and he came over 
and I told him what had happened 
and he said 
 move over 
and he got hand
and the guy points in the jeep  in the MP jeep led the way points with his siren on 
the other MP drove my car 
and we went over to the base  to the  the  to the dispensary 
and they took her ges right in 
and while I was sitting there she shrugs passed out I thought 
and the doctor said to me 
 talk to her 
 keep talking to her 
and so I kept talking 
 Marianne  it's Mommy 
 Marianne  talk to me  Marianne 
and I'd watch eyelashes
head
the next day he told me that her heart has had ges stopped 
that she had gone into shock 
and that it was only ges
but it scared me 
s I_mean I wasn't even aware of how bad it was 
he didn't wanna tell me 
I said to him the next day when I took her back to him 
I said 
 why didn't you tell me what was happening 
he said 
 because I didn't need two patients 
 I only needed one 
 uh and you were the only one 
 it was  ye your points voice was the only thing that was gonna bring her back 
so  that's probably head
 yes 
I worked as a speech therapist I told you this uh in  El Paso Texas at the  cerebral palsy clinic there 
uh and a_lot of the people that I worked with had 
they were children for the most part 
uh and I loved working with kids 
so  that was  it was fun for me 
but they had ges all different kinds of problems 
 uh  some of them were ah 
we didn't know at the time 
the diagnosis wasn't thrown around like it is now because this was fifty years ago 
and uh uh d uh some of them were autistic 
the one little girl had had spinal meningitis 
and had  was now blind 
and had a hard time hearing 
and couldn't  head
she was nine 
but  she  they ges hadta start all over with her like she was a baby  to teach her hand
and they said eventually she was gonna be okay 
and I only worked with her for a year or so 
I don't know but I did speech therapy with her 
uh th the one patient that they sent me to see uh 
I_mean I had no business doing any of this 
I had no background 
uh but they head
and uh the one patient was a woman who had had a stroke 
and had aphasia 
and ges
and she was talking about her cake 
but ges
and uh I don't think I accomplished a thing with her 
I  I really don't 
um but that was before they placed so much value on early work with stroke people 
and I head
um  other_than that uh I had  uh a daughter 
I have a daughter who is  has a genetic  she's missing part of a chromosome 
and didn't talk at all til she was about two and a half 
never head
and then started off very slowly 
and now n I can't shut her up 
uh she's fifty  five 
and has the mental 
well  it's uh 
she would test probably at about ten years old 
she reads 
uh she's a sports fanatic 
but it  it was a long time coming and working with her trying ges
uh  to express herself in any way really  was difficult 
uh other_than that  I don't think so 
it's a picture of two people stuck in a flood 
 and he's hanging on for dear life to a 
 a tree limb 
but he also seems to be wearing a lifevest 
so  maybe he  is a paramedic or fireman or something 
I see nothing like that on her 
so  I guess he's in there to rescue her 
uh  yeah  I think that's about all I can tell you 
I wouldn't wanna be either one of them thank_you 
 hm 
okay 
the little boy is kicking a soccer ball around 
and it goes through somebody's window 
into a room where it knocks a lamp down 
and there's a man sitting 
and he gets up and looks out  takes the ball and looks out the window 
I don't really see there's an end to that story 
he winds up with the ball 
but I'm sure it didn't end there 
 that's about the best I can tell you on that one 
mkay 
 okay 
little boy's going out the door with his backpack 
apparently he's going to school or something 
and mother wants him to take an umbrella 
and he tells her 
 uh hand
 it's not gonna rain 
he doesn't want an umbrella 
and he goes out 
and pretty soon it's raining 
and he goes running home through the puddles with his hands trying to keep the water off his head 
and she's standing there waiting for him because she knew he'd be back  or drown one or the other 
and he goes off again with an umbrella 
a man has a daughter 
and apparently is a widower 
and marries a woman who has two daughters 
and  but he must travel ges a_lot because he's never around in the rest of the story 
um n n the stepmother doesn't like the  the stepdaughter 
and turns her into a maid for her two daughters and for herself 
and she's the one that hasta clean and wait on them 
and  and uh  she's uh very good with the anima
and  and they're her friends because she really has no other friends 
and the  meanwhile at the castle the king decides he's going to throw a ball for the prince because the prince should get married 
and he's not showing any signs of being interested in anybody 
so  they put out the word that there's gonna be a ball 
and they send out invitations 
and the stepmother gets the invitation and sets to making ready her two daughters 
and Cinderella uh who uh they don't even consider as part of the family wh goes into the trunks of things that pro probably shrugs were her mother's 
and makes herself a dress 
which they totally destroy and tell her she's going nowhere 
and  and she cries 
and she's all upset 
and her fairy godmother comes 
and dresses her in this beautiful ges dress 
and turns her mice into footmen 
and her horses into the ges horses for this beautiful carriage 
and sends her off to the ball 
but tells her that she hasta be home before midnight 
so  she goes to the ball 
and of_course the prince falls in love at first sight 
and she's all he's interested in 
while stepmama and stepdaughters are  just don't know what to do with themselves 
and at five to twelve all_of_a_sudden Cinderella realizes she better get home 
so  she goes tearing out 
and as she runs away loses one of her sl glass slippers 
and goes home and everything ges
the coach the everything the beautiful dress 
and all she has left is the other glass slipper 
so  the prince is beside himself 
he decides he hasta find her 
so  he sends this  w one of his people out to find her with the slipper 
and they  everybody in the ges realm hasta try this slipper on 
and of_course it doesn't fit anybody because obvious  she  sh she had very tiny feet 
and finally they find her 
she tries the slipper on 
and the prince  marries her 
and they live happily ever after
