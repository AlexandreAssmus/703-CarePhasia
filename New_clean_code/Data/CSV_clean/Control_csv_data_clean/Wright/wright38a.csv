then I pick one  u one slice up 
turn it over on top of the first one 
head
pretty much 
today was little Johnny's birthday 
he's four years old 
now what's gonna happen for him today 
well  he's got friends co are coming over to the birthday party 
mom made him a nice cake and she frosted it and put four candles on top of it 
but when she went back into the kitchen to make sure everything was cleaned up for the party their dog jumped up got on top of the table and started eating the birthday cake 
when mom heard the commotion in the living room she grabbed a broom and chased the dog under the couch 
just then the doorbell rang 
the guests were arriving 
and the cake was destroyed 
mom was more worried about the cake than the little kids were though 
they enjoyed the rest of the cake just fine and had a great time 
uh when I was seven years old uh I went swimming at the Northern_Michigan university pool with a good friend of mine 
uh I started feeling chills while I was swimming but I thought it was just because the water was cold 
I went out and uh showered off afterwards 
and the hot water felt really good 
but I was getting stiffer and stiffer 
when we left the sun was shining and it was about eighty degrees 
and just standing still in the sun felt really good but moving was getting incredibly hard 
since my friend only lived a couple of blocks away I sat down and said 
 I'm just gonna sit here 
 can you go home and have your mom call my mom and have her come and pick me up 
well  my mom came to pick me up 
sh she felt that I had a fever took me to the hospital and they found out that I had meningitis 
and I was in the hospital for four days 
oh  it might have been five I can't remember 
it it  I was seven okay laughs 
and they gave me a spinal tap 
and that's terrifying because they have you laying on your side 
and here I was seven 
 saying 
 now don't move 
 this'll hurt but don't move you might end up paralyzed 
well  that certainly calmed me right down 
but with the exception that they bring in uh uh the uh flavored uh uh pops whenever I wanted from the nursing station 
the refrigerated uh like fruit drink things that are frozen 
that was okay 
but they didn't turn the tv on t for my room until the day I left 
so  I was in the hospital for four days with no tv 
but I'm 
okay 
um my mom uh when I was twenty one had a brain tumor 
and she went in for surgery 
and when she came back out 
uh this is in the late seventies 
they did the surgery 
they got the tumor out 
but at the same time it caused some damage to her ability to speak well and to uh understand well 
um it  it was difficult uh trying to develop uh lists of things that she wanted done around the house 
um but we managed to work out a pretty good system of uh you_know 
she'd write down things as they occurred to her immediately on a pad of paper which she always kept with her 
and that seemed to help a_lot because you_know she could remember something short term but an hour from now forget it 
but just by carrying that pad around with her all the time she was able to make lists of things so when I came home I knew what she wanted done 
and we were able to you_know bridge the gaps for awhile until her condition ended up getting worse and she ended up going to a nursing home 
I've had a stress free life laughs 
okay 
when I was in high school I was out with some friends at Presque_Isle 
there's no death in this story 
um and uh we were walking along 
and it's all rocks along the edge of Lake_Superior 
it's not a beach at that particular spot 
and it was a big rock cliff on one side ges
and I looked over at it 
and I thought I could climb it 
and one of my friends said 
 I don't know head
 looks
 oh  no  head
well  I managed to climb head
it was probably a sixty or seventy foot cliff 
and I got up within about five ten feet to the top and then ran out of hand holds 
and I was looking down looks
I didn't wanna look down anymore 
it was way far down 
but I was able to move off to one side 
and there was a tree that was actually raises
and I was able to reach up with one hand raises
but at that point I was pretty darn scared because I didn't know how secure that tree was 
but there was only one way to find out 
and it was strong enough since I'm here laughs 
uh this woman was walking 
and all_of_a_sudden a flash flood came up and swept her down stream 
fortunately she was lucky enough to grab on to a tree branch and hold on 
and a rescue  worker came along looking to see if there are any victims in the flood saw her out there begging for help 
and he climbs out on a long branch to rescue her 
and brings a belt so_that they'll be able to  with a rope attached to it that so_that they'll be able to pull her back to shore safely 
and boy she looks cold 
little boy is getting ready to go to school and his mom offers an umbrella 
he says 
 no  Mom 
 I don't need an umbrella 
 it's not raining 
once again she asks him 
 you really oughta take your umbrella with you today 
 no no no  Mom  I'm just fine 
he walks out the door and starts walking to school when all of a sudden it starts to rain 
it starts raining harder and harder 
he turns around runs back and runs into the house 
he's soaking wet 
his hair's plastered down 
his shirt is soaked 
his mom looks at him and says 
 now didn't I ask you if you needed that umbrella 
so  he quickly changed his clothes and then took the umbrella with him on his way back to school again 
there's a boy outside playing with a soccer ball when all of a sudden he decides to try to kick it as hard as he can 
the ball sails quite a ways 
in_fact  it sails s so far it sails right through the neighbor's plate glass window in his living room 
when it comes through the glass after breaking a window it even knocks over a lamp in the living room 
the man who's sitting in his living room minding his own business before the ball comes flying through jumps up grabs the ball and looks out the window 
but the boy's run away 
there once was a young girl called Cinderella 
she had three ugly stepsisters 
and her family  didn't like her very much and made her do all
she hadta scru
and she hadta cle
and she hadta cook and sew and everything all by herself while her stepsisters just got to lay around trying on pretty clothes and going out and having fun 
um one day the prince was gonna have a big ball 
and all three of the sisters were figuring out what to wear 
looking around buying dre new dresses checking out how they looked 
but Cinderella couldn't go 
when all_of_a_sudden her fairy godmother appears and says 
 what's wrong Cinderella 
 why are you so depressed 
Cinderella says 
 I can't go to the ball that the prince is having but my stepsisters get to go instead 
and the fairy godmother says 
 well  nonsense 
and she waves her magic wand and a beautiful gown appears 
and she says 
 well  you're gonna need a horse or  horses and a coach to ride 
so  she snatches up some mice that were playing in the kitchen and turns them into horses and turns a pumpkin into a huge carriage 
and she gives her  gives her a pair of fancy glass slippers to wear to the ball 
but the stepmother said or  uh the fairy godmother says 
 be sure you're home by midnight 
 the magic's only good for one day 
 at the stroke of midnight all of this will disappear 
so  Cinderella goes to the ball 
and she has a wonderful time 
she's dancing and makes a heck of an impression on the prince 
he just wants to dance with her all night 
when she all_of_a_sudden looks up at the clock and realizes it's five minutes to midnight 
oh_goodness 
so  she turns and races out_of the ball 
and in a hurry to get away she drops one of her glass slippers 
falls off of her foot 
hops into her carriage 
and as they race away but right at the stroke of midnight the horses change back into mice 
the carriage changes back into a pumpkin 
and her fancy dress gown turns back into the rags that she wore in the kitchen 
she sneaks into the house 
and all her stepsisters wha were talking about the next day was how the prince fell in love with this beautiful lady 
he tries to find her 
and all he hasta go by is the one glass slipper that she f lost behind her 
he goes around 
he tries every girl is town to see whose foot the slipper will fit on 
the three step  stepsisters all try to squeeze their feet into that glass slipper as hard as they can 
but they can't make them fit 
when the prince looks over at the  s f what he thinks is just the maid and says 
 why don't you try it on 
 oh  she's just the maid 
 it couldn't possibly be her 
well  wouldn't you know he tries it on her and it fits perfectly 
and they lived happily ever after 
there was a cat that was walking outside when all_of_a_sudden a dog came along and chased the cat right up a tree 
a little girl on her tricycle saw that her cat was up the tree 
and started crying  that her cat wouldn't come back down 
dad deci came out to see what all the commotion was about 
and saw that he could get the cat back down by grabbing a ladder from his garage and climbing up the tree to get the cat 
unfortunately once he got up the tree the ladder fell down 
and now dad was trapped up the tree with the cat while the dog was still barking 
somebody called the fire department 
they came over  to rescue the cat  and dad from the tree
