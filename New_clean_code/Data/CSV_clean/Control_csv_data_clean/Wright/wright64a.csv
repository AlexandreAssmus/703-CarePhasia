and I laughs would bring my tea with me

and I was project manager on a couple substantial projects 
and one of the  assistant project managers for the general contractor had a bad lisp 
and he was very hard to understand 
and if he got excited he would even have a harder time 
so  it was very difficult 
but uh if you were very nice and talked calmly he would calm down 
and you could  you were able ta 
but you hadta be very patient and very caring with him to do that 
an it was hard 
it was a cold

and it was raining 
and I was walking home from a friend's house 
and the rain was really coming down 
and all of sudden the lightning started crashing nearby 
and I couldn't move fast enough because of that lightning striking so close by 
it was very scary

as I can remember 
once upon a time  back in the g good old days Cinderella lived with her father 
and cinder Cinderella's father met this lady that had two s daughters 
and they moved in with Cinderella and her dad 
and they weren't nice 
they didn't like Cinderella at all 
and they kind_of made her into a  a  m a maid sorta 
to take care of the dogs and the horses and the cats and  everything 
and to be kind_of a maid for the s ugly two mean ladies  mean daughters 
and b Cinderella would look at the castle 
and dream and think of her Prince_Charming 
and in that castle um they decided to have a ball to see if they could find a  girlfriend for the  for Prince_Charming 
so  they sent out invitations 
and they  uh Cinderella got one 
but their  her stepsisters wouldn't let her go 
they were gonna go instead 
but Cinderella called on a fairy godmother 
and she dressed Cinderella just so beautiful 
and a the mice and the birds all helped 
and Cinderella looked beautiful in her glass slippers 
and  but the fairy godmother says 
 points you better be careful because at midnight all this goes away 
 you  you go back to being Cinderella 
 so  you hafta get everything done by midnight 
so  sure enough she met Prince_Charming 
and Prince_Charming just went head over heels over this lovely Cinderella with 
and they danced 
and they danced 
and they danced 
and bango twelve o'clock came 
and Cinderella hadta run and leave because she'd turn back to whatever she was before 
and she was afraid Prince_Charming would not like that 
so  she ran away 
and as she was running away she drops one of her glass slippers 
and leaves it laying there 
but she goes back 
and suddenly she becomes Cinderella again 
and the Prince_Charming is so sad that his lovely Cinderella was gone and he couldn't find her 
so  he assigns a bunch of people with hands
and try on this glass slipper  to find the girl that it fit 
and so first he went and went 
and they searched and searched and couldn't go 
and they went to Cinderella's house 
and they tried the glass slipper on both of his  s
and they tried hands
hands
and it didn't fit 
and they saw Cinderella over there in the corner 
and they said 
 come over ges
so  she goes over there 
and it fits 
and everything goes great 
Prince_Charming is happy 
Cinderella's happy 
and they live happily ever after
