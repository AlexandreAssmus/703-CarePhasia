inhales and wouldn't come down 
and  so the man climbed up the l  tree to help 
and I guess  so_that then the man couldn't come down 
so  somebody call the fire department 
na inhales fire department's gonna rescue everybody 
 okay  I guess the bv reason the man's up in the tree is because the ladder fell down 
f
take a slice of uh bread 
 sniffs an
and I put jelly on it 
 and enjoy all the grease and sugar you shouldn't have 
inhales I'd had atrial  fribulation 
inhales and t during those times inhales I got real dizzy and hadta get down ch w in a hurry so I wouldn't fall down 
inhales and  and a bright light appeared  under my eyes 
inhales and I couldn't detect any pulse 
so  I knew my heart had stopped 
inhales so  I performed a cardial 
or defribrulated 
inhales I learned how in Men's_Health_Magazine 
 and I saved my life several times  doing that 
 s  because this is a recurring problem with mayi me 
and uh the last time I had atrial fibrillation sniffs was uh  Sunday morning 
inhales and it was so bad I couldn't  head
so  I woke up my wife 
inhales she's a very sound sleeper 
I woke her up and told her 
and she come running around and pounced on it about a dozen times  inhales leal 
and I knew to inhales uh every time she come down I exhale 
inhales because it works better if my lungs are empty when she pumps my heart 
inhales and  that brought me around real quick 
 so  I don't think I'll ever shrugs let my wife travel without me from now on 
she's the only  she's the best defibrillator I've got 
 n
inhales the scariest thing I had  d ever had is when I   I couldn't get my heart restarted 
when I got arrhythmia you_know I can feel the  ges
and they inhales come more frequently than uh inhales say two beats a second or something like that 
inhales and  but when  when you have a atrial fibulation 
what's happened was that inhales your pump  doesn your heart doesn't pump blood 
it just flutters ges

 and uh a battery lasts about three or four days 
 oh inhales the rescuer inhales and a r  girl about to be rescued i inhales is trapped inhales i i in some brush in a swift  wa swift water  flood water points
inhales that's what you call a inhales swift w water rescue 
inhales the man  in the  f  flotation jacket is trying to rescue her 
inhales and it looks like they're both in trouble 
tangled up in the brush 
 uh uh trapped by the brush in a swift current 
 well  a man  a boy has kicked soccer ball through a window 
inhales the soccer ball nen 
knocks it off the table 
the man  is getting out_of his easy chair 
and holding the  soccer ball to see where it came from 
I guess looking out the broken window 
 oh  the boy wants to go out 
inhales and it's raining out 
so  the mother's giving the boy an umbrella 
inhales  s
he doesn't think it's raining hard enough 
inhales the then it starts raining harder 
inhales and he comes in 
inhales all soaking wet

inhales that lived  with her mother 
and her  single  sisters that were not so pretty 
the nicest way I could say it 
and uh  inhales  Cinderella wanted to go out dancing 
 but she didn't have a way to get there  I guess 
so  her fairy godmother inhales come to the rescue 
inhales and  presented her  with a  carriage pulled by white horses 
and to take her to the palace 
sniffs where the prince was having a party 
inhales uh  she was the belle of the ball
