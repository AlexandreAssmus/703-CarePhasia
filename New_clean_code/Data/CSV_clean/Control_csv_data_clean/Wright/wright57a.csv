sighs um most recently uh a guy I'm working with  uh with music 
he's  uh  he's on medication 
and he has uh anxiety problems 
so  I just tried to speak um softly and clearly 
be very detailed and distinct about what we needta accomplish together 
and how uh to go about doing it 
and just to make sure that he understands 
and  tongue
and if there's something that he doesn't understand then I repeat it and go over it carefully until he understands it 
uh just in general 
about what 
coughs  
anything where you were in fear of your life laughs 
um  well  um  I'm trying to think 
 yeah  one time when I was about I think  four or five 
it was raining 
and we were in the desert 
and there was a flash flood 
and I went out to go swimming in this  this creek of rushing water 
and I almost drowned 
and I was very scared 
and I grabbed onto plants and whatever I could on the side of the bank 
and held on 
and people stopped um on the road and were attempting to help me 
and finally my mother came out and pulled me out 
took me back home 
I was pretty scared 
um well  last year I was really sick with diabetes 
and I got diagnosed  um with type two diabetes 
and my blood sugar was like five hundred and ten 
and I was like losing my eyesight 
you_know  my eyes were real blurry 
and that's  you_know by the time I got to the doctor um he told me that I'd probably have some cognitive and memory problems 
because my blood sugar was so high for so many  y for so long 
you_know  at_least several months if not a couple of years 
and  so um  tongue
I kind_of forgot what the question was laughs 
okay  
 okay yeah I was pretty  I was really sick 
um I was  uh I hadta go buy glasses because I couldn't even see the t_v 
it was all blurry like five feet in front of me 
and so anyways I went and got on medication and changed my diet 
and things are much better now 
so  but I was really sick 
xxx um there's two people in the water 
and it  it coughs looks to me that  I guess  there's a man trying to save a little girl that's drownding 
and uh he has a belt  there's a belt 
and I think he's got a looped around a branch or something 
but I  he has a lifejacket on 
and he's trying to save a girl from drowning in a river 
yeah  that's about it 
coughs 
 okay  um it's a  a boy 
and he has a soccer ball 
and he kicks it 
and it goes through a window breaks the window knocks over a lamp 
uh there's a man sitting um tongue
and he gets really scared 
and picks up the ball and looks out the broken window 
okay  um there's a mother and a  a little boy 
and the little boy is getting ready to leave and go out 
and the mother insists that he takes an umbrella 
and uh he says 
 I don't need it 
 it's fine outside 
and sh they argue a little bit 
she gives in 
and he  so he leaves 
and he's walking down the road 
and he sees that it starts to rain 
so  and it starts raining really hard so he rushes back to the house 
co he's covering his head 
he's getting all wet 
and he goes back into the house 
and sees his mother 
and he's soaking wet 
and she looks at him as if ta 
 I told you so 
and so then he gets the umbrella and uses it 
and goes back out and uses the umbrella and starts walking down the road again 
okay  um  Cinderella's father married  a woman which was  became her stepmother 
and the stepmother had um two daughters 
and um so they all moved in together 
 and then the father died 
 and so Cinderella was l left in the care of the wicked stepmother 
and she was very mean to her 
and um made her work very hard and do all the chores 
and sighs they  the stepsisters were very mean also 
and I think called her names and made her do all their chores as_well 
and so she  she made friends with all the animals 
and  because she was lonely 
and   and then  um  and then an announcement came 
someone came to the door and announced that there was gonna be a ball 
and so they all got excited and wanted to go to the ball 
and since Cinderella was prettier than the other two uh stepsisters the mother  didn't want her to go 
because she wanted  one of her daughters to meet and possibly marry the prince 
so  she locked uh Cinderella in the tower 
uh and  they  went to the ball 
and  so
oh  oh_well  this was before the animals made Cinderella a dress 
and it was real pretty 
and that's what infuriated the stepmother 
and she tore up the dress 
and then locked her in the room 
and then Cinderella was crying 
and then she  then the fairy godmother came 
and uh let her out_of the room 
and uh with the magical wave of her wand made um her a beautiful gown and glass slippers 
and fixed her hair all up nice 
and turned a pumpkin into a coach 
turned mice into white horses 
and uh the dog into a coachman 
and  and so she was able to go to the ball 
and she met the prince danced with him 
and the um fairy godmother told her that she hadta leave by midnight or she  everything would return as it was 
and so  tongue
and the clock started to strike midnight 
and she said 
 I hafta go 
and he didn't want her to leave 
but she started to run away 
and she lost one of the glass slippers 
tongue_clicks and she ran and ran and got back in the coach 
and they started going down the road 
and then every ding when the clock struck twelve turned back to the way it was 
and she was very sad but she had a good time 
and she realized that she still had one of the glass slippers 
and so tongue_clicks she went home 
and then the next day 
and the prince really liked her so 
and he had this glass slipper so  um 
so  he sent out a decree to find this woman with the laughs glass slipper 
and so they searched all the houses knocked on the houses tried the slipper on everyone's foot 
and it wouldn't fit anybody 
and k he finally came to Cinderella's house 
and they tried  the um slippers on the stepsisters and  and it wouldn't fit 
and then cin they were gonna try it on Cinderella 
and the stepmother tripped the  the  uh the little guy with the slipper 
and  um and he tripped and fell and broke the slipper 
and so the stepmother was like 
 oh  well  the slipper's broken 
 and you can't try it on Cinderella 
and then Cinderella said 
 but I have the other slipper 
and so right then and there the prince knew that she was the one 
and they were happy and got married and lived happily ever after
