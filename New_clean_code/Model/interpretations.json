Interpretation: The average_tree_depth of 1.52 supports the aphasia pattern as it is lower than the average non-aphasic threshold of 2.86. The average_lexical_density of 1.27 supports the aphasia pattern as it is lower than the average non-aphasic threshold of 37.85. The word_stutter_count of 0.00 contradicts the aphasia pattern as it is lower than the average non-aphasic threshold of 10.27. The syllable_stutter_ratio of 0.18 contradicts the aphasia pattern as it is higher than the average non-aphasic threshold of 0.10."
